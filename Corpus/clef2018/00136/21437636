Autologous stem cell transplantation in a rare multicentric Castleman disease of the plasma cell variant. We present a case of a 52-year-old male who was evaluated due to anorexia, persistent diarrhea, weight loss, and liver enzyme elevations, with no hematologic laboratory abnormalities. Imaging modalities revealed several tissue lesions involving the pancreas, the right kidney, and an axillary lymph node. Diagnosis of Castleman disease was reached only due to the tissue obtained from the lymph node. Chemotherapy and immunosuppression led to a short remission. The patient underwent autologous stem cell transplantation, and has since been in remission. This case demonstrates the cryptogenic and chameleon-like nature of Castleman disease. Challenges in treating Castleman disease patients reflect current limitations and the need for a greater understanding of disease pathogenesis.
