Echo-endoscopy: new therapeutic frontiers. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been established as a valuable diagnostic modality as it offers high-resolution imaging and fine-needle biopsy, which is essential in detecting and staging malignancies. Since the introduction of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in 1992, numerous novel EUS-based interventions and techniques have emerged. Currently, established interventional EUS techniques include celiac plexus block and neurolysis, drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and pelvic fluid collections, and implantation of fiducial markers and radioactive seeds into the malignant tumors. Emerging EUS-guided experimental techniques include antitumor injection, ablation of tumors, and vascular access. Diagnostic and therapeutic access to the biliary tree and pancreatic duct is increasingly being used for failed ERCP procedures or inaccessible ducts. Interventional EUS is a very promising technique with many potential applications. The future holds promise for substantial progress in EUS-guided therapeutic interventions and their applications in clinical gastroenterology.
