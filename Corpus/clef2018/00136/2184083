Endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) can provide high resolution images of the pancreatic parenchyma. Complete visualization of the pancreas requires scanning from positions in the duodenum and stomach. Current clinical experience indicates that EUS is a useful adjunct to standard imaging in the evaluation of suspected pancreatic tumors. Improvements in technique and instruments are necessary to broaden the clinical application of EUS in pancreatic disease.
