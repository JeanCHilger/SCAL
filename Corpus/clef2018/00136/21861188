Hepatic and pancreatic involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: quantitative and qualitative evaluation with 64-section CT in asymptomatic adult patients. To analyse quantitatively and qualitatively asymptomatic hepatic and pancreatic involvement in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) using 64-section helical CT.The 64-section helical CT examinations of 19 patients with HHT (8 men, 11 women mean age, 58.6 years) were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed and compared to those of 19 control subjects who were matched for age and sex. Comparisons were made using univariate analysis.Dilated and tortuous intrahepatic arterial branches was the most discriminating independent variable (P < 0.0001) and had the highest specificity (100% 19/19Liver and pancreatic involvement in asymptomatic HHT patients is associated with myriad suggestive findings on 64-section helical CT. It can be anticipated that familiarity with these findings would result in more confident diagnosis of HHT.
