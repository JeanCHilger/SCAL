Pancreatic cancer: an endoscopic perspective. Pancreatic cancer continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The advent of endoscopic ultrasound-guided interventions have brought about a paradigm shift in the endoscopic approach to diagnosis, treatment and palliation of this common malignancy. The last decade has witnessed significant advances in techniques of endoscopic biliary drainage, endoluminal stenting, celiac plexus neurolysis and image-guided radiation therapy, which have transformed the scope of palliation in pancreatic cancer. Moreover, endoscopic ultrasound-aided intratumoral delivery of fiducials, radioisotopes and chemotherapeutic agents have shown promising results and warrant further investigation. This review summarizes the recent advances in endoscopic applications for the management of pancreatic neoplasms.
