Metachronous pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma: Role of imaging in a review of 17 cases with surgical correlation. To describe the imaging features of pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma.Retrospective study of 17 patients with isolated metachronous pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma with surgical and pathological correlation.The preoperative diagnosis was made on ultrasound in 13 cases. Contrast-enhanced CT showed intense tumor enhancement at the arterial phase, mostly homogeneous but sometimes heterogeneous. There were multiple lesions in six cases. Following complete surgical resection, survival was fairly good.Long-term follow-up with CT obtained in the arterial and portal venous phases is mandatory. The arterial phase acquisition is essential for the diagnosis of pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma.
