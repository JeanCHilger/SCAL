Very high CEA level in a large pancreatic cyst: is it a surgical indication by itself? Pancreatic mucinous cystic lesions might develop malignancy if untreated, or could harbor malignancy at the time of the diagnosis. Many reports stated that cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen is an accurate diagnostic marker of pancreatic mucinous cysts.A man with a incidental pancretic cystic lesion of 35 mm in diameter was admitted to our Department. CT and EUS did not reveal solid components, main duct was not dilated and cyst fluid CEA was very high (1445 ng/ml).The patient underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy and the surgical specimen showed a pseudocyst with columnar mucinous epithelium, consistent with low-grade PanIN.Is it possible that the mucinous epithelium of panIN was responsible for the unexpectedly high CEA value? Clinicians should be aware of the usefulness of the CEA level in cystic fluid but even a very high CEA value should not be considered by itself to be evidence of a mucinous lesion.
