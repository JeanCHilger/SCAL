Spontaneously complete regression of pseudolymphoma of the remnant pancreas after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pancreatic pseudolymphoma is extremely rare.We present multiple pseudolymphomas in the head and body of the pancreas. The hypoechoic lesions observed by endoscopic ultrasound were enhanced in late-phase angio-computed tomography and homogeneously hypointensive in T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed strong accumulation in the lesions. The lesions were suspected to be non-functioning islet cell carcinoma. The intraoperative pathological diagnosis for the specimen obtained by a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was non-neoplastic lymphoid cells. The remnant lesion in the pancreatic body was preserved.Macroscopically, the mass was well-circumscribed gray-white colored lesion. The pathological diagnosis was pancreatic pseudolymphoma. The lesion in the remnant pancreas spontaneously disappeared within one year after the operation.The differential diagnosis of pancreatic pseudolymphoma from malignant tumor is very difficult, however, the image findings demonstrated here may be informative. The spontaneous disappearance of pancreatic pseudolymphoma was firstly observed in the present case.
