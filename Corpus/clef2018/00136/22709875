Laparoscopic middle pancreatectomy under a pancreatic duct-navigation surgery. Recent developments of diagnostic modalities have increased detection of many benign and low malignant pancreatic lesions, and then various minimally invasive surgeries and/or pancreatic function preserving surgeries have been devised for such lesions. Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery has developed rapidly in recent years, and its minimal invasiveness is expected. This report describes a laparoscopic middle pancreatectomy under a pancreatic duct-navigation surgery for a localized main pancreatic duct stenosis, and this method is effective to benign and low malignant pancreatic lesions in the points of minimal invasiveness and function preservation.
