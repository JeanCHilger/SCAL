Advances in the diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms is challenging due to limitations of current diagnostic tests. There is considerable interest in developing an accurate and cost-effective diagnostic test (or panel of tests) to differentiate cyst types and to identify those which would benefit most from surgical resection.Current multidetector computed tomography scans may have improved accuracy to distinguish between mucinous and nonmucinous cysts. Attempts to generate quantitative criteria from cross-sectional imaging to differentiate cyst types have yielded mixed results. DNA mutations and microRNA show promise in the ability to distinguish between mucinous and nonmucinous cysts. Cyst fluid mucin glycoproteins and cytokines may identify those cysts with high malignant potential. Proteomic analysis may yield other biomarker candidates.Analysis of DNA mutations and proteins within pancreatic cyst fluid have identified potential biomarkers to aid with the management of patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms.
