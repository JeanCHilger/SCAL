Dual-source, dual-energy multidetector CT for the evaluation of pancreatic tumours. To investigate the potential diagnostic value of dual-energy CT (DECT) with virtual non-enhanced (VNE) and iodine-only images, and to determine the optimal mixed ratio of blended images for evaluation of pancreatic diseases.Multiphasic DECT was performed in 44 patients with focal pancreatic disease. DECT was used during the pancreatic and hepatic venous phases, and a peak kilovoltage of 120 kVp was used for both non-contrast phases. For qualitative analysis of the CT images, two radiologists assessed three image sets (VNE, iodine-only and blended images) in order to determine the acceptability of VNE in replacing true non-enhanced (TNE) images, the added value of iodine-only images and the preferred blending ratio. For quantitative analyses, the CT numbers and image noise of the pancreatic parenchyma, lesions, aorta and psoas muscle were measured. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the lesion was calculated on the pancreatic phase images. The effective radiation dose for DECT and TNE images was calculated. Statistical comparisons were made using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon test, the paired t-test and repeated measures of analysis of variation with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.The level of acceptance of the VNE images in replacing TNE images was 90.9%. Regarding the iodine-only images, 50% of the cases were found to have an added value. The linear-blended images with a weighting factor of 0.5 were preferred.DECT was able to provide high-quality VNE images that could replace TNE images and iodine-only images showing an added value. Blended images with a weighting factor of 0.5 were preferred by the reviewers.
