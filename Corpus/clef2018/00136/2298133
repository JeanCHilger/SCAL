Retractile mesenteritis. Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. An 18-year-old boy, who had severe abdominal pain for 18 months associated with marked weight loss, was found to have a stenosed ileal sling on double-contrast radiology of the small intestine. At operation a plate-like tumour was extending from the pancreas to the aortic bifurcation. Histological examination of removed tissue revealed retractile mesenteritis (mesenteric panniculitis liposclerotic mesenteritis). The symptoms regressed and the patient again gained weight under immunotherapy with 1 mg/kg of prednisone and 2 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide daily. Subsequently, under prednisone alone, there was a recurrence, which responded within five weeks to daily 60 mg prednisone and 125 mg cyclophosphamide. The patient remains symptom-free on 125 mg cyclophosphamide and 10 mg prednisone daily.
