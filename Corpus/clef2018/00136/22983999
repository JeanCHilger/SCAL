A challenging case of epigastric pain: diagnosis and mini-invasive treatment of a large gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. The authors present a case of a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm in a patient with a medical history of pancreatic surgery. The lesion was found and evaluated by ultrasound, CT-angiography and then treated with trans-catheter embolisation. This mini-invasive approach led to a complete resolution of the lesion.
