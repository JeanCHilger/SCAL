Management of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in an academic hospital (2005-2010): what follow-up for unoperated patients? Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are diagnosed frequently in asymptomatic patients. It is still not clear what follow-up is indicated for patients not undergoing surgical resection.Review of all reports of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) from June 2005 to June 2010, identifying all patients diagnosed with IPMN subsequent reconstruction of the initial therapeutic decision, indications for and adherence to scheduled follow-up, and IPMN evolution by morphology and by biology.Overall, 4943 MRCP reports were analyzed, identifying 234 patients with IPMN. Although 143 (61.1%) of these were comprised in Sendai criteria for resection, surgical resection was considered in only 42 (17.9%) patients. Of the remainder, 52 were not subjected to any control, 58 to a single short time check, 77 to MRCP-based regular annual follow-up, and 5 were treated for associated ductal adenocarcinoma. With a median follow-up of 39.5 months (range, 12-72), 37.6% of 125 patients in follow-up had a morphological evolution, but only 2.4% has developed a malignant IPMN. No deaths were recorded, directly related to IPMN, in all 187 conservatively managed patients.In the analyzed series, fewer patients than expected underwent surgical resection, and only 67.2% undergo regular follow-up, but no more than 2.4% developed malignancy.
