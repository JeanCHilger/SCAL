Endoscopic diagnosis and management of ampullary lesions. Most (>95%) ampullary lesions are adenomas or adenocarcinomas. Side viewing endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are complementary procedures that have an important role in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of ampullary lesions. Here the authors review their epidemiology and discuss the evidence for endoscopic modalities, with an emphasis on techniques for endoscopic resection. Although endoscopic papillectomy represents one of the highest-risk endoscopic interventions, it has largely replaced surgical modalities for the treatment of adenomatous lesions. Appropriate patient selection and use of preventive maneuvers will minimize the likelihood of persistent or recurrent lesions and postprocedure complications.
