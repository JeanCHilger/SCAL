Gastroduodenal artery false aneurysm. Among visceral arteries false aneurysms most commolny occur in hepatic arteries and their branches. In gastroduodenal artery, the disesase develops in less than 1.5%, although the risk of rupture reaches 70%. A male aged 53, diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis was referred to CT-angiography of aorta with suspicion of gastrodudodenal artery aneurysm. The exam was suggestive for an aneurysm placed near body of pancreas. Admitted a few days later to angiography, the patient was diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm of gastrodudodenal artery which was subsequently embolized. Although the aneurysm was not as clearly visible in angiography compared to CT, the supplying vessel was explicitly defined, allowing its selective embolizing with coils.
