Early pancreatic splenosis presented 2 years after splenectomy. Splenosis is defined as the autotransplantation of splenic tissue resulting from the spillage of cells from the pulp of damaged spleen after splenic injury or splenectomy. The splenic tissue implants are generally numerous, and the preferred location is the grater omentum. Pancreatic splenosis is a rare condition with only two previous cases reported in the English literature. We describe a case of pancreatic splenosis with unusual characteristics, in which a definitive diagnosis was obtained with the use of (99m)Technetium-sulfur-colloid scintigraphy avoiding invasive procedures or surgical removal.
