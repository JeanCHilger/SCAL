Free breathing three-dimensional gradient echo-sequence with radial data sampling (radial 3D-GRE) examination of the pancreas: Comparison with standard 3D-GRE volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE). To evaluate the diagnostic performance of free breathing three-dimensional gradient echo-sequence with radial data sampling (radial 3D-GRE) in MR imaging of the normal and diseased pancreas, using standard 3D-GRE for comparison in cooperative patients, and to perform a preliminary assessment in noncooperative patients.One hundred and eight consecutive patients underwent 1.5 Tesla MR imaging of the abdomen that included pre- and postcontrast free breathing radial 3D-GRE. The sequences were evaluated by two radiologists retrospectively, independently, and blindly. The results were compared using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Kappa statistics were used to measure the extent of agreement between the reviewers.The average scores indicated that the overall images quality of radial 3D-GRE was lower than 3D-GRE-VIBE in both pre- and postcontrast study (P = 0.0172 and 0.0001), however it achieved a rating that approximated good. In all patients, radial 3D-GRE had a mild extent of streak artifact, pulsation, susceptibility, and respiratory artifact. Radial 3D-GRE approximated good results for pancreatic edge sharpness and pancreatic ductal clarity, and did not differ significantly between cooperative and noncooperative patients. Respiratory artifact was worse in cooperative than in noncooperative patients (P = 0.02). Demonstration of pancreatic disease was slightly inferior with radial 3D-VIBE, but quality approximated good.Free breathing radial 3D-GRE may be applicable for pancreatic MR imaging in patients who are unable to suspend respiration.
