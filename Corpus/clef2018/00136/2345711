Pancreatic carcinoma presenting as primary lung cancer. Because pancreatic cancer often metastasizes to other sites, it may not be diagnosed until autopsy. Pulmonary metastases from the pancreas are not uncommon but unfortunately not often recognized. Dr Mishriki describes a patient with obstruction of the superior vena cava and metastatic pancreatic cancer that was misdiagnosed as primary lung cancer. Autopsy revealed the pancreas to be the primary tumor site.
