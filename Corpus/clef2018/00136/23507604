A case of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction with bulky no.7-metastatic node successfully treatedby chemoradiation followed by surgery. The patient was a 59-year-old man showing an ulcerative tumor. He had squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed by biopsy specimens, found in the esophagogastric junction by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Abdominal CT showed a No.7 nodeswelling( 40mm in diameter), and the metastatic tumor directly invaded the pancreas(cStage IVa). We scheduled surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy, because it was difficult to remove the metastatic node completely. Two courses of chemotherapy consisting of 5-FU and CDDP were performed, and 2 Gy/day-irradiation(total amount of 40 Gy)was performed over 20 days. After chemoradiation, the tumor changed to a superficially depressed lesion, and the metastatic huge node was shrunk. Thirty-five days after chemoradiation, transhiatal a lower esophagectomy with proximal gastrectomy was performed. Histopathologic findings after surgery showed no cancer remnant in the primary site and the node(pCR). Three years later, the patient is well without recurrence. Although there was no evidence of preoperative chemoradiation limited in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy may be an effective treatment in advanced cases, such as the present one.
