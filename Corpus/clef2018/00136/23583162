Spontaneous rupture of an advanced pancreatoblastoma: aberrant RASSF1A methylation and CTNNB1 mutation as molecular genetic markers. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare pancreatic tumor that is most commonly encountered in infants and young children. This report describes an unusual presentation of a large pancreatic body pancreatoblastoma presenting with intraabdominal bleeding due to spontaneous rupture of the tumor in a 5-year-old boy. Subsequent molecular analysis from the resected specimen identified a mutation in CTNNB1 and aberrant methylation of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A.
