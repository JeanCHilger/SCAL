Squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the pancreas is a controversial entity of uncertain origin, as the pancreas is entirely devoid of squamous cells. Cases of pancreatic carcinomas that exhibit primary squamous morphology are rarely described in the literature. We report a case of primary SCC of the pancreas in a 66-year-old woman with complaints of epigastric pain of five months duration. Imaging studies demonstrated a solid tumor in the body of the pancreas that invaded the superior mesenteric (SMA) and celiac arteries, as well as regional lymph nodes. Cytological examination of an endosonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) specimen confirmed the diagnosis of well-differentiated SCC of the pancreas. On the basis of diagnosis and examinations prior to chemotherapy, we did not detect any SCC lesions that might have metastasized to the pancreas. Primary SCC of the pancreas is a rare entity that comprises 0.05% of all exocrine pancreatic carcinomas. The clinical profile and biological behavior of pancreas SCC are similar to typical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.
