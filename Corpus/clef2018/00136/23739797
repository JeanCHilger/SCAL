Evaluating blunt pancreatic trauma at whole body CT: current practices and future directions. Blunt pancreatic trauma almost always occurs in the setting of multiple severe injuries, and is usually diagnosed within the context of whole-body trauma CT. Associated injuries may flag the pancreas for greater scrutiny. Main duct laceration is the primary determinant of the need for surgical intervention. Characterization is improved with advanced post-processing techniques. We present useful diagnostic pearls, describe key pitfalls, and review advancements in the evaluation of pancreatic trauma at whole-body MDCT.
