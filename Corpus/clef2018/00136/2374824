Pancrease divisum: CT and ERCP findings. A case of pancreas divisum diagnosed by CT is reported. ERCP via the major pipilla revealed a very short pancreatic duct, which appeared to be abruptly interrupted by a tumor. CT, however, demonstrated two definite pancreatic moieties separated by a fat cleft, indicating the presence of pancreas divisum.
