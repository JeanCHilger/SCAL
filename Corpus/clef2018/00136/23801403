Preoperative assessment of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumours: role of MDCT and MRI. This study was done to compare the diagnostic accuracy of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative assessment of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumours (NFPET).Fifty-one patients (25 men, 26 women mean age, 52 years), preoperatively investigated by both MDCT and MRI and subsequently operated on with a histological diagnosis of NFPET, were included in this study. MDCT and MRI accuracy in evaluating location, size, margins, baseline density/signal intensity, structure, pattern of enhancement, peak enhancement phase, involvement of main pancreatic duct, involvement of adjacent organs, infiltration of peritumoural vessels, involvement of locoregional lymph nodes, and liver metastases was compared using Pearson correlation, Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.MDCT and MRI had similar accuracy in assessing size, margins, baseline density/signal intensity, structure, pattern of enhancement, peak enhancement phase, involvement of main pancreatic duct, involvement of adjacent organs, involvement of locoregional lymph nodes, and liver metastases (p>0.05). MDCT was superior to MRI in evaluating the infiltration of peritumoural vessels (p=0.025).MDCT performed better than MRI in assessing vascular involvement and should be considered the best imaging tool for preoperative evaluation of NFPET.
