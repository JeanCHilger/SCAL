Complications of endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration on pancreatic cystic lesions: final results from a large prospective multicenter study. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic cystic lesions has been reported to have a higher complication rate than that of solid lesions, but the real complication rate is unknown. Aim of the study was to identify the complication rate of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and related risk factors.Prospective multicenter study at four referral centres. Data were collected from January 2010 to July 2012, searching for all adverse events related to guided fine needle aspiration. All complications occurring up to day 90 were recorded.298 patients (43.9% male, mean age 63.2 ± 15.4 years) underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of pancreatic cystic lesions. Mean size was 34.1 ± 9 mm. Adverse events occurred in 18 patients (6%): mild complications in 12/18 (66.6%), and moderate complications in 6/18 (33.3%). Seven were immediate, 6 early, and 5 late. All resolved with medical therapy.Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic cystic lesions has been found to be associated with a higher complication rate than for solid lesions however, the risk rate is acceptable considering the complication grade and the important diagnostic role of the technique in the management of pancreatic cystic lesions.
