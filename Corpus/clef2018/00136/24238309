Suck-ligate-unroof-biopsy by using a detachable 20-mm loop for the diagnosis and therapy of small subepithelial tumors (with video). The diagnosis and therapy of subepithelial tumors (SETs) can be challenging.Proof-of-concept evaluation of the suck-ligate-unroof-biopsy (SLUB) technique for small (<2 cm), non-pedunculated SETs.Pilot feasibility study.Tertiary-care referral center.Twenty-three patients (median age 60 years) meeting the inclusion criteria after preliminary EUS.SET ligation was performed with a detachable 20-mm loop deployed through an 18-mm diameter, soft, oblique, transparent, cap attachment. The SLUB technique comprised (1) suction to draw the SET into the cap (2) ligation below the SET, confirmation by repeat EUSTechnical success, histology and/or immunohistochemistry yield, adverse events, completeness of resection.SLUB was attempted on 24 SETs and was technically successful in all. Location was the stomach (n = 19), small bowel (n = 1), colon (n = 2), and rectum (n = 2). Median size by EUS was 10 mm (range 6-15 mm). Biopsy specimens provided an immunohistologic diagnosis in all cases: GI stromal tumor (n = 5), leiomyoma (n = 8), carcinoid tumor (n = 5), Vanek's tumor (n = 2), granuloma (n =1), and pancreatic heterotopia (n = 3). Follow-up endoscopy and EUS in 13 patients showed well-healed scars with no residual tumor, including all 9 patients with premalignant neoplastic lesions. The only adverse event was self-limited pain in 2 patients.Single center, single operator, small sample size.Loop ligation of small, non-pedunculated SETs is feasible by using a cap attachment for suction. Unroofing after ligation is safe and provides sufficient tissue for immunohistochemistry. Ligation combined with unroofing appears to lead to complete ablation by ischemia and tumor enucleation.
