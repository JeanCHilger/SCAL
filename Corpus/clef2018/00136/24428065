Diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis according to miagnetic resonance imaging data. To estimate the informative value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR cholangiopancreatography for diagnosing changes in the parenchyma and duct system of patients with suspected and/or diagnostically established chronic pancreatitis (CP).MRI was carried out in 120 surgical patients with suspected and/or diagnostically established CP, by using a Siemens Magnetom Impact 1.0 T MRI system. The study protocol encompassed standard gradient sequences and MR cholangiopancreatography.No visual signs of changes were found in the pancreatic parenchyma and main pancreatic duct (MPD) in 7 (5.8%) patients. There were undetectable MR changes in the pancreas and duct system in 12 (10.0%) patients. Mild changes in the pancreas were visualized in 17 (14.2%). Its moderate changes as diffusely reduced signal intensity, gland irregularities, and dilated MPD with uneven ecstasized and shortened side branches were revealed in 24 (20.0%) patients. Most examinees (n = 60 (50.0%)) had obvious pancreatic changes.Standard MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography in evaluating CP can visualize pancreatic parenchymal signal changes and altered ducts particularly in patients with suspected CP, the signs of pancreatic parenchymal atrophy and fibrous changes and estimate pancreatic sizes and duct system changes.
