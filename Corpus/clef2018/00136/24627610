Huge undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas with osteoclast-like giant cells. Undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) is very rare, less than 1% of all pancreatic malignancies, and shows worse prognosis than that of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. We present a case of en bloc resection for a huge undifferentiated carcinoma with OGCs that invaded the stomach and transverse mesocolon. A 67-year female was admitted for left upper quadrant pain and computed tomography demonstrated a mass occupying the lesser sac and abutting the stomach and pancreas. There were no distant metastases and the patient underwent subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, total gastrectomy, and segmental resection of the transverse colon. Histopathological examination confirmed an 11 cm-sized undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas with OGCs. Immunohistochemical staining revealed reactivity with pan-cytokeratin in adenocarcinoma component, with vimentin in neoplastic multi-nucleated cells, with CD45/CD68 in OGCs, and with p53 in tumor cells, respectively. The patient had suffered from multiple bone metastases and survived 9 mo after surgery. This case supports the ductal epithelial origin of undifferentiated carcinoma with OGCs and early diagnosis could result in favorable surgical outcomes. Investigations on the surgical role and prognostic factors need to be warranted in this tumor.
