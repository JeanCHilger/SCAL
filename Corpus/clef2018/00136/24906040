Administration of secretin (RG1068) increases the sensitivity of detection of duct abnormalities by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in patients with pancreatitis. Administration of secretin improves noninvasive imaging of the pancreatic duct with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). We performed a large prospective study to investigate whether synthetic human secretin (RG1068)-stimulated MRCP detects pancreatic duct abnormalities with higher levels of sensitivity than MRCP.We performed a phase 3, multicenter, baseline-controlled study of patients with acute or acute recurrent pancreatitis who were scheduled to undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) between March 26, 2008, and October 28, 2009. Patients underwent a baseline MRCP that was immediately followed by administration of RG1068 and repeat MRCP and then underwent ERCP within 30 days they were followed up for 30 days. MRCP and ERCP images were read centrally by 3 radiologists and 2 endoscopists, respectively, who were all independent and blindedIn total, 258 patients were enrolled in the study 251 MRCP image sets were assessed, and 236 patients had evaluable ERCPs. Pancreatic duct abnormalities were observed in 60.2% of ERCP images. All radiologists identified duct abnormalities in RG1068-cin√© MRCP image sets with significantly higher levels of sensitivity (P < .0001) than in images from MRCP, with minimal loss of specificity. Adverse events were reported in 38.0% of patients after MRCP and 68.1% after ERCP. Of the 55 patients who experienced a serious adverse event, 3 (1.2%) and 52 (20.5%) of the events were reported to be temporally associated with MRCP and ERCP, respectively. The adverse events most frequently considered related to RG1068 were nausea, abdominal pain, and flushingCompared with images from MRCP, those from RG1068-stimulated MRCP are improved in many aspects and could aid in diagnosis and clinical decision making for patients with acute, acute recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis. RG1068-enhanced MRCP might also better identify patients in need of therapeutic ERCP (ClinicalTrials.gov, Number: NCT00660335).
