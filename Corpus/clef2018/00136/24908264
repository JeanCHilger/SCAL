Comparison of multi-slice computed tomographic angiography and dual-source computed tomographic angiography in resectability evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma. The assessment of pancreatic cancer resectability is based mainly on the extent of the peripancreatic vasculature involvement with tumor mass. The 16-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) were used in non-invasive imaging of the pancreas and the regional vessels in 48 pancreatic carcinoma patients. Both of these techniques were combined with contrast-enhanced angiography and post-scanning reconstruction of 2D and 3D images. Based on the degree of involvement revealed by these images, the pre-operative tumor resectability was determined. The CTA-based resectability was then correlated with the surgical and pathological findings for the evaluation of their sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy. The study suggests that resectability based on dual-source CTA showed higher sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy than that obtained from MSCTA scanning.
