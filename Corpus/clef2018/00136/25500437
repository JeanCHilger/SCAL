Late complications of self-expandable metallic stent placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction. The patient was a 68-year-old man with pancreatic cancer exhibiting invasion into the superior mesenteric artery and stenosis of the third part of the duodenum. He subsequently received a duodenal stent for malignant gastric outlet obstruction. On day 43 after the placement of the duodenal stent, he reported feeling poorly, with hypotension and hematemesis. High-density areas were observed from the stomach to the rectum on computed tomography. We diagnosed the origin of bleeding as the last third of the duodenum unfortunately, the patient died. This is the first report of massive gastrointestinal tract bleeding as a late complication of self-expandable metallic stent placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction.
