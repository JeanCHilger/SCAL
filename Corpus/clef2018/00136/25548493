Clinicopathological features of small nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. To present our experiences in studying the clinicopathological features of small nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-pNETs).The subjects included 9 patients with NF-pNETs who underwent pancreatectomy between April 1996 and September 2012. The surgical procedure, histopathological findings, and prognosis were assessed.All tumors were incidentally detected by computed tomography. The median diameter was 10 mm (5-32 mm). One patient was diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau disease, and the others were sporadic cases. For the histopathological findings, 7 patients were G1 1 patient was G2Sporadic NF-pNETs smaller than 10 mm tend to have less malignant potential. These findings suggest that lymphadenectomy may be omitted for small NF-pNETs after further investigation.
