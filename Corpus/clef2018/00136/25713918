Incremental value of cell block preparations over conventional smears alone in the evaluation of EUS-FNA for pancreatic masses. The effectiveness of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been established for a definite pathological diagnosis of pancreatic solid masses. We investigated the usefulness of cell block preparations in EUS-FNA, by evaluating the added value of cell block preparations over conventional smears alone.Between March 2011 and June 2013, 61 patients were retrospectively evaluated who underwent EUS-FNA for pancreatic solid masses. Diagnostic values for diagnosing pancreatic malignancy were compared for a combination of the conventional smear and cell block (CSCB) and the conventional smear alone (CS).The addition of the cell block technique increased the sensitivity of conventional smear for diagnosing the pancreatic malignancy from 79% (CS) to 90% (CSCB, p=0.0313) and the accuracy from 81% to 91% (p=0.0313). The specificity and positive predictive value were 100% in both methods. The negative predictive value was increased from 33% (CS) to 50% (CSCB), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.0833).The addition of the cell block method after a conventional smear may increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value for diagnosing the pancreatic malignancy in patients with pancreatic masses who undergo EUS-FNA. Further study may be warranted to determine whether the cell block method can replace the conventional smear.
