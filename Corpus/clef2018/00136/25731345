A case of resection of pancreatic head lymph node metastasis of rectal carcinoid. An 80-year-old woman was treated with low anterior resection and D3 lymph node dissection for rectal carcinoid in August 2007. Pathological diagnosis was a tumor 23 Ã— 22 mm in size with muscularis propria invasion, ly1, v0, n1 (No. 251[1/12]). Partial hepatectomy was performed for liver metastasis in March 2010 and September 2011. In June 2013, an isolated tumor of 17 mm in diameter was detected between the inferior vena cava and the stomach using abdominal ultrasonography. The tumor was diagnosed as pancreatic head lymph node metastasis using abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and positron emission tomography (PET) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was noted at the site of the tumor, but not at other parts of the body. Curative resection was the chosen treatment option. Open surgery was performed in September 2013, and a tumor 30 mm in diameter located at the ventral side of the inferior vena cava, lateral side of the portal vein, and cranial side of duodenum was resected. No surrounding tissue infiltration was found. Pathological analysis of the resected specimen indicated lymph node metastasis of the rectal carcinoid. The patient has been disease free for 9 months after surgery.
