Rare case of Helicobacter pylori-positive multiorgan IgG4-related disease and gastric cancer. A 61-year-old male from Northeast China presented with a 2-mo history of abdominal distension, pruritus and jaundice. Laboratory testing revealed an elevated serum IgG4 level. A computed tomography scan showed a typical feature of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and cholecystocholangitis. Early gastric cancer was incidentally discovered when endoscopic untrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the pancreas was carried out. The patient underwent radical subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer combined with cholecystectomy. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and IgG4-positive plasmacytes were detected in gastric cancer tissue, pancreatic EUS-FNA sample and resected gallbladder specimen by immunohistochemistry. The patient was diagnosed with H. pylori-positive IgG4-related AIP and sclerosing cholecystocholangitis as well as H. pylori-positive gastric cancer. He responded well to steroid therapy and remains healthy with no signs of recurrence at one year follow-up. We speculate that H. pylori might act as a trigger via direct or indirect action in the initiation of onset of gastric cancer and multiorgan IgG4-related disease.
