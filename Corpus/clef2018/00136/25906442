Mucin expression in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration specimens is a useful prognostic factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to further examine the utility of mucin (MUC) expression profiles as prognostic factors in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Mucin expression was examined by immunohistochemistry analysis in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration specimens obtained from 114 patients with PDAC. The rate of expression of each MUC was compared with clinicopathologic features.The expression rates of MUCs in cancer lesions were MUC1, 87.7% MUC2, 0.8%Mucin expression profiles in ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration specimens have excellent diagnostic utility and are useful predictors of outcome in patients with PDAC.
