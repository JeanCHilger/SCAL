Advances in diffusion-weighted imaging. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has become a routine component of clinical MR imaging. Its unique soft tissue contrast mechanism exploits differences in the motion of water molecules in vivo at a biologically meaningful scale. The clinical potential of DWI in lesion detection, characterization, and response assessment has been explored. This review briefly covers basic principles of DWI and introduces advances, specifically for abdominopelvic organs.
