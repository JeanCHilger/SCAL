Conventional imaging of pancreatic cancer. Computed tomography has become the optimal imaging modality for both diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is especially highly accurate in assessing the relationship of the tumour to critical arterial and venous structures, since their involvement can preclude surgical resection. MRI provides additional staging information regarding presence of small liver metastases not seen at CT. Precise definition of tumour resectability is needed to facilitate optimal patient treatment.
