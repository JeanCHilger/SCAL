Immunosuppression and a serious opportunistic infection: an unfortunate price to pay. A 57-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type 1, status postcadaveric pancreas transplant alone 11 years ago, on chronic immunosuppression, and dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease, presented with 2 months of progressive generalised weakness, lumbar back pain with right lower extremity radiculopathy and episodic symptomatic hypotension. Preliminary infectious disease work up was unremarkable. She was discharged following symptomatic improvement. She represented 3 days later with continued functional decline and leucocytosis. Chest X-ray demonstrated diffuse pulmonary nodules, confirmed on chest CT scan. CT-guided biopsy of a right upper lobe nodule was performed studies confirmed Nocardia farcinica. Further imaging revealed bilateral white matter intracranial lesions, and extensive Nocardia-positive fluid collections in the right gluteal and vastus musculature, requiring periodic surgical debridement. She was treated with multiple antimicrobials, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate and moxifloxacin. She was discharged after a 6-month hospitalisation.
