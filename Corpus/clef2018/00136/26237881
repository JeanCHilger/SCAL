Radiological examinations in suspected physical abuse of a child. Injuries associated with child abuse involve typical imaging findings that should be recognized by every radiologist, because a radiologist may be the first person to raise doubts about abuse. Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages in the vicinity of the longitudinal cerebral fissure are characteristic of a brain injury resulting from shaking. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most recommendable method of imaging. At the acute stage, computed tomography is sufficient for the detection of conditions requiring immediate neurosurgical treatment, if magnetic resonance imaging is not possible. Ultrasonography is not sensitive enough for this purpose. Fractures in a child under the age of one year are always suspicious, especially rib fractures. Injuries of the liver, pancreas and intestine are often found in the abdominal region. Contrast-enhanced CT scan is the best investigation in injuries of the lungs and the abdominal region. If a suspicion of physical abuse is raised upon imaging studies, it is important to bring this to the notice of the attending physician and note the issue also in the report.
