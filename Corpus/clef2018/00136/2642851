Application of magnetic resonance imaging in pancreas transplant. Various imaging methods have been used in the differential diagnosis of pancreas-transplant dysfunction. As early as 1977, angiography and radionuclide studies ([75Se]seleno-DL-methionine) were used to evaluate pancreas allografts. More recently, the use of 99mTc-labeled DTPA, computed tomography, and ultrasonography has been described, and abnormal findings associated with rejection have been reported with these imaging methods. However, no attempt has been made to determine the ability of each method to detect rejection and to differentiate graft dysfunction caused by rejection from dysfunction by other causes. We summarize our experience with the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pancreas transplantation and a comparative study of radionuclide 99mTc-DTPA scans, ultrasonography, and MRI in the detection and differentiation of pancreas-graft dysfunction.
