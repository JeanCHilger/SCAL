A Case of Retroperitoneal Lymphangioma that Was Difficult to Differentiate from Pancreatic Tumor. We report a rare case of retroperitoneal lymphangioma that was difficult to differentiate from pancreatic tumor. The patient was a 38-year-old woman. In June 2011, CT detected a pancreatic tail tumor. She was expected to undergo radical surgery and was referred to our hospital. The tumor was 55×43×40 mm in size and was described as a multilocular cystic lesion with a partition on CT. MRI demonstrated the tumor as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted images. Sonazoid-enhanced US showed a contrast effect of the partition wall. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as a mucinous cystic neoplasm, and the patient underwent surgery. Intraoperatively, the tumor was a white multilocular cystic lesion with a capsule. The cystic lesion was exfoliated from the pancreatic parenchyma. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a cavernous lymphangioma without malignancy. The surgery achieved good progress and the patient was discharged 12 days postoperatively. She is attending our clinic without any recurrence.
