A Case of Long-Term Survival after Pancreatoduodenectomy for Gastric Cancer with Pancreatic Invasion. A 79-year-old woman with symptomatic pyloric stenosis was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer. CT revealed that the tumor had invaded into the pancreatic head.Since no contraindications were found at laparotomy, we performed pancreatoduodenectomy. The histopathologic diagnosis was pT4b (panc), pN3a (11/35), P0, CY0, H0, M0, pStage â…¢C, R0. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 1 year. The patient has survived without recurrence for more than 2 years. The efficacy of pancreatoduodenectomy for advanced gastric cancer is still controversial. Pancreatoduodenetomy may be indicated for selected cases of advanced gastric cancer, if an R0 resection can be achieved.
