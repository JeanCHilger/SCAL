A case of neurofibroma located in the retroperitoneum involving the uncinate process of the pancreas. A case of solitary neurofibroma in the retroperitoneum involving the uncinate process of the pancreas, which has been reported in only one case in Japan and less than 20 cases in the world literature, is described. A 57-year-old male complained of back pain and microhematuria. Plain and enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) indicated an 8 x 6 cm hypovascular tumor located in the uncinate process. We initially assumed it to be a cancer of the pancreas. His physical examination and blood chemistry result were normal. Various diagnostic imaging methods however, disclosed a rare type of tumor. The tumor was resected by pancreaticoduodenectomy and histological examination revealed it to be neurofibroma.
