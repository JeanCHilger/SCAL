Frantz's tumor: a papillary and cystic tumor of the pancreas in girls. Four girls with Frantz's tumor, a papillary and cystic tumor of the pancreas, are studied and discussed in comparison with 112 cases in the literature, including 58 Japanese cases. The neoplasms occur predominantly in girls and young women. Up to recently, the tumors have possibly been misclassified as nonfunctioning islet cell tumor or carcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, papillary cystadenocarcinoma, or pancreatoblastoma according to microscopic findings and frequently have been managed with aggressive surgery such as pancreatoduodenectomy. The tumors are well encapsulated and the cut surfaces show characteristically solid and hemorrhagic-necrotic patterns. Ultrasonography and CT scan are the most useful tools for the diagnosis. The neoplasms usually behave like a very low-grade malignancy, so that complete removal is the treatment of choice for the tumor arising anywhere in the pancreas. Immunochemical and electron microscopic studies can differentiate Frantz's tumor from other neoplasms and also suggest that the tumors originate from primordial cells or multipotential stem cells capable of differentiating into both exocrine and endocrine lines.
