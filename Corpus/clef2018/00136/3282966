Pseudocyst following splenectomy: impact of CT and ultrasound on its diagnosis and management. Three cases of pseudocysts occurring after splenectomy are presented. Sonography and computed tomography were helpful in diagnosing the pseudocysts as well as providing guidance for subsequent drainage. Demonstration of a cystic mass adjacent to the tail of the pancreas following splenectomy suggests the diagnosis of postsplenectomy pseudocyst and has important implications for clinical management.
