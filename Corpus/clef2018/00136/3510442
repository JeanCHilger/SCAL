Pancreatic necrosis: CT manifestations. Pancreatic necrosis is a potential sequela of acute pancreatitis, which pathologically represents a collection of devitalized tissue. Appropriate therapeutic planning requires definition of this irreversibly damaged gland, the presence of which is not consistently diagnosed on the basis of clinical and laboratory data. Over an 18-month period, 22 patients with pancreatic necrosis were studied by one or more computed tomographic (CT) examinations. Retrospective analysis showed the findings to vary with the developmental stage of the necrotizing process. During the acute phase, there was considerable morphologic overlap of necrosis and pancreatic phlegmon. Typical findings were seen in the subacute and chronic stages and included diffuse enlargement of the gland with largely decreased central density. A thick, smooth surrounding rim produced a characteristic saclike configuration. CT-guided aspiration for culture material was performed in four patients with suspected superinfection. Negative gram stain and culture results in two patients allowed surgery to be performed on a more elective basis.
