Tuberculous retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy mimicking metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. A case of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy of tuberculous origin is reported. Despite clear representation of retroperitoneal lym-phadenopathy by abdominal ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT), fine-needle aspiration was inconclusive. Exploratory laparotomy was necessary to make the diagnosis. Nonsurgical diagnosis of this entity continues to be a challenge.
