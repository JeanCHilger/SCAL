Pancreatic mass due to Strongyloides stercoralis infection: an unusual manifestation. A 30-year-old man returning from a trip through India complained of epigastric pain, diarrhea, loss of weight, and jaundice. Stool examination was positive for Strongyloides stercoralis. On ultrasonographic investigation, intravenous cholangiography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography, stenosis of the distal common bile duct and enlargement of the pancreatic head were observed. The patient was treated for the Strongyloides infection. The jaundice disappeared within days, the laboratory finding normalized, and the patient recovered rapidly. However, the ultrasonographic examination showed a complete recovery in the course of about 2 years. From this report we conclude that in patients with obstructive jaundice and Strongyloides stercoralis infection, serious abnormalities resembling pancreatic tumour or pancreatitis can be found on ultrasonographic and radiological investigations, and this should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic mass in patients living in or returning from endemic areas.
