Diagnosis and therapy of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. A critical review of the status. The practical implications of the new Marseilles classification (1984) of pancreatitis are discussed and the present-day diagnostic methods critically reviewed. The new classification distinguishes between two typical long-term profiles, i.e. acute (reversible) and chronic (progressive) pancreatitis. Modern diagnostic tests such as sonography, CT, ERCP and the secretin-CCK test do not provide a "gold standard" for early chronic pancreatitis. Thus, long-term studies of function and morphology are needed to differentiate chronic pancreatitis (progressive dysfunction, calcification, ERP changes) from acute (reversible) pancreatitis. The etiology is a helpful prognostic guide since gallstone pancreatitis virtually never becomes chronic. However, alcoholic "acute" pancreatitis may not always progress to chronic pancreatitis. Drug or surgical treatment of pain is symptomatic and empirical, since the pathomechanisms of pain are poorly understood. A prerequisite for optimum therapy is exact staging of the disease into: uncomplicated early stages with short, self-limiting episodes of pancreatitis: conservative therapy, persistent pain, mainly due to pseudocysts (diagnosis by morphological tests): surgical therapy, advanced painless forms of chronic pancreatitis associated with diabetes and/or steatorrhea: diet and substitution therapy. After successful surgical drainage persistent pain subsides, but postoperative episodic recurrences of pancreatitis are common in the early stages of the disease and in association with continued alcohol intake. However, spontaneous pain relief occurs in all cases in the late stages of the disease and with progressive pancreatic dysfunction (despite continued alcohol abuse).
