Diagnosis of hydatid cyst by percutaneous aspiration: value of electrolyte determinations. A study was made of the fluid from 11 hydatid cysts (10 hepatic, one renal) and from 50 nonparasitic cysts (25 renal, 10 ovarian, 10 pancreatic and five hepatic). Our analysis indicated that the chloride (range 62-95 mEq/liter), the sodium (range 125-139 mEq/liter) and the potassium content (range 5.1-7.5 mEq/liter) of the former differed significantly (p less than 0.01) from those of the controls. Hydatid cysts may be indistinguishable from others with both CT and ultrasound and therefore the electrolyte data are of diagnostic value when a hydatid cyst is accidentally punctured percutaneously.
