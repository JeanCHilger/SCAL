Fine-needle aspiration biopsy via percutaneous transhepatic catheterization: technique and clinical results. Under fluoroscopy, we performed fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas and bile duct via percutaneous transhepatic catheterization in 24 patients with obstructive jaundice. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of our technique were 67, 100, and 71%, respectively. This method of biopsy avoids malignant seeding of the tract and does not burden patients psychologically.
