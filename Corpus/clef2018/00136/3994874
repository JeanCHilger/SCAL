Echocardiographic features of a mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. Cross sectional echocardiography detected a mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst which caused extracardiac compression in a 49 year old man. Computed tomography confirmed the presence of a cystic lesion lying behind the heart and extending from the pancreas to above the carina. Surgical decompression resulted in resolution of the clinical and echocardiographic findings.
