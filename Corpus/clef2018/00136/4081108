Preduodenal portal vein in an adult--angiography and CT. We report on an adult case of preduodenal portal vein illustrated by computed tomography (CT) and angiography. These diagnostic modalities were initially performed to evaluate a coexisting pancreatic cancer. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated unusual positioning of the portal vein ventral to the duodenum. The superior mesenteric-portal vein, which was L-shaped and convexly caudad, strongly suggested this anomalous condition.
