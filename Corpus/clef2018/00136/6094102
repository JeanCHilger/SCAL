Percutaneous hepatic biopsy in suspected pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic neoplasms often present with hepatic lesions as well as a pancreatic mass, as seen on abdominal computed tomography examination. To obtain histologic diagnosis, we advocate computed tomography-directed biopsy of the liver lesion instead of the pancreatic mass because of the increased accuracy and safety of hepatic biopsy as compared with pancreatic biopsy.
