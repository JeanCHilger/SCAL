Tumors of the endocrine pancreas. 37 patients suffering from apudomas of the pancreas are reported (18 insulinomas, 6 isletcell-hyperplasias, 9 Zollinger-Ellison syndroms, 1 glucagonoma, 3 without hormone production). In preoperative localization computerized tomography and angiography were the best with 65% positive findings. Insulinomas were enucleated, all free of recidives. 50% of operated isletcell hyperplasias had a postoperative resisting hyperinsulinism. Either gastrectomy or tumour enucleation was performed in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The five-years survival rate was 43%.
