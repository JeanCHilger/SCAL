Pancreatic cystadenoma. Angiographic and histologic findings illustrated by two cases. Two cases of pancreatic cystadenoma are presented, demonstrating the typical angiographic and histologic pattern as given in previous literature. Although computed tomography and ultrasound examinations may be useful [11], angiography seems to play a decisive role in establishing the diagnosis, demonstrating the localization and extent of the tumor, and permitting the possible differentiation of benign and malignant lesions.
