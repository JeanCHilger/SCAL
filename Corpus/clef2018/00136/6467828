Calcific pancreatitis: calcification patterns and pancreatogram correlations. The abdominal radiographs of 74 patients with calcific pancreatitis were reviewed to assess the distribution, density and patterns of calcification. These characteristics were compared with the results of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and ultrasonography. There was a decreasing gradient of calcification from head to tail in most patients. Foci of calcification greater than 5 mm in diameter were almost always associated with pancreatic duct obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography did not provide additional diagnostic information and is unnecessary in calcific pancreatitis except when a precise map is required before operation.
