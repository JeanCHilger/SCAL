Diagnostic algorithms. Analysis of the factors conditioning their definition. An illustrative case (bilio-pancreatic pathology). A case of biliopancreatic pathology studied with traditional (the old algorithm) and the latest (new algorithm) diagnostic techniques is examined. A comparative analysis reveals the second to be simpler, less expensive and less dangerous to the patient. The hope is expressed that doctors will become better informed of the diagnostic criteria to employ for the purpose of cost reduction.
