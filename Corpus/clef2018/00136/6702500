Computed tomography of the abdomen. The CT applications described above are based on our experience with an integrated ultrasound-CT approach, tailored to the patient and aimed at reducing radiation and invasive diagnostic procedures. This approach is not presented as the ideal example to be followed by all. Rather, it is only a sample of the many possible uses of CT. Though there may be many disagreements with our approach, there can be no doubt that CT has revolutionized diagnostic abdominal imaging, to the benefit of all concerned.
