Computed tomography of the abdomen. In a few short years, computed tomography has become an important diagnostic procedure in the examination of the abdomen and pelvis. Its forte lies in its ability to provide cross-sectional views of excellent anatomical detail. Imaging of deep-seated structures such as the pancreas, adrenal glands, and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes is now possible. The ability to distinguish small variations in tissue density enables the radiologist to evaluate the texture of solid structures, and to differentiate them from cysts or abscesses. The addition of contrast enhancement makes it possible to determine the vascularity of a lesson. The major limitation of CT is poorer delineation of structures in thin patients, and in patients in whom voluntary and involuntary motion cannot be interrupted. Computed tomography is compared with other complementary imaging procedures to include sonography, radionuclide imaging, and conventional radiograph procedures. It has replaced invasive diagnostic procedures in many instances. In a given situation, one or more imaging modalities may be appropriate.
