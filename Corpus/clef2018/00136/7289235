Diagnostic evaluation of CT and ERCP based on a retrospective analysis of hepato-biliary and pancreatic diseases. A retrospective analysis was performed in order to evaluate diagnostic accuracies by computed tomography (CT) and by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Materials studied were 67 lesions out of 56 cases with hepato-biliary and pancreatic diseases confirmed mainly at surgery. Diagnostic accuracy of the CT & ERCP for the hepato-biliary lesions was 59.5% & 86.5% and that of CT & ERCP for the pancreatic lesions was 60% & 80% respectively. CT scan is useful for diagnosing abscess, cyst or tumors. On the contrary, lesions which invade the hepato-biliary tract or pancreatic duct can be readily diagnosed by ERCP examination. ERCP is less useful for the diagnosis of parenchymatous lesions or infiltration of lesions into the surrounding organs. Therefore, the combined use of both CT and ERCP is important for the diagnosis of hepato-biliary or pancreatic disease.
