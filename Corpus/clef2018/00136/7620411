Endoscopic ultrasonographic-guided punctured pancreatic ductography: an initial and successful trial. A 71-year-old male suffering from an intraductal papillary tumor of the pancreas was admitted to our hospital for further investigation. Diagnostic trials, including endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, did not produce an adequate ductography because of a large amount of mucinous fluid. Therefore, we performed endoscopic ultrasonographic-guided punctured pancreatic ductography (EPPD). This procedure was safely performed without any complications. We report this initial and successful trial of EPPD.
