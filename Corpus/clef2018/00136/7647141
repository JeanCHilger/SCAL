Groove pancreatitis. A case report of chronic focal pancreatitis. The "groove pancreatitis" is a special form of segmental chronic pancreatitis affecting the "groove" between pancreatic head, duodenum and common bile duct. This type of chronic pancreatitis was first described in 1973 and only few cases have been reported in literature. Unlike other forms of chronic pancreatitis, this is often preceded by peptic ulcers, gastric resections or biliary tract diseases it could be associated with cysts of the duodenal wall and pancreatic cysts. Abdominal pain, vomiting due to duodenal stenosis, obstructive jaundice and weight loss are the most common presenting symptoms. The radiological features show a pancreatic mass similar to a pancreatic head carcinoma and the discrimination of groove pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma is often difficult or even impossible in some patients. We describe a case of groove pancreatitis treated with pancreatoduodenectomy, reviewing the clinical and radiological features. We remark that the groove pancreatitis is a disease that must be known and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.
