Magnetic resonance imaging of the spleen and pancreas. MRI of the spleen and pancreas requires specialized sequences which diminish artifacts in the upper abdomen. High temporal resolution sequences (e.g., spoiled gradient echo) acquired immediately after intravenous Gd-DTPA administration are necessary for imaging both the spleen and pancreas. In evaluating the spleen, early post Gd-DTPA images are essential as many focal disease processes (e.g., lymphomatous deposits or metastases) equilibrate rapidly (< 2 min) with splenic parenchyma. Complete pancreatic examination also requires the use of T1-weighted fat suppressed spin echo. T2-weighted images provide complementary information in a number of settings, in particular in the evaluation of islet cell tumors. Pancreatic ductal carcinoma is low signal on T1-weighted images and enhances in a diminished fashion on immediate post Gd-DTPA images. These tumors are well differentiated from focal chronic pancreatitis and islet celltumors based on their appearances on combined T1, T2-weighted and immediate post Gd-DTPA enhanced images.
