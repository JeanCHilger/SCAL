Cystic tumors of the pancreas: apropos of 36 cases. Cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas are rare cystic tumors of pancreas. Clinicopathological features and treatment of these neoplasms have been studied in 36 patients over a 10-year period (1983-1993). There were 19 cystadenomas (CA) either serous (n = 13) or mucinous (n = 6) and 17 cystadenocarcinomas (CAC). Eighteen CA (95%) were found in women. CAC were found equally between both sexes. Median age was 63 years and was the same for CA and CAC. Ultrasound gave correct diagnosis of CA or CAC in 64% and CT-scan in 77%. The majority of CAC (n = 15) were localized in the head of the pancreas. CA had no preferential localization. 24 patients (66%) underwent including resection (n = 20) and biopsy (n = 4). Four other patients had a percutaneous biopsy and 8 were observed. Hospital mortality was 8%. Complications included gastric atony (n = 4) and pancreatic fistula (n = 2). Four-year actuarial survival is 63% for resected CAC and 100% for resected CA. In conclusion, most cystic pancreatic tumors are found in women. Malignant lesions are found predominately in the head of the pancreas. Modern imaging technics combined with clinical presentation are reliable in obtaining a diagnosis. Resection remains the treatment of choice.
