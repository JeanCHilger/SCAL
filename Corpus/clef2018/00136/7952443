Laparoscopic treatment of pancreatic serous cystadenoma. A 69-year-old man with multiple medical pathology had a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas with obstructive symptoms and abdominal pain. Diagnosis and treatment were done by laparoscopy with total relief of symptoms. Sonograms every 3 months and a computed tomography scan performed 12 months after the procedure report no refilling of the cyst, and 18 months later the patient is free of symptoms. The last sonogram showed no changes. We consider laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of serous cystadenoma of the pancreas to be a useful alternative in the management of this neoplasm.
