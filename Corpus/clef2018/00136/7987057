MR tomography of acute pancreatitis: initial results. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated for its potential in assessment of acute pancreatitis compared to computed tomography (CT). 15 patients with acute pancreatitis were examined using a routine protocol including T1- and T2-weighted sequences and a fat-suppressed T1-weighted spin-echo sequence. Gadopentant-Dimeglumin (Gd-DTPA) was given. For comparison, plain and contrast-enhanced CT was performed prior to MRI. MRI proved to be superior to CT in detection of bleeding, duodenitis and ascites. MRI failed to detect concrements. These first results show that, considering the latest development in technology, MRI is not inferior to CT in diagnostic imaging of acute pancreatitis.
