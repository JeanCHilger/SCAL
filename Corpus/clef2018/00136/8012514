A resected case of giant leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas. Leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas is very rare. We report a case of giant leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas treated by distal pancreatectomy. A 53-year-old female was admitted with an large abdominal mass. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography revealed a huge tumor adjacent to the pancreas. However, we could not identify the primary organ with these imagings. Angiographic findings strongly suggested that the tumor originated from the pancreas, as main feeding arteries arose from the great pancreatic artery. Fourteen days after trans-catheteric arterial embolization, we performed a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Histologically, we confirmed the diagnosis as a leiomyosarcoma originating from the pancreas.
