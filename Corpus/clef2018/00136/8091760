Computed tomographic diagnosis of acute blunt pancreatic transection. Pancreatic injuries secondary to blunt trauma are challenging to diagnose. In many cases, the diagnosis is missed or delayed due to the subtle symptoms and signs of pancreatic injury. Blunt pancreatic injuries may evolve over a period of time and can be a source of extensive morbidity and mortality. Most radiologic and laboratory studies have been notoriously nonspecific in diagnosing pancreatic injuries. This article discusses three patients we treated with pancreatic transection secondary to blunt trauma, who underwent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen on admission. The pertinent CT findings and utility of CT as a diagnostic tool in these three cases of blunt pancreatic injuries are reviewed. Abdominal CT scanning can accurately identify pancreatic injuries secondary to blunt trauma, allowing expeditious surgical intervention. A high index of suspicion for pancreatic injury combined with careful interpretation of abdominal CT scans can provide valuable information about pancreatic injury during the initial trauma assessment.
