Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and pheochromocytoma. Report of a case. A 49-year-old woman was diagnosed in 1985 as having pheochromocytoma because of hypertension with high levels of plasma catecholamine concentration and 24-hour urine excretion of vanillyl-mandelic acid and metanephrine together with a right adrenal mass. The excised tumor cells had fine granular basophilic cytoplasm with argyrophilic granules by Grimelius' method. Four years later, she was diagnosed as having a duodenal bulb ulcer. Serum gastrin showed an abnormally high level of 1900 pg/ml. Abdominal echogram and computed tomography revealed a hypoechoic lesion in the pancreas and intrahepatic multiple tumors. A needle biopsy specimen of the liver tumor was compatible with the histology of metastatic islet cell tumor. A diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was made due to malignant gastrinoma with multiple liver metastases. The patient had no family history of endocrinological or neoplastic disorders. The present case indicates the possibility that pheochromocytoma and gastrinoma, that is, endocrine tumors characteristic of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I and MEN II, may be coincident even in a person without MEN. A continued awareness of previously rare or undescribed manifestations is important in patients with islet cell tumors or pheochromocytoma.
