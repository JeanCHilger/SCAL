Pancreatic lymphoma. Primary lymphoma of the pancreas is an extremely rare condition. There are no previous reports from northern Europe. It is important to differentiate pancreatic carcinoma from lymphoma because there is significant difference between the prognosis and treatment. We describe here a case of primary pancreatic lymphoma in a 64-year-old woman who was admitted to hospital because of a sudden abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasound, computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings are presented, and the features of pancreatic lymphoma in these imaging studies are discussed.
