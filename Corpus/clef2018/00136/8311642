A case of pancreatic cancer with the sign of Leser-Trélat. A case of 79-year-old man with pancreatic cancer associated with the sign of Leser-Trélat was presented. Abdominal CT scanning was performed and a pancreatic tail tumor involving the spleen and the greater omentum as well as ascitic retention were detected. Ba-enema study showed the stenosis of the sigmoid colon, suggesting the peritoneal disseminations. Absolute non-curative operation of side-to-side transverso-sigmoidostomy was performed for colonic stenosis, and biopsy of the disseminated omental tumor was performed, which was histologically diagnosed as well differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma compatible with pancreatic cancer. The postoperative course was uneventful and at present the patient was followed at outpatient clinic. To our knowledge, this case is the first report with pancreatic cancer associated with the sign of Leser-Trélat in Japan.
