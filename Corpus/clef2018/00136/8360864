Primary carcinoid tumor of the pancreas. X-ray computed tomographic and echo-endoscopic aspects. Primary carcinoid tumors of the pancreas are exceedingly rare, only few cases have been reported in the literature. We present a case of primary carcinoid tumor of the pancreas occurring on chronic pancreatitis. The CT, as well as endosonographic features are described. Those two techniques might contribute to an early preoperative diagnosis which is important since carcinoid tumors have a better prognosis than the common pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
