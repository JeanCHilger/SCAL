Traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Fifteen patients who developed pseudocysts following pancreatic trauma were evaluated to determine outcome in relation to the nature and site of pancreatic duct injury. Pseudocysts developed in eight patients operated on within 48 h of abdominal trauma and in seven who were initially treated conservatively. In none was duct injury diagnosed during initial management. Presentation was a median of 20 (range 8-360) days after injury. In 14 patients, pseudocysts (mean diameter 9 (range 3-16) cm) were confirmed by computed tomography or ultrasonography. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) demonstrated the site and severity of the duct injury in eight of 11 patients. Two patients with side duct injury on ERP were treated successfully without intervention. Pseudocysts arising from distal duct injuries (four patients) were treated by percutaneous aspiration or catheter drainage, although one patient required subsequent distal resection for recurrent pancreatitis caused by a pancreatic duct stricture. Three patients with duct injuries in the neck or body with pancreatic disruption underwent distal pancreatectomy. Proximal duct injuries with mature pseudocysts (three patients) were drained internally. Three patients had complicated pseudocysts (haemorrhage in one, sepsis in two) that necessitated emergency laparotomy and external drainage one of these patients died from sepsis. These findings suggest that traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts that follow peripheral duct injury may resolve spontaneously, whereas those associated with distal duct injuries can be treated by percutaneous aspiration or catheter drainage. Proximal duct injuries, however, require surgical intervention using either resection or internal drainage, depending on the maturity of the cyst wall.
