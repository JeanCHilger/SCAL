The diagnosis of pancreatic cyst by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and ultrasonic scanning. Fourteen patients with verified pancreatic cysts were examined by both preoperative endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) and ultrasonic scanning. ERP showed filling of a cyst in 4 patients and raised suspicion of a cyst in 8. In two patients it was not possible to visualize the pancreatic duct. Ultrasonic scanning showed a cyst in 12 patients. There were two false negative ultrasonic diagnoses. These two were correctly diagnosed by ERP. Ultrasonically guided percutaneous puncture was carried out on 19 occasions in 8 patients. Cysts down to 2 cm in diameter were punctured without difficulty. There were no clinically significant complications due to the punctures. One patient was followed for 20 months without ultrasonically demonstrable recurrence of a large cyst aspirated, showing that definite therapy is possible by this method. Puncture can be used to verify the diagnosis and as treatment in patients where surgery is contraindicated.
