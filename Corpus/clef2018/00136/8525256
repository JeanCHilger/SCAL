Prognostic value of the sites of pancreatic necrosis determined by computed tomography of the abdomen. Correlations between tomographic findings and the outcome of the disease was made in 49 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis submitted to surgical treatment. Mortality rate was 20.40% resulting mostly from sepsis and multiple organ failures. There was no correlation between APACHE II index and number of necrotic areas diagnosed by abdominal computed tomography although they were closely related with mortality. These findings suggest that different necrotic areas have different prognostic values. The root of the superior mesenteric artery and retropancreatic area were related to worst prognosis with 100% mortality rate. Incomplete necrotic tissue removal is the possible explanation for the high mortality rate.
