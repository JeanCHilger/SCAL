Treatment of pancreatic stones with extracorporeal lithotripsy with sonographic localization. Pancreatic stones may be treated by endoscopic extraction or by surgery. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy increased possibility of noninvasive steps to their elimination. The aim of this study was to describe our first experience with this method.10 patients (6 men and 4 women) in average age 47 years (between 19 to 72 years) were treated. The lithotriptor MEDILIT with sonographic targeting was used for fragmentation of pancreatic stones. Fragmentation was achieved in 8 patients, in 4 cases we observed spontaneous disappearnace, in 3 cases an endoscopic extraction of fragments was necessary. In one case good fragmentation was observed at control ECRP, but the repeated Wirsungography showed a big pseudocyst which had not been diagnosed at the first examination and surgery was necessary. In 2 cases no fragmentation was achieved and in these cases surgery was also indicated. No serious side effects were observed, nor elevation of amylase values compared with the situation before the shock wave treatment.Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of pancreatic stones revealed good fragmentation and disappearance stone from ductus Wirsungi without serious side effects on clinical course and surrounding soft tissues.
