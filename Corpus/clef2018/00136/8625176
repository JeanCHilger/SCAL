Effectiveness of the cytologic examination of pure pancreatic juice in the diagnosis of early neoplasia of the pancreas. The early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma through the use of traditional radiographic or ultrasonographic methods is extremely difficult.To detect an early and potentially curable cancer of the pancreas, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) and aspiration cytology of pure pancreatic juice were performed in 295 consecutive patients who had symptoms or findings that suggested pancreatic disease but in whom there was neither a pancreatic mass nor ductal stenosis.Positive cytologic results were obtained in 12 patients (4%). With the aid of intraoperative cytodiagnosis, all 12 early neoplasms of the pancreas were successfully resected. Of these 12 resected specimens, 4 were adenocarcinoma with minimal invasion, 3 were in situ adenocarcinoma and 5 were marked atypia. All 12 patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence for an average of 32 months after surgery. The 283 patients who had negative ERP-cytology results were observed, but no further cases of pancreatic cancer were found.Because ERP-cytology is simple to perform, safe, and reliable, it is useful in the diagnosis of patients who have early neoplasm of the pancreas.
