Spread of gallbladder carcinoma: CT evaluation with pathologic correlation. To assess the accuracy of computed tomographic (CT) imaging in the detection of spread and staging of gallbladder carcinoma.CT findings of spread of gallbladder carcinoma in 59 Japanese patients who underwent radical surgery were correlated retrospectively with pathologic findings.The incidence of histologically proven nodal involvement was 54% (32 patients) and the most common spread of gallbladder carcinoma. The sensitivities in CT detection of N1 and N2 nodal involvement were 36% and 47%, respectively positive predictive values were 94% and 92%, respectively. Direct extension to the liver, extrahepatic bile duct, and gastrointestinal tract or pancreas were histologically confirmed in 24, 18, and five patients. The sensitivities in the CT detection of direct spread to the liver of less than 2 cm, more than 2 cm, the extrahepatic bile duct, and the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas were 65%, 100%, 50%, and 57%, respectivelyFor detecting the spread of gallbladder carcinoma, CT imaging has low to moderate sensitivity however, CT imaging can help in determining resectability and in planning the treatment, especially in advanced-stage gallbladder carcinoma, because of a high positive predictive value.
