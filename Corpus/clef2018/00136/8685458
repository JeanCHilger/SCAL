Carcinoma of the pancreas. Typical and atypical aspects using midfield-strength magnetic resonance. Until few years ago, MR assessment of pancreatic carcinoma was thought to be feasible only with high-strength equipment, but today also low- and midfield units allow pancreatic lesion detection, thanks to parameter optimization. The authors retrospectively analyzed the MR findings of 57 patients examined with a midfield MR unit all the patients had clinically suspected pancreatic carcinoma, which was confirmed in 54 cases. The lesions were more easily detected using T1-weighted sequences, thanks to their high intrinsic contrast, while T2-weighted sequences often confirmed the glandular changes already depicted by T1-weighted sequences. MRI correctly depicted vascular and lymph node involvement and detected liver metastases with no i.v. contrast agent injection. The only limitations of this technique are the unfeasibility of MR exams of diagnostic value in uncooperative patients (5% of cases) and the very similar MR features of parenchymal scars, due to previous acute pancreatitis, to those of pancreatic carcinoma. In conclusion, CT remains the gold standard in the study of pancreatic cancers, but midfield strength MRI, if correctly performed, can be proposed as a complementary tool to CT, especially in questionable cases and in the patients with known reactions to iodinated contrast agents.
