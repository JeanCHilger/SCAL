Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas: CT and MR findings. Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas is a very rare low-grade malignant neoplasm with only 126 cases reported in the literature and seen mostly in young female patients. Surgical excision means cure in cases before malignant degeneration developed. Its characteristic findings are typical location in the tail of the pancreas, peripheral capsule formation, hypodensity on CT images, and hyperintense internal signal characteristics on T1-weighted MR images secondary to hemorrhage and accumulation of methemoglobine molecule. These findings are enough for the preoperative diagnosis that may lead to early surgery and cure. We present the CT and MR findings of this very rare neoplasm in a case report.
