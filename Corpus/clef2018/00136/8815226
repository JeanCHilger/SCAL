A case of intrapancreatic duodenal duplication communicating with the biliopancreatic channel. Intestinal duplications are rare and are usually diagnosed in the first two years of infancy. They can occur at any level of the alimentary tract from the oral cavity to the anus. Duodenal duplication accounts for approximately 7% of all intestinal duplications. A previously healthy 4-year 6-month old boy was admitted with progressive increasing vomiting. Physical examination was normal, the serum amylase level was moderately increased. Upper gastrointestinal series showed an extrinsic compression defect of the proximal duodenum. Ultrasonography showed a 3 cm diameter cyst in the head of the pancreas. A duplication was suggested. Helical CT cholangiography showed a communication between duplication and the biliopancreatic common channel. The biliary tree was normal. Surgical resection of the intrapancreatic lesion was performed. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed a duodenal duplication.
