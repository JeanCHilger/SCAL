Fast MR imaging techniques: impact in the abdomen. The increased efficiency of MRI data acquisition has had a substantial impact on clinical MRI of the abdomen. Five particular applications that have thus been affected include breath-hold imaging of liver lesions (including detection, characterization, and biopsy), MR cholangiopan- creatography, practical chemical shift imaging (including liver and adrenal glands), dynamic imaging after contrast media injection, and MR angiography.
