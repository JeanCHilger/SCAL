Value of new diagnostic aids in relation to the disease process in pancreatic cancer. An assessment was made of the diagnostic value of six tests done on 28 patients who proved to have resectable and 45 patients who had non-resectable pancreatic cancer. Ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were the most sensitive tests for the diagnosis of resectable tumours. Ultrasonography was slightly, and cytology definitely, better for the diagnosis of resectable tumours than for the diagnosis of non-resectable tumours. Computerised tomography, angiography, and scintigraphy were not effective means of diagnosing resectable tumours. The differences in diagnostic sensitivities of the tests for resectable and non-resectable disease are probably due to variations in pathological features which influence not only the stage of presentation, but also the detectability of the tumour. As long as investigation is limited to patients with symptoms, a large proportion of tumours will not be diagnosed at a resectable stage. However, the results of this study suggest that the resectability rate may be maximised by the early use of ultrasonography in patients with symptoms suggesting cancer in the region of the head of the pancreas, and in patients with vague, non-specific complaints. A combination of ERCP and direct ductal aspiration for cytology is the best means of diagnosing resectable tumours.
