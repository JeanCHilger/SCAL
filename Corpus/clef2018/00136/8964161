Noninvasive mucinous cystic pancreas carcinoma with a 16-year course. A 26-year-old woman was operated on because of a suspected infectious pseudocyst of the pancreas. A large cyst was found on the body of the pancreas. During laparotomy a biopsy specimen was taken from the cystic wall, but no evidence of a tumor was obtained. On the basis of these intraoperative findings, a cystogastrostomy was performed and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. The patient presented 8 years later with a recurrent cyst and was operated. As there was a suspicion of a cystic neoplasm, total resection of the cyst was performed. Based on the histological findings a noninvasive mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas was diagnosed. We believe that from the beginning this cyst was a noninvasive mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Following the complete resection the clinical course was favorable for 8 more years without evidence of recurrence or metastases.
