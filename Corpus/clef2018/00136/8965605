Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic pseudocysts with mediastinal extension are a rare clinical entity. The pseudocysts traverse the diaphragma by way of the esophageal hiatus or by erosion directly through the diaphragma. Although the predominant clinical manifestations are related to the chest, proper management should include laparotomy and cystenteric anastomoses. In some cases the mediastinal components rapidly disappear without any specifically treatment.
