Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas. Report of a case with diagnosis by fine needle aspiration cytology. Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas is a distinct clinicopathologic entity. It has a benign clinical course, and surgical resection can be curative.A 17-year-old female presented with a mass measuring about 12 cm in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed papillae with a central fibrovascular core and lined with many layers of bland-appearing cells exhibiting nuclear grooving. These features, along with ultrasound and computed tomographic findings, led to an accurate preoperative diagnosis.In the setting of typical clinical and radiologic findings, it is possible to make a correct preoperative diagnosis by FNAC. Doing so has important implications for management.
