Computed tomography and ultrasonography in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases. Seventy three percutaneous punctures and catheter drainages were performed in 68 patients in 1992-1996. Visual control under CT was made in 32 patient and that under ultrasonography in 41. Diagnostic aspiration fine-needle biopsies of pancreatic lesions in 33 patients shower 5 adenocarcinomas, 2 cysts with signs of malignancy, 2 pseudocysts, 1 pancreatic adenoma, 23 chronic pancreatitis. Percutaneous catheter drainage in 15 patients with pyogenic complications of acute pancreatitis yielded good results. Successful external drainages of pyogenic pancreatic pseudocysts followed by sclerotherapy were made in 21 patients. There were recurrent cysts in 2 patients. This method is effective and safe for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases and should be widely put into clinical practice.
