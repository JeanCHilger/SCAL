The diagnostic performance of echography and CT in pancreatic diseases producing extrahepatic cholestasis. A hundred and fifty patients with jaundice and analytical suspicion of extrahepatic cholestasis were studied prospectively history, laboratory investigation and ultrasound examination were realized. Computerized tomography was performed in 146 patients. Ultrasonography and computerized tomography findings were confirmed by CPRE o CPTH and surgery. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 92.6% while that of computerized tomography was 87.2% for the identification of dilated biliary ducts. The accuracy of ultrasonography was higher than the one obtained in computerized tomography in cholangiocarcinoma (sensitivity: 77.7%) and gallbladder carcinoma (sensitivity: 100%). Computerized tomography recognized choledocholithiasis (sensitivity: 83.3%) and ampullary carcinoma (sensitivity: 88.8%) with better accuracy. However for pancreatic carcinoma (sensitivity: 88.8%) and pancreatitis (sensitivity: 83.3%) both examinations had the same accuracy.
