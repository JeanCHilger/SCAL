From the Archives of the AFIP. Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: radiologic-pathologic correlation. Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare primary tumors. They have pathologic and clinical similarities to biliary cystadenomas of the liver and mucinous cystic tumors of the ovary. Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas typically affect middle-aged women and arise in the tail of the pancreas. Gross pathologic and imaging features usually are those of a large, multilocular cystic mass. There is, however, a spectrum of radiologic findings that overlaps with those of other entities including pancreatic pseudocyst, other primary epithelial and nonepithelial tumors of the pancreas, and metastases. In most cases, ultrasound and computed tomography are the mainstays for radiologic evaluation, with magnetic resonance imaging having a complementary role. All mucinous cystic neoplasms should be considered as mucinous cystadenocarcinomas of low-grade malignant potential. Complete surgical excision alone results in an excellent clinical outcome and disease-free survival, irrespective of histologic or radiologic parameters in over 90% of cases studied.
