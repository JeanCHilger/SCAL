Techniques of MRI cholangiopancreatography. History, current status and future prospects. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a recent, non invasive, diagnostic modality capable of producing high quality images of biliary and pancreatic ducts. On the basis of the literature and our experience, we report the history and the current status of this new technology, including 2D, 3D and single shot fast spin echo sequences. As perspectives echo-planar imaging and functional imaging are discussed.
