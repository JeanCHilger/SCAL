Pancreatic fluid collections: diagnosis and endoscopic management. Pancreatitis may be acute or chronic, mild or severe. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis remains the most serious form of acute pancreatitis and accounts for the majority of complications. Although there is an established nomenclature for pancreatitis and pancreatic fluid collections, such as pancreatic pseudocysts, it is not widely understood or recognized by gastroenterologists. Because the management options for the treatment of pancreatic fluid collections continues to evolve with an increased use of endoscopic therapy, gastroenterologists will be increasingly called on to treat patients with pancreatitis and its complications. This article addresses and summarizes pancreatic fluid collections and their management, with an emphasis on endoscopic drainage.
