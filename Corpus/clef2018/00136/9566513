Pancreatic duct stenting in benign pancreatic disease. The ability to place endoscopic stents into the pancreatic duct has led to a dramatic increase in stent therapy for benign pancreatic diseases, particularly chronic pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. The overall effectiveness of this therapy remains unknown. This article critically reviews the available literature with a focus on patient selection, efficacy, and risk. The risk of pancreatic duct stenting is only now beginning to be appreciated, and clinicians must understand not only the potential effectiveness of pancreatic duct stenting but also the magnitude of the potential risk when considering this therapy.
