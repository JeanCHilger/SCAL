Carcinoma arising from ectopic pancreas in the stomach: endosonographic detection of malignant change. We present a case of a submucosal tumor in the stomach that was suspicious for malignancy on preoperative endosonography. The resected tumor was histologically diagnosed as a ductal adenocarcinoma that originated in ectopic pancreatic tissue in the gastric wall. Although malignant transformation in ectopic pancreas is extremely rare, it remains an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of gastric submucosal masses.
