Lipomas of the pancreas. The purpose of this study was to describe the CT findings of pancreatic lipomas in four patients.In all four cases, the lipoma was revealed incidentally on CT scans obtained for other reasons. CT scans were diagnostic, showing well-circumscribed masses within the pancreas composed almost entirely of fat, with a few scattered vessels or septa or both, which ranged in size from 1.4 x 2.0 cm to 4.5 x 5.3 cm in the axial plane. Pancreatic lipomas are rare, usually incidental tumors and, as with lipomas found elsewhere in the body, conservative management is often indicated.
