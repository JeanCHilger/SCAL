Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms associated with celiac axis stenosis due to compression by median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus. Celiac axis stenosis is frequently associated with pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms. Although the cause of stenosis was not clear in most of the reported cases, compression of the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm was found to be responsible for the stenosis in 7 of 42 reported cases of this type of aneurysm. We report a case of aneurysm caused by compression of the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm and celiac plexus. An asymptomatic 43-year-old Japanese man was admitted with a low echoic lesion in the uncus of pancreas. Computed tomographic scan and angiogram revealed stenosis of the celiac axis and two aneurysms in the inferior posterior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The celiac plexus and median arcuate ligament were divided surgically and normal flow was reestablished in the celiac axis. One of the aneurysms was resected and the afferent artery of the other aneurysm was ligated. In the setting of pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm associated with celiac axis stenosis, management of stenosis should be considered in addition to local treatment of the aneurysm. In this context, division of median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus or aorto-celiac bypass may normalize the flows in the pancreaticoduodenal arcade and could be effective in preventing aneurysm reformation.
