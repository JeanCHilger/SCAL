Two synchronous solid and cystic tumors of the pancreas. We report a 17-year-old woman who had two synchronous solid and cystic tumors of the pancreas (SCTP) detected by abdominal echography and computed tomography. There was a 6 x 5 cm mass in the pancreatic body and a 3 x 3 cm mass in the tail, with the two lesions being separate. No distal metastases were detected. The resected tumors consisted of solid and cystic components and both were well demarcated with fibrous capsules. The larger tumor was predominantly solid and the smaller one was mostly hemorrhagic. On microscopy, the tumor cells were small, eosinophilic, and arranged, in part, like pseudorosettes. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for alpha-1 antitrypsin, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. The final diagnosis was SCTP arising synchronously and independently at two sites. As far as we know, only one case of multicentric SCTP has been reported previously. Local recurrence of SCTP suggests the possibility of multicentric occurrence, and we believe that reports of such cases may increase in the future with advances in echography and computed tomography.
