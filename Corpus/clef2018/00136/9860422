A newly recognized entity: intraductal "oncocytic" papillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas are increasingly recognized, and their characteristic endoscopic and radiological features are well reported in the literature in recent years. Oncocytic features in these tumors are uncommon and unrecognized. Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm is a distinct pancreatic tumor and is a recently recognized entity. We report a case of a 69-yr-old patient who presented with symptoms mimicking pancreatitis, resulting in delay in the diagnosis of her pancreatic tumor. She underwent a successful Whipple's procedure and subsequently has remained well. The resected specimen showed an intraductal oncocytic papillary-mucinous neoplasm. The entity is new and the literature information is inadequate at present to judge the biological behavior of this tumor. We discuss this recently recognized entity.
