A case of microcystic cystadenoma treated by duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas constitute about 9% of all cystic lesions of the pancreas and less than 1% of all pancreatic neoplasms. The case of a 70 years-old woman with microcystic cystadenoma is reported. CT-scan of the abdomen diagnosed a 5 cm multilocular septated cyst, with calcifications in the context, localized in the head-uncinate process of the pancreas. The mass was well separated by a sharp cleavage plane with portal vein and superior mesenteric vessels. An ERCP showed cephalic symmetrical stenosis (diameter 3 mm) of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), mildly dilated in the remaining tract (diameter 6 mm). An intraoperative biopsy of the cystic wall was performed. Therefore, it was decided to proceed with a duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas (DPPHR), including the stenosis tract of the MPD in the surgical specimen. The reconstructive procedure consisted, by i.v. jejunal loop transposition, in a side-to-side pancreatico-jejunostomy, including in the anastomosis both corpocaudal stump and the resection cavity of the pancreatic head, and an end-to-side Roux-en-Y jejuno-jejunostomy. With respect to long-lasting pain relief and preservation of the endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas, DPPHR is a highly effective surgical procedure with a low early and late morbidity and mortality due to limited surgical resection. This technique, introduced into surgical practice by Beger, is indicated in patients with chronic pancreatitis with an inflammatory mass in the head of the pancreas. The authors conclude that this procedure can be performed also in case of pancreatic benign tumors, as microcystic cystadenoma. Advantages of this technique makes DPPHR an attractive alternative to Pylorus-Preserving-Pancreatico-Duodenectomy (PPPD).
