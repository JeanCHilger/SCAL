Gastric aberrant pancreas: EUS analysis in comparison with the histology. Histologic diagnosis of aberrant pancreas is usually difficult when tissue samples are obtained with a standard biopsy forceps. The aim of this study was to describe the endosonographic (EUS) features of gastric aberrant pancreas.EUS was performed in 10 patients with aberrant pancreas before resection. EUS features of the lesions were analyzed and compared with resected specimens retrospectively.EUS in 5 lesions (50%) demonstrated the ectopic pancreatic tissue as located in the third and fourth sonographic layers (submucosa and muscularis propria) and in the third layer (submucosa) in the other 5 lesions. The margin appeared for the most part indistinct (80%) because of the lobular structure of the acinous tissue. The internal echo pattern in all cases was heterogeneous, mainly a hypoechoic image (acinous tissue) accompanied by scattered small hyperechoic areas (adipose tissue). An anechoic area (duct dilatation) (80%) and fourth-layer thickening (muscular hypertrophy) (80%) were commonly visualized.Gastric aberrant pancreas has characteristic EUS features that correlate with specific histologic components and is variable with regard to sonographic layer of origin.
