Experience with staging laparoscopy in pancreatic malignancy. The role of diagnostic laparoscopy in the staging of abdominal malignancies is not well defined.We retrospectively reviewed the usefulness of diagnostic laparoscopy as a staging procedure in pancreatic malignancy. This experience between February 1988 and May 1997 involves 109 cases of suspected or proven pancreatic malignancy. All laparoscopies were performed with the patient under conscious sedation and local anesthesia in an endoscopy suite.Of the 109 patients with pancreatic cancer, 45 (42%) had metastatic disease. The use of computed tomography (CT) alone revealed the existence of liver metastases in 10 of 109 (9%) patients, which were confirmed laparoscopically. The further use of laparoscopy identified metastases in 29 more cases: hepatic, 23 hepatic and peritoneal, 3In patients with a negative CT for metastases, laparoscopic identification of metastases avoided unnecessary laparotomy in 29 of 99 (29%) patients with pancreatic cancer. Staging laparoscopy is indicated in all cases of pancreatic malignancy before an attempt at a surgical cure.
