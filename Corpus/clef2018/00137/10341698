Computed tomography in abdominal tuberculosis. The diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis is often difficult because of its protean clinical manifestations and non-specific laboratory investigations. In the abdomen, tuberculosis may affect the intestinal tract, lymph nodes, peritoneum and solid viscera in varying combinations. CT, with its ability to provide a comprehensive overview of abdominal structures, is the imaging modality of choice for evaluation of such patients. This pictorial review illustrates the spectrum of CT appearances of abdominal tuberculosis which includes intestinal, lymph nodal, peritoneal, mesenteric, hepatic, splenic and pancreatic disease.
