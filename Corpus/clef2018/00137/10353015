Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas. Pathology report of 13 cases. Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are exceptional. The aims of our study were to reevaluate the mode of presentation of these tumors and to analyze the role of pathological examination in diagnostic assessment and prognostic evaluation.We report the clinical, radiological and pathological findings in a retrospective series of 13 patients in whom a diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas was made between 1983 and 1997. There were 12 females (median age: 22.5 years) and one male, aged 73.The tumor was discovered incidentally (3 cases) or because of nonspecific digestive symptoms (10 cases). Biological data were uninformative. The tumor was pancreatic in 12 cases and duodenal in 1. In all cases, imaging techniques showed an heterogeneous lesion with no or poor vascularization. A cystic component was identified in 4 cases. Surgical resection was performed in all cases. Pathological examination showed an encapsulated tumor in 8 cases, a non-encapsulated but well-limited lesion in 3 cases and an infiltrative tumor in 2 cases. At the time of diagnosis, multiple liver metastases were present in 1 case. Mean duration of follow-up was 24 months (range: 3-168). At last follow-up, all patients, including the patient with synchronous metastatic disease, were alive, without local recurrence.Our study confirms that most cases of solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas present with a suggestive clinical picture, including their occurrence in young women and their good prognosis after surgical resection. However, our results also underline the occurrence of cases presenting with unusual features, including old age, male sex, extra-pancreatic localization and malignant evolution. Histopathological examination is essential for the establishment of the diagnosis but morphological data are of little prognostic value.
