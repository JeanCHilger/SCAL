Endoscopic ultrasonography: changes of chronic pancreatitis in asymptomatic and symptomatic alcoholic patients. Changes suggestive of chronic pancreatic damage by endoscopic ultrasonography were studied in 31 asymptomatic and symptomatic alcohol abusers. Fifteen additional patients who did not drink alcohol served as controls. Eighty-nine percent (17 of 19) of the alcohol abusers with chronic abdominal pain had chronic pancreatitis by endoscopic ultrasonography. Similarly, 58%, (7 of 12) asymptomatic alcoholic patients also had changes of chronic pancreatitis on endosonography. Endoscopic ultrasonography has thus detected changes suggestive of alcohol-induced chronic pancreatic damage in up to 58% of asymptomatic alcoholic persons and in 89% of alcoholic persons with pancreatic type pain.
