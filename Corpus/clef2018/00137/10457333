Fungal pseudotumor masquerading as pancreatic cancer-a sequela of new technology? Fungal infection resulting in chronic pancreatitis is rare. We report a case of chronic pancreatitis due to fungal infection causing common bile duct obstruction and abdominal pain mimicking pancreatic cancer. Treatment included resection to cure the pain and rule out malignancy. Long-term effects of fungal infection may be seen more frequently as total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and foreign bodies (e.g., stents, drains, central venous catheters) are more often being used in the treatment of many diseases.
