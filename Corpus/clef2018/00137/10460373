Papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas in a teenage boy. We present a case of a 13-year-old boy with a left-sided abdominal mass which proved to be a papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. This low-grade malignant lesion of young patients is very rare, and exceedingly rare in males. The prognosis following resection of this tumor is good. We present the ultrasound and computed tomographic picture of this lesion, as well as the gross and microscopic pathology.
