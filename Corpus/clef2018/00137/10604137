"MAURITIUS": tumour dose in patients with advanced carcinoma. Radioimaging of various human tumours by means of somatostatin analogues and vasoactive intestinal peptide has been introduced into clinical practice in recent years. The finding that human tumours express various subtypes of somatostatin receptors has led to the development and characterization of a novel peptide tracer, termed MAURITIUS. MAURITIUS identifies a broad range of somatostatin receptors with high binding affinity, and somatostatin receptor 1 with low binding affinity. In order to evaluate patients for tumour radiotherapy with 90Y-MAURITIUS, tumour dose calculation is performed with 111In-MAURITIUS [111In-DOTA-lanreotide]. Treatment is initiated in patients presenting a tumour uptake of > or = 10 Gy/GBq (i.e., standard dose for 1 treatment cycle with 90Y-MAURITIUS). In 25 patients with advanced cancer refractory to conventional antineoplastic treatment 111In-MAURITIUS (approximately 150 MBq 10 nmol/patient), scintigraphy and dosimetry was performed. Dosimetry data were calculated based on scintigraphic results as well as urine, faeces and blood data. In all patients, at least one tumour site was visualized during the initial few minutes of application. Additional tumour sites not seen on conventional imaging (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging bone scan) could be detected in 6 patients with carcinoids, one patient with prostate cancer and one patient with lymphoma. Liver metastases were visualized in all patients with gastrointestinal cancers, while the primary tumour was not detected in 2 patients with pancreatic, and in 1 patient with rectal, cancer. The calculated radiation dose for tumours and/or metastases ranged between 3-60 Gy/GBq for 90Y-MAURITIUS. MAURITIUS is a universal receptor ligand for a large variety of different human tumours, and is suitable for treatment when labelled with 90Y.
