Problems inherent in the diagnosis and treatment of common bile duct calculi during video-laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Report on 700 cases, February 1991 to December 1997. Conditions of predictivity seem to make treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones during VLC more safe and adequate. IV cholangiography (or, nowadays, MRI and echoendoscopy) drive to a selective use of ERCP and cholangiography, help to reduce the incidence of residual lithiasis and give a "topographical map" of the CBD that can be useful, during VLC, in the search of the hilum structures, especially when the anatomical situation is not clear.
