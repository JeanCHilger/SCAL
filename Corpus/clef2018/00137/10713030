Pancreaticopleural fistula: diagnosis with magnetic resonance pancreatography. Pancreaticopleural fistula secondary to chronic pancreatitis is a rare cause of recurrent pleural effusion. The demonstration of the fistula with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and CT is invasive or limited. We report in two patients the use of magnetic resonance pancreatography as a noninvasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography for the diagnosis of pancreaticopleural fistula.
