Radiologic diagnosis of different forms of acute pancreatitis. By using their data on 123 patients with different forms of pancreatitis, the authors describe the ultrasound and computed tomographic semiotics of this condition. The authors consider ultrasonography and computed tomography to be highly informative in diagnosing different forms of the disease and its complications. Both methods not only assess the pancreatic parenchyma, the extent of the process to the adjacent anatomic structures, but permit a follow-up and diagnostic and treatment measures under their visual guidance.
