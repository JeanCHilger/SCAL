Invasive interventions guided by computerized tomography in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the internal organs. Diagnostic punctures under CT guidance were made in 544 patients with diseases of the chest (n = 303), abdomen (n = 149), and retroperitoneal space (n = 92). In 87 patients, diagnostic punctures were combined with therapeutical manipulations and included aspiration and drainage of visceral organ cysts and abscesses. The proposed procedure of diagnostic biopsies under CT guidance could ascertain the morphological nature of a lesion in 90.1% of cases prior to treatment. Therapeutical aspirations and drainage of visceral cysts and abscesses under CT guidance resulted in their complete recovery in 97.8 and 85.7% of cases, respectively. Diagnostic and therapeutical interventions under CT guidance caused complications in 6.9% of cases. At diagnostic biopsy, pneumothorax is the most frequent complication *5.3%), and lung tissue hemorrhage along the puncture needle passage is the less frequent (1.3%). The use of therapeutical interventions developed complications in 1.1% of cases.
