Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors.Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micro-cystic, 2 oligo-microcystic) was found. Only 6 (50%) patients had symptoms. The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm. Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable. All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed. No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.
