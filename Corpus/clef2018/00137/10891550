The detection of telomerase activity in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas by fine needle aspiration. Telomerase activation in differentiated cells is associated with cell immortalization. Detection of telomerase expression in cancer provides a potential biomarker to be evaluated in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients. Analysis of telomerase activity in biopsy specimens may serve as a useful marker for the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study was conducted to determine if telomerase could be detected in fine needle aspirates from patients with pancreatic carcinoma. The telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay was used to determine telomerase activity from pancreatic cancer cell lines, paired tumor/normal human pancreatic tissues and specimens obtained at the time of diagnostic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies. In this report, we demonstrate that: i) telomerase activity is present in pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer specimens, but absent in matched adjacent areas of normal pancreatic tissues ii) telomerase activity is present in FNA samples obtained at the time of CT-guided FNA of pancreatic adenocarcinomas
