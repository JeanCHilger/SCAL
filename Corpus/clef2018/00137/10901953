Imaging of the normal and abnormal pancreaticobiliary system with single-shot MR cholangiopancreatography: a pictorial review. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a rapidly evolving non-invasive imaging modality that produces images of the pancreatic duct and biliary tree without the need for intravenous or oral contrast. The images are equivalent to those from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), but the non-invasive acquisition avoids the morbidity and mortality associated with diagnostic ERCP. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is indicated in patients who require only a diagnostic ERCP, who fail an ERCP or who are unable to undergo ERCP due to altered post-surgical anatomy. Other evolving indications include triaging of patients with obstructive jaundice into percutaneous or endoscopic management drainage pathways depending on the site, length and nature of the duct obstruction, thereby potentially decreasing the number of failed or unsuccessful ERCP. Pre-operative identification of anomalous biliary anatomy and choledocholithiasis prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy promise to modify the pre-operative and operative management of the patient in order to minimize the risk of duct injury and unnecessary intra-operative dissection and cholangiography. The advantages of the technique include its non-invasiveness, the absence of contrast administration, its relative operator independence and the ability to evaluate both sides of an obstructed duct, thereby accurately evaluating stricture morphology and length. The disadvantages of MRCP compared to ERCP include its lack of an immediate therapeutic solution to duct obstruction, procedural cost, unit availability and the inability to evaluate patients with pacemakers or ferromagnetic implants.
