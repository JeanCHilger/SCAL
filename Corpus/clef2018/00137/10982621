Spindle cell carcinoma of the pancreas. We experienced a rare case of spindle cell carcinoma of the pancreas. The patient was a 74-year-old man who complained of abdominal pain and loss of weight. Ultrasonographic scans revealed a hypoechoic solid mass in the head of the pancreas, 4 cm in diameter, with a high echoic spot suggestive of central necrosis or hemorrhage. The mass was hypodense on enhanced computed tomographic scans and hypovascular on angiograms. At laparotomy, the tumor had invaded to the mesocolon, but dissemination and distant metastasis were not found. We therefore performed pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy and ascending colectomy. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 26 after an uneventful recovery. Two months later, he was readmitted because of ascites, with positivity of spindle cells shown on cytology he died on day 92 after surgery. In the resected specimen, the tumor had a mostly sarcomatous component, consisting of spindle-shaped cells, and a small glandular component. Immunohistochemically, both components were positive for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen, but negative for vimentin and desmin. The tumor was diagnosed as a spindle cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Perineural invasion, lymphatic permeation, and blood vessel invasion were found, but lymph node metastasis was not found. Although a curative operation was performed, the outcome in this patient was very poor.
