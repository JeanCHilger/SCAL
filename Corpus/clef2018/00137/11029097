Abdominal tuberculous lymphadenopathy: MR imaging findings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic tool in abdominal tuberculous lymphadenopathy.MRI studies of 11 patients with histologically proven abdominal tuberculous lymphadenopathy were reviewed with regard to anatomic distribution, size, shape, degree, and pattern of enhancement and relation of the lesions to adjacent structures.The most common site of involvement was the periportal area (n = 6), followed by the peripancreatic (n = 5), mesenteric (n = 1), and paraaortic (n = 1) areas. Eight patients were readily diagnosed as having tuberculous lymphadenopathy on abdominal computed tomography. Three patients had a heterogeneously enhancing masslike lesion adjacent to the pancreas and were initially diagnosed as having cystic tumor of the pancreas. On MRI, 11 lesions showed T1 iso- or hypointensity and central T2 hyperintensity. Two lesions showed T1 iso- or hypointensity and central T2 hypointensity. The lesions with different T2 signal intensities showed different patterns of enhancement on contrast-enhanced dynamic studies. The relations between the enlarged lymph nodes and adjacent bile ducts or vascular structures were well depicted on MRI.MRI was useful in differentiating enlarged lymph nodes abutting the pancreas initially diagnosed as cystic neoplasms on abdominal computed tomography.
