Pancreaticobiliary diseases. Comparison of 2D single-shot turbo spin-echo MR cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. To compare the diagnostic value of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to that of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the diagnosis of various obstructive and nonobstructive pancreaticobiliary diseases.We retrospectively reviewed 153 patients who had undergone both MRCP and ERCP Breath-hold, heavily T2-weighted images using 2D single-shot turbo spin-echo technique were obtained. MRCP and ERCP results were correlated with the final clinical diagnoses. Accuracy of MRCP and ERCP in the diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary diseases, detecting the cause and site of biliary obstruction, if present, and distinguishing malignant from benign cause of obstruction were compared.Success rates of MRCP and ERCP were 98.7% and 89.5%, respectively. The accuracy of MRCP and ERCP in detecting the site of biliary obstruction was 89.7% and 96.2%, and in detecting the cause of biliary obstruction 69.2% and 71.8%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for positive and negative tests for MRCP and ERCP in distinguishing malignant biliary obstruction from benign causes were 86.4%, 82.4%, 4.9, 0.2 and 88.6%, 94.1%, 15.1, 0.1, respectively. Concordance between the two tests was 91% (kappa coefficient 0.82, standard error of kappa 0.113, p<0.001). In the group of nonobstructive biliary diseases, accuracy of MRCP and ERCP in detecting cholecystolithiasis were 100% and 73.7%, and in detecting pancreatitis 57% and 14%, respectively.2D single-shot turbo spin-echo MRCP can be performed as a complement to ERCP and can replace ERCP in high-risk patients and in case of unsuccessful cannulation.
