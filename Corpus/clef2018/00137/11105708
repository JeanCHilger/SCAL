Fat replacement with absence of acinar and ductal structure in the pancreatic body and tail. We report an unusual case of fat replacement of the pancreatic body and tail. Findings on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and ERCP could be confused with dorsal pancreas agenesis. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed massive fat replacement with complete absence of the acinar and ductal tissue and scattered islets of Langerhans.
