Papillary solid tumor of the pancreas in a child: a case report. We present a case of a papillary solid neoplasm of the head of the pancreas incidentally diagnosed after an abdominal trauma in a thirteen year old boy. Imaging features (US, CT) of the lesion were not specific enough to permit a precise diagnosis with certainty. Preoperative percutaneous needle biopsy can give presumptive evidence which may guide the treatment. Prognosis is fairly better than other pancreatic neoplasms in children (particularly pancreatoblastoma). Treatment relies only on surgery.
