CT criteria for venous invasion in patients with pancreatic head carcinoma. The purpose of the study was to evaluate CT criteria for venous invasion in patients with potentially resectable carcinoma of the pancreatic head, with surgical and histopathological correlation. In 113 patients evaluated with spiral CT for suspected pancreatic head carcinoma, several CT criteria for venous invasion were scored prospectively for the portal vein (PV) and the superior mesenteric vein (SMV): length of tumour contact with PV/SMV (0 mm, < 5 mm, > 5 mm) circumferential involvement of the vein (0 degree, 0-90 degrees, 90-180 degrees, > 180 degrees)
