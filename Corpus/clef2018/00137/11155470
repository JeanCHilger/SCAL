NMR cholangiography in the diagnostic algorithm of candidates to video laparocholecystectomy. High resolution magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non invasive imaging modality for depicting the pancreatobiliary tree. It can demonstrate dilation, stenosis and intraductal filling defects of both the biliary and the pancreatic duct. The imaging quality of high resolution MRCP is excellent. MRCP appears to be more effective and less invasive than endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to evaluate many pancreatic and biliary diseases as choledocholithiasis, malignant obstruction, incomplete or failed ERCP, postsurgical alterations of the biliary tract (as biliary-enteric anastomoses), sclerosing cholangitis, chronic pancreatitis, and congenital anomalies of the biliary and pancreatic duct.MRCP was performed in 21 non selected patients with suspected choledocholithiasis and demonstrated the presence of stones in the biliary tract in 5 of them. In these 5 patients sequential endoscopic-laparoscopic treatment was performed and confirmed in all cases the presence of stones in the biliary tree. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (VLC) and transcystic cholangiography was attempted in the restant 16 patients.Laparoscopic transcystic cholangiography confirmed in all cases the response of MRCP.MRCP has the potential to replace ERCP in the management of patients candidate to VLC with suspected choledocholithiasis.
