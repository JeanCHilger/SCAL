The accuracy of EUS and helical CT in the assessment of vascular invasion by peripapillary malignancy. The relative accuracy of helical CT and EUS for defining the local resectability of peripapillary malignancies is undefined.Fifty-one patients with a peripapillary malignancy and no metastatic disease were prospectively evaluated with helical CT and EUS. Imaging results were compared with surgical staging, and a tumor was defined as resectable when there was no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor.Nine patients had surgically confirmed locally unresectable disease, which was accurately predicted by EUS in 6 patients (sensitivity 67%) and by helical CT in 3 patients (sensitivity 33% p = 0.35). When only patients with complete EUS examinations were included, the sensitivities of EUS and helical CT for vascular invasion were 100% and 33% (p = 0.06), respectively. When all patients not undergoing surgery because of imaging evidence of locally unresectable disease were included, the sensitivities were 100% and 62.5% (p = 0.02), respectively. One of 15 patients with a tumor amenable to surgical resection was labeled as unresectable by EUS but subsequently had a local recurrence of the tumor. The specificities of EUS (93%) and helical CT (100%) were similar.EUS is more sensitive than helical CT for detecting vascular invasion by peripapillary malignancies and should be added to staging protocols, particularly when findings on helical CT are equivocal.
