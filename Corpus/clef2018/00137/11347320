Digestive system neoplasms originating from the autonomic nervous system. Diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic issues. The gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumors (GAN tumor) are uncommon stromal tumors of the intestinal tract and retroperitoneum. The distinction of GAN tumors from other gastrointestinal stromal tumors is based on electron microscopic findings. However further study of additional cases is needed to fully characterize both their gross and microscopic features and to further characterize the natural history of such tumors. In the present study we report two cases of GAN tumor that arose from the stomach and small intestinal with different prognostic evolution in two patients of 73 and 65 years old. They were both treated by surgery, but only one case was successful. In addition patient 1 aged 73, died 11 months after surgical treatment with liver metastases on CT. scan. Patient 2, is clinically well five years after surgical treatment.
