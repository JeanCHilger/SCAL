Imaging of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas: literature review. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) is defined as a syndrome consisting of dilatation of the main pancreatic duct and/or branch ducts associated with mucin overproduction. The purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of different imaging techniques (CT, EUS, ERCP) for determination of tumor invasion and pancreatic extension. Diagnosis often is delayed because it is confused with chronic pancreatitis or cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. It is difficult to rule out invasive malignancy. MRCP can be an essential imaging modality because it is a non-invasive technique. Intraductal ultrasound or pancreatoscopy could become in the future an additional useful preoperative procedure. A high frequency of invasive carcinoma in patients operated for pancreatic IPMT is observed. Surgical resection should be extended until a normal tissue margin is encountered.
