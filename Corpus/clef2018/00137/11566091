Imaging and localization of pancreatic insulinomas. For pancreatic insulinomas, the treatment of choice is surgical excision, which when successful is curative. Intraoperative palpation combined with ultrasonography theoretically depict almost all tumors, however the accuracy of palpation is improved by the preoperative localization. All recent advances in imaging have improved the likelihood for curative surgical resection. Our purpose is to demonstrate the characteristics of all modalities, which may be used in the preoperative localization algorithm.
