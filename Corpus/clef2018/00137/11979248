Influence of EUS training and pathology interpretation on accuracy of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic masses. Identification, staging, and fine needle aspiration of pancreatic mass lesions are probably the most technically demanding EUS skills. This study evaluated the effect of formal training on the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic masses and the source of the variability in diagnostic accuracy between initial and later procedures.Sixty-five patients with pancreatic masses underwent EUS-FNA between April 1998 (introduction of EUS-FNA) and August 1999, 20 of whom were examined by 3 endosonographers without prior experience with EUS-FNA. The initial experience of these 3 endosonographers (April to December 1998 group A patients), which included a formal training period of 2 months, and their later experience (January to August 1999After a short training period, there was a significant improvement in EUS-FNA accuracy (33% vs. 91% p = 0.004). After pathology review, good agreement was identified between original FNA interpretation and that on review (kappa = 0.78Significant improvements in EUS-FNA accuracy can be achieved with a short period of mentored training. EUS-FNA errors during the initial learning phase are primarily due to inadequate specimens. Interpretation of pancreatic EUS-FNA specimens remained consistent before and after training.
