Guidelines for management of patients with pancreatic cancer. The incidence of pancreatic cancer has fallen during the last ten years in Sweden. Early signs and symptoms of the disease are still undiscovered and when diagnosis is made the disease is incurable in most patients. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the first-line imaging test followed by spiral computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if required for definite diagnosis. Spiral CT is also the imaging test of choice for assessment of resectability of the tumor. Surgical removal of the tumor is the only chance of cure. Markedly improved hospital mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy is reported and an association between hospital volume and outcome of the operation has been established. Longterm survival after attempted curative resection continues to be dismal, however. Adjuvant treatment should not be given outside clinical studies. Palliative treatment has improved thanks to progress in the field of endoscopy, interventional radiology and in management of pain and nutrition. Palliative chemotherapy should only be given selectively outside clinical studies. Radiotherapy has no proven effects on survival. Special pancreatic cancer treatment teams with catchment areas of 2-4 million inhabitants are recommended by international authorities.
