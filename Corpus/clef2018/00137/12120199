Has blood glucose level measured on admission to hospital in a patient with acute pancreatitis any prognostic value? Early detection of pancreatic necrosis allows better management of the disease. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard for detecting pancreatic necrosis is expensive.This study was to evaluate for the first time whether blood glucose estimation on hospital admission--a simple, cheap, readily available laboratory parameter--may detect pancreatic necrosis and have prognostic value in acute pancreatitis.Single blood glucose estimation upon hospital admission was evaluated prospectively for detecting pancreatic necrosis and as a prognostic indicator. The study included 241 nondiabetic patients with a first attack of acute pancreatitis. All underwent CT within 72 h of admission.High blood glucose (> 125 mg/dl) correlated significantly with complex high clinical and biochemical prognostic scores (Ranson, Imrie), a high Balthazar score, pancreatic pseudocysts, and a long hospital stay, but not with organ failure, indication for artificial ventilation, dialysis, surgery, length of intensive care, and mortality. Pancreatic necrosis detection sensitivity of high blood glucose was 83%, specificity 49%, positive predictive value 28%, and negative predictive value 92%.A patient with normal blood glucose on admission is unlikely to have pancreatic necrosis. Contrast-enhanced CT would not be needed unless the patient fails to improve.
