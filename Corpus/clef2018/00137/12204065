Carcinosarcoma of the pancreas: a case report and review of the literature. We report the case of a 74-year-old white man with a mass in the head of the pancreas, which was found incidentally on computerized tomographic scan during a workup for deep vein thrombosis. Endoscopy with pancreatic duct brushings yielded a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. A pancreaticoduodenectomy followed, with complete resection of the tumor. Pathologic examination showed 2 distinct components. One component was a conventional infiltrating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and the other component was high-grade sarcoma with features of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. To our knowledge, this carcinosarcoma is the seventh reported case of a primary pancreatic neoplasm with mixed carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements.
