Successful catheter-guided local thrombolysis in acute pulmonary embolism in the early postoperative period after pancreatic head resection. Pulmonary embolism in the early postoperative period is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Systemic application of thrombolytic agents during this time is contraindicated operative thrombectomy also has a high mortality rate. We report a case of successful local lysis in combination with catheter fragmentation of a massive two-sided pulmonary embolism diagnosed on the 4th postoperative day after pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy for distal carcinoma of the common bile duct. Thrombolysis was performed in three sessions by a combination of catheter-supported interventional fragmentation of the thrombus with local rt-PA lysis. There were no bleeding complications or disturbances of anastomotic healing. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 23rd postoperative day after changing anticoagulation to a vitamin K antagonist. The case presented demonstrates the possibility of local lysis in combination with interventional methods as a therapeutic option for pulmonary embolism in the early postoperative period as an alternative to surgical strategies.
