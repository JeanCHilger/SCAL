Pancreatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma: report of three cases. The pancreas is an uncommon site of metastasis from renal cell carcinoma.Three observations are described in this review which is aimed at reporting recent data on diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic features of this kind of metastasis 0: The average space of time between nephrectomy and the diagnosis of the metastasis was 16 years. They have been fortuitously discovered in 2 cases, in patients who did not complain of any pancreatic symptom, during abdominal ultrasonography done for another reason. In the third case, pancreatic symptoms led to the diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was useful to diagnose multiple lesions misdiagnosed on CT-scan or MRI imaging. EUS patterns are characteristic, but histological and cytological examinations of EUS-guided needle biopsies are difficult to study according to the hypervascularized character of these metastasis.The diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis must be suggested for patients suffering from a pancreatic mass with a previous medical history of late renal cell carcinoma. According to their hypervascularized character, the negativity of EUS-guided needle biopsies could strongly direct the diagnosis. When surgery is possible, the survival rate is better than in primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma and is even better than in pancreatic metastasis from other sites.
