Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The fine art of bilio-pancreatic imaging. With the introduction of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography in the early 1970s, gastroenterologists have a lot of diagnostic options in the biliopancreatic system to their disposal. Meanwhile, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has become a competitive replacement for diagnostic ERCP with the advantage of avoiding complications related to endoscopic techniques. Mounting evidence suggests that both MRCP and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) have a profound influence of diagnostic algorithms in a variety of hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases.
