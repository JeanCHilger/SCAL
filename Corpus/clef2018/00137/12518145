Endoscopically inserted endoluminal receiver coil for high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas: Initial results in an animal model. This study assessed the feasibility of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas by means of an endoscopically inserted endoluminal magnetic resonance receiver coil.A 0.032-inch diameter internal magnetic resonance imaging receiver coil was endoscopically inserted into the pancreatic duct in 4 pigs through the accessory channel of a standard duodenoscope to obtain high-resolution magnetic resonance images by using T1- and T2-weighted sequences.The pig anatomy precluded the usual transoral approach however, transgastric access allowed endoscopic transpapillary insertion of a receiver coil into the pancreatic duct in all animals without the need for sphincterotomy. The small swine pancreas could then be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging with a 0.3 x 0.3-mm in-plane resolution.High-resolution pancreas magnetic resonance imaging is feasible by using an endoscopically inserted endoluminal receiver coil. The smaller stomach and larger pancreatic duct diameter in humans will facilitate clinical application of the imaging procedure.
