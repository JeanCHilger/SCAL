Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic injuries in children. Pancreatic injury after trauma can occur in the child as an isolated lesion after a minor injury. The consequences can be severe in the absence of prompt diagnosis and treatment. Determination of mechanism of injury, clinical examination, blood amylase levels and abdominal CT-scan are first line steps for the evaluation of the injury. ERCP and MRI can be useful tools to further document injury to the pancreatic duct. In the absence of duct injury, conservative treatment can be applied. For the other cases, the treatment is surgical although newer techniques may be applied in selected cases.
