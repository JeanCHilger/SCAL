Review article: Pancreatic function testing. Pancreatic function tests are most commonly used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis. These tests include tests which document exocrine or endocrine gland insufficiency and tests which instead measure gradations of decreased secretory capacity. The tests in the former category generally become abnormal when advanced, longstanding chronic pancreatitis is present. Tests in the latter category, however, have the potential to detect chronic pancreatitis at an earlier stage than other available diagnostic tests, including commonly used imaging tests such as computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. This potential advantage of diagnostic sensitivity is, however, counterweighed by the fact that these tests which measure stimulated secretory capacity are only available at a very few referral centres. This article will review the variety of pancreatic function tests and describe their rationale, accuracy, cost, and clinical usefulness.
