Cyst duplication of the colon in an adult. Case report. The cystic type of the enteric duplication has the same histological structure as the digestive tract and the same mucosal lining as the segment to which is attached. These are rare pathological conditions especially in an adult as they usually are diagnosed and treated in childhood. A 39 year-old women has been elective admitted in our unit complaining of upper abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass in epigastrium and left upper quadrant. The imagistic findings (abdominal ultrasound and CT scan) raise the suspicion of a pancreatic cystic lesion. Intraoperative we found a large cystic lesion localized in the transverse mezocolon close to the transverse colon. The resected specimen was examined histopatologically and found to be a cystic duplication of the colon. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery.
