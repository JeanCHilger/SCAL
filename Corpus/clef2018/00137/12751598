Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas: computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging features. The aim of this study was to analyze the computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas. The cases of eight patients with pathologically proven IPMT (1 papillary hyperplasia, 7 adenocarcinoma) of the pancreas were retrospectively reviewed. There were five men and three women with ages ranging from 42 to 82 years. Imaging studies included six thin-section dynamic CT scans, seven MRI scans, one MR cholangiopancreatography scan, and two endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography scans. There was only one benign IPMT, which presented as a unilocular cyst in the pancreatic body with no mural nodules and no dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD). All seven patients with malignant IPMT had multilocular cysts with papillary projections in the pancreatic head and/or uncinate process accompanied by dilated MPD (5 diffuse, 2 segmental). Communication between the cystic lesions and the MPD were evident in all seven patients. One patient had small mural nodules in the branch ducts of the pancreatic body and five had a bulging papilla with a patulous orifice. A mass effect resulting in biliary obstruction was shown in one patient. One patient had a ruptured cyst with mucin leakage into the right anterior pararenal space following sono-guided aspiration. In conclusion, the main imaging feature of IPMT in our patients was a multilocular cyst with papillary projections located in the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Although CT and MRI cannot differentiate mucin content from pancreatic juice, communication between the cystic lesion and the dilated MPD and a bulging papilla with a patulous orifice are characteristics of IPMT.
