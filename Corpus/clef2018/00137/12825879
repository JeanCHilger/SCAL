Intractable pruritus associated with insulinoma in the absence of multiple endocrine neoplasia: a novel paraneoplastic phenomenon. Insulinoma is a rare tumour, the main symptoms of which are related to hypoglycaemia. Generalized pruritus has been described in association with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN II or Sipple's syndrome) as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Further, pruritus is known to be part of the paraneoplastic syndrome in other solid tumours. This case describes a patient presenting with symptoms of Whipple's triad (hypoglycaemic symptoms during fasting, low fasting blood sugar levels and symptoms relieved by intravenous dextrose). Magnetic resonance scanning and selective mesenteric angiography demonstrated a probable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. Pituitary fossa imaging and endocrine profile excluded the MEN I syndrome. Symptoms resolved after surgical removal of the tumour. Histology confirmed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. The association between pruritus and insulinoma appears to be a novel paraneoplastic phenomenon.
