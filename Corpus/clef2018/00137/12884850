Weekly paclitaxel for a patient with advanced gastric cancer. A 56-year-old woman diagnosed with gastric cancer was admitted to our hospital for operation on May 15, 2001. The operation was performed on May 23. The tumor formed a large mass from the antrum to the head of the pancreas, and cancer cells were detected in the ascitic fluid microscopically. During the operation, resection was impossible, and so 100 mg of cisplatin (CDDP) was infused into the abdominal cavity. After the operation, she experienced continuous nausea and there was a discharge of 1200-1600 ml of digestive fluid per day from her nasogastric tube. On July 17, a new regimen, of 4-week courses of chemotherapy, with weekly administrations of 65 mg/m2 of paclitaxel, along with premedication for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest, was started. After the first of these 4-week courses, the discharge from her nasogastric tube decreased to 200-600 ml per day, and the tube was removed 78 days after insertion. Oral intake of food increased smoothly, and she was discharged on September 14. After another, short, hospitalization, she was discharged on October 20, and she has been coming to our outpatient clinic once a week. After paclitaxel was started, gastric fiberscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan showed reduction of the tumor. Of special note was the disappearance of a scitic fluid after two courses, rated as a "partial response" (Japanese classification). There was a decrease in hemoglobin, but neither leukocytopenia nor a decrease in platelets was found. Neuropathy was slight and no treatment was needed. Now, after 1 year, 11 courses of chemotherapy have been administered at the outpatient clinic. These results suggest weekly administration of paclitaxel to be a promising treatment for advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination. The therapeutic efficacy should be confirmed by further clinical trials.
