Severe colonic complications of pancreatic disease. Colonic involvement in pancreatic disorders is rare but potentially fatal. Extension of contiguous inflammation or neoplasm, autodigestive effects of enzymes, or dissection of a pseudocyst or abscess may involve the colon producing obstruction, perforation, hemorrhage, or abdominal pain.Nine patients with pancreatic disease requiring colonic resection were identified. Cases included pancreatic abscess producing colonic necrosis (2). pancreatic carcinoma invading the colon (3). extension of pancreatitis producing a colonic stricture (3). and pseudocyst eroding into the splenic flexure (1). Presentation was varied, including rectal bleeding (2). clinical deterioration during severe pancreatitis (4). and large bowel obstruction (3). The 3 cases due to malignancy, 1 of which was recurrent, presented with primary large bowel symptoms suggesting intestinal obstruction rather than pancreatic disease. Typically, patients with severe acute pancreatitis had colonic pathology obscured and unrecognized initially because of the ongoing, fulminant inflammatory process.Recognition of large bowel involvement may be difficult because of nonspecific symptoms or be masked by the systemic features of a critical illness. Colonoscopy, contrast x-rays, or CT scan may be vital in selected cases to detect underlying pathology. Clinicians should be aware that acute or chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic carcinoma may compress, erode, or inflame the large bowel, resulting in life-threatening colonic necrosis, bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
