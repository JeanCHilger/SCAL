Pancreatic metastasis of naso-sinusal epithelioma. Apropos of a case. The authors report a pancreatic metastasis of sinusal squamous cell carcinoma in a 69 year-old man, 18 years after the first excision of the primary neoplasm. The metastases appearing in a patients having previously presented several tumors, was detected by a rising CA 19-9 level and a pancreas head enlargement at the CT. The diagnosis was identified at laparotomy by tumor biopsy. The vascular involvement of the tumor obliged to perform double bypass. 103 cases of pancreatic metastases, published in the literature from 1983 to 1991, are reviewed. Generally the pancreatic mass is visualized by CT but the diagnosis is only carried out on microscopy. Treatment depends on anatomical and pathological characteristics of primary and secondary tumours. Solitary metastasis of renal carcinoma origin have the best prognosis after radical surgery. In other cases palliative procedures are widely used. First case of pancreatic metastasis originated from recurrent sinusal squamous cell carcinoma with poly-tumoral clinical presentation.
