Ultrasonic and computed tomographic appearances of paraganglioma simulating pancreatic mass. We report two cases of paraganglioma in which the tumour was situated adjacent to the head of the pancreas simulating a pancreatic mass lesion. The absence of biliary or pancreatic duct dilatation on ultrasound in the presence of a large mass suggested a retroperitoneal tumour rather than a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Functional activity in these tumours is common and should be excluded before biopsy.
