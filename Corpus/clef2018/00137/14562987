Ultrasonic-guided percutaneous injection of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm with thrombin. Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm is a relatively uncommon complication of chronic pancreatitis, with an associated high mortality if rupture or hemorrhage occurs. We present a case of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm complicating pancreatitis which was successfully treated by direct percutaneous injection of thrombin into the aneurysmal sac. Follow-up at 8 weeks did not demonstrate recurrence. This case indicates that percutaneous thrombin injection offers effective treatment of visceral arterial pseudoaneurysms.
