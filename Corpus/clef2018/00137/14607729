CT manifestations and features of solid cystic tumors of the pancreas. To study retrospectively the manifestations and characteristics of solid cystic tumor of the pancreas(SCTP)on CT.Nine patients with solid cystic tumor of the pancreas underwent resection with pathological and immunohistochemical confirmation. All the patients were female, aged 27.7 years on average at onset of the disease. CT scan was performed in patients with or without intravenous injection of contrast medium it was also performed in the arterial phase in 4 patients.Solid and cystic structures were observed in tumors of the pancreas. Solid structure demonstrated low or iso-density on unenhanced CT, poor enhancement in the arterial phase and marked enhancement in the portal venous phase on contrast material-enhanced CT. Cystic structure showed low density on both pre- and pro-contrast views. The CT findings of tumors with predominantly cystic or equal proportion of solid and cystic structure: mural nodules for solid structure, "floating cloud" signs, or solid and cystic crossing distributions. Cystic structure of tumors predominately solid presenting as a beading appearance under capsule. In round, oval and completely encapsulated tumors in the pancreas, the greater vessel enhanced with well-defined margins on pro-contrast images. No dilatation was observed of the common bile and pancreatic ducts.The characteristics of solid cystic tumor of the pancreas revealed by CT could confirm the diagnosis of the disease in combination with onset age and sex of patients.
