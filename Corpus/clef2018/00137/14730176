A case of acute pancreatitis presenting with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction. A 71-year-old man presented with left upper quadrant abdominal pain. Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) demonstrated an evolving left bundle branch block, a sign of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, a coronary angiogram demonstrated minimal coronary artery disease, and serum troponin T was undetectable in serial serum measurements. Later, serum pancreatic enzyme levels were elevated and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen was consistent with pancreatitis. In patients presenting with acute pancreatitis and ECG changes suggesting AMI, measurement of serum troponin T concentrations can aid in differentiating ECG changes driven by acute pancreatitis from those of true myocardial ischemia or infarction.
