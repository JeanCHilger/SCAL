Solid pseudopapillary pancreatic tumor in pregnancy. A case report. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm, occurring predominantly in young African American women. Tumor growth, which is typically slow, may be accelerated during pregnancy secondary to the influence of progesterone.We report a rare case of an 8-cm SPT in the head of the pancreas presenting as hyperemesis gravidarum during pregnancy. In contrast to previous case reports, surgical resection of the tumor at 16 weeks' gestation, although successful, did not ameliorate the patient's abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. With intravenous nutritional support, she delivered a healthy infant near term.SPT may present as hyperemesis gravidarum. Patients with refractory hyperemesis gravidarum should be evaluated for thyroid disease, gastroesophageal reflux, cholestasis and pancreatitis. If these more common etiologies are excluded, then one may consider SPT in the differential diagnosis, particularly in African American patients. SPT may grow during pregnancy due to progesterone responsiveness. Surgical resection during pregnancy is possible without harmful fetal effects but may not correct gastrointestinal dysfunction during pregnancy.
