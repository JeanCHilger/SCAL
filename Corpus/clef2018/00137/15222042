Role of curved planar reformations using multidetector spiral CT in diagnosis of pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases. To investigate the role of curved planar reformations using multidetector spiral CT (MSCT) in diagnosis of pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases.From October 2001 to September 2003, 47 consecutive patients with pancreatic or peripancreatic diseases, which were confirmed by operation, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and clinical follow-up, were enrolled in this study. CT scanning was performed at a MSCT with four rows of detector. A set of images with an effective thickness of 1.0-2.0 mm and a gap of 0.5-1.0 mm (50% overlap) were acquired in all patients for post-processing. Curved planar reformations were carried out by drawing a curved line on transverse source images, coronal or sagittal multiplanar reformations according to certain anatomic structures (such as cholangiopancreatic ducts or peripancreatic vessels) and the position of lesion.With thin collimation, MSCT could acquire high-quality curved planar reformations to display the profile of the whole pancreas, to trace the cholangiopancreatic ducts and peripancreatic vessels, and to show the relationship of lesions with pancreas and peripancreatic anatomic structures in one curved plane, which facilitates diagnosis and rapid communication of diagnostic information with referring physicians.MSCT with thin collimation could be used to create high-quality curved planar reformations in evaluating pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases with pertinent anatomic information and relative pathologic signs to facilitate the diagnosis and enhance communication with the referring physician. Curved planar reformations can serve as supplements for transverse images in diagnosis and management of pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases.
