Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The current imaging technique and clinical application of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is reviewed. MRCP has evolved into a feasible method of non-invasively evaluating the pancreaticobiliary system and has considerable clinical utility. If endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is incomplete or has failed, or in patients with biliary and gastrointestinal surgical procedures, MRCP is a useful alternative modality. In the near future, MRCP may supplant diagnostic ERCP such that ERCP is reserved primarily for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, when MRCP is performed in conjunction with abdominal MR and MR angiography, the 'all-in-one' examination can evaluate the solid organs and vessels of the abdomen as well as the ductal systems.
