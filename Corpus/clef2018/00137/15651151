Chronic pancreatitis--a disease we can treat but cannot cure. Chronic pancreatitis is one of conditions with a significant impact on quality of life of patients and is an important risk factor for carcinoma emergence. Currently we have a lot of fundamental evidence concerning etiopathogenic mechanisms of chronic pancreatitis genesis. Among conclusive etiology factors belong genetic influence, heredity or autoimmune influence. However, in majority of cases the disease is not diagnosed until diagnosis of manifesting stages is made both clinically and morphologically. In spite of it new very sensitive diagnostic methods appear to give precision to diagnostics, such as new generations of NMR appliances making possible not burdening diagnostic NMR cholangio-pancreatographies or the use of intraductar endosonographic probes. Therapy still consist of treatment of symptoms. A causal therapy, with exception of an obstructive form and autoimmune form, is unknown. Above all we treat pancreatic pain and regulate symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency through an application of a capsule with micropellets enabling controlled release of enzymes in the upper part of duodenum. Undoubtedly, in future a genetic treatment will be introduced and new drugs containing pancreatic enzymes developed, primarily from the viewpoint of use and stability of digestive pancreatic enzymes.
