MR imaging of primary malignant lymphoma of the pancreas. Pancreatic lymphoma is rare and is usually found as a large pancreatic mass. We report the case of a small 2-cm pancreatic lymphoma in a 54-year-old woman that had its histological origin in the pancreatic parenchyma. The mass showed homogeneously high signal-intensity on T2-weighted images and low signal-intensity on T1-weighted images. The infiltrative nature and hypovascularity in early-phase dynamic contrast study without encasement of arteries and veins were well demonstrated by MR imaging and were consistent with malignant lymphoma.
