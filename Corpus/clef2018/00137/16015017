Pancreatitis associated with pancreatic carcinoma. Preoperative diagnosis: role of CT imaging in detection and evaluation. The combined occurrence of pancreatic carcinoma with acute or chronic pancreatitis is seldom seen in medical practice, but when present it is a challenging dilemma, plagued by confusing overlapping clinical findings and pitfalls in diagnostic imaging tests. This article reviews the presumptive pathophysiological aspects of this relationship, the perplexing clinical presentations and the advantages and limitations of the noninvasive imaging examinations. The role of state-of-the-art CT imaging in screening patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis is emphasized and the impute of additional more invasive tests in detecting pancreatic tumors in this cohort of patients is reviewed. The habitual use of CT imaging, followed when needed by complementary examinations, can improve on previously reported low detection rates and hopefully decrease the number of exploratory laparatomies and unnecessary major pancreatic surgical resections.
