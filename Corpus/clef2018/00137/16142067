Normal pancreas aspects. Variations and malformations. Major advances have occurred with regards to imaging of the pancreas. In spite of harmonic imaging, US remains limited. Multi-detector CT allows excellent evaluation of the pancreatic parenchyma with multiplanar ductal and vascular reformations. MRI provides excellent evaluation of the pancreatic parenchyma using fat suppressed T1W images and excellent evaluation of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct using T2W images. Senile pancreas is characterized by atrophy and ductal dilatation, sometimes microcystic. Fatty infiltration of the pancreas could be focal or diffuse. Pancreas divisum is characterized by the absence of fusion of the pancreatic ducts with several anatomic variants. Annular pancreas results from malrotation of the pancreatic buds. MRI is the best technique to diagnose these malformations.
