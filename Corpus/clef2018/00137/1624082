A case of jejunal gastrinoma diagnosed by percutaneous transhepatic portal venous sampling. A 63-year-old male was admitted to our department for further examination of hypergastrinemia. Secretin provocation test and calcium infusion test suggested Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and percutaneous transhepatic portal venous sampling (PTPVS) demonstrated gastrinoma in the jejunum, although CT, ultrasonography and angiography could not accurately detect the location of the gastrinoma. Laparotomy findings showed a solid tumor 1.5 cm in diameter in the jejunal mesentery 5 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, and primary gastrinoma was confirmed in the submucosa of the jejunum immediately adjacent to this tumor. An immunohistochemical study using the PAP method revealed gastrin secreting cells in the tumor. In addition to this case of jejunal gastrinoma, a review of literature in Japan and other countries was presented.
