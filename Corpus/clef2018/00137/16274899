MRI features of a pancreatic schwannoma. A case of a pancreatic schwannoma is presented. The patient, a previously healthy woman, is hospitalized with the diagnosis of purulent pleuritis. Ultrasonography (US) of the abdomen shows a 3-cm mass in the head of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals, in T1-weighted sequences, the mass to be hypointense, and an early and persistent enhanced signal is noted following the administration of gadolinium. In T2-weighted fat saturation sequences, the lesion appears markedly hyperintense. A duodenopancreatotomy is performed, and the pathologic specimen demonstrates a schwannoma of the pancreas with Antoni A pattern.
