Postmenopausal bleeding and vaginal nodules as the first presenting sign of adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. Vaginal submucosal nodules were observed in a 67-year-old woman, with ultrasonographic features of an advanced uterine neoplasm. On biopsy, light microscopy suggested that the lesions might be metastatic foci from an extragenital cancer, with a prevalent tubular growth pattern. Parallel immunohistochemical reactions revealed a diffuse, strong CA 19-9 positivity in both the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Subsequently, high serum levels of such tumor marker were also found, and an extragenital cancer was suspected of pancreatic or biliary origin. A mass in the gallbladder fossa was then detected by computed tomography and a primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma was confirmed on ultrasound-guided biopsy.
