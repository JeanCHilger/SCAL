Pancreatoblastoma (infantile pancreatic carcinoma)--a case report. Pancreatoblastoma or infantile pancreatic carcinoma is a rare pancreatic tumor with distinct acinar and squamoid cell differentiation that generally affects infants and young children. Ultrasound and CT scan may be useful but preoperative diagnosis is often quite difficult. The outcome is generally favourable. A such case of 10 years old boy with an abdominal mass is being presented.
