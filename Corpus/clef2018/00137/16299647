Diagnosis and treatment of paraduodenal hernia: a report of 16 cases. To summarize the experience of diagnosis and treatment for paraduodenal hernia (PDH).The clinical data of 16 cases with PDH surgically treated from 1962 to 2003 were analyzed retrospectively.The average age of the patients was 36 years old. There were 13 cases with left PDH (Landzerts hernia) and 3 cases with right PDH (Waldeyer's hernia). Ten patients usually had no symptoms, while acute abdominal pain occurred after full food in 3 case and after vigorous movement in 13 cases respectively. X-ray revealed complete or incomplete intestinal obstruction in 12 cases, while ultrasonography and CT revealed dilated cystic jejunal loop between the pancreas and the stomach in 6 cases. Fourteen cases (87.5%) were misdiagnosed before operation. The hospital stay ranged from 10 to 13 days. All patients were followed up from 2 to 4 years without recurrence.With high misdiagnostic rate, it is the key to perform exploratory operation for suspicious PDH.
