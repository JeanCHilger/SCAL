Whole-body MSCT of patients after polytrauma: abdominal injuries. The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate the spectrum of abdominal injuries and the reliability of computed tomography-based diagnosis in patients after polytrauma.CT findings and clinical reports for 177 patients after polytrauma were evaluated with regard to abdominal injuries. Clinical patient reports at the time of discharge from the hospital were utilized as the standard of reference. Abdominal injuries resulting from an accident, frequent additional traumas and following therapeutic procedures were recorded. In the case of discrepancies in the reports, the CT scans were viewed retrospectively.In 30 out of 177 patients, 42 abdominal injuries were detected. 69 % of the injuries were caused by traffic accidents while 31 % resulted from falls. Liver and spleen injuries were the most common. 50 % of the cases were treated surgically, and the other half of the cases underwent non-surgical conservative therapy. Massive chest traumas, pelvic injuries, cerebral traumas and injuries to extremities were commonly associated with abdominal injuries. Evaluation of the discrepancies in the clinical reports showed that injury to the pancreas and the small intestine were not successfully detected on CT, thus resulting in a false negative diagnosis. Early stages of organ parenchyma laceration were also initially misdiagnosed on CT.Contrast-enhanced whole-body MSCT is a reliable and rapid method for diagnosing abdominal injuries in patients after polytrauma. Only very few patterns of injury are not detected on CT. The appearance of fluid collection in the abdomen is an indicator of possible parenchyma injury and requires further evaluation in cases of clinically suspected organ trauma.
