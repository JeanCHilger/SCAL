A patient undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in whom involved common hepatic artery anomalously arising from the superior mesenteric artery was removed and reconstructed. Identifying anatomical variations of the celio-mesenteric arterial branches is important when performing pancreaticoduodenectomy. A relatively rare variation is the common hepatic artery entirely originated as a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. This type of variation is termed hepatomesenteric trunk type common hepatic artery, in which an accessory left hepatic artery arising from the celiac trunk is absent. Preservation of hepatomesenteric trunk type common hepatic artery is indispensable during pancreaticoduodenectomy because fatal hepatic injury or leak of hepaticojejunostomy can occur. The present case report shows a patient with pancreatic head tumor in whom hepatomesenteric trunk type common hepatic artery was involved by the tumor. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy during which the involved hepatomesenteric type common hepatic artery was removed and reconstructed using saphenous venous grafts. Histopathological examination showed double cancers which were composed of an advanced ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and early bile duct adenocarcinoma. The patient is alive 18 months after the surgery without recurrence.
