Necrolytic acral erythema: a variant of necrolytic migratory erythema or a distinct entity? Hepatitis C is a major health problem in Egypt. Necrolytic acral erythema (NAE) is a recently described necrolytic erythema that has a distinctive acral distribution and a uniform association with hepatitis C. Some authors believe that NAE is a distinct entity and others consider it as a variant of necrolytic migratory erythema (NME).Five patients with clinical features consistent with NAE were included in this study. The patients were subjected to skin biopsy examination, CT scan of the pancreas and a liver biopsy. Liver function tests, serum glucagon, glucose, amino acids and zinc were measured. All patients were tested for hepatitis C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Three patients presented with early (acute) lesions and two patients with chronic lesions. The distribution of the lesions was almost exclusively on the dorsae of the feet. Histopathological findings were similar to those of other necrolytic erythemas. Hepatitis C virus was uniformly detected in all patients. Serum glucagon was high in two patients, serum glucose was high in four patients, serum amino acids were low in three cases and serum zinc and albumin were low in two cases. Little or no improvement was reported after oral amino acid supplementation, while the response to oral zinc sulfate was moderate to good.Necrolytic acral erythema is closely associated with hepatitis C infection. Many findings indicate that NAE seems to be a variant of NME rather than a distinct entity. Hence, an alternative proposed term could be acral NME.
