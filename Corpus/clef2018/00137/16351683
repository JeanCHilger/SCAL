Abdominal compartment syndrome: a new indication for operative intervention in severe acute pancreatitis. The current management of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is maximal conservative therapy within an intensive care environment. The only commonly accepted indication for operative intervention is the presence of infected pancreatic necrosis. We present a case wherein a laparotomy performed for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) arising in the setting of SAP in the absence of pancreatic necrosis prevented early mortality and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of ACS as a new indication for operative intervention in SAP.
