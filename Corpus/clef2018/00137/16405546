Exocrine pancreatic function: evaluation with MR imaging before and after secretin stimulation. Secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (SS-MRCP) enhances standard pancreatic imaging in chronic pancreatitis. Diffusion-weighted MRI added to SS-MRCP allows a qualitative and potentially quantitative estimate of pancreatic exocrine secretion, providing an alternative to standard "tube" tests.
