CT diagnosis and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. The current use of multidector row helical CT (MDCT) and imaging postprocessing techniques represents an additional step forward in the use of helical CT for detection and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Although no large series have been published detailing the accuracy of MDCT compared to single detector row helical CT, the additional resolution of the MDCT thin-section images and use of postprocessing techniques should certainly equal, if not exceed, the accuracy of the helical CT.
