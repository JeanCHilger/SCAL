Single case of renal cell carcinoma and endocrine pancreatic head cancer occurring with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant genetic disease in which various neoplastic lesions occur in multiple organs. Reported here is a case of VHL disease with concurrent renal cell carcinoma and endocrine pancreatic cancer. The patient was a 43-year old woman. On this occasion, the patient had sought treatment from her local physician, complaining chiefly of yellowing of the skin and bulbar conjunctiva. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scans revealed a mass in the right kidney and a mass in the pancreatic head. Peripheral blood genetic analysis revealed an Arg/stop heteroconjugative mutation in codon 113 in exon 1 of the VHL gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 (p25-26). After various tests were performed, the patient was diagnosed with right renal cell carcinoma, malignant tumor of the pancreatic head, and multiple pancreatic cysts accompanying von Hippel-Lindau disease. Right nephrectomy and pancreatoduodenectomy were performed. Based on the histopathological results, the patient was diagnosed with right renal cell carcinoma and highly differentiated endocrine pancreatic cancer. Immunohistologically, a large number of atypical cells were found to be positive for both anti-chromogranin and anti-synaptophysin antibodies in the endocrine tumor. Immunostaining for each type of gut hormone was also performed, but all results were negative. Based on the above findings, nonfunctioning, highly differentiating endocrine cancer was diagnosed. This is the first confirmed case of renal cell carcinoma and endocrine pancreatic cancer occurring concurrently with VHL. This is an important case, so it is presented here along with a short discussion of the literature.
