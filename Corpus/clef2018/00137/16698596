Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: CT and MRI features of 3 cases. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rather rare but low-grade malignant tumor with good prognosis after surgical excision.In 3 patients with solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas which were proved pathologically, the imaging features (CT in all and MRI in one patient) of the tumor were analyzed.In the 3 female patients under 35-year-old who presented no jaundice, CT revealed that huge solid-cystic masses of the pancreatic head with calcification in one and slight dilation of the pancreatic duct in another, but without dilation of the bile duct system in all. MRI demonstrated mixed signal intensity on T1WI and T2WI of the mass in one patient. CT and MRI revealed obvious enhancement of the cystic wall and solid part of the masses.CT and MRI findings of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas are characteristic, and the diagnosis can be made preoperatively with the combination of clinical features.
