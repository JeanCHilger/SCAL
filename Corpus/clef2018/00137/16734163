Contribution of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to the diagnosis of biliary tract disease. The aim of the study was to assess the role of magnetic resonance cholangiopan-creatography (MRCP) in the diagnosis of biliary tract and pancreatic duct diseases, also in relation to the data reported in the literature. Over the period from Februrary 2002 to July 2004, 252 consecutive patients, with a clinical or instrumental suspicion of biliary disease were submitted to magnetic resonance to investigate the biliary tract. The definitive diagnosis of disease was obtained by surgery and/or endoscopic retrtograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with clinical or diagnostic evidence of disease and by means of follow-up in the remaining cases. MRCP, combined with T2-weighted FSE sequence on the axial plane yielded positive findings in 191/252 patients (75.79%) in 75/191 (39.26%) either ERCP was indispensable (n = 33) or surgery proved necessary (n = 42). MRCP and surgical sample findings proved discordant in 3/42 cases operated on (7.14%)
