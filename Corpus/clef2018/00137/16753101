What are the main errors made by surgeons in the management of pancreatic cancer?. The present review identifies two major conceptual errors. Therapeutic nihilism, which should be discounted in view of the results currently achieved by surgery, and noncentralization, since better results have been demonstrated, both in terms of morbidity and mortality and in survival, in high-volume centers than in low volume centers. The present review also identifies errors in management, the most important of which are: undervaluing the medical record, which is of great utility and continues to be the pillar on which the entire diagnostic process is based the systematic use of preoperative biliary drainage, which used to be considered mandatory but should be used highly selectively in patients with severe jaundice or biliary tract infections, and viewing preoperative imaging tests as unreliable, when current radiological techniques, particularly helical computed tomography (CT), are highly reliable in establishing tumor resectability and consequently they should be used in all treatment planning. Moreover, because radiological tests are highly reliable, laparoscopic staging has lost diagnostic value
