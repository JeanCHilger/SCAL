New advances in pancreatic imaging. This review serves to highlight new technology and novel applications of existing techniques and their role in the management of pancreatic diseases, including acute and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and pancreatic cystic neoplasms.Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has shown promise in evaluating the severity of acute pancreatitis, staging pancreatic cancer, and predicting malignancy in cystic neoplasms. Optical coherence tomography within the pancreatic duct appears to be able to differentiate malignant and normal pancreatic ducts. Spectroscopy may prove useful in differentiating focal chronic pancreatitis from malignancy. Multidetector-row computed tomography may provide more accurate information regarding cancer respectability and differentiation between ductal type of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors.These new developments will help with the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic diseases.
