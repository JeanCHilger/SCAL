High F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in solid pseudo-papillary tumors of the pancreas. We report two cases of young women with a solid pseudo-papillary tumor of the pancreas which having cystic and hemorrhagic components with marked calcification on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed abnormally increased accumulation of F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the pancreas tail tumors, especially in the non-calcified solid portion of the tumors. These patients underwent elective resection of the masses and distal pancreatectomy and were diagnosed with solid pseudo-papillary tumors by histopathological analysis. There was no evidence of distant metastasis on follow-up after surgery and they showed no histopathological findings suggesting malignancy. These cases suggest that solid pseudo-papillary tumor may show high uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose.
