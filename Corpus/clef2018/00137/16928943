Evaluation of imaging-guided core biopsy of pancreatic masses. The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of imaging-guided core biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses.Imaging-guided core biopsy is sensitive, safe, and accurate in the diagnosis of malignant lesions of the pancreas. Benign biopsy findings cannot be used to exclude the presence of a neoplasm, and repetition of a biopsy should be considered if there is high clinical suspicion of malignancy.
