A case of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. We present ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings in a case with pancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumor and their correlations with histopathology. Ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic mass, and computed tomography revealed a hypodense mass at the pancreatic head minimally enhanced after intravenous contrast agent administration. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hypointense mass on unenhanced T1-weighted images including a hyperintense focus representing the hemorrhage. The lesion was hyperintense on T2-weighted images. On the postcontrast images the lesion showed peripheral thin contrast enhancement in arterial phase and enhanced slightly diffusely in venous and equilibrium phases. The patient underwent elective resection of the mass and pancreatoduodenectomy with jejunostomy tube placement. A final diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumor was made histopathologically. Solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rare pancreatic tumor. It is important to make the diagnosis preoperatively because with an adequate surgical resection the prognosis is good. A multimodalitary approach, especially magnetic resonance imaging can suggest the diagnosis without the need for biopsy.
