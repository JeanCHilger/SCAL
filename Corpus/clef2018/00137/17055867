Patient preference and recall of results of EUS-guided FNA. There are no clear guidelines regarding the best way, in terms of timing and setting, to deliver results to patients who undergo EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) of suspected pancreatic masses.We aimed to study (1) whether patients undergoing EUS-FNA prefer to receive preliminary results immediately after the procedure or at a later date, after final results are known and (2) to assess the accuracy of patients' recollection of information given to them regarding their FNA diagnosis.We enrolled patients presenting to our endoscopy center for EUS-FNA of suspected pancreatic masses and obtained data through 4 pilot surveys.University-based endoscopy center.Sixty patients who were referred for EUS-FNA of suspected pancreatic masses.A total of 57 of 59 patients (96.6%) wanted preliminary results the same day as the procedure. Twenty-eight of 60 (42.7%) knew they were having a biopsy, and 42 of 60 (70%) knew cancer was suspected. Of those who received preliminary results, 31 of 41 (75%) remembered the diagnosis correctly the next day, and 32 of 38 (84%) remembered the diagnosis correctly 1 week later.Single-center pilot study.The majority of our patients wished to receive preliminary results the same day as the procedure. Although most patients remembered results correctly, 25% of patients did not remember the correct diagnosis the next day. Further work is needed to improve patient's understanding of the reasons for the EUS-FNA and recall of preliminary EUS-FNA results.
