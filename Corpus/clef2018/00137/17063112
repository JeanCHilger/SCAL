Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a low-grade malignancy, which has been infrequently observed in adolescent and young adult females since first report by Frantz in 1959. In this article, we describe our experience of 8 cases of SPT with the clinical features, diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and images of 8 patients who underwent surgery for SPT between January 1995 and December 2004.Seven females and 1 male with the mean age of 29 years (range, 10 to 64) at presentation were identified. Three patients presented palpable abdominal mass, 2 with abdominal pain, and the remainder with no specific symptom. The mean diameter of the tumors was 7.9 cm (range, 4.0 to 10.0). Four were located in the tail, 3 in the body, and 1 in the head. Surgical procedure included distal pancreatectomy with/without splenectomy in 7 patients and Whipple operation in 1 with no surgical morbidity and mortality. All were alive without evidence of recurrence after mean follow-up of 26.4 months (range, 1 to 66).SPT of the pancreas is an unusual neoplasm and typically occurs in young females presenting well-demarcated pancreatic masses, which are amenable to cure by complete surgical resection.
