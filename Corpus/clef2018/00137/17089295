Management of pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma report of five cases. Pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma are rare. In most cases metastases occur many years after nephrectomy. Solitary pancreatic metastases of renal cell cancer can be the only manifestation of tumor dissemination. Between 1995 and 2005 five patients after nephrectomy due to renal cell cancer were suspected of having malignant pancreatic tumor and underwent an operation. The histology revealed metastases of renal cancer. The intervals from primary renal tumor resection to recognition of metastases in the pancreas varied from 6-17 years. The prognosis of metastatic invasion to the pancreas is better than that of primary pancreatic carcinoma. Radical resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice for isolated solitary late metastases of renal cell cancer in the pancreas.
