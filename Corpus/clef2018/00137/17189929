A case of hepatectomy for liver metastasis after pancreatoduodenectomy for carcinoma of ampulla of Vater. After curative resection of carcinoma of ampulla of Vater, 5-year survival rate has been reported ranging from 40% to 60%. Two major causes of the treatment failure are local recurrence and liver metastasis. Liver metastases are often multiple and are associated with poor prognosis. There have been few reports on long-term survivors after hepatectomy for metastatic liver tumors from carcinoma of ampulla of Vater. We report a 42 year-old female patient with solitary hepatic metastasis from carcinoma of ampulla of Vater, which was successfully treated by hepatectomy 69 months after curative Whipple's operation. Histologic examination of the resected specimen had revealed stage IB moderately-differentiated, intestinal type adenocarcinoma (T2N0M0). Since neither local recurrence or distant metastasis were detected, the patient underwent liver segmentectomy. Histologic study confirmed the presence of metastatic liver tumor from carcinoma of ampulla of Vater. She is doing well without evidence of recurrence at 20 months after hepatectomy.
