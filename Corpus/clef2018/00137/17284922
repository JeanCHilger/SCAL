Hypoglycemia due to ectopic release of insulin from a paraganglioma. Insulin-secreting pancreatic tumors and insulin-like growth hormone-secreting non-islet cell tumors can cause hypoglycemia. However, insulin-releasing paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma has almost never been reported. A 67-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital because of headache, palpitation, perspiration, faintness, frequent sense of hunger and absent-mindedness. These intermittent symptoms had begun approximately a year before admission. On physical examination, she had high blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg. Hormonal studies demonstrated increased urinary norepinephrine levels, and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was confirmed while the patient was symptomatic. Abdominal MRI revealed a retroperitoneal mass measuring 4.5 cm in the pancreatic region. She was treated with an alpha-blocking agent to control blood pressure preceding the removal of the mass. Histopathological diagnosis was paraganglioma, and immunohistochemically insulin staining in the neoplastic cells was demonstrated. Her blood pressure normalized and hypoglycemia relieved after the operation. The patient did not have recurrence of hypoglycemia after a year of follow-up. Paraganglioma is a rare tumor of the neural crest, and co-secretion of insulin and catecholamines has been reported only by a single case report in the literature. The present patient is another case with this co-secretion.
