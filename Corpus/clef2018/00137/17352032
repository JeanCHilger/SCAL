Gastric adenocarcinoma inducing portal hypertension: a rare presentation. Advanced gastric cancer usually presents with symptoms due to direct extension into adjacent viscera, distant metastases from lymphatic or hematogenic dissemination and peritoneal seeding. However, portal hypertension as a presentation of metastatic gastric cancer is rare and usually seen in association with other malignancies, e.g. hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma. We report a case of signet ring adenocarcinoma of the stomach that presented with esophageal and duodenal varices and bleeding due to portal hypertensive gastropathy. Pagetoid spread of cancer cells likely caused early metastasis and the unusual presentation. We also discussed the pathophysiology of development of portal hypertension in association with malignancies.
