A case of adenosquamous gastric carcinoma successfully treated with TS-1, low-dose CDDP and docetaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patient was a 66-year-old male with extremely advanced gastric cancer type 3 and diagnosed with adenocarcinoma by endoscopic biopsies specimens. Combined chemotherapy of TS-1, CDDP and docetaxel was prescribed in order for tumor reduction and downstaging. TS-1 (80 mg/m(2)) was administered 28 days followed by 14 days rest as one course. CDDP (8 mg/m(2)) was administered on days 1, 2, 14 and 15 and docetaxel (40 mg/m(2)) was administered on day 1 and 14, followed by 4 weeks rest as one course. After 2 courses of treatment, a CT scan revealed a minor response of tumor reduction. Therefore, total gastrectomy, partial pancreas body and tail resection, and D 2 lymph node dissection were performed. The patient had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy of TS-1 and biweekly docetaxel after surgery with no recurrence for 13 months. Adverse reactions were grade 3 neutropenia and grade 2 diarrhea. Combined chemotherapy of TS-1, low-dose CDDP and docetaxel were intensive and required constant patient monitoring. However, it proved effective and feasible as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for advanced gastric cancer.
