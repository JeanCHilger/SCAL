Epigastric mass due to a hydatid cyst of the pancreas. A case report and review of the literature. Primary hydatid disease of the pancreas is very rare.We report the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and an epigastric mass. A diagnosis of a pancreatic cyst was established by ultrasonography and CT scan before surgery. The treatment consisted of the resection of the protruding dome with a cystogastrostomy. The recovery was uneventful and the patient has remained symptom free so far.Hydatid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all cystic masses in the pancreas, especially in the geographical regions where the disease is endemic.
