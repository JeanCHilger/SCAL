Imaging of neuroendocrine tumours (CT/MR/US). Neuroendocrine tumours may be broadly divided into pancreatic endocrine tumours (PETs) and carcinoid neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). In both cases, patients may present with a clinical syndrome related to hormone secretion by the tumour. In these cases, cross-sectional imaging plays an important role in the localization of the primary tumour, the detection of metastases, and the assessment of response to treatment. Computed tomography (CT) is established as the primary modality, although following technological advances detection rates on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are now challenging those of CT. Endoscopic ultrasound has an important role in the preoperative assessment of the pancreas where a small functioning tumour or the possibility of multiple tumours is suspected. The sensitivity for the detection of small functioning tumours depends upon optimal technique, whichever modality is used. Non-functioning tumours frequently present late with mass effect, as there is no accompanying clinical syndrome. Carcinoid neuroendocrine tumours are most frequently localized on CT. MRI is usually used as a problem-solving tool. As technology evolves, detection rates may continue to improve, and the highest sensitivities may be achieved by a combination of different modalities.
