EUS FNA in intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas. There is little information concerning the potential role of fine-needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography in the pathologic diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas.Patients with an intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas suggested by endoscopic ultrasonography underwent fine-needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography in order to investigate the presence of mucin and/or cytologic changes consistent with this diagnosis. A group of 111 patients with other pancreatic lesions explored during the same period of time was used as a control group.Fine-needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography was safely performed in 19 patients and supported the diagnosis in 17 of them. Nine out of the 17 patients with suspicion of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas went to surgery and this diagnosis was confirmed in the resected specimen in all of them. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of EUS FNA in the diagnosis of IPMT were 82%, 100%, 100%, 92% and 94% respectively.Fine-needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography is a good technique to support the diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas and should be considered in this group of patients if pathologic confirmation is judged to be necessary.
