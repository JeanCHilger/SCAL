Plasma level of thrombomodulin is an early indication of pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis. The potential to predict pancreatic necrosis within the first 48 h by using plasma soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) in 104 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) was analyzed in a prospective 5-year investigation performed at a single institution.According to Balthazar CT grade, pancreatitis was classified as no necrosis in 72 patients, one-third necrotic in 18 patients, one-half necrotic in 10 patients and more than one-half necrotic in 4 patients. Blood was collected at the first 48 hours after the onset of pain and analyzed for sTM.In the healthy volunteers, plasma levels of TM were 16.49+/-5.24 microg/L. By comparison, the mean plasma levels of TM in each group of pancreatitis patients were as follows: CT grade A group, 34.21+/-10.73 microg/L CT grade B group, 36.18+/-12.50 microg/LPlasma soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) is a potential marker to predict pancreatic necrosis within the first 48 h, and further investigation in a multicentre study is necessary.
