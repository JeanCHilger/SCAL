It can mimic cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.We report the case of a patient having peripancreatic tuberculosis who presented with fever, jaundice, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and weight loss. Imaging and tumor markers also suggested a pancreatic malignancy. MRI helped to identify the peripancreatic lymph node involvement and biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node clinched the diagnosis.Pancreatic and peripancreatic tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of the head of the pancreas.
