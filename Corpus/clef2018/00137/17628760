Pancreatic incidentalomas. Correct assessment and therapy. Due to recent advances in CT/MRI technology, incidentalomas of the pancreas are detected with increasing frequency. Pancreatic incidentalomas should be differentiated into solid and cystic tumors. In both subgroups definitive classification of the tumor is often not possible. Operative therapy is recommended in premalignant or malignant pathologies. Thus solid incidentalomas should be resected independently of their size, if the patient is without serious comorbidities. In case of cystic incidentalomas, benign cystic lesions should be excluded as far as possible. Otherwise they should be resected if their size is >or=2 cm. In case of IPMN with specific risk factors, resection is recommended when the tumor size exceeds 1 cm.
