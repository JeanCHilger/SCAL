Accessory spleen presenting as a mass in the tail of the pancreas. In this case report, we describe an accessory spleen that presented as a mass in the tail of the pancreas and mimicked a neoplasm. Intrapancreatic accessory spleen have a relatively high prevalence and can be mistaken for tumors. We present a case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen in a 40-year-old man, which was discovered incidentally during a workup for an aortic dissection. Computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated a hypervascular mass in the tail of the pancreas. The clinical and radiological differential diagnosis included pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm, pancreatic endocrine neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary tumor, ductal adenocarcinoma, and metastasis. After a distal pancreatectomy was completed, microscopic examination revealed heterotopic splenic tissue.
