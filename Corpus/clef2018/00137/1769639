Diagnosis of gastroenterologic diseases with sonography. Part 3: Pancreas and spleen. Ultrasonic assessment of the pancreas is rendered difficult by interposed gas-containing loops of bowel and stomach. In 50% of the cases, meteorism and ileus prevent the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In the case of chronic pancreatitis, focal pancreatitis and carcinoma of the pancreas, too, further diagnostic procedures (CT, ERCP, fine-needle aspiration) are required. As a rule, the caliber of the pancreatic duct can readily be assessed, and may, for example, indicate a carcinoma in the head of the pancreas. Splenomegaly and focal or diffuse parenchymal lesions are detectable by ultrasonography, although an etiological differentiation is not usually possible. The most common lesions are the so-called "bland" splenic cysts. Of importance is the diagnosis of rupture of the spleen, which requires immediate treatment.
