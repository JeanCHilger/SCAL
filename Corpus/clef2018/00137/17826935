Renal cortical lesions in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis: a clue to differentiation from pancreatic malignancy. To describe the occurrence of renal cortical lesions (RCLs) in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).This retrospective study was approved by our research ethics board informed consent was waived. Systematic search of CT scan reports in 5-year interval yielded 17 patients with AIP (male:femaleBoth readers independently identified the same 6/17 (35%) patients in the study group and 0/22 in the control group with two or more RCLs. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.004). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of RCLs in the differentiation of AIP from pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 35%, 100%, 100%, and 67%, respectively. To the six AIP patients with RCLs, we added three more identified anecdotally. In 7/9, >5 RCLs were seen which were wedge-shaped and cortical-based, ranging from <1 to 4cm. Typical pancreatic findings of AIP were noted in all, with the gland affected focally in 5/9 patients.We have shown the presence of multiple renal cortical lesions which occur in approximately 35% of our AIP patient population.
