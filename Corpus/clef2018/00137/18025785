A large Brunner's gland hamartoma causing gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction. Clinical symptoms of Brunner's gland (BG) hamartoma are rare. Most lesions are small and asymptomatic. Symptomatic BG hamartoma may mimic a malignancy of the duodenal-pancreatic area. Though standard mucosal biopsies are inferiorly diagnostic due to normal duodenal mucosa surrounding, a biopsy was indicated in this case.We report the case of a 37-year-old man with a large BG hamartoma mimicking a malignancy. Preoperatively the biopsy led to an inconclusive diagnosis. Due to its large size and its presence of symptoms, a surgical excision was performed.BG hamartoma may be a rare indication for surgery.
