Thiazolidinediones and slowing the progression of diabetes. A continuing goal of treatment of diabetes is to slow the progression of the disease through the preservation of beta-cell function. To assess efficacious and cost-effective methods of doing this, The Pharmacy & Therapeutics Society (Glastonbury, CT) assembled a study group of health plan medical directors. Based on a review of the data, the group studied the value of earlier diagnosis and the administration of thiazolidinediones. The potential role for health plans to support this approach to diabetes care is outlined below.
