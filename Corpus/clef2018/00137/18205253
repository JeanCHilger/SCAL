Occult sporadic insulinoma: localization and surgical strategy. Insulinomas continue to pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians, surgeons and radiologists alike. Most are intrapancreatic, benign and solitary. Biochemical diagnosis is obtained and imaging techniques to localize lesions continue to evolve. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Despite all efforts, an occult insulinoma (occult insulinoma refers to a biochemically proven tumor with indeterminate anatomical site before operation) may still be encountered. New localization preoperative techniques decreases occult cases and the knowledge of the site of the mass before surgery allows to determine whether enucleation of the tumor or pancreatic resection is likely to be required and whether the tumor is amenable to removal via a laparoscopic approach. In absence of preoperative localization and intraoperative detection of an insulinoma, blind pancreatic resection is not recommended.
