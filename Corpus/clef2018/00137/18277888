Uncovered Hanaro Versus Luminex metal stents for palliation of malignant biliary strictures. Endoscopic stent insertion is the optimum method of palliation for malignant biliary obstruction. Various types of self-expanding metal stents have been introduced in the market. Whether one type of stents is superior to the others in terms of stent patency remains undefined.This randomized trial compared 2 uncovered metal stents with similar technical characteristics, but significant cost difference, in the palliation of inoperable malignant biliary strictures.Ninety-two patients with inoperable biliary obstruction were randomized to receive either a 10-mm diameter Hanaro or Luminex uncovered metal stent. The duration of stent patency, the overall patient survival, the mechanism of stent occlusion, and the adverse events were analyzed.Eighty-nine patients were included in the analysis 44 received Hanaro stents and 45 Luminex stents. The overall median patency rates between the 2 stents did not differ (328 d for the Hanaro vs. 289 d for the Luminex stentThe 2 uncovered metal stents are comparable in terms of placement, occlusion rates, overall stent patency, and patient survival Hanaro stent insertion, however, seems to be a cost-saving strategy at least in Greece.
