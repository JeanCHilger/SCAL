Choledochal cyst and anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union in adults: radiological spectrum and complications. Choledochal cyst and anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union (APBDU) are considered to be embryologically related to each other, and their complications are clinically important. This article illustrates the key imaging features of choledochal cysts and APBDU and their various associated abnormalities and complications. Complications of common bile duct are more common in APBDU with choledochal cyst, and complications of gallbladder are more common in APBDU without choledochal cyst.
