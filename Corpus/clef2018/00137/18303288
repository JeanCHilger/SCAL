Visualization of the biliary tract using gadobenate dimeglumine: preliminary findings. To compare contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography (CE-MRC) performed with gadobenate dimeglumine with T2-weighted MRC (T2-MRC) for visualization of the bile ducts in nondilated biliary systems.Twenty consecutive patients who underwent MR imaging (MRI) of the liver and pancreas with nondilated intrahepatic ducts were included in this retrospective study. T2-weighted MRC was performed using a multislice, high-resolution fat-suppressed half-Fourier acquisition turbo spin-echo sequence. Contrast-enhanced MR cholangiography was performed using a fat-suppressed 3-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequence acquired 1 to 1.5 hour after intravenous administration of gadobenate dimeglumine. For image interpretation, the biliary system was divided into 8 segments. Two readers graded visualization of each segment on T2-MRC and CE-MRC using a 5-point scale (0, nonvisualization 4, excellent visualization). Final opinion for each sequence was rendered by consensus. Superiority of visualization was assessed using the McNemar test and comparing adequately (visualization scores 3 and 4) and inadequately (visualization scores 0, 1, and 2) visualized segments of the ducts on both sequences. Interobserver variability was assessed with kappa statistics.Overall and segment-based evaluation revealed superior visualization of biliary segments with CE-MRC compared with T2-MRC. We also found a statistically significant difference between the 2 sequences for overall and for right hepatic duct and cystic channel visualization (P < 0.05). A high concordance between readers 1 and 2 both for T2-MRC and CE-MRC was achieved (85.8% and 89.4%, respectively).Gadobenate dimeglumine can be used as an alternative intrabiliary contrast agent for contrast-enhanced MR cholangiography in nondilated biliary systems in patients with normal excretory liver function tests.
