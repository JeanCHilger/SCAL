Diagnosis of pancreatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor by EUS guided FNA. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the pancreas are very rare. Only two case reports have been published, both with diagnoses made on surgical pathology. We present the first case of pancreatic stromal tumor diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration.A 47-year-old male presented with self limited nausea and vomiting. A CT scan revealed a subtle, hypervascular mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound confirmed the pancreatic mass and fine needle aspiration was performed giving a bloody sample. Cytology showed spindle cell proliferation with CD117 positive immunohistochemistry, confirming a pancreatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.We present a case of pancreatic stromal tumor diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration. Although very rare in the pancreas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses and blood aspirates.
