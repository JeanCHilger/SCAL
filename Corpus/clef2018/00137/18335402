Pancreatic endocrine tumors - management guidelines (recommended by the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumors). Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) are rare neoplasms of this organ. The majority of PETs are tumors without hormonal activity. In this publication, we present the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the management of these tumors proposed by the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumors. These guidelines refer to biochemical and location diagnostics, including scintygraphy of somatostatin receptors, endoscopic ultrasonography and other anatomical and functional imaging methods. High importance is attached to correct histopathological diagnosis which determines further management of patients with PETs. Antitumor therapy requires multidirectional procedure, and therefore the rules of surgical treatment, biotherapy, chemotherapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are discussed.
