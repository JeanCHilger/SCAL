Diagnosis and management of choledochal cysts. A review of 10 new cases. the aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic options for the various types of this rare disease.10 patients with choledochal cysts (CC) were diagnosed in our hospital since 1991. Type of cyst was established according to the Alonso-Lej classification.we report 7 type-I, 1 type-III, 1 type-IVa, and 1 type-V CC cases. Clinical manifestations were abdominal pain in all cases with biliary or pancreatic features. The diagnosis was established using abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). All 7 patients with type-I CC underwent total cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepatojejunostomy. For type-III CC an endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) was performed, and in type-IVa CC a transductal sphincterotomy and cholecistectomy was made. The patient with Caroli s disease (type V) underwent liver transplantation. We have followed up all patients for several years without significant complications.CC is more frequent in childhood, but is not exceptional in the adult. Imaging techniques and ERCP play an important role in the diagnosis, and also in the treatment of type-III cysts. Therapeutic options depend on cyst type, but due to the potential malignancy of this disease total cyst excision is recommended for types I, II and IV. In type-III CC endoscopic sphyncterothomy is recommended, while liver transplantation is sometimes necessary for type V. Long-term follow-up is crucial to prevent malignant transformation except for type-III CC where this complication is very unusual.
