A long-term survival case of unresectable malignant pancreatic endocrine tumor successfully treated with systemic chemotherapy. A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of high grade fever in October 1999. Computed tomography showed a solid tumor in the tail of the pancreas with multiple liver tumors. We diagnosed him as unresectable pancreatic tail cancer with multiple liver metastases at first, so systemic chemotherapy using UFT was performed. Gradually, liver metastases were slightly reduced, and tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9) decreased to the normal range. In April 2001, percutaneous transhepatic tumor biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a malignant pancreatic endocrine tumor. Long NC had continued by using the UFT regimen. But because tumors had gradually grown since October 2003, the chemotherapy with S-1 was followed by gemcitabine (GEM). The patient has now survived for 7.5 years while receiving the combined chemotherapy of S-1/GEM.
