A case of advanced gastric cancer successfully treated with S-1 and paclitaxel followed by curative resection. A 59-year-old man diagnosed with Stage IV advanced gastric cancer due to pancreatic invasion(T4)and splenic hilum lymph node metastasis(N3)was initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 and CDDP. However, it was discontinued because the tumor marker increased after 1 course. Instead of S-1 and CDDP, S-1 and paclitaxel were then administered. After 4 courses, CT scan revealed reduced tumor size and the disappearance of splenic hilum lymph node swelling that indicated PR of the chemotherapy. Moreover, serum CEA was remarkably decreased to 77 ng/mL from 1,092 ng/mL. He could undergo subtotal gastrectomy(Billroth II)with lymph node dissection(D2)and cholecystectomy. Histopathological examination revealed Stage II (pT2(SS), pN1, CY0, ly1, v2)advanced gastric cancer that showed good effect of S-1 and paclitaxel. At this writing (October 2007), the patient has remained free of disease for more than 1 year and 6 months with good nutrition. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 and paclitaxel for advanced gastric cancer seems to have been effective.
