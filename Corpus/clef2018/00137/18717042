Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. The neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the pancreas are very rare lesions with frequency of about 3 to 10 per 1 000 000 inhabitants. The neuroendocrine tumors composes a heterogeneous group of tumors. The gastro-entero-pancreatic tumors (GEP) constitute 70% of all NET and 2% of all digestive system tumors. There have been several attempts to classify those lesions and since 2000 exists WHO classification which divides NET according to malignancy and histologic structure. The most often NET of the pancreas are insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, VIPoma. There is a recommendation to assay hormonal activity, measure concentration of specific peptides, biogenic amines and hormones produced by NET cells to establish diagnosis. Those tests are useful in monitoring treatment and in prognostication course of the disease. Imaging methods especially useful in localization GEP-NET are: ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) and angiography. The most sensitive method in preoperative diagnosis seems to be EUS or less accessible intra ductal ultrasonography (IDUS). Surgical treatment depends on progression of disease as well as on localization of tumor and consists in both radical methods and palliative operations. The gold standard in pharmacological treatment are somatostatin analogs which can induce long-term remission even in inoperable lesions. Although NET of pancreas are very rare. they are still important diagnostic and therapeutic problem and requires interdisciplinary co-operation. The neuroendocrine tumors should be treated in centers with highest rank of references.
