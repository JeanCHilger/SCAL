Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: current use and future applications. Magnetic resonance pancreatography (MRCP) is now established as a robust noninvasive tool for the evaluation of biliary and pancreatic pathology. Its diagnostic performance is comparable with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography without the associated risks. This article aims to familiarize the reader with the technique, clinical indications, and limitations of the investigation. Common pitfalls in interpretation also are addressed. Emerging applications and techniques are discussed that include recent advances in technology and the development of functional imaging.
