Surgical management for stenosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy. The management of the stenosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy is dictated by the state of the anastomosis and the residual pancreas, endocrine, and exocrine pancreatic function. We report a case of a 23-year-old woman who presented with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. Four years ago, she was diagnosed with pancreatic injury with a transection of the body of the pancreas. A computed tomography scan showed a pancreatic laceration, and she underwent a Letton-Wilson surgical procedure. At present, we think that the stenosis of the anastomosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy caused the recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. We performed a reoperation for stenosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy by the previous surgical procedure. Reoperation is a useful and radical procedure to relieve recurrent acute pancreatitis caused by the stenosis of the pancreaticojejunostomy.
