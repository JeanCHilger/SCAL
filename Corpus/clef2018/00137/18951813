Role of imaging in the management of pancreatic mass. Pancreatic cancer is the second commonest malignant gastrointestinal neoplasm. Modern imaging techniques have greatly increased sensitivity in diagnosing and staging pancreatic cancers. Multidetector CT in particular, plays a critical role in local staging and determining the resectability of pancreatic tumours. MR and endoscopic ultrasound are valuable in those groups of patients in whom CT findings alone are inconclusive in tumour characterisation and local staging, particularly vascular involvement. In this article we review the current established concepts and the role of imaging in the multidisciplinary management of pancreatic tumours together with a comprehensive review of the literature.
