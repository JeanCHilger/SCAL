Marked response to combination chemotherapy using S-1, CPT-11 for lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer. A 68-year-old man with lymph node metastasis of stomach pylorus pointed out by abdominal CT, was diagnosed as gastric cancer of the stomach pyloric region. Although an operation was performed, the lymph node metastasis of No. 13 had invaded the pancreas, and curative resection of the lymph node was impossible. After the operation, he was given combination chemotherapy with PTX combined S-1, and CDDP combined S-1. Progressive disease (PD) was confirmed by abdominal CT after both combination chemotherapies. Next, he was given combination chemotherapy with S-1 and CPT-11 (S-1 100 mg/body, day 1-14, CPT-11 125 mg/m(2) day 1 and 15 every 4 weeks). Disappearance of the lymph node metastasis and decrease of CA19-9 were confirmed after combination chemotherapy with S-1 and CPT-11. After six courses of the chemotherapy, recurrences are no longer seen. S-1+CPT-11 chemotherapy is considered very useful because the adverse events of this chemotherapy have been mild.
