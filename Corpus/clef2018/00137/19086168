Pancreaticojejunostomy: a valid operation in chronic pancreatitis? Patients with chronic pancreatitis and intractable pain may be candidates for surgical intervention and various types of surgery have been described over time. The objective of this study was to describe long-term outcome following pancreaticojejunostomy in patients with chronic pancreatitis.Thirty-two patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent lateral pancreatiocojejunostomy and were then followed-up for 5 years.The short-term results on relief of abdominal pain were good, but seemed to deteriorate at long-term follow-up (5 years), as did pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function. A substantial number of patients admitted to continued alcohol abuse at 5-year follow-up (31%).Pancreaticojejunostomy in patients with chronic pancreatitis renders good pain relief. In effect, the deterioration in abdominal pain at long-term follow-up was in parallel with a tendency towards a decline in both exocrine and endocrine function and a continued alcohol abuse.
