Assessment of vessel size by MRI in an orthotopic model of human pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with no cure. Therapies that target the tumor vasculature are promising new treatment strategies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can non-invasively determine a vessel size index and a blood volume fraction to characterize the vascular compartment in a tumor. The changes in the T2 and T2* relaxation rate constants after the administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles are dependent on the size and morphology of tissue blood vessels. In this study, MRI was used to investigate changes in the tumor vasculature in an orthotopic primary human pancreatic cancer xenograft model during tumor progression. The SPIO contrast agent Feridex I.V. was first validated as an intravascular contrast agent over the course of the imaging session, and shown to remain in the blood for at least 1.5 h. The average vessel size index was not correlated to the tumor area within an image slice, but the average blood volume fraction was significantly and negatively correlated to the tumor area (p<0.05). Blood volume fraction may serve as a non-invasive biomarker for changes in the tumor vasculature due to tumor growth Further investigation is needed to evaluate this promising technique as a tool to monitor tumor vascular changes in response to antiangiogenic therapies in pancreatic cancer.
