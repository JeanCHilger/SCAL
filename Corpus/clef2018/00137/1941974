Retroperitoneal duodenal rupture during closed abdominal trauma. Duodenal retroperitoneal wound after blunt abdominal trauma, is a well known, and a classical entity. Most of the patients are operated with delay and this lesion could easily be missed at laparotomy if not searched for. Mortality and morbidity are much higher if the diagnosis is delayed more than 24 hours. These lesions should be strongly suspected after any blunt abdominal trauma, and repeated clinical assessment is mandatory in the conscious patient. Gastrografine upper GI study and CT Scan are interesting diagnosis procedures when the patient is unconscious or should be anesthesized. At laparotomy, the presence of a central retroperitoneal hematoma should guide the surgeon to explore the duodenum. Treatment depend on the time of diagnosis, the severity of the wound, and the associated pancreatic lesions.
