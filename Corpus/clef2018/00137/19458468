A case of intramural duodenal hematoma accompanied by acute pancreatitis following endoscopic hemostasis for duodenal ulcer bleeding. Intramural duodenal hematoma is an uncommon condition, which usually develops after blunt abdominal trauma. It is also reported as a complication of anticoagulant therapy, blood dyscrasia, pancreatic disease, and diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy. The typical clinical pictures of intramural duodenal hematoma consist of upper abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, and hematochezia, and it is rarely accompanied by intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, and pancreatitis as its complication. We report a case of intramural duodenal hematoma extended to peritoneal cavity, and accompanied by acute pancreatitis following therapeutic endoscopy for duodenal ulcer bleeding in a 32-year-old man who was on maintenance of anti-coagulation therapy after valvular heart surgery.
