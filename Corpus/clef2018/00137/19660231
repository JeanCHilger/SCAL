Minimally invasive treatment of acute intrahepatic fluid collections with acute biliary pancreatitis. Peripancreatic fluid collection suggests the anatomical-clinical scenario of necrotizing acute pancreatitis. However, intrahepatic fluid collection is a rare occurrence with fewer than 30 cases being reported in the medical literature. We describe 2 cases of intrahepatic fluid collection in 2 patients with acute biliary pancreatitis and discuss the therapeutic possibilities.The first case report is that of a 68-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute biliary pancreatitis with several necrotizing fluid collections and a large infected intrahepatic collection in the left lobe. The patient was successfully treated by percutaneous US/CT guided drainage. The second case report is that of a 72-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute biliary pancreatitis with several peripancreatic fluid collections and a voluminous intrahepatic fluid collection in the left lobe that caused epigastric pain. This patient was also successfully treated with percutaneous US/CT guided drainage.Intrahepatic fluid collection in the course of acute biliary pancreatitis is a rare occurrence. The therapeutic approach is the same as that for pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. In case of infection, the patient undergoes percutaneous US/CT guided drainage. This therapeutic procedure can be added to the therapeutic program for necrotizing acute biliary pancreatitis together with ERCP/ES and videolaparocholecystectomy (VLC).
