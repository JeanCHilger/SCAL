Role of endoscopy in screening of early pancreatic cancer and bile duct cancer. In the screening of early pancreatic cancer and bile duct cancer, the first issue was 'what are the types of abnormality in laboratory data and symptoms in case of early pancreatic cancer and bile duct cancer?' Early cancer in the pancreaticobiliary region has almost no symptoms, however epigastralgia without abnormality in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a sign of early stage pancreaticobiliary cancer. Sudden onset and aggravation of diabetes mellitus is an important change in the case of pancreatic cancer. Extracorporeal ultrasonography is a very useful procedure of checking up changes of pancreatic and biliary lesions. As the role of endoscopy in screening, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most effective means of cancer detection of the pancreas, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is most useful of diagnosis tool for abnormalities of the common bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is an important modality as the procedure of sampling of diagnostic materials. Endoscopic ultrasonography-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has the role of histological diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesion also. Especially, in the case of pancreas cancer without evidence of cancer by pancreatic juice cytology and brushing cytology, EUS-FNA is essential. Intra ductal ultrasonography (IUDS) and perotral cholangioscopy (POCS) are useful for determination of mucosal extent in extrahepatic bile duct cancer. Further improvements of endoscopical technology, endoscopic procedures are expected to be more useful modalities in detection and diagnosis of early pancreatic and bile duct cancers.
