Diagnostics and surgical treatment of solid pseudopapillary pancreas tumors. Solid-pseudopapillary pancreatic tumors (SPPT) are slow-growing tumors and have a considerably good prognosis, in case of radical removal. Thus, results of surgical treatment of 10 patients with SPPT were analyzed. On the basis of ultrasound examination, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative picture 2 groups of patients were formed. 1st group consisted of 3 patients and was characterized by small tumor diameter (2,5-5 sm) and solid structure. The rest 7 patients formed the 2nd group tumor was larger (more than 5 sm) and had a cystic structure. Radiologic features of SPPT were: cystic component of the tumor (especially with papillary structures), hemorragic contents of the cysts, capsule and calcinates both in stroma and capsule. Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be the most effective diagnostic method. All patients with solid-pseudopapillary carcinomas of pancreas had adjuvant chemotherapy. At present all patients are in satisfactory state.
