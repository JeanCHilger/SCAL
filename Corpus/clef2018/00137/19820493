Differentiation of benign and malignant solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas. The aim of this study was to investigate differential imaging features between benign and malignant solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imagings.Between January 2001 and January 2007, we identified 30 patients with confirmed SPN by surgery. The computed tomographic and magnetic resonance images were reviewed by 3 radiologists in consensus. Each tumor was analyzed for the following categories: location of tumor, tumor margin, proportion of solid component, morphology of capsule, growth pattern, calcification, and presence of upstream pancreatic ductal dilatation.Benign SPN usually had oval/round or smoothly lobulated margins, and malignant SPN more commonly had focal lobulated margins (P = 0.027). Presence of complete encapsulation was more frequently seen in benign SPN, whereas focal discontinuity of capsule was more commonly seen in malignant SPN (P = 0.005). There was no statistical difference between benign and malignant tumors in other imaging findings.A focal lobulated margin and a focal discontinuity of the capsule may suggest malignant SPN, whereas a round or smoothly lobulated margin and a complete encapsulation were more commonly seen in benign SPN.
