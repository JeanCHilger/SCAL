Endoscopic treatment for chronic pancreatitis: indications, technique, results. Endoscopic treatment associated with or without extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for chronic pancreatitis has been employed for about 20 years. Although two randomized control trials have revealed the greater effectiveness of surgery as compared to endoscopic treatment for chronic pancreatitis, a considerable number of patients have successfully obtained complete and long-term relief from pain by the less invasive endoscopic treatment. In this review, we discuss the indications, techniques and results of endoscopic treatment and ESWL for painful chronic pancreatitis. We also discuss the characteristic clinical features that are predictive of a good response to endoscopic treatment and ESWL.
