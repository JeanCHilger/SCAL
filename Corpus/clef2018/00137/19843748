Normal dynamic MRI enhancement patterns of the upper abdominal organs: gadoxetic acid compared with gadobutrol. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, at dynamic MRI of the upper abdominal organs, contrast enhancement with gadoxetic acid, a hepatobiliary contrast agent, is comparable with that achieved with an extracellular contrast agent.Dynamic gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI of the pancreas, spleen, kidney, liver, and abdominal aorta was performed on 50 patients dynamic gadobutrol-enhanced MRI was performed on a control group of 50 patientsAll MR images in both groups were of diagnostic quality. During the early dynamic phases, significantly lower mean enhancement indexes were found in the gadoxetic acid group than in the gadobutrol group in the pancreas (portal venous phase, 0.66, 1.39, p <or= 0.001 hepatic venous phase, 0.51, 1.36, p <or= 0.001), spleen (portal venous phase, 1.54, 2.41, p <or= 0.001Early dynamic MRI of the upper abdominal organs, especially the spleen, pancreas, and kidney, benefits from the higher gadolinium concentration of gadobutrol than in the organ-specific contrast agent gadoxetic acid. Higher protein binding resulting in increased relaxivity of gadoxetic acid compensates for the low gadolinium concentration in the abdominal aorta.
