Sarcopenia in an overweight or obese patient is an adverse prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. The average weight-losing pancreatic cancer patient undergoing palliative therapy is frequently overweight rather than underweight, and this can confound conventional measures used for risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate if weight and body composition, specifically sarcopenia, assessed from diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans, is of prognostic value in patients with pancreatic cancer. The nature and extent of tissue loss over subsequent months was also evaluated.A total of 111 patients entering a palliative therapy program, who had CT images and had undergone nutritional screening, were studied. In patients for whom follow-up scans were available (n = 44), longitudinal changes in body composition were studied at a mean of 230 +/- 62 and 95 +/- 60 days prior to demise.Sixty-two patients (55.9%) were sarcopenic, 44 (39.6%) were overweight/obese, and 18 (16.2%) were both. Age > or =59 years (hazard ratio, 1.71 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.66Sarcopenia in overweight/obese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is an occult condition but can be identified using CT scans. This condition is an independent adverse prognostic indicator that should be considered for stratification of patients' entering clinical trials, systemic therapy, or support care programs.
