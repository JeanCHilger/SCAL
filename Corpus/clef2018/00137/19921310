Whipple's procedure for an oligometastasis to the pancreas from a leiomyosarcoma of the thigh. Pancreatic tumours are most frequently primary, with lesions secondary to metastasis uncommon.This report describes the case of a 61-year-old man who underwent resection of a right thigh leiomyosarcoma 2 years prior to presentation with obstructive jaundice. Subsequent CT and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) diagnosed metastatic leiomyosarcoma to the pancreatic head for which he underwent a Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy.Metastasis from an extremity leiomyosarcoma to the pancreas is an extremely rare entity, which can be diagnosed by EUS and treated successfully by pancreaticoduodenectomy.
