Manganese-enhanced MRI of hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries using Mn-DPDP. In this study, Mn-dipyridoxaldiphosphate (MnDPDP), a clinically approved manganese contrast agent for hepatic and pancreatic imaging, was demonstrated for the first time for manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) in brains of normal young rats (n = 4) and rats with hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) insult at postnatal day 7 (n = 8). After a single intraperitoneal injection of low dosage with 0.1micromol/g in postnatal 14 days, 2D T1-weighted image (T1WIs), T1 maps, T2-weighted images (T2WIs) and T2 maps were acquired at 7 Tesla 1 day before, 1 day and 7 days after MnDPDP injection. The image contrast changes induced by MnDPDP appeared as the hyperintensity in T1WIs and the hypointensity in T2WIs. T1 and T2 values decreased in the regions of Mn enhancement. Such enhancement presented as a delayed pattern that was more pronounced in 7 day after MnDPDP injection, suggesting the sustained Mn accumulation due to MnDPDP. Moreover, the MnDPDP enhancement in H-I brains was more pronounced in the lesion sites and was easily detectable in T1WI, T1 map, T2WI and T2 map. The results demonstrated here support the possibility of using MnDPDP as a 'slow release' Mn(2+) for clinical diagnosis of various neuropathologies.
