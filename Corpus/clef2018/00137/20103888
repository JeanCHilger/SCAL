Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the pancreas--a case report. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) of the pancreas is an uncommon tumor with occasional recurrences and rare malignant transformation. We experienced a case of IMT in the body of the pancreas. The patient had no particular symptoms. Dynamic computed tomography revealed a 19-mm lesion in the body of the pancreas.The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, and has remained in good condition without recurrence for 3 years. Preoperative diagnosis of IMT is difficult due to its rarity and the lack of specific findings. Although the prognosis is better than that for pancreatic carcinoma, long-term follow-up is mandatory.
