Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are a heterogeneous group of pancreatic tumors that vary in pathophysiology, malignant potential, clinical course, and outcomes. Their management is heavily predicated on establishing an accurate diagnosis. This can be particularly challenging, but can often be achieved by a thorough history and physical examination combined with high-quality, thin-slice computed tomography, although additional diagnostic tools may be required. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment can range from simple observation to total pancreatectomy. This decision rests on a clear and complete understanding of each disease process in the context of the patient's age and comorbidities. This article reviews the most common cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, focusing on their diagnosis and management.
