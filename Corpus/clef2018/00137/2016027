Magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas with gadolinium-DTPA. Gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA was evaluated as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pancreas at 1.5T. Twenty-five patients were imaged with identical gradient-echo (GE) (TR 47, TE 13, 80 degree pulse angle) and spin-echo (SE) (TR 300, TE 15) MR sequences prior to and following an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA. Marked pancreatic enhancement was demonstrated on dynamic sequential breath-hold GE images obtained immediately following the Gd-DTPA bolus (116% mean enhancement over pre-Gd-DTPA images). Enhancement decreased but persisted on the SE images obtained approximately 5 and 15 min following the Gd-DTPA bolus (65 and 60% mean enhancement, respectively). Five of the patients had a pancreatic mass. In these five patients, the enhancement of pancreatic tissue resulted in improved conspicuity of the mass. These initial results suggest that pancreatic enhancement occurs following an intravenous bolus of Gd-DTPA and has the potential to improve MR visualization of pancreatic masses.
