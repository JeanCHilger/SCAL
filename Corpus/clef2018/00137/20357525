Clinical approach to incidental pancreatic cystic lesions. Cystic lesions of the pancreas are being incidentally recognized with increasing frequency and become a common finding in clinical practice. Despite of recent remarkable advances of radiological and endoscopic assessment and a better understanding of natural history of certain subgroups of cystic lesions, differentiating among lesions and making an optimal management plan is still challenging. A multimodal approach should be performed to evaluate incidentally detected cystic lesions. Emerging evidence supports selective nonoperative management for the majority of patients with cystic lesions, but, for those in whom a suspicion of malignancy remains, surgery is indicated. Concerning long-term follow-up, there is limited data to support the ideal modality, intensity, and duration. Therefore, evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of cystic lesions of the pancreas should be established.
