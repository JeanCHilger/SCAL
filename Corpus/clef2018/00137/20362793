Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a clinicopathologic review. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is an intraductal mucin-producing epithelial neoplasm that arises from the main pancreatic duct (MD-IPMN), secondary branch ducts (BD-IPMN), or both (mixed type Mix-IPMN). Neoplastic progression from benign adenoma to invasive adenocarcinoma has not been proven but is generally thought to occur. With increasing recognition of IPMN, our understanding of the diagnosis and management of the tumors is evolving. At present, treatment options for patients with IPMN range from observation to pancreatic resection depending on the natural history of the lesion. This review focuses on currently available data that guide management decisions for patients with IPMN.
