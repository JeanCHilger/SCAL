Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in children with long common pancreaticobiliary channel: surgical technique and functional outcome. In patients with maljunction of pancreatic and common bile duct (CBD)-defined as a long common pancreaticobiliary channel (LCPC)-a resection of the CBD and a hepaticojejunostomy is recommended. To date, this operation is usually performed through an open approach. In this article, we report on our experience with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for LCPC in children.From 2004 to 2008, 7 children underwent MIS for LCPC. Mean age at operation was 46 months. Two patients had a choledochal cyst (Todani type IV) additionally. Diagnosis was made preoperatively by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography, in 5 children confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography. A four-trocar technique was used for the laparoscopic approach. Follow-up examinations included laboratory tests, ultrasound, and scintigraphy.A Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed in all patients-in 6 children completely by laparoscopy. In 1 child, the operation was converted to open after CBD diversion due to a large, vulnerable liver. In 2 children with extended choledochal cyst, additionally, a reconstruction of the separated hepatic ducts was performed. Reresection of a CBD stump was carried out by laparoscopy in another patient. A leakage of the anastomosis occurred in 1 child.The laparoscopic approach for pathology of pancreaticobiliary ducts might be a new alternative for surgical treatment in infants and children. It can also be performed in cases with choledochal cyst involving the hepatic ducts and for reresection of remnants of CBD.
