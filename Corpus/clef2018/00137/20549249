Sister Mary Joseph's nodule derived from pancreatic cancer. Umbilical metastases known as Sister Mary Joseph's nodules (SMJNs) occur rarely. They are an uncommon clinical or radiographic finding, and are rare as the first sign of a malignant disease. Pancreatic cancer presenting as an SMJN is a rare phenomenon, and is the source of an SMJN in 9% of cases.We experienced four cases of SMJN derived from pancreatic cancer. All cases originated in the tail and/or body of the pancreas.Herein, we introduce a case with pathognomonic imaging findings. We also present the results of our review of recently published papers about SMJN, done by conducting a PubMed search.
