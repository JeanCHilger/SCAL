Carboplatin and docetaxel-induced acute pancreatitis: brief report. A 60-year-old Caucasian female presented with stage IIA (T2N0M0) estrogen- and progesterone-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer. She was started on an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH). She tolerated the first two cycles of the TCH regimen well. However, 3-4 days after the third and fourth cycles, she developed acute pancreatitis. Elevated pancreatic enzymes and abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings confirmed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Common causes of pancreatitis were ruled out. Given the time course it was assumed that the chemotherapy was the cause of pancreatitis in our patient. The patient did not receive any further docetaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy but continued on adjuvant trastuzumab alone for a planned duration of 1 year without any recurrence of acute pancreatitis.
