Application of the medical image three-dimensional visualization system of abdomen in diagnosis and evaluating resectability of pancreatic tumors. To study the value and the clinical application of the Medical Image three-dimensional Visualization System of Abdomen (MI-3DVS) in diagnosis and evaluating resectability of pancreatic tumor.Twelve patients with pancreatic tumor were tested with 64-slice helical CT (64-MSCT) angiography, and the CT data was reconstructed with MI-3DVS from November 2008 to August 2009. The 3D findings were adopted in diagnosis and evaluating resectability, and the results were compared with surgical operation and the pathological finding. There were 7 male and 5 female, aged from 14 to 83 years. Within the 12 cases, there were 4 cases with pancreatic carcinoma, 5 cases with pancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumor, 2 cases with pancreatic serous cystadenoma, 1 case with pancreatic cyst (ductal epithelial papillary hyperplasia).Nine tumors which had been regarded as removable pre-operatively with MI-3DVS were removed successfully. Three patients who were considered unresectable by other hospitals with CT were operated successfully with MI-3DVS. The other 3 patients' tumors were actually not able to be removed as pre-operative evaluation.MI-3DVS plays an important role in diagnosis and assessment of resectability of pancreatic tumor.
