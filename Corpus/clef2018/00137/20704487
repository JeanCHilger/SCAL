Asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting as an orbital metastatic tumor. Although rare, orbital metastatic tumors may be the initial presentation of an asymptomatic primary carcinoma. We report a rare case, with clinicopathological correlation, of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, presenting first in the orbit with symptoms of diplopia, blurring of vision and supraorbital ache. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit showed a left solid intraconal tumor with peripheral rim enhancement. The tumor demonstrated hypointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Excisional biopsy was performed and histopathology confirmed a metastatic adenocarcinoma. Subsequent gastrointestinal imaging and tumor markers revealed an asymptomatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with multiple liver metastases. Our patient developed hepatobiliary sepsis and passed away 44 days after diagnosis. This case highlights the role of early biopsy of atypical orbital tumors in the localization of an asymptomatic primary carcinoma.
