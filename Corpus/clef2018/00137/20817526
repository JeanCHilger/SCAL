Multiple recurrent pancreatic cysts with associated pancreatic inflammation and atrophy in a cat. Previous reports of true pancreatic cysts in cats have suggested that pancreatic cysts in cats are benign incidental findings. This case report describes the progressive clinical course and diagnostic findings in a cat with multiple recurrent pancreatic cysts. The presenting clinical signs included diarrhea, intermittent vomiting, polyphagia, and marked weight loss. Pancreatic cysts were identified via abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT). An exploratory celiotomy and lesion histopathology confirmed multiple true pancreatic cysts of unknown etiology. One month after surgery the cat presented for lethargy and decreased appetite. Clinical re-evaluation was diagnostic for diabetes mellitus and an abdominal ultrasound confirmed recurrence of the pancreatic cysts. The recurrent nature of the pancreatic cysts and the concurrent development of diabetes mellitus were suggestive of progressive loss of pancreatic function or insulin resistance. This is the first described case of multiple recurring pancreatic cysts in a cat associated with pancreatic inflammation, atrophy and endocrine dysfunction.
