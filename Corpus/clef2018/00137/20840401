Endoscopic ultrasound of pancreatic cystic lesions. The impact of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) on the management of pancreatic cystic lesions remains unclear, and there are no published studies of the Australian experience in this area. The aim of this study was to review the experience of EUS for such lesions within our institution.A retrospective review was undertaken of data collected prospectively over a two-year period within the EUS database of St. Vincent's Hospital. Patients who underwent EUS for suspected pancreatic cystic lesions were identified. Data were collected on demographic variables, EUS findings, the results of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and the findings on clinical and radiological follow-up.Fifty-nine patients were identified. Two thirds were female. Most lesions were located at the pancreatic head. Median diameter was 25 mm. FNA was performed in 36 cases (61%). On cytology, six (17%) showed features of mucinous tumours and five (14%) showed adenocarcinoma. The remainder contained either non-specific benign cells or insufficient epithelial tissue. Follow-up data on 48 cases (83%), after a median duration of 15 months, revealed that 15 lesions (31%) had been resected, including six serous and six mucinous tumours. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen in FNA specimens appeared to be higher in mucinous than in serous neoplasms. Twenty-four lesions had undergone repeat radiological imaging: only three had grown in size.EUS and FNA are useful procedures for assessing pancreatic cystic lesions. Malignant features are demonstrated in only a small minority. The majority of the remainder show no signs of progression during follow-up.
