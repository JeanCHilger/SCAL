Pancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumours - EUS FNA is the ideal tool for diagnosis. Solid pseudopapillary tumour (SPT) is a rare tumour of the pancreas with low malignant potential affecting mainly young women difficult to diagnose preoperatively. The aim of this study is to describe the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) features and utility of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) in diagnosing these tumours.A retrospective analysis of SPTs identified in a tertiary institution EUS database between April 2002 and April 2009 was performed. Medical records, imaging, EUS features, cytology and histology specimens were reviewed. Patients were followed up until April 2009.Seven cases of SPTs were indentified out of 2400 EUS performed. All patients were females with a mean age of 41 years (range 22-69). The tumours were solitary with a mean diameter of 2.9 cm (range 2-4.3 cm). Five tumours were located in the body and tail of the pancreas and two in the neck. All lesions were hypoechoic, heterogenous and well circumscribed, with five having a cystic component and two having a calcified rim. FNA using a 22-gauge needle was performed in six cases with no complications. A preoperative diagnosis of SPT based on cytology was obtained in 5/6 cases (83%). Surgical resection was done in six cases with confirmation of SPT and no metastatic disease.EUS-guided FNA is a minimally invasive, safe and reliable way of diagnosing SPT by providing characteristic cytological specimens. Definitive preoperative diagnosis leads to targeted and minimally invasive surgical resection.
