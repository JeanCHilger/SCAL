Cystic pancreatic lesions: a pictorial review and management approach. The majority of cystic pancreatic lesions are incidental findings, especially with the increasing use of advanced imaging modalities for non-related conditions. Most of these lesions were previously attributed to pseudocysts, although cystic neoplasms are now an important differential to be considered and excluded. This article aims to describe the types of cystic pancreatic lesions, demonstrate their imaging findings and discuss the management of these conditions.
