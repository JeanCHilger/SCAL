Incidence of pancreatic carcinoma in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic carcinoma belongs to the area of conditions with late diagnosis and there is no effective screening method. One possible approach to diagnosing so called early adenocarcinoma, therefore, lies in the identification and systematic examination of individuals in risk for this condition.Between 1992 and 2005 we systematically observed 223 individuals diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. In this 14-year period we performed classical biochemical tests, endoscopic ultrasound, CT scans and ERCP, we asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per year and classified individuals consuming regularly more than 80 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for men and 50 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for women as having the alcoholic form of chronic pancreatitis. The remaining patients were classified according to TIGARO classification.Alcohol-related etiology was detected in 73.1% of patients, 21.5% had the chronic obstructive form and only 5.4% were classified as idiopathic pancreatitis. Pancreatic carcinoma was detected in 13 patients with chronic pancreatitis (5.8%), three patients were diagnosed with gastric carcinoma and one with esophageal carcinoma. Pancreatic malignancy developed mainly in patients with the alcoholic form of pancreatitis (4.5%). In the 14 year period 11 subjects died, out of which eight cases were related to pancreatic carcinoma.Pancreatic and extra-pancreatic cancer localized in the gastrointestinal tract are among the serious complications of chronic nonhereditary pancreatitis. Systematic observation of patients with chronic pancreatitis must be performed with the aim of early diagnosis of pancreatic, but not only pancreatic malignancies.
