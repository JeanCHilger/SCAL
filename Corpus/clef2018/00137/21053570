Pancreatic solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm: report of a case in an elderly man with cytologic-histologic correlation. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare and unusual tumors, occurring mostly in young women. Their cytologicfeatures are well described in textbooks however, published reports still show some cytologic findings overlapping with pancreatic endocrine neoplasms and demonstrate the important diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration.A case of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas occurred in a 61-year-old man on cytology it was initially diagnosed as pancreatic endo crine neoplasm. The resection specimen in addition to immunohistochemical stains gave away the diagnosis.Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration remains a valid, minimally invasive procedure in pancreatic cytology. Tumor cells grouped around fibrovascular cores are the most reproducible cytologic finding in these tumors. Immunostains can play an important role when cell block material is available.
