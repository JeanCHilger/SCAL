Choledochal cyst with chronic pancreatitis: presentation and management. Choledochal cysts are benign congenital cystic dilatations of the common bile duct. They are usually associated with pancreatobiliary malunion resulting in long-term complications, such as acute pancreatitis and bile duct cancer. However, the occurrence of chronic pancreatitis with a choledochal cyst is rarely reported.We report three cases of choledochal cysts associated with chronic pancreatitis with their presentation and management. The choledochal cysts were classified according to the Alonso-Lej classification with Todani modifications, based on radiographic and operative findings. Chronic pancreatitis was defined using Marseille criteria (1984). Two patients had a type I choledochal cyst and one had a type IV-A. All cases had chronic calcific pancreatitis with a grossly dilated main pancreatic duct. Abdominal pain was the most common presentation, present in all three patients while jaundice was seen in one patient. The laboratory parameters and MRI/MRCP helped to confirm the diagnosis. All patients underwent cyst excision with drainage and had an uneventful postoperative course. At a median follow-up of 9 months, two patients were asymptomatic and one patient, who developed duodenal obstruction, underwent gastrojejunostomy.the association of a choledochal cyst with chronic pancreatitis may be etiologically related. Excision of the cyst with lateral pancreaticojejunostomy can be performed safely and is usually curative.
