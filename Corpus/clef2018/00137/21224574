A case of rupture of post-gastrectomy afferent loop obstruction due to invasion by pancreatic cancer. A 77-year-old man with history of distal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction for peptic ulcer disease performed 55 years ago was admitted to our hospital for diarrhea and abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a dilatation of the afferent loop and the duodenum, and a low density mass located in the body of the pancreas, which invaded the gastro-jejunal anastomosis site as well as the celiac axis and the superior mesenteric artery. Judging from these findings, we diagnosed this case as acute afferent loop obstruction due to an unresectable pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic decompression of the afferent loop was unsuccessful. After a while, the patient complained a severe abdominal pain, and an emergency surgery was performed under the diagnosis of rupture of the afferent loop. At laparotomy, a perforation of the jejunum located at a 15 cm anal side from Ligament of Treitz was found, and Braun's anastomosis was performed using the perforated site. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and survived for 15 months after the operation. Prompt decompression of afferent loop should be performed for preventing a rupture in case of acute obstruction of the afferent loop.
