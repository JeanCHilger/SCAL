Comparison of three-dimensional negative-contrast CT cholangiopancreatography with three-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatography for the diagnosis of obstructive biliary diseases. The purpose of our study was to compare three-dimensional (3D) negative-contrast CT cholangiopancreatography (3D-nCTCP) with 3D MR cholangiopancreatography (3D-MRCP) for the diagnosis of obstructive biliary diseases.3D-nCTCP and 3D-MRCP were performed on seventy clinically documented obstructive biliary diseases patients. The accuracy of each technique in determining the location and cause of biliary obstruction was evaluated compared with the final clinical diagnoses.Both methods achieved 100% of accuracy in the diagnosis of the presence and location of biliary obstruction, and had a similar sensitivity, specificity, accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant biliary obstruction or calculous from noncalculous biliary obstruction (p>0.05). At 3D-nCTCP, six patients with stones were misinterpreted as cholangitis (N=2), papillitis (N=3), or bile duct adenocarcinoma (N=1) two metastases were mistaken as acute pancreatitis or pancreatic head carcinomas, and one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was misled as bile duct adenoma. At 3D-MRCP, one small stone, one ampullary adenoma, and one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were mistaken as cholangitis, ampullary stone, and intrahepatic bile duct stone, respectively, and three gallbladder carcinomas and another intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were misdiagnosed as hilar cholangiocarcinoma (N=3) or common hepatic duct stone (N=1)3D-nCTCP has the similar effects as 3D-MRCP for the diagnosis of biliary obstruction and, the location and the cause of biliary obstruction. In view of selected cases contraindications for MRI, 3D-nCTCP is a potential substitute.
