A case of drug-induced hepatic injury associated with sitagliptin. A 58-year-old man with a 10-year history of type II diabetes mellitus presented with progressive jaundice that began three days before admission. Thorough history-taking revealed that the patient had started on a new medication, sitagliptin, one month previously for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Laboratory investigations showed severe liver dysfunction. Ultrasonography detected no extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation or gallstones. Abdominal computed tomography excluded pancreatic and hepatic focal lesions. Liver function improved upon discontinuation of sitagliptin. Drugs are an important, often unrecognized, cause of acute liver injury. This report presents a rare case in which sitagliptin was responsible for acute hepatic damage. As demonstrated, a thorough drug history is helpful in any case of unexplained liver injury.
