Primary yolk sac tumor of the common bile duct. Yolk sac tumor (YST) is a germ cell neoplasm usually arising from the gonads. Extragonadal YST has been reported in the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, liver, and pelvis. Primary YST of the common bile duct (CBD) has not been previously reported. We describe an 11-month-old girl with a YST arising from the CBD who presented with obstructive jaundice. Imaging studies revealed an intraluminal CBD mass with intrahepatic biliary dilatation and extraluminal infiltration of the head of the pancreas. A complete resection was carried out, and postoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin was administered.
