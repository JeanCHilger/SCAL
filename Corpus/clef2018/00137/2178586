The current value of classical (conventional) x-ray diagnosis within the scope of complex tumor diagnosis. Conventional X-ray methods and ultrasound tomography are the general basic imaging modalities in oncology. These methods are important for tumor detection as well as for further diagnostic decision making. In the diagnosis of thoracic and bone tumors the conventional X-ray methods still are of high diagnostic value. CT and MRI are complementary methods for extension diagnosis. In the diagnostics of gastrointestinal tumors the complementary endoscopic-radiologic examinations are the initial procedures. Tumors of the liver, pancreas and bile ducts require the application of ultrasound tomography and US-guided fine needle biopsy. In these cases CT provides additional information. Tumors of the kidney can be detected by sonography. Primary diagnostic methods in tumors of the urinary bladder are the cystoscopy, delayed cystography and sonography. CT and MRI are the predominant procedures in the diagnosis of brain and spinal cord tumors. Conventional X-ray methods represent the basic imaging procedures, and, combined with digital radiography, conclusive ultrasound tomography a necessary part of the complex tumor diagnosis.
