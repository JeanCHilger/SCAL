Tumoral and nontumoral pancreas: correlation between quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and histopathologic parameters. To prospectively determine whether dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) quantitative parameters correlate with fibrosis and microvascular density (MVD) in malignant and benign solid pancreatic focal lesions and nontumoral pancreatic tissue.The institutional review board approved the study written informed consent was obtained. DCE MR was performed in 28 patients with surgically resectable focal pancreatic lesions. DCE MR quantitative parameters derived from one-compartment (OC) (transfer rate constant [K(trans)] and distribution fraction [ƒ]) and two-compartment (TC) (K(trans), tissue volume fraction occupied by extravascular extracellular space [v(i)], and tissue volume fraction occupied by vascular space [v(p)]) pharmacokinetic models were correlated with fibrosis content and MVD counts in focal lesions and nontumoral tissue (Spearman correlation coefficient [SCC]). Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared (Mann-Whitney test) between tumoral and nontumoral tissue. Diagnostic performance of DCE MR fibrosis detection was assessed (receiver operator characteristic curve analysis).K(trans) OC and K(trans) TC were significantly lower in primary malignant tumors compared with benign lesions (P = .023) and nontumoral pancreatic tissue downstream (P < .001) and upstream (P = .006) ƒ and v(i) were significantly higher in primary malignant tumors compared with nontumoral pancreatic tissue downstream (P = .012 and .018, respectively). Fibrosis was correlated negatively with K(trans) OC (SCC, -0.600) and K(trans) TC (SCC, -0.564) and positively with ƒ (SCC, 0.514) and v(i) (SCC, 0.464), with P < .001 (all comparisons). MVD was positively correlated with ƒ (SCC, 0.355Quantitative DCE MR parameters, derived from pharmacokinetic models in malignant and benign pancreatic solid lesions and nontumoral pancreatic tissue, were significantly correlated with fibrosis and MVD.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11103515/-/DC1.
