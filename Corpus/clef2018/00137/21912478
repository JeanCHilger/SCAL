Duodenal pseudolymphoma: a case report and review of literature. We report a rare case of duodenal pseudolymphoma without any symptoms. The lesion located in front of the head of the pancreas was found accidentally during a medical examination. The findings of computed tomography and positron emission tomography-computed tomography suggested a stromal tumor or malignant lymphoma. Surgical resection was performed. The lesions were pathologically diagnosed as duodenal pseudolymphoma.
