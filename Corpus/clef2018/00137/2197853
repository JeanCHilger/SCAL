Duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas in treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Twenty-four patients underwent duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas for chronic pancreatitis of the head. All patients were reassessed in our follow-up clinic. Comparison with partial duodenopancreatectomy showed that both procedures can alleviate the majority of symptoms. However, duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas has lower early and late postoperative complication rates. It facilitates occupational rehabilitation, does not alter the patients glucose metabolism, and leaves fewer patients symptomatic in long-term follow-up. A higher rate of recurrence of pancreatitis of the tail is not found. Duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas is thus considered to be an alternative to partial duodenopancreatectomy in treatment of severe chronic pancreatitis of the head.
