Dual-source dual-energy computed tomography imaging of acute necrotizing pancreatitis--Preliminary study. To investigate the clinical value of dual-source computed tomography dual-energy technology in the imaging diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.Thirty-two cases with diagnosed acute necrotizing pancreatitis and underwent contrast-enhanced dual-source dual-energy CT in portal venous phase were retrospectively analyzed. Difference of CT value between pancreatic parenchyma and necrosis, contrast to noise ratio of pancreatic parenchyma-to-necrosis and score of subjective diagnosis were measured, calculated and assessed on CT images of 80 kV, 140 kV and weighted-average 120 kV.The difference of CT value between pancreatic parenchyma and necrosis in the images of 80 kV, 140 kV and weighted-average 120 kV was (67.22 +/- 21.11) HU, (42.91 +/- 15.12) HU, (48.78 +/- 16.13) HU contrast to noise ratio of pancreatic parenchyma-to-necrosis in the images of each group was 8.35 +/- 3.63, 5.89 +/- 2.67, 7.72 +/- 3.58At portal venous phase dual-sourcedual-energy enhancement CT, the demonstration of pancreas necrosis is better than those at 80 kV, 140 kV and weighted-average 120 kV in the diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
