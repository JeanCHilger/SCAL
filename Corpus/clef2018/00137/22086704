Robotic central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy (transgastric approach) in a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Function preserving minimal invasive pancreatectomy is thought to be ideal approach for benign and borderline malignant tumors of the pancreas because these tumors can be expected for longterm survival. Pancreatic tumor in the neck of the pancreas is a challenging issue. Pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy with/without splenectomy are the usual modes of surgery for them. Central pancreatectomy is a rare surgical procedure, even in open surgery. With the development of laparoscopic experiences, a few cases of laparoscopic central pancreatectomy have begun to be reported, but they are believed to be still demanding tremendous laparoscopic skills and experiences. However, advancements in technology have encouraged surgeons to overcome the limitations of conventional laparoscopic surgery. Herein, we report a case of robot-assisted central pancreatectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy (transgastric approach). Wrist-like movements of effector instruments and stable 3-D visualization provided by the robot surgical system are believed to enhance the precise and safe laparoscopic performance. More experiences need to be accumulated in order to evaluate the real value of robot pancreatic surgery.
