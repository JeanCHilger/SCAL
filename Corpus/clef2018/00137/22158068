Pancreatoduodenectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in uncinate process pancreatic cancer. The objective of the study was to delineate surgical outcomes of pancreatoduodenectomy following neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) in uncinate process pancreatic cancer (UPC).We reviewed 97 patients with resected usual pancreatic head cancer (PHC) and UPC and analyzed clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of PHC and UPC with a review of the reported literature regarding UPC.Twenty-five patients (27.8%) had UPC, and 72 patients had PHC. Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was performed in 67 patients (69.1%) and conventional pancreatoduodenectomy in 28 patients (28.9%), and 2 patients needed total pancreatectomies. When comparing UPCs with PHCs, less frequent jaundice (P = 0.009) and more advanced stages of cancers at the time of diagnosis (linear-to-linear association, P = 0.03) were found in UPCs, and CCRT was administered more frequently in UPCs (P = 0.013). Survival outcomes between PHC and UPC were similar, with median survival rates of 25.9 and 30.5 months, respectively (P = 0.702). In addition, disease-free survival was similar between the 2 groups (15.6 and 15.2 months, respectively P = 0.4503). Our oncologic outcome of pancreatectomy for UPC is likely to be more acceptable compared with those previously reported in the literature.Although UPCs are found in relatively advanced clinical stages, favorable oncologic outcomes may be obtained by pancreatectomy following preoperative CCRT.
