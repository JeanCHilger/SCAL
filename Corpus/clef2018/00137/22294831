Efficacy of intraductal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of non-opaque choledocholith. To evaluate the efficacy of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) in the diagnosis of non-opaque, common bile duct stones.A total of 183 patients (102 males, mean age 73 years 81 females, mean age 70 years) with suspected common bile duct stones diagnosed through abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and abdominal Type-B ultrasound were included in the study. The diagnosis was confirmed through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by IDUS.A total of 183 patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones were included in the study as follows: 36 patients with high-density CBD stones, 68 patients with sand-like stones, 44 patients with low-density stones, 21 patients with ampullary cancer, and 14 patients with pancreatic cancer. Conventional imaging revealed 124 cases of choledochectasia, and only 36 cases of suspected CBD stones ERCP revealed 145 cases of CBD stones with three missed diagnoses. IDUS revealed 148 cases of CBD stones, 21 cases of ampullary tumors, and 14 cases of pancreatic cancer.IDUS was more effective in the diagnosis of bile duct stones than ERCP, upper abdominal CT or upper abdominal MRI.
