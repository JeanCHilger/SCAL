Dynamic telecytopathology for on-site preliminary diagnosis of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic masses. We evaluated dynamic telecytopathology for on-site-evaluation of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) samples of the pancreas. Realtime images of stained cytology smears were assessed by a cytopathologist while communicating with the on-site operator by telephone. A total of 55 consecutive cases was assessed preliminary diagnoses of benign, atypical/suspicious and positive for malignancy were 69%, 7% and 24%. We also reviewed 55 consecutive cases of EUS-guided FNA of pancreas which had had conventional microscopic on-site evaluation prior to the introduction of telecytopathology. Preliminary diagnoses of benign, atypical/suspicious and positive for malignancy were 60%, 9% and 31%. The overall concordance between the preliminary and final diagnosis was 84% for telecytopathology and 87% for conventional microscopy. Neuroendocrine neoplasms and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma were diagnostically challenging for both telecytopathology and conventional microscopy. Telecytopathology was similar in accuracy of preliminary diagnosis to conventional microscopy during EUS-FNA of pancreas.
