Large intestine bleeding caused by the lienal artery pseudoaneurysm rupture complicating a pancreatic pseudocyst. Bleeding pseudoaneurysm of a peripancreatic artery is a rare cause of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Arterial pseudoaneurysm develops as a result of partial enzymatic damage of arterial wall in acute or chronic pancreatitis. The authors report the case of a 60-years old man with bleeding into the lienal flexure of the colon due to the erosion of the pseudoaneurysm of a branch of splenic artery into the pancreatic pseudocyst in the tail region of the pancreas communicating with the colon. The diagnosis was established by CT-scan and angiography. The patient underwent surgery with the ligation of the bleeding vessel and the resection of the part of the colon.
