Multi-slice computed tomography for diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasms and serous cystadenomas of the pancreas. To assess the value of multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of  pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms and serous cystadenoma.The MSCT images were reviewed for 19 pathologically confirmed cases of pancreatic mucinous cystadenomas and 13 cases of pancreatic serous cystadenomas (n=13) treated in our center between July, 2003 and December, 2009. The CT features were analyzed including the tumor location, contour, dimension of the largest cyst, cystic wall, septation, presence of calcification, solid component, pancreatic atrophy, main pancreatic duct dilatation, and lesion margins.Significant differences were found between the two groups in lesion diameter  (P=0.009), cyst distribution of the largest cyst (>2 cm) (P=0.01), and the presence of solid component (P=0.02).MSCT can be of important value in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of  pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms and serous cystadenomas.
