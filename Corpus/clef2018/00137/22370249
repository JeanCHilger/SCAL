Endovascular treatment of a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm associated with gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding from the pancreatic duct originating from aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms of peripancreatic arteries. It is a life-threatening cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that should always be considered in patients with prolonged or intermittent obscure gastrointestinal blood loss, or both, especially in patients with pancreatic disorders or prior pancreatic surgery. We demonstrate an endovascular treatment strategy in a patient with a common hepatic pseudoaneurysm and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding, with preserved flow in the hepatic artery. This treatment consisted of a covered stent placement in the hepatic artery, followed by transcatheter coil embolization of collateral feeding arteries.
