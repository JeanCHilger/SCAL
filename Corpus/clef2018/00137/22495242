Use of fat suppression in R₂ relaxometry with MRI for the quantification of tissue iron overload in beta-thalassemic patients. To assess the performance and results of R(2) relaxometry using a fat-suppressed (FS) multiecho sequence and compare these to conventional R(2) relaxometry in estimating tissue iron overload.Relaxation rate values (R(2)=1/T2) of the liver, spleen, pancreas and vertebral bone marrow (VBM) were estimated in 21 patients with β-thalassemia major, using a respiratory-triggered 16-echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo sequence before (R(2)) and after (R(2) FS) the application of chemically selective fat suppression.Hepatic and splenic R(2) FS values correlated with respective R(2) values (r=0.98 and r=0.96, P<.001), whereas correlations between R(2) FS and R(2) values for pancreas and VBM were not statistically significant. Bland-Altman plots show disagreement between R(2) and R(2) FS values, particularly for pancreas and VBM. Hepatic, pancreatic and VBM R(2) FS values correlated with serum ferritin (r=0.88, P<.001 r=0.51, P<.003Application of fat suppression in the standard CPMG sequence improved the capability of MRI in noninvasive quantification of iron, particularly in lipid-rich tissues, such as vertebral bone marrow (VBM) and pancreas.
