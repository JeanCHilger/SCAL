Complex communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformation with pancreatic heterotopy depicted with fetal magnetic resonance imaging: a case report. Bronchopulmonary foregut malformation (BPFM) is a group of rare congenital anomalies that affect the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tracts. We report here the first case of prenatal depiction of communicating BPFM, including extrapulmonary sequestration and foregut cyst, both with pancreatic differentiation. Magnetic resonance imaging on the fetus confirmed a polymalformative syndrome with right-lung and gastric cysts and allowed the detection of respiratory and alimentary tracts communication and aberrant feeding vessels. Diagnosis was confirmed after birth by multidetector computed tomography and postnatal pathologic findings. The patient, a boy, underwent surgery for respiratory distress at 4 weeks of life. This singular case confirms the benefits of early surgery for communicating BPFM.
