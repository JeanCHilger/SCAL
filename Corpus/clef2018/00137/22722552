The role of chronic inflammation: chronic pancreatitis as a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic carcinoma is a condition with late diagnosis and one for which there is no effective screening method. One possible diagnostic approach of so-called early adenocarcinoma is the identification and systematic examination of individuals at risk for this condition. Between 1992 and 2005 we systematically observed 223 individuals diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. In this 14-year period we performed classical biochemical tests, endoscopic ultrasound, CT scans and ERCP. We also asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per year and classified individuals consuming regularly more than 80 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for men and 50 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for women as having the alcoholic form of chronic pancreatitis. The remaining patients were classified according to the TIGARO classification. Alcohol-related etiology was detected in 73.1% of patients, 21.5% had the chronic obstructive form and only 5.4% were classified as idiopathic pancreatitis. Pancreatic carcinoma was detected in 13 patients with chronic pancreatitis (5.8%), 3 patients were diagnosed with gastric carcinoma and 1 with esophageal carcinoma. Pancreatic malignancy developed mainly in patients with the alcoholic form of pancreatitis (4.5%). In the 14-year period 11 subjects died, out of which 8 cases were related to pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic and extrapancreatic cancer localized in the gastrointestinal tract are serious complications of chronic nonhereditary pancreatitis. Systematic observation of patients with chronic pancreatitis must be performed with the aim of early diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies (but also including other types).
