Laparoscopic resection of an epidermoid cyst within an intrapancreatic accessory spleen:  a case report and review article. We report a case of an epidermoid cyst within an intrapancreatic accessory spleen that was treated by laparoscopic excision. A 39-year-old man with no abdominal symptoms was incidentally found to have a cystic pancreatic lesion on computed tomography scan undertaken for suspected deep vein thrombosis. Further computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed similar findings and the laparoscopic resection of the distal pancreas and spleen was undertaken as malignancy could not be excluded. Microscopic analysis revealed a well-circumscribed epidermoid cyst within a thin splenic rim in the tail of the pancreas.Such histologic diagnoses are extremely rare, and this is the 26th case report to our knowledge in English language journals. These lesions should be treated surgically to exclude malignancy. This is the first case reported in the United Kingdom and the first to be excised by pure laparoscopic means, which we believe provides effective and successful surgical management.
