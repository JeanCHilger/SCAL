Common bile duct syndrome in children. Two children bile duct dilatation due to anomalous junction of the pancreato-biliary ductal system are reported. A long common channel comes out of the duodenal wall and, thus, reflux of pancreatic juice into the biliary tree and dilatation of biliary ducts may occur. Clinical findings were upper abdominal pain, vomiting, or jaundice. Diagnosis was accomplished by abdominal ultrasonography and endoscopic or intra-operative colangiography. Both cases were treated by Roux-en-Y hepatico-jejunostomy, the best technique for these cases. Follow-up showed that the patients are well and free of symptoms.
