Effectiveness of combined endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and stenting in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) can be coupled with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the same setting when biliary and/or duodenal stenting are required.Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of EUS-FNA combined with stenting during the same session in patients with pancreatic cancer.Consecutive patients referred for EUS-FNA of a pancreatic mass with symptoms of biliary (Â±upper digestive) obstruction were included. Consecutive patients undergoing biliary and/or duodenal stenting without EUS-FNA during the same period were used as controls. Procedure-related complications were the primary outcome measure. Duration of the procedure, ability to achieve biliary/duodenal stenting, the yield of EUS-FNA, and clinical outcomes were evaluated.A total of 122 patients underwent combined EUS-FNA and stenting and 68 underwent stenting alone (control group). In the combined group, histological proof of cancer was obtained in 88.52% at first EUS-FNA and 95.08% after a second EUS-FNA. Biliary stent placement was successful in 97.5 and 98% in the combined and the control groups, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the groups for length of stay after endoscopy and for procedure-related mortality and morbidity within 30 days. The median time from endoscopy to chemotherapy in the combined group was 12 days.Combined EUS-FNA and biliary and/or duodenal stenting is feasible in almost all patients with suspected pancreatic cancer, with no additional hazard and a high histological yield.
