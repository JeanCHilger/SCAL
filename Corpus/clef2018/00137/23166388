Tumor aggressiveness and patient outcome in cancer of the pancreas assessed by dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT. This study aimed to assess the role of a quantitative dynamic PET model in pancreatic cancer as a potential index of tumor aggressiveness and predictor of survival.Seventy-one patients with (18)F-FDG-avid adenocarcinoma of the pancreas before treatment were recruited, including 27 with localized tumors (11 underwent pancreatectomy, and 16 had localized nonresectable tumors) and 44 with metastatic disease. Dynamic (18)F-FDG PET images were acquired over a 60-min period, followed by a whole-body PET/CT study. Quantitative data measurements were based on a 2-compartment model, and the following variables were calculated: VB (fractional blood volume in target area), K(1) and k(2) (kinetic membrane transport parameters), k(3) and k(4) (intracellular (18)F-FDG phosphorylation and dephosphorylation parameters, respectively), and (18)F-FDG INF (global (18)F-FDG influx).The single significant variable for overall survival (OS) in patients with localized disease was (18)F-FDG INF. Patients with a high (18)F-FDG INF (>0.033 min(-1)) had a median OS of 6 and 5 mo for nonresectable and resected tumors, respectively, versus 15 and 19 mo for a low (18)F-FDG INF in nonresectable and resected tumors, respectively (P < 0.04). In metastatic disease, multivariate analysis found VB, K(1), and k(3) to be significant variables for OS (P < 0.043, <0.031, and <0.009, respectively). Prognostic factors for OS in the entire group of patients that were significant at multivariate analysis were stage of disease, VB, K(1), and (18)F-FDG INF (P < 0.00035, <0.03, <0.024, and <0.008, respectively). Median OS for all patients with a high (18)F-FDG INF, low VB, and high K(1) was 3 mo, as opposed to 14 mo in patients with a low (18)F-FDG INF, high VB, and low K(1) (P < 0.021), irrespective of stage and resectability.Quantitative (18)F-FDG kinetic parameters measured by dynamic PET in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer correlated with the aggressiveness of disease. The (18)F-FDG INF was the single most significant variable for OS in patients with localized disease, whether resectable or not.
