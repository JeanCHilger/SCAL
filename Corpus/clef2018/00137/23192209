Imaging studies of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas: 2-tone duct sign and cork-of-wine-bottle sign as indicators of intraductal tumor growth. The objective of this study was to describe the imaging findings for intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas.Eleven pancreatic tumors pathologically confirmed as intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm were retrospectively collected. The dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging including MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), ultrasound, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) results were reviewed. The 2-tone duct sign and cork-of-wine-bottle sign were reviewed as indicators of intraductal tumor growth on CT/MR and MRCP/ERCP images, respectively.A 2-tone duct sign was noted on the dynamic CT images (7/10, 70%) and on the MR imaging (5/8, 63%). The distal main pancreatic duct was dilated in all the patients except one, who had a branch duct lesion. A cork-of-wine-bottle sign was observed on the MRCP image (3/8, 38%) and on the ERCP image (3/6, 50%).Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms are rare tumors showing characteristic imaging findings such as the 2-tone duct sign and the cork-of-wine-bottle sign that represent their intraductal growth.
