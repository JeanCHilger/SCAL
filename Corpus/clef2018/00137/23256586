Intraluminal duodenal diverticula: collective review with report of a laparoscopic excision. A comprehensive review of intraluminal duodenal diverticulum (IDD) is presented, along with a report of a completely laparoscopic excision of this duodenal abnormality as well as a report of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrating the classic fluoroscopic "wind sock sign" pathognomonic appearance of IDD. IDD may easily be missed unless one specifically considers this entity in patients presenting with symptoms of foregut disease. Patients with IDD typically present in the fourth decade of life with duration of symptoms less than 5 years that typically include pain, nausea and vomiting, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis usually requires imaging studies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Laparoscopic excision is recommended because of superior visualization of significant intestinal anatomic abnormalities, the need for accurate ampullary localization, and the ability to facilitate complete diverticular excision while maintaining biliary and pancreatic ductal integrity. Review of surgical literature suggests that IDD results from congenital duodenal developmental abnormalities matured by long-term duodenal peristalsis.
