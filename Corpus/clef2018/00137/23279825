Necrolytic migratory erythema associated with glucagonoma syndrome diagnosed by ⁶⁸Ga-DOTANOC PET-CT. Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is a rare dermatological condition which presents a diagnostic challenge. Repeated negative skin biopsies and non-detection of any pancreatic tumor in conventional imaging modalities like a computed tomography (CT) scan and ultrasonogram (USG) make the diagnosis more difficult. By the time the diagnosis is made, the patient usually presents with metastasis. We present a rare case of difficult to diagnose NME, as repeated skin biopsies and conventional imaging modalities like CT and USG could not detect the underlying glucagonoma. A (68)Ga-DOTANOC positron emission tomography PET-CT was able to detect the underlying cause of NME as glucagonoma of the pancreas and the same investigation confirmed the absence of any metastasis elsewhere in the body. The tumor was excised and patient dramatically improved, and all skin lesions disappeared.
