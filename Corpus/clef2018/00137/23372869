Isolated pancreatic tuberculosis: a case report and radiological comparison with cystic pancreatic lesions. Pancreatic tuberculosis is rare and can occur in the absence of evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body. Here we review the radiological appearance of pancreatic tuberculosis and compare it with other cystic pancreatic lesions, including common lesions (pseudocysts, serous or mucinous cystadenomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm) and rare lesions such as solid pseudopapillary tumors, etc. Their typical localizations within the pancreas and their malignant potential are presented. Knowledge of these can assist radiologists and clinicians in selecting the best approach towards making the correct diagnosis.
