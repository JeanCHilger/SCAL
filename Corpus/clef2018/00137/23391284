The increasing role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the management of pancreatic and biliary disease. Pancreatic and biliary disease continues to have a significant impact on the workload of the National Health Service (NHS), for which there exists a multimodality approach to investigation and diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is fast becoming a fundamental tool in this cohort of patients, not only because of its ability to provide superior visualization of a difficult anatomical region, but also because of its valuable role as a problem-solving tool and ever-improving ability in an interventional capacity. We provide a comprehensive review of the benefits of EUS in everyday clinical practice.
