Chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic malignancy: clinical and radiological differential diagnosis of pancreas head space-occupying mass. Chronic pancreatitis can be complicated both by an inflammatory benign mass and by the development of pancreatic cancer. The distinction of these complications is not only difficult but also crucial as patients suffering from either of the two have significantly different prognoses. This article describes typical clinical and radiological findings, which may help the physician in differentiating these two maladies. Furthermore, we conducted a retrospective study where we evaluated the clinical patterns in patients with chronic pancreatitis who underwent resection for a pancreatic mass. Although certain findings may be indicative for benign tumors, none of the diagnostic tools available offers a sufficient degree of certainty. In cases of tumors secondary to autoimmune pancreatitis the diagnostic error is exceptionally high. Because of the poor prognosis related to untreated pancreatic cancer, the general recommendation is to perform resection of the tumor when technically possible and when carcinoma cannot be ruled out completely.
