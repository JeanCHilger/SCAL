IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease is a multiorgan lymphoproliferative disease distinct from Sjögren's syndrome: a Caucasian patient and literature review. This paper aims to report a case of IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease with a systematic review.The relevant English literature was searched using the keywords 'Mikulicz's disease' and 'IgG4'. Original and review articles were reviewed, and the clinical scenarios were exemplified with a case report.A 49-year-old Caucasian man presented with axillary lymphadenopathy and bilateral parotid/submandibular enlargement. A chest computerized tomography showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with low metabolic activity on the position emission tomography. A histopathological study showed an IgG4/IgG ratio of 75% in the plasma cells of the submandibular glands, associated with high levels of total serum IgG and IgG4. He had dry mouth, but minor salivary gland biopsy was negative without xerophthalmia. He had nasal obstruction and dyspnea, notably with supine position/cervical rotation, which substantially improved with glucocorticoid treatment. He had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus with hyperlipasaemia and diffuse pancreatic swelling supportive of autoimmune pancreatitis.Our case report supports the literature that there are similarities between IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease and Sjögren's syndrome, but the differences are significant. IgG4-related Mikulicz's disease is a multi-organ lymphoproliferative disease distinct from Sjögren's syndrome.
