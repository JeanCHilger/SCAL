Clinics in diagnostic imaging. 145. A 63-year-old man presented with painless jaundice, loss of appetite and significant weight loss. Cross-sectional imaging showed a diffusely enlarged pancreas, with no significant fat stranding and a hypodense rim on computed tomography, which appeared hypointense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. There was a narrowed pancreatic duct and features of common bile duct narrowing in the region of the pancreatic head. However, there was no obvious mass seen in the pancreatic head region. These features were classical of autoimmune pancreatitis with diffuse involvement of the gland. Laboratory investigation showed abnormal liver function and the classical sign of raised immunoglobulin G class 4 antibodies. The patient showed dramatic response to high-dose steroids, with resolution of both the laboratory and imaging abnormalities within one month. We discuss the classical imaging features of Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis, an uncommon condition that needs to be differentiated from pancreatic malignancy.
