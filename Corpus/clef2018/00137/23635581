Retropancreatic retroperitoneal tumors: a 30-year experience with 38 cases. Retropancreatic retroperitoneal tumors (RRTs) are seldom encountered in clinical practice. The lack of characteristics on clinical presentation and imaging make preoperative diagnosis difficult and surgical management remains a challenge. This retrospective report surveys the presenting diagnosis and surgical management of 38 patients with RRTs presenting at our center between August 1981 and May 2012. Six patients were misdiagnosed on the basis of computerized tomography and one each by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Tumors were localized posterior to the pancreatic head and uncinate process (n = 18) posterior to the neck and body of the pancreas (n = 9)
