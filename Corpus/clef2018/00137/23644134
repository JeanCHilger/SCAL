Diagnosis and treatment of glucagonoma: report of one case. glucagonoma is a rare islet alpha-cell tumor. We report a case of glucagonoma in a 55-year-old male patient with such clinical findings of necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes mellitus, body weight loss, and anemia. CT examination found a space-occupying lesion in the pancreas, and an elevated serum glucagon level indicate the diagnosis of glucagonoma, which was confirmed postoperatively by pathological examination of the tumor tissue. A definite diagnosis of glucagonoma relies on pathological report, and so far no standard treatment strategy has been available for this tumor. Surgical resection is an effective means for treatment of glucagonoma.
