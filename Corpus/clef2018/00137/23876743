Preoperative diagnosis of a solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas by Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Biopsy: A retrospective case series. A solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas (SPTP) is a rare neoplasm.We herein present five cases of SPTP diagnosed using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided fine-needle biopsy (FNB) using a needle with side fenestration (ProCore-needle).From January 2011 to June 2012 in five patients with SPTP tissue acquisition was carried out with a 19-gauge (4 patients) or a 22-gauge (one patient) needle.The mean age of the patients was 30.8 years, the mean lesion size was 49mm and the most common location was the tail of the pancreas (3 cases). When the samples were evaluated macroscopically, small core fragments were observed in all cases. A preoperative diagnosis of SPTP was made in all patients on the basis of the histocytological and characteristic immunophenotypic patterns and was confirmed at final surgical histology.In our experience, EUS-FNB is an effective and secure method for a preoperative diagnosis of SPTP.
