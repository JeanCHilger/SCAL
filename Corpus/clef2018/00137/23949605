Cystic tumor on the porta hepatis. A cystic entity from the porta hepatis of a 64-year-old female patient was sent in for rapid section diagnostics with a clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer. The rapid section diagnostics revealed aspects of glandular proliferation with mucous-like material in the lumina which led to the suspicion of infiltration of a highly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. However, conventional paraffin-section histology and the immunohistochemical marker profile could not confirm this suspicion but an adenomatoid tumor was diagnosed. In typical locations in the genital area of both genders, this entity is a current differential diagnosis to infiltrations of an adenocarcinoma.
