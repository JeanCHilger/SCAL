A case of alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen and human chorionic gonadotropin producing renal cell carcinoma. A 51-year-old woman was admitted with a complaint of a left hypochondralgia and an abdominal mass. Laboratory testing showed a markedly increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (234,700 ng/ml). The enlargement of the left kidney and the adrenal gland was noted by CT scan and a tumorous thrombus was shown by inferior caval venography. The patient underwent a left nephrectomy, a combined resection of the spleen, tail of the pancreas and the removal of a tumorous caval thrombus. The patients AFP level gradually decreased after surgery. In a histological study, the tumor was diagnosed as a renal cell carcinoma and the presence of AFP, CEA, and HCG in the cancer cells was demonstrate by means of the "PAP" method.
