Surgical treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have formed a certain nosologic group in 2000 yr. Precise diagnosis may be established basing only on the results of immunohistochemical investigation and the CD 117 revealing. The results of treatment of 32 patients, suffering GIST in 2007 - 2012 yrs were adduced. Clinical signs of GIST are nonspecific. Examination must include the upper endoscopy conduction, as well as abdominal ultrasonography and computeric tomography. Gastric GIST was diagnosed in 65.6% patients, the small intestinal--in 9.4%, colonic--in 9.4%, pancreatic-- in 3.1%. The operation volume depends on localization, dimensions and spread of the tumor.
