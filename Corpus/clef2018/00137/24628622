Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration with fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in 104 patients with pancreatic mass. Diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy is often based on cytological specimens collected by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA). Several factors can decrease sensitivity of EUS FNA for pancreatic cancer: well-differentiated tumors, pancreatitis, blood, necrosis and slides with low cellularity. The objective of this study is to report on the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis combined with cytology in pancreatic masses.EUS database and medical records of patients referred for EUS between January 2009 through august 2013 were reviewed. Data on cytology, FISH and surgical pathology were reviewed. Surgical pathology, death or extended clinical follow-up were used to verify correct diagnosis of malignancy. FISH performed using a four-set DNA probe for chromosomes 3, 7, 17, and band 9p21 in patients with inconclusive immediate cytology reading. Sensitivity of cytology and FISH were compared.Study cohort comprised of 104 patients with FISH analysis on EUS FNA specimens of pancreatic masses (74 adenocarcinoma, 7 neuroendocrine tumor and 23 benign. Sensitivity of cytology and FISH for carcinoma was respectively: 62% and 81%. Sensitivity of FISH + cytology was 89%. The specificity of FISH and cytology was 100%. The most common abnormality on FISH was a 9p21 deletion seen in 43 patients (58%) followed by polysomy of 7 (46%). FISH detected malignancy in 23 patients with negative cytology.In patients with inconclusive immediate cytology reading, FISH is superior to cytology and improves overall sensitivity. The 9p21 deletion is the most common abnormality seen in this cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer.
