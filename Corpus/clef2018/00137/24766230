The role of endoscopic ultrasound in the radiation treatment of pancreatic tumor. Radiotherapy is an established treatment modality for patients with pancreatic cancer. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) allows the delivery of high doses to the tumour, while sparing the sensitive tissues around it, thus reducing side effects. However, the need of precisely contouring and identifying the target lesion is mandatory to be able to perform IGRT. Endoscopic ultrasound has been progressively implemented in the field of radiotherapy as a tool for intra-lesional placement of fiducial markers to perform IGRT and for direct placing of sealed radioactive sources in contact with the target lesions. In the current paper we provide an updated review on the role of endoscopic ultrasound in the radiation treatment of pancreatic cancer, highlighting areas of future research.
