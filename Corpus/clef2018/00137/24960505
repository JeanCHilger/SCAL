Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy in a solitary true pancreatic cyst. Solitary true pancreatic cysts (STPCs), or epithelial cysts, are benign lesions that are extremely rare in adult patients. Advances in radiographic techniques have improved the ability to identify pancreatic cystic lesions. We report a case of a large and symptomatic STPC in a 47-year-old female patient who was treated successfully with spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. We also review the clinical and pathologic features of all reported STPCs within the past 25 years.To compose the review, we did a search of the international literature for STPCs that had occurred in adults. Fourteen related articles were found describing cases of STPCs. Clinical and pathologic information was collected for all of the reported pancreatic cysts, and a database was formed. STPCs are detected more frequently in women than in men. The mean age of occurrence is 43.2 years, and the mean cyst size is 5.6 cm. Fifty percent of true cysts are located in the head of the pancreas. Size and site are responsible for the symptoms caused, although 22.8% were asymptomatic. Diagnosis was made postoperatively in all cases by histopathologic studies. No case of malignancy was reported in any STPC.STPCs are rare and benign lesions commonly discovered incidentally during abdominal imaging. Surgical treatment is considered the appropriate therapy for large and symptomatic STPCs. The definitive diagnosis is established by histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies.
