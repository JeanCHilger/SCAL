A Spanish multicenter study to estimate the prevalence and incidence of chronic pancreatitis and its complications. No nation-wide epidemiological study on the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis (CP) had been thus far carried out in Spain. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence and incidence of CP, as well as to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic criteria used in Spanish pancreas units.An observational, descriptive study of hospital pancreas units in Spain. CP-related epidemiology, etiology, manifestations, diagnostic tests, functional complications, and treatments were all assessed using a structured questionnaire. Overall results were estimated by weighting cases in each site.Information was collected from six pancreas units with a sample frame of 1,900,751 inhabitants. Overall prevalence was 49.3 cases per 105 population (95 % CI, 46 to 52) and incidence was 5.5 cases per 105 inhabitant-years (95 % CI, 5.4 to 5.6). Most common etiologies included tobacco and alcoholism, which were associated with three in every four cases. The most prevalent symptoms were recurring pain (48.8 %) and chronic abdominal pain (30.6 %). The most widely used diagnostic method was echoendoscopy (79.8 %), CT (computerized tomography) (58.7 %), and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)/MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) (55.9 %). Most prevalent morphologic findings included calcifications (35 %) and pseudocysts (27 %). Exocrine (38.8 %) and endocrine (35.2 %) pancreatic insufficiency had both a similar frequency. Treatments used were rather heterogeneous among sites, with enzyme replacement therapy (40.7 %) and insulin (30.9 %) being most commonly used.Pancreas units amass a significant number of both prevalent and incident CP cases. Patients seen in these units share a similar typology, and differences between units are greater regarding diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
