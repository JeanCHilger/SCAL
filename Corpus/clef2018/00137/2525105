Psoas muscle pancreatic pseudocyst: CT--US diagnosis and percutaneous drainage. We present 2 cases of psoas muscle pancreatic pseudocysts. In both cases there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of recent acute pancreatitis. The route of extension for the pseudocyst from the pancreas to the psoas was the perirenal space. In both cases the diagnosis was made on the basis of imaging studies and the pseudocysts resolved with percutaneous drainage only.
