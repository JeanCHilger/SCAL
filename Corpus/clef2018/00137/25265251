Detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) using semi-quantitative [68Ga]DOTATOC PET in combination with multiphase contrast-enhanced CT. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) pose a diagnostic challenge with respect to the physiologic somatostatin receptor expression in the uncinate process representing a potential pitfall for receptor imaging with PET/CT.We identified 49 PNETs from a total of 316 consecutive [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT examinations for whom the detections rates of PET and multiphase contrast enhanced (CE-) CT could be retrospectively compared and 38 PNETs for which SUVmax and SUVmax target-to-liver ratios could be calculated for the tumors and the uncinate process.The detection rate of PET (83.7%) was higher than of the different CT phases (arterial: 59.2%, P=0.017 portal-venous: 38.8%, P<0.001Patients with PNETs should undergo [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT with at least an arterial and venous phase CT scan. SUVmax and SUVmax target-to-liver ratios provide additional information but do no reliably separate PNETs from normal tracer uptake in the uncinate process.
