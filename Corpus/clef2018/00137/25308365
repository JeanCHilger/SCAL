Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas:a management dilemma. Pancreatic lymphoepithelial cysts (LECs) are rare, benign lesions that are typically unexpected post-operative pathological findings. We aimed to review clinical, radiological and pathological features of LECs that may allow their pre-operative diagnosis. Histopathology databases of two large pancreatic units were searched to identify LECs and notes reviewed to determine patient demographic details, mode of presentation, investigations, treatment and outcome. Five male and one female patients were identified. Their median age was 60 years. Lesions were identified on computed tomography performed for abdominal pain in two patients, and were incidentally observed in four patients. Five LECs were located in the tail and one in the body of the pancreas, with a median cyst size of 5 cm. Obtaining cyst fluid was difficult and a largely acellular aspirate was yielded. The pre-operative diagnosis was mucinous cystic neoplasm in all patients. This series of patients were treated distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. A retrospective review of radiological examinations suggested that LECs have a relatively low signal on T2 imaging and a high signal intensity on T1 weighted images. LECs appear more common in elderly males, and are typically incidental, large, unilocular cysts. Close attention to signal intensity on MRI may allow pre-operative diagnosis of these lesions.
