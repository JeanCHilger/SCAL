A rare case of mixed mucinous cystadenoma with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas treated by laparoscopic central pancreatectomy. Mixed mucinous cystadenoma with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is rare. There have been only two previous case reports in the English-language literature. We present a case of a 46-year-old woman who was diagnosed with mixed mucinous cystadenoma with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic neoplasm in the dorsal/proximal body of the pancreas with a clear-margin multilocular cavity and enhanced internal septum. The patient underwent laparoscopic central pancreatectomy. The diagnosis of mixed mucinous cystadenoma with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas was confirmed by pathological examination. The patient was followed up for 3 months and there were no signs of recurrence, or pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case treated by laparoscopic central pancreatectomy.
