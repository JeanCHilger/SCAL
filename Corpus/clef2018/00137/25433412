Differentiation of focal-type autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma: assessment by multiphase contrast-enhanced CT. To evaluate the utility of multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings alone and in combination for differentiating focal-type autoimmune pancreatitis (f-AIP) from pancreatic carcinoma (PC).The study group comprised 22 f-AIP lesions and 61 PC lesions. Two radiologists independently evaluated CT findings. Frequencies of findings were compared between f-AIP and PC. Statistical, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.Homogeneous enhancement during the portal phase (AIP, 59 % vs. PC, 3 % P < 0.001), dotted enhancement during the pancreatic phase (50 % vs. 7 %The combination of CT findings may allow improvements in differentiating f-AIP from PC.• f-AIP can mimic PC on imaging findings. • The differentiation of f-AIP from PC is important in patient management. • Some CT findings can be used to identify AIP. • The combination of CT findings will improve differentiation from PC.
