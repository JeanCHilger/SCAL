An unusual case of biliary bezoar causing small bowel obstruction in a patient with ampullary diverticulum and stapled gastroplasty. Primary small bowel bezoars constitute 0.44% of small bowel obstructions (SBO). We report a case of a man with a history of gastroplasty who presented with lower abdominal pain. Initial examination revealed leucocytosis and serum lipase. CT of the abdomen/pelvis was consistent with pancreatitis, cholelithiasis and a stable, 3.8 cm, ampullary diverticulum, without obstruction of the pancreatic/common bile duct. Considering this was the patient's first episode of pancreatitis with evidence of cholelithiasis, it seemed prudent that he would benefit from cholecystectomy but not diverticulectomy. Post-cholecystectomy he represented to the hospital with biliary emesis. CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed postsurgical changes. Owing to non-resolution of the symptoms, 48 h later a small bowel follow-through was obtained that suggested partial SBO. Ultimately, the patient was taken for exploratory laparoscopy and small bowel resection, after a large intramural mass was encountered in the small bowel. Final pathology revealed a 3 cm biliary bezoar causing obstruction and stercoral ulceration.
