A case of pancreatic pseudocyst associated with pancreatic cancer successfully treated with endoscopic pseudocyst drainage, which allowed continuation of chemotherapy. We report a case of pancreatic pseudocyst associated with pancreatic cancer that was successfully treated with endoscopic pseudocyst drainage, which allowed continuation of chemotherapy. A 74-year-old woman complaining of jaundice was diagnosed with locally advanced cancer in the head of the pancreas, and she underwent chemotherapy with gemcitabine. One month later, she was admitted to our hospital for severe epigastralgia, and she diagnosed with a pancreatic pseudocyst that was 14 cm in diameter. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided pseudocyst drainage was successfully performed. The amylase concentration of pseudocyst fluid was 13,320 U/L, and bacterial culture was negative. The epigastralgia soon resolved, but 1 week later, the size of the pseudocyst was 12 cm in diameter. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed communication of the pancreatic duct with the pseudocyst. A pancreatic stent was placed. The patient again underwent chemotherapy for 3 months, without major complications. The pseudocyst was no longer visible 3 months after stent placement. The patient died of pancreatic cancer with peritonitis carcinomatosa, 6 months after the initial diagnosis.
