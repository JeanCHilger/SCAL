Insulinoma in a patient with chronic renal failure due to type 2 diabetes mellitus treated effectively with diazoxide. A 63-year-old man was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at 42 years of age. He subsequently exhibited poor blood glucose control for a prolonged period, and his renal failure worsened. He therefore underwent hemodialysis and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed a mass in the pancreatic tail. The immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide immunoreactivity levels were significantly elevated, and the results of a fasting test led to a diagnosis of insulinoma. The patient received treatment with oral diazoxide and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which resulted in the resolution of the hypoglycemia. This is a rare case of renal failure in which the CGM findings showed improvements in the blood glucose level after diazoxide administration.
