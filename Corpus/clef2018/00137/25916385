Differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer from other solid tumours arising from the periampullary area on MDCT. To investigate CT features and differential diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to other solid tumours arising in the periampullary area.One hundred and ninety-five patients with pathologically proven, solid periampullary tumours, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 98), neuroendocrine tumours (n = 52), gastrointestinal stromal tumours (n = 31), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (n = 14), underwent preoperative CT. Two radiologists reviewed CT features and rated the possibility of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Statistically common findings for pancreatic adenocarcinoma included: patient age >50 years ill-defined marginCT is useful not only for differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma form other solid tumours but also for differentiating between other solid tumours, including NET, SPN, and GIST, arising in the periampullary area.• Periampullary tumours arise within 2 cm of major duodenal papilla. • Many mass-forming periampullary tumours can be completely removed by minimal surgery. • Accurate differentiation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other solid tumours is important. • CT is useful for differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other solid tumours. • CT is useful for characterization of periampullary tumours other than adenocarcinomas.
