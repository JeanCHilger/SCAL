Insulin sensitivity and secretion in youth onset type 2 diabetes with and without visceral adiposity. To investigate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion patterns among Asian Indian youth without and with type 2 diabetes (T2DM-y defined as onset of diabetes at or below 25 years) with normal and high visceral fat (VF) levels.We recruited 74 T2DM-y individuals, within 18 months of diagnosis and compared them to 77 age-matched controls with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Using L4/L5 abdominal CT images, VF levels were categorized as normal or high according to their median values. Oral glucose tolerance tests (glucose and insulin measures) were used to derive Matsuda index, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and oral disposition index (DIo). Relationships between measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion and T2DM-y by VF level were assessed using standardized multinomial regression models.Participants were categorized into four groups: NGT-normal VF NGT-high VFLower DIo and Matsuda index, younger age and higher leptin were independently associated with high visceral fat among T2DM participants. Also, lower DIo was seen with increasing 2 h PG values even among normal glucose tolerant individuals.
