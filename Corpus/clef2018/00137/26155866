Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with extensive calcification. A 54-year-old woman exhibited pancreatic calcification on abdominal ultrasonography. Diagnostic imaging revealed a 20-mm mass with a 12-mm calcification in the tail of the pancreas. The mass was weakly enhanced in the early phase of contrast-enhanced CT. We performed pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Histopathological diagnosis was a nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET), grade 2. This is a rare case of PNET with extensive calcification.
