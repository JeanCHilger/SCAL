Pancreatic Solid and Cystic Neoplasms: Diagnostic Evaluation and Intervention. High-resolution imaging modalities, such as multi-detector computed tomography, MR imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound, are frequently used alone or in combination to characterize focal solid and cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging in solid pancreatic neoplasms, typically adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors, is primarily used to detect and stage the extent of the tumor and to determine if complete surgical resection for cure is feasible. In cystic pancreatic masses, imaging aims to differentiate benign nonmucinous cystic lesions from potentially or frankly malignant mucin-producing cysts. Several noninvasive and invasive treatment options can be performed if surgical resection is not possible or contraindicated.
