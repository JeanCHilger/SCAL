In vivo identification of pancreatic cystic neoplasms with needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are increasingly identified with the widespread use of imaging modalities. The precise diagnosis of PCLs remains a challenge despite the use of CT, MRI, and EUS-FNA. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a new endoscopic imaging modality that provides real-time, very high magnification images. A smaller CLE probe, which can be passed through a 19-gauge FNA needle, is now available. Needle-based CLE during EUS has recently been examined to evaluate PLCs, and the specific criteria of nCLE for the diagnosis of PLCs have been proposed.
