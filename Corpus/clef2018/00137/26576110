Reduced Field-of-View Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Pancreas: Comparison with Conventional Single-Shot Echo-Planar Imaging. To investigate the image quality (IQ) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of reduced field-of-view (FOV) di-ffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of pancreas in comparison with full FOV DWI.In this retrospective study, 2 readers independently performed qualitative analysis of full FOV DWI (FOV, 38 × 38 cm b-value, 0 and 500 s/mm(2)) and reduced FOV DWI (FOV, 28 × 8.5 cmOn qualitative analysis, reduced FOV DWI showed better anatomic structure visualization (2.76 ± 0.79 at b = 0 s/mm(2) and 2.81 ± 0.64 at b = 400 s/mm(2)), lesion conspicuity (3.11 ± 0.99 at b = 0 s/mm(2) and 3.15 ± 0.79 at b = 400 s/mm(2)), IQ score (8.51 ± 2.05 at b = 0 s/mm(2) and 8.79 ± 1.60 at b = 400 s/mm(2)), and higher clinical utility (3.41 ± 0.64), as compared to full FOV DWI (anatomic structure, 2.18 ± 0.59 at b = 0 s/mm(2) and 2.56 ± 0.47 at b = 500 s/mm(2) lesion conspicuity, 2.55 ± 1.07 at b = 0 s/mm(2) and 2.89 ± 0.86 at b = 500 s/mm(2)Reduced FOV DWI of the pancreas provides better overall IQ including better anatomic detail, lesion conspicuity and subjective clinical utility.
