Duodenopancreatic contusions. Diagnostic difficulties in children. The authors describe a case of duodenopancreatic injury in a 6-year-old girl, with the clinical presentation of appendicitis. The findings point to the importance of a precise anamnesis, as in its mild form the traumatism is often poorly recognized, and may be incorrectly diagnosed. It is therefore recommended that a thorough clinical examination be carried out, with abdominal ultrasonography, X-ray barium and tomodensitometry if necessary. Frequently, as is the case with other abdominal, injuries, surgery may be avoided if the patient's condition is carefully followed.
