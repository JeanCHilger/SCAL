Failure of ultrasound to detect extra-pancreatic abscesses in severe acute pancreatitis. The development of intra-abdominal abscesses in patients with severe acute pancreatitis can be associated with a mortality as high as 100%. The clinical findings in these patients may be non specific and therefore imaging is essential. Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging modality of choice. However, a satisfactory ultrasound examination may be regarded as sufficient, particularly when there is limited availability of CT. A case of extra-pancreatic abscess complicating severe acute pancreatitis, in whom sonography was "normal", but CT demonstrated the abscess is presented. The importance of CT in these patients in whom an abscess is suspected and our experience with similar cases is discussed.
