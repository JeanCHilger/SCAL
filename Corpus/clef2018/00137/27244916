BILIARY HYPERTENSION IN CHRONIC PANCREATITIS AND PECULIARITIES OF ITS DIAGNOSIS. Possibilities of various diagnostic methods for biliary hypertension detection in chronic pancreatitis were analyzed. Biliary hypertension was revealed in 163 (31%) patients, suffering chronic pancreatitis. The laboratory investigations data, ultrasonographic investigation, computer tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnet-resonance cholangiopancreatography, intraoperative measurement of the biliary ducts width, intraoperative measurement of biliary pressure were applied for diagnosis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnet-resonance cholangiopancreatography and intraoperative measurement of biliary pressure are considered the most sensitive methods for chronic pancreatitis diagnosis.
