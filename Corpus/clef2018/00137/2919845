Splanchnic venous obstruction. A complication of chronic pancreatitis. A retrospective review of 20 adult patients with splanchnic venous obstruction secondary to chronic pancreatitis was performed to identify factors important in the preoperative diagnosis and operative management of this disorder. Fifteen patients with isolated splenic vein obstruction, four with portal occlusion and one with isolated inferior mesenteric vein occlusion were studied. Chronic alcoholism was the etiology of the pancreatitis in 18 patients two patients had a Type IV hyperlipidemia. Four patients with massive hemorrhage from gastric varices were treated with splenectomy. Most patients presented with complaints of chronic pancreatitis, requiring pancreaticojejunostomy to treat the underlying pancreatic disorder. Splenic artery inflow control was obtained preoperatively in six patients and offers a technique that is beneficial in decreasing operative blood loss. The dynamic computerized tomography (CT) scan was a valuable diagnostic tool in identifying splanchnic venous obstruction although selective angiography is required for confirmation of the diagnosis.
