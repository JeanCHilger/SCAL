Mixed ductal and acinar cell cancer of the pancreas head report of a case. A 63 year old Japanese man was admitted in Feb. 1983, with his chief complaint of upper abdominal pain. Physical examination showed only resistance in the right hypochondrium on palpation, but no icteric conjunctiva and skin. A large global tumor of the pancreas head was visualised as a hyperechoic mass with irregularly shaped cystic cavity in ultrasonography, as a hypervascular mass with lucent area in celiac arteriography, and as a mass lesion with low density area in body computerized tomography. Cancer cells were histologically confirmed on specimens taken by fine needle aspiration biopsy under ultrasonic guidance. Cancer of 6.5 X 6.0 X 4.0 cm in size was resected by pancreaticoduodenectomy. Four months after operation, two liver metastatic nodules were resected by right hepatic lobectomy. Histologically, tumor was composed of two characteristic patterns, acinar cell cancer and duct cell cancer, which were confirmed by immunohistochemical techniques. The patient is doing well 3 years and 3 months postoperatively without evidence of recurrent cancer. To our best knowledge, this case is the seventh of mixed ductal and acinar cancer in the world, but the previous 6 cases were reported on autopsy specimens.
