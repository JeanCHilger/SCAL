Case report: CT of a duodenal paraganglioma. Paraganglioma is a neoplasm of neuroectodermal origin that occurs rarely in the bowel. This case report illustrates the previously undescribed CT appearance of a duodenal paraganglioma. An intensely enhancing mass in the region of the pancreatic head was found. The intense enhancement ruled out adenocarcinoma and focal pancreatitis. An islet cell tumor of the pancreas was the major differential diagnostic consideration.
