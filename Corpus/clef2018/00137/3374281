A multi-plane scout sequence using flash imaging. A new pulse sequence is presented for multi-plane imaging which simultaneously acquires images in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Combined with FLASH imaging or other similar techniques, T1- and T2-weighted images in all three planes can be acquired in approximately 12 and 30 seconds, respectively. The sequence is easily implemented by modifying a multi-slice sequence to provide a rotation of gradient assignments between slice excitations. This sequence has been used extensively as a rapid "scout" scan. Several clinical examples are included.
