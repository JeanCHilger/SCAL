Calcified pancreatic pseudocysts. Extensive calcification of a pancreatic pseudocyst that permits visualization on plain abdominal radiographs is unusual. When such x-ray findings are encountered, a broad differential diagnosis can be made, which includes tumors, cysts, abscesses, or malformations of the adjacent structures. Two cases of calcified pancreatic pseudocysts are discussed. Calcified pancreatic pseudocysts may be a potential source of complications such as pain, bleeding, or infection. Because the cyst wall is mature and spontaneous resolution is unlikely, proper treatment of calcified pseudocysts consists of timely resection or internal drainage.
