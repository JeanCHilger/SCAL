Multiple simultaneous percutaneous needle biopsy (MSPNB) technique for masses of the abdomen and peritoneum. A technique for the biopsy of abdominal masses consisting of the simultaneous insertion of multiple needles is described. This technique was employed in 45 patients. The results were compared with the author's preceding experience with 32 cases performed with a conventional technique of sequential biopsies. Adequate specimens were obtained in 42 (93.3%) cases with the multiple simultaneous percutaneous needle biopsy (MSPNB) technique. This compares with a diagnostic adequacy yield of 84.3% for the sequential technique. In 25 cases performed under CT guidance, the average CT utilization time was 12 minutes, and the average number of slices was 3, as compared to 45 minutes and 12 slices with the conventional sequential technique. No complications were encountered. We conclude that the MSPNB technique is a safe time- and cost-effective technique with a high yield of adequate and diagnostic specimens.
