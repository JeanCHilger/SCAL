Papillary cystic epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas. A clinical study of four cases. We treated four cases of papillary cystic epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas. This neoplasm typically presents in young female patients as a slowly growing mass that may attain large size. It is of low malignant potential, and surgical resection will be curative in almost all cases. One patient presented with a liver metastasis from the pancreatic tumor both lesions were successfully resected. Papillary cystic epithelial neoplasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any cystic pancreatic neoplasm.
