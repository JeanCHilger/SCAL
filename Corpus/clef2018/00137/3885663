Impact of new imaging techniques on survival in cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region. The impact of new imaging techniques on diagnostic delay and on survival in carcinoma of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region was investigated. The study comprised 67 patients treated before (1968-1975) and 82 treated after (1979-1981) the introduction of new imaging techniques at Oulu University Central Hospital. The symptomatology, diagnostic delay and survival rates were identical in both groups, but the number of patients per year increased significantly during the latter period. The study indicated that the new imaging techniques, despite their increased diagnostic yield, did not influence diagnostic delay or survival in pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma.
