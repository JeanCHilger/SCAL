Densitometry of the pancreas (author's transl). The authors present their experience of 15 months use of a C.T. Scanner of the third generation. Of 1,000 patients in which the tomography sections involved the pancreas, in one third the examination was requested for a suspected pancreatic lesion. The image of the pancreas was obvious in 9 cases out of ten. The diagnosis was correct in 8 cases out of ten. These results are extremely encouraging, and reliable compared with those of echotomography in the present state of the technic. The illustrations show the interest of C.T. Scanning in surgery, for the surgeon then has available anatomical sections of the whole supramesocolic region. The authors emphasize the necessity of pluridisciplinary comparison for better use of this technic.
