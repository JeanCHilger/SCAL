Computed tomographic evaluation of the retroperitoneum in infants and children. With many retroperitoneal diseases in infancy and childhood, computed tomography will give information unavailable by any other single imaging technique. This maxim applies particularly to the adrenal, where the percolating nature of neuroblastoma with its propensity toward spinal involvement is exquisitely shown with computed tomography. Renal neoplasms and trauma can be illustrated effectively with computed tomography, as can pancreatic disease and spinal and paraspinal inflammatory and neoplastic disease. In addition to diagnostic studies, computed tomography may be used as guidance for invasive procedures.
