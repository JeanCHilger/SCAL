Cytodiagnosis by needle aspiration-biopsy in pancreatic diseases : a preliminary study (author's transl). In this preliminary work, the first results concerning the cytodiagnostic of pancreatic diseases by needle aspiration are reported. 37 aspirations were carried out on 30 patients. 16 during the operation and 21 by transcutaneous way using arteriography in 16 cases, ultrasonic scanning in 3 cases, tomodensitometry in 2 cases, as a guide. In 7 patients, both way were used. Cancer of the pancreas was diagnosed by this technique in 10 cases out of 14, without accident. No results were falsely positive. Skill and good technique would seem to allow to decide between pancreatitis and cancer in doubtful cases and diagnose cancer of the pancreas sufficiently early.
