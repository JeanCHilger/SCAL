Computer tomography for tumours of the oesophagus and stomach (author's transl). The diagnostic scope of CT has been demonstrated for malignant tumours of the oesophagus (41 patients) and tumours of the stomach (18 patients). Of importance is the demonstration of circumferential spread of tumours of the oesophagus, the early demonstration of mediastinal lymph node metastases and the demonstration of infradiaphragmatic lymph node involvement from tumours of the middle and lower thirds of the oesophagus. In the presence of tumours of the stomach, it is possible to demonstrate infiltration of neighbouring organs (pancreas, spleen, hilum of liver) and haematogenous or lymphatic spread.
