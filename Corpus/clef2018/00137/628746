The ultrasonic and computed tomographic appearance of splenic lobulations: a consideration in the ultrasonic differential of masses adjacent to the left kidney. A splenic lobulation interposed between the tail of the pancreas and the left kidney is not uncommon. On prone ultrasonic scans, this variant of splenic configuration must be considered in the differentiation of anterior masses adjacent to the left kidney and masses originating in the tail of the pancreas. Computed tomography is the most sensitive method to use in making this distinction.
