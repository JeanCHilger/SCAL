Computed tomography and echography in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. The diagnostic possibilities of computer tomography and echographic investigations were studied in 58 patients with chronic pancreatitis and 36 patients with carcinoma of pancreas. Positive morphological signs for the existence of chronic pancreatitis were established in 75,9 per cent in computer tomography and in 83,93 per cent in echographic investigations. The difference in the diagnostic sensitivity of both diagnostic methods is not significant (p greater than 0,05). The calcifications in pancreas are better detected by computer tomography whereas both methods are equivalent in the diagnosis of the pancreatic cystes. In carcinoma of pancreas computer tomography gives the correct diagnosis of the disease (p greater than 0,05) in 69,5 per cent and echography--in 78,8 per cent of the patients. With computer tomography false negative results amount to 30,5% in 13,9 per cent normal pancreas was described and in 16 per cent--pseudocyst in pancreas. With echography--false negative results were established in 21,2 per cent of the patients
