Pancreatic sonography: past and present. Prior to the advent of cross-sectional imaging, the diagnosis of pancreatic disease and its extent could not be obtained without surgery. Ultrasound is a noninvasive modality which has been evolving over the last 7-10 years. The purpose of this review will be to determine the present status of ultrasound in the evaluation of adult and pediatric pancreatic disease. Also, its role with regard to computed tomography (CT) and interventional techniques will be discussed.
