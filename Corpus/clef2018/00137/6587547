Ultrasound tomography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Orientation and diagnostic possibilities. 40 patients were examined by peroral endoscopic ultrasonography with two new prototypes (Prototype II and III, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Indications were given by various intestinal diseases. Topographical orientation could be difficult, but was facilitated by standard positions of the instrument. The organs identified included liver, gallbladder, common bile duct, pancreas, spleen and kidneys. Pathological lesions of the mentioned organs were characterized by the reflex pattern known from external ultrasonography. Up till now endoscopic sonography is not a routine method but may give additional information to peroral endoscopy and external ultrasonography without replacing these methods.
