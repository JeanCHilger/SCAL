Radiological evaluation of visceral injuries in the battered child syndrome. Diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the recognition, evaluation, and follow-up of visceral injuries in the battered child syndrome. Conventional radiography is important for the diagnosis of associated skeletal fractures, pulmonary parenchymal injury, gastric dilatation, and pneumoperitoneum. An upper gastrointestinal series is the examination of choice in suspected intramural duodenal hematoma. Ultrasonography is helpful in the diagnosis of retroperitoneal hematoma, acute traumatic pancreatitis, and pancreatic pseudocyst. Nuclear scintigraphy is valuable if injury is limited to the liver or spleen. CT is the imaging modality of choice for assessing generalized blunt abdominal trauma as well as evaluating the extent of injuries to the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and mesentery.
