Ultrasonographic diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma supplemented with CT or ERCP. The practicability of ultrasonography as the primary imaging method for pancreatic carcinoma was studied in a series of 64 patients with pancreatic carcinoma examined and operated on more than 2 years previously, and CT and ERCP were compared for their expedience in the further examination of uncertain sonographic findings. Ultrasound revealed 42 carcinomas definitely and 8 carcinomas uncertainly (78%) and further indicated dilatation of bile and/or pancreatic ducts in 10 patients. Three sonographic examinations failed, and one resulted in a false negative finding (error of interpretation). ERCP proved to be a little more informative than CT in the further examinations.
