Abdominal computer tomography. In computer tomography of the abdomen the amount of diagnostic information obtained depends on the organ system examined and correlates with the topographical anatomy. The information gained by this non-invasive method results from the demonstration of contour alteration and from inherent density differences. Although at this point in time, while the process of evaluation is still in progress, it is too early to formulate definitive guidelines on the indications for computer tomography of the abdomen, we suggest, on the basis of experience hitherto, that computer tomography of the adrenals and the pancreas is better than the previously known image-producing diagnostic methods. The overall diagnostic value of computer tomography of the liver and spleen, depending on the pathology in question, is apparently at least equal to sonography, nuclear medicine and angiography. Computer tomography of the gastrointestinal tract and the kidneys, when compared to other diagnostic radiographic and sonographic investigations, at present adds little information, and for this reason has limited application in these systems. In contrast to this is the highly instructive computer tomographic examination of the extrarenal retroperitoneal space.
