Ultrasonic evaluation of the pancreas. With the advent of new gray scale imaging techniques, ultrasound plays a major role in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. As a noninvasive, nonionizing, accurate, and inexpensive diagnostic modality that directly images the pancreatic gland, ultrasound can be used as a primary screening tool. It is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and in detecting and following pseudocysts and other complications. Neoplasms can be detected with a high rate of accuracy, and by assessing the presence of ascites or metastatic foci in the liver, ultrasound can aid in the staging of the neoplastic process. Bowel gas and obesity remain serious limitations to adequate examination, and in these patients computed tomography offers a complementary modality.
