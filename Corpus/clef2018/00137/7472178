Sonographic demonstration of the pancreatic duct and its clinical relevance (author's transl). Out of 19 patients with sonographically demonstrable pancreatic ducts, the Wirsungian duct was found to be dilated on endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) in 18 cases and of normal calibre in only 1 case. The cause of dilatation of the pancreatic duct was chronic pancreatitis in 10 patients and pancreatic carcinoma in 8 patients. There were two differing forms of duct representation in the sonographic picture. Retrospective evaluation of sonographic and ERCP results in 43 patients showed that demonstration of a pancreatic duct of normal calibre is seldom possible using ultrasound. As dilated pancreatic ducts are demonstrable sonographically more readily such a finding must be taken as indicative of pancreatic disease.
