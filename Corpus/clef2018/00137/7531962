Pancreatic injuries from blunt trauma. Pancreatic injuries from blunt trauma are infrequent, and their diagnosis and management can be extremely difficult. Over the past 10 years we treated 13 patients with major pancreatic injuries from blunt trauma. Twelve had been involved in motor vehicle collisions, none of whom were wearing seat belts. One patient was injured in an assault. Only five patients had physical findings suggesting intra-abdominal injury. Serum amylase levels were elevated in seven of the nine patients (78%) in whom this test was obtained. Computed tomography scans demonstrated pancreatic injury in three of the four patients in whom it was performed. The five patients in whom peritoneal lavage was performed had free intraperitoneal blood from injuries to other abdominal viscera. One injury was diagnosed by ultrasound. Injuries were equally distributed throughout the pancreas, with two injuries in the head, three in the body, five in the tail, and three with injuries in both the head and the body. Five patients had ductal injuries. All patients underwent celiotomy. Eight patients required no operative management of their pancreatic injuries other than drainage. Injury Severity Score averaged 28.5 +/- 2.6 (mean +/- standard error), and mean hospital stay was 31 +/- 9.8 days. One patient with delayed diagnosis of a pancreatic injury developed a pseudocyst, but all other complications and prolonged hospitalizations were due to injuries to the head, chest, other abdominal organs, or extremities. All patients survived. The diagnosis of blunt pancreatic injury requires a high index of suspicion, and diagnostic studies may demonstrate only subtle signs of injury. Most injuries can be managed by localized resection and/or drainage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
