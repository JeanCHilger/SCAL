Pancreatic abscesses. The paper deals with pancreatic abscess as one of three entities of pancreatic infection. In spite of the common origin with infected pancreatic necrosis and infected pancreatic pseudocyst, the treatment of each kind of pancreatic necrosis has its own requirements. By comparing 30 pancreatic abscesses (mortality 18%), 29 infected pancreatic pseudocysts (mortality 6%) and 35 infected pancreatic necroses (mortality 43.5%) we concluded that the best treatment for pancreatic abscess is surgical evacuation with external drainage, for that of infected pancreatic pseudocyst internal drainage operation, and for infected pancreatic necrosis surgical debridement with external drainage, lavage and open-abdomen procedure. Differences in CT scan, treatment and prognosis require different surgical approach to each type of pancreatic necrosis. (Fig. 3, Ref. 24.)
