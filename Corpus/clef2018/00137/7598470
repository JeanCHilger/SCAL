The current management of carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas can be diagnosed and staged effectively by computed tomography (CT) scan and by visceral angiography. If the tumor appears to be resectable, no further studies such as percutaneous biopsy are required. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the only potentially curable treatment. This operation can be performed with a hospital mortality rate of approximately 2%. If the resection is curative, five-year survival in excess of 20% can be anticipated. Utilizing multivariate analysis, negative lymph node status, the absence of microscopic evidence of blood vessel involvement, and two or fewer blood transfusions during surgery are all independent predictors of long-term survival. Adjuvant therapy is effective and should be used routinely.
