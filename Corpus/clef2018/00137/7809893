Percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses. Percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscesses has proved to be one of the most successful and gratifying of all interventional radiology procedures. Collections of intra-abdominal fluid can be detected easily with computer tomography and sonography. Diagnostic aspiration is done under guidance of sonography or computer tomography. Sonography is the ideal imaging method for monitoring interventional procedures. Its ability to visualize the collection of superficial fluid and its real-time capability allows precise control of insertions of needles and catheters. If the collection is poorly seen with sonography, often because of air, computer tomography can be used as a system of guidance. It is essential that radiologists and surgeons collaborate in the treatment of patients with abscesses. Percutaneous drainage is favoured in patients at high risk with open surgery, while diffuse collections between bowels almost always need surgical drainage. Simple abscesses can be treated successfully with percutaneous drainage. Complicated abscesses in the pancreas can also be treated with good results. The procedure is carried out under local anaesthesia. Most complications are minor and can be treated conservatively. Coagulation abnormalities must be corrected, but there are no other contraindications to these image-guided percutaneous procedures.
