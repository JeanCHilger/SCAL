Metastatic involvement of the pancreas from renal cell carcinoma treated by surgery. A solitary late recurrence of renal cell carcinoma is very unusual. A case of triple pancreatic metastases of renal carcinoma is presented in a male patient who 9 years previously had undergone left radical nephrectomy. Although there are no specific signs, arteriography, computed tomography and intraoperative ultrasonography can give additional information to detect this rare localization. Surgical resection, when possible, is the most useful treatment for this metastatic lesion.
