Pancreatic tuberculosis mimicking pancreatic head carcinoma: a case report and review of the literature. A 24-year-old man presented with vague abdominal fullness and a mild epigastric dull pain for about 3 months was found to have a pancreatic head tumor at a medical center 2 months ago. He came to our hospital for further treatment. Ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) all revealede a pancreatic head tumor. Laparotomy was performed because pancreatic head carcinoma was highly suspected. Indurated mass in the pancreatic head, enlarged lymph nodes and white tubercles on the intestine proved to be tuberculosis on histological examination of a frozen section. Acid fast bacilli were also found. The patient was given antituberculous therapy and is now doing well. To avoid unnecessary laparotomy, CT, echo-guided percutaneous aspiration cytology or biopsy and culture of the tissue for mycobacteria should be done in a patient with pancreatic mass, especially in a region where pulmonary and abdominal tuberculosis are common.
