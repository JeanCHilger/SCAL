Comparison of MR and CT scanning in severe acute pancreatitis: initial experiences. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 1.0 T in seven patients with severe acute pancreatitis. A T2-weighted spin echo sequence and a breath-hold multislice rapid gradient echo sequence (TurboFLASH) were used in each patient. TurboFLASH imaging was performed before and after intravenous gadopentetate-dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). All MRI images were compared with a recent contrast-enhanced CT scan. Postgadolinium MRI was equivalent to contrast-enhanced CT in differentiating viable pancreatic parenchyma from areas of pancreatic necrosis. MRI identified the presence of gas in a case of pancreatic abscess but failed to identify small foci of pancreatic calcification demonstrated in one case by CT. MRI was also equivalent to CT in assessing the location and extent of peripancreatic inflammatory changes and fluid collections. However, MRI, particularly the T2-weighted spin echo, was superior to CT in characterizing the complex nature of such inflammatory changes in one case. Initial experience suggests that MRI is a valuable technique in assessing patients with severe acute pancreatitis.
