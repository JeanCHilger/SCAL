Pancreatic carcinoma--preoperative diagnosis and indications for surgery. Symptomatic pancreas tumors are diagnosed in general by ERCP, transabdominal ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Endoscopic ultrasonography, angiography (facultative) and video laparoscopy in combination with laparoscopic sonography and peritoneal lavage are providing preoperatively important additional information about the spreading of the tumor. Preoperative diagnostic procedures should allow the surgeon to exclude patients with an unresectable tumor from extended resection. In most of these patients satisfactory palliation can be achieved endoscopically. The indication for surgical treatment of resectable pancreatic tumors is based on the mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy far beyond 5% in experienced centers. Improved surgical techniques and improved perioperative management together with the implementation of accurate preoperative analysis of risk factors allow resection of primary pancreatic tumors with a low morbidity and mortality.
