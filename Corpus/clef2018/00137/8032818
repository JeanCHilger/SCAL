Case report: ciliated foregut cyst of the pancreas mimicking teratomatous tumour. A ciliated cyst of foregut origin is often found in relation to the tracheobronchial tree and the upper gastrointestinal tract, when it is called bronchogenic cyst and enterogenous cyst, respectively. Cysts of this type rarely occur in the pancreas. We report a case of ciliated foregut cyst involving the pancreas, and mimicking teratomatous tumour on radiology.
