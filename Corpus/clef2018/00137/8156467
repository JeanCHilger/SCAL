Necrotic stenosis of the right colon secondary to acute pancreatitis. The authors report the case of a 52-year-old man who had stenosis and necrosis of the right colon secondary to acute pancreatitis. The right colon is a very uncommon location for this complication. The site of the stenosis was documented by contrast enema examination and computed tomography. Although conservative management is usually advocated for the initial management of this complication, laparotomy was necessary when the patient's condition failed to improve with conservative therapy. Colonic necrosis was found at laparotomy, and a partial colectomy was carried out, followed later by ileocolic reanastomosis. The authors emphasize the diagnostic and treatment options for this entity.
