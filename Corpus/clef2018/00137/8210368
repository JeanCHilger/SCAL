Prospective comparison of T2-weighted fast spin-echo, with and without fat suppression, and conventional spin-echo pulse sequences in the upper abdomen. To evaluate use of fast spin-echo (FSE) magnetic resonance imaging with and without fat suppression in the liver and upper abdomen.Conventional spin-echo (SE) T2-weighted, FSE T2-weighted, and fat-suppressed FSE T2-weighted images from 37 patients strongly suspected to have focal hepatic lesions were evaluated.Quantitative analysis demonstrated that fat-suppressed FSE imaging had the highest lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratio conventional SE imaging, the lowest. In a qualitative analysis, FSE imaging was preferred. In a rank order analysis, FSE imaging was preferred 83% of the time and fat-suppressed FSE imaging 17% of the time as regards overall image qualityFSE imaging with and without fat suppression is a potentially useful pulse sequence for evaluating the upper abdomen.
