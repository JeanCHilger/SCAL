Gadolinium-DTPA dimeglumine administered orally for the study of the abdomen with magnetic resonance. Clinical evaluation and tolerance. The tolerance to and the clinical value of a new positive oral contrast agent, Gd-DTPA-Dimeglumine, were evaluated. Ten healthy volunteers and 30 patients with abdominal and pelvic tumors were studied. Fourteen patients underwent MR scans only after cm administration, while 16 patients were examined both before and after. All images were obtained by means of a 1.5-T MR unit using SE and GE pulse sequences on the axial and coronal planes. Before the examination, a 1-mmol Gd-DTPA-Dimeglumine solution with mannitol and sodium citrate diluted in 1L of water was administered to all patients in 100-150-ml fractions. The product was well tolerated and its taste was good adverse reactions were uncommon and mild. The solution was stable during gastrointestinal tract transit. Bowel signal was hyperintense on both GE and SE pulse sequences, which clearly demonstrated the bowel lumen distinguishing it from the surrounding fatty tissue and depicting even the smallest vascular structures. Moreover, from a clinical point of view, the hepatic, pancreatic and colic borders were better demonstrated in both normal and pathologic conditions.
