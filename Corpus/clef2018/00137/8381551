Islet cell tumors: comparison of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging with dynamic gadolinium enhancement and fat suppression. Ten patients with 11 islet cell tumors underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within a 1-month period. MR imaging depicted all 11 tumors, and CT depicted seven of the 11 tumors. CT did not depict four of seven tumors that measured 2.5 cm in diameter or less. Islet cell tumors had low signal intensity on T1-weighted fat-suppressed MR images, and gastrinomas were best shown with this technique. Two of three insulinomas less than 1.5 cm in diameter were best shown on dynamic contrast-enhanced fast low-angle shot (FLASH) images as uniform areas of high signal intensity. Hepatic metastases were seen in five patients and showed peripheral ringlike enhancement best demonstrated on dynamic gadolinium-enhanced FLASH images. Hepatic lesions were most conspicuous on T2-weighted fat-suppressed spin-echo images. MR imaging with dynamic gadolinium enhancement and fat suppression is a promising tool in the investigation of islet cell tumors.
