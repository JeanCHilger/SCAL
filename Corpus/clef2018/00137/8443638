Pancreatic infection complicating acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic infection is the leading cause of death from acute pancreatitis. Patients with severe necrotizing pancreatitis are most at risk. Early computed tomography and percutaneous fine-needle aspiration microbiology of areas of pancreatic necrosis enable early diagnosis. Pancreatic infection should be treated surgically, although sterile necrosis may be managed conservatively. The role of antimicrobial drugs is uncertain.
