Differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Endosonography is the most sensitive method to detect even small pancreatic tumors. A number of endosonographic criteria have been evaluated, but there are not specific features that allow malignant tumors to be differentiated from benign tumors. The role and timing of endoscopic ultrasound as part of a more diagnostic evaluation in patients with pancreatic tumors is not yet defined.
