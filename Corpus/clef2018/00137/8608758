Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatography: a case report. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatography was performed on a 48-year-old man with a diagnosis of pancreatic stone. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy had been performed previously on this patient, approximately two years earlier, following the diagnosis of a tumor-forming pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and conventional ultrasound-guided percutaneous pancreatography had failed to yield a diagnosis. However, endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatography was performed successfully, delineating the pancreatic duct and a filling defect caused by intraductal calculi. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatography will be a potential alternative in cases when endoscopic retrograde pancreatography has failed or proved non-diagnostic.
