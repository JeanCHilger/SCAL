Ultrasonographic aspects of cystic papillary tumor of the pancreas. Apropos of 2 cases. Cystic papillary pancreatic tumor is an infrequent neoplasm of unknown origin which is presented almost exclusively in young women. It is characterized by an anodyne clinical symptomatology with it frequently treated as an accidental finding. Ultrasonography and computerized axial tomography have a priority role in the study of this entity but the definitive diagnosis is based on the histologic findings. The treatment of choice is surgical removal and although it is a malignant tumor, good evolution is observed with recurrence not being expected. Two new cases of cystic papillary tumor are presented comparing the ultrasonographic appearance of the same with other pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Although the ultrasonographic findings are not characteristic they may be suggestive of papillary tumor.
