Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas: imaging-pathologic correlation on 56 cases. To evaluate the clinical, pathologic, and imaging findings of solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN) of the pancreas and to correlate imaging and gross pathologic features.A retrospective review was performed in 56 patients (53 female and three male patients aged 10-74 years [mean age at diagnosis, 25 years]) with pathologically proven SPEN of the pancreas. All patients underwent computed tomography (n = 49), ultrasonography (n = 31), or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 9). Tumor size, location, and imaging features were evaluated and correlated with gross pathologic and histologic features.Mean transverse diameter of these tumors was 9.0 cm (range, 2.5-17.0 cm). They were localized to the tail (n = 30), head (n = 18), and body (n = 8) of the pancreas. All tumors contained some degree of internal hemorrhage or cystic degeneration, and all were well encapsulated. Areas of hemorrhagic degeneration ranged from solid friable tumor to gelatinous or cystic cavities and therefore demonstrated variable imaging features. Calcification was noted in 16 patients. Fluid-debris levels were noted in 10 patients.Imaging studies of SPEN of the pancreas consistently demonstrate variable degrees of hemorrhagic degeneration. Calcification is common. Characteristic fluid-debris levels and signal intensities seen with MR imaging indicate blood products. In the appropriate clinical setting, these findings are useful in making a prospective diagnosis.
