Acute pancreatitis associated with continuous infusion cytarabine therapy: a case report. While acute pancreatitis is a recognized complication of numerous drugs, cytarabine's role in causing this complication is controversial. Approximately 15 cases have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration linking cytarabine with pancreas-related toxicities. Previous case reports have been complicated by comorbid illnesses and the coadministration of other drugs associated with acute pancreatitis.This report describes the clinical course of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who developed recurrent pancreatitis associated with cytarabine therapy.A male age 36 years with French-American-British M5B acute myelogenous leukemia received induction cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day) by continuous infusion for 7 days, and subsequently developed acute pancreatitis. The patient was rechallenged with intermittent, bolus, high dose cytarabine (HDAC) (3 g/m2bid administered over 3 hours) during the following intensification treatment, but did not develop clinical acute pancreatitis. Retreatment with continuous infusion cytarabine at a later time resulted in recurrence of acute pancreatitis.This case illustrates that cytarabine treatment may cause acute pancreatitis, and that this toxicity may be schedule dependent. In those with known sensitivity to cytarabine, altering the administration technique may avoid this complication.
