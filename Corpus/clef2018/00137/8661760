Lesser sac hernia through the gastrocolic ligament: CT diagnosis. We present a case of a lesser sac hernia of the ileum through a defect in the gastrocolic ligament with reemergence through a defect in the gastrohepatic ligament. Computed tomography (CT) revealed the herniated bowel surrounded by the liver, the stomach and the pancreas, and demonstrated the defect in the gastrocolic ligament between the stomach and the transverse colon.
