Mucinous pancreatic ductal ectasia: mucus secreting tumor of malignant potential. We report two cases of mucinous pancreatic ductal ectasia including one which progressed to micro-invasive carcinoma. The frequency of this tumor may be under-estimated (24 cases reported in the literature) because of confusion with pseudocysts or mucinous cystadenoma. The diagnosis is made at retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endosonography is useful for tumors in the head of the pancreas, the predominant localization. At present, there is no test which can distinguish malignant forms from benign mucinous ductal ectasia. Resection of the tumor and the surrounding pancreatitis is the only curative treatment known. Pancreatoduodenectomy may be discussed in elderly patients with a tumor without signs of malignancy.
