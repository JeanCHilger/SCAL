Ampullary carcinoma in familial adenomatous polyposis: report of a case. We report the case of a 48-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) who was found to have ampullary carcinoma 6 years after undergoing total colectomy. The patient was examined periodically after colorectal surgery except for duodenoendoscopy because he had also previously undergone distal gastrectomy with gastrojejunal anastomosis for a duodenal ulcer at 27 years of age. An ampullary lesion was suspected on blood chemistry and detected by computed tomography scan and ultrasonography although the patient showed no clinical symptoms. A pancreatoduodenectomy was performed and the histological examination revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with no metastasis to the regional lymphnodes. Long-term periodic surveillance of the upper gastrointestinal tract including the papilla of Vater is therefore important for FAP patients who have undergone prophylactic colectomy.
