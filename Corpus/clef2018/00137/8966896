The clinical picture of acute cholecystitis complicated by jaundice has four main types: with the prevailing syndrome of inflammation of the gallbladder, of the pancreatic syndrome, of the cholangitis syndrome and of the profound pain syndrome by the type of renal colic. Echography is thought to be an informative preoperative method of diagnostics of the cause of jaundice, its significance being increased when combined with the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (94.4%). The patients must be operated upon within 24-28 hours. The intervention volume must be adequate to the type of the injury independent of the patient's age and of the degree of concomitant diseases.
