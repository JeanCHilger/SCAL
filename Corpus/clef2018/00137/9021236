Ultrasonographic study of pancreatic cysts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Pancreatic cysts are an uncommon extrarenal clinical feature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The prevalence of pancreatic cysts, sonographically assessed in ADPKD and in the different typs of ADPKD (PKD1 and PKD2) has not been reported. We have studied 173 ADPKD patients and 160 non-affected family members and found a prevalence of pancreatic cysts, of 9% in ADPKD patients over 30 years of age. The presence of pancreatic cysts was related to the increasing age, to the female sex and to the type of ADPKD, found exclusively in PKD1 patients. No complications related to pancreatic cysts were recorded. Pancreatic cysts are an unusual feature of ADPKD and do not appear to contribute to morbidity or mortality.
