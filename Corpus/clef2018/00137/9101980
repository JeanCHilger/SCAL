Endosonography of tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract: is routine use justified?. Major indications of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are staging of carcinomas of the oesophagus, stomach, and pancreas, lymphomas of the stomach and the diagnosis of submucosal tumors. Based on a meta-analysis, the accuracy of EUS is 84% in the T-stage of oesophagus carcinoma (1154 patients) and 77% (1035) in the N-stage, and of stomach carcinoma 80% (2699) and 70% (1207), respectively. Drawbacks of EUS: tumor stenosis which cannot be passed by the endoscope the inability to distinguish between benign and malignant stomach ulcera and the diagnosis of lymph nodes.
