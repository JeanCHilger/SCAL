Concealed perforated aneurysm of an aberrant right hepatic artery: papillary bleeding. Case report and review of the literature. A rare case of spurious aneurysm of an aberrant right hepatic artery is reported. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography, computed tomography and selective angiography of the coeliac trunc are diagnostic. Resection of the aneurysm and interposition of saphenous vein is the preferred procedure. In selected cases ligation of the common hepatic artery is possible. Intrahepatic aneurysms are preferably treated interventionally.
