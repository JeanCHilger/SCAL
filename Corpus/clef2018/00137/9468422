Intraductal papillary and mucinous tumors of the pancreas: accuracy of preoperative computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography, and long-term outcome in a large surgical series. Few data are available on the accuracy of preoperative imaging or on long-term outcome after surgery for intraductal papillary and mucinous tumors of the pancreas. The aims of this study were to assess the following: (1) the accuracy of preoperative computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and endoscopic ultrasonography for determination of tumor invasion and pancreatic extension as compared with surgical findings (2) the long-term outcome after surgery.Forty-seven patients who underwent surgery between 1980 and 1995 for pathologically diagnosed intraductal papillary and mucinous tumors were included in this study. The findings of available computed tomography (n = 25), endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (n = 29), and endoscopic ultrasonography (n = 21) were reviewed by experienced clinicians blinded to pathologic diagnosis to assess tumor invasion and pancreatic extension. Pathologic specimens were reviewed by experienced pathologists. Postoperative follow-up data were analyzed.Histologic features of invasive carcinoma were found in 43% of patients, severe dysplasia in 21%, and mild or moderate dysplasia in 36%. The overall accuracy of computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and endoscopic ultrasonography in distinguishing between invasive and noninvasive tumors were, respectively, 76%, 79%, and 76%. The overall 3-year disease-free survival rate was 63%, but it was 21% among patients with invasive carcinoma at surgery (p < 0.001).This study emphasizes the need for early surgical resection in patients with suspected intraductal papillary and mucinous tumors of the pancreas because of the high frequency of invasive carcinoma and the inadequacy of preoperative imaging for assessing malignancy.
