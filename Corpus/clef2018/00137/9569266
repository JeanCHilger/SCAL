Magnetic resonance cholangiography--feasibility and application in the paediatric population. To assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) in paediatrics.MRC was attempted in 41 children from 1 week to 14-years. There were three groups: (1) children studied with MRI for non-biliary problems as controls (2) infants with jaundiceIn group 1, the entire common duct was visualised in all 12 children. In group 2, successful demonstration of the common duct was achieved in two of the ten infants with subsequent confirmation of normal bile duct patency. In the last group of patients with suspected biliary disease, MRC gave good anatomical display of six choledochal cysts but failed to demonstrate the anomalous choledochopancreatic channel. It helped to confirm the diagnosis of two cases of pancreatic head cysts, and one case of Caroli's disease.MRC can be applied to the paediatric population, but its value depends on the type of problem to be evaluated. With current spatial resolution, its value in the diagnosis of biliary atresia is probably limited because it cannot reliably demonstrate the bile ducts in young infants with non-obstructive jaundice. In older children, it could provide a non-invasive anatomical display of the biliary tree and its disease. It has a potential role in addressing problematic cases encountered during ultrasonography.
