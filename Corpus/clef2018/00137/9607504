Pancreas divisum and stenosis of the major and minor papillae in an 8-year-old girl: treatment by dual sphincteroplasty. Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas. Its relationship to the development of pancreatitis is controversial. The authors report on an 8-year-old girl who presented with recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis and multiple failed attempts at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) who was referred for surgical exploration. She was found to have marked stenoses of both major and minor papillae and an intraoperative pancreaticogram consistent with pancreas divisum. She underwent sphincteroplasty of both major and minor papillae and remains symptom-free after 22 months. It is believed that in a patient with pancreatitis and pancreas divisum, or in a patient with pancreatitis and multiple failed attempts at ERCP, transduodenal exploration and intraoperative pancreaticogram are appropriate next steps in management. If pancreas divisum in association with minor papilla stenosis is found, sphincteroplasty is appropriate therapy. If major papilla stenosis is also present, we recommend sphincteroplasty of both the major and minor papillae.
