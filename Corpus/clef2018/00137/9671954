Endoscopy and intraductal ultrasonography. Because the prognosis in pancreatic carcinoma is so poor, a reliable method for early detection of tumors is needed. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a useful method for precise diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Recently, peroral pancreatoscopy (POPS) and intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) have been introduced to make a more detailed diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. These three techniques were performed in 48 patients with pancreatic carcinoma. The ultrasonographic and endoscopic findings of pancreatic carcinoma were studied. EUS, IDUS, and POPS are very useful for differentiating between benign and malignant pancreatic tumors.
