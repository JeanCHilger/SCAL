Unusual variant of left paraduodenal hernia herniated into the mesocolic fossa leading to jejunal strangulation. Paraduodenal hernia is a rare condition in which the small bowel loops are herniated into an unusual fossa in the periduodenal area. We treated a patient with paraduodenal hernia diagnosed preoperatively. A 28-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of intermittent abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a large tumor adjacent to the pancreas. Provisional diagnosis made according to computed tomography (CT) findings was tumor of the pancreas tail. However, on a CT scan performed after the administration of diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin, Schering, Berlin, Germany) the mass was shown as a jejunum loop located between the stomach and the pancreas body. Subsequent laparotomy revealed that the jejunum loop was herniated into an unusually large mesocolic fossa and that the hernial orifice was covered by the adhesion between the transverse and descending colons. It seemed that the small intestine within the mesocolic fossa was strangulated by this adhesion. The patient's abdominal pain resolved postoperatively. These observations suggest that paraduodenal hernia should be suspected in patients with chronic, atypical abdominal pain, regardless of the findings for small bowel obstruction.
