Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas associated with hypoglycemia: involvement of "big" insulin-like growth factor-II. Apart from insulinomas, pancreatic tumors are rarely complicated by hypoglycemia and some may produce insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). To our knowledge, IGF-II-producing pancreatic tumors associated with hypoglycemia have not been reported previously. We describe what we believe to be the first case of "big" IGF-II-producing pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. A 68-year-old man presented with a history of recurrent hypoglycemia. Abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass, approximately 5 cm in diameter, in the tail of the pancreas and two low-density areas in the liver. Low serum glucose was associated with low insulin levels and high levels of hormones (i.e., glucagon and IGF-II) that are functionally opposite to insulin. Although serum IGF-II level was within the normal range, most IGF-II was of the high molecular weight form, as determined by Western immunoblot analysis. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of hypoglycemia induced by IGF-II-producing pancreatic tumor was made. Surgery was not possible because of the patient's poor general condition. The patient ultimately died as a result of malignant cachexia. At autopsy, a yellowish-white tumor was found in the tail of the pancreas, and a histopathologic diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma was made. Immunohistologically, the tumor cells contained IGF-II in an irregular staining pattern, suggesting that the hypoglycemia was caused by a pancreatic tumor producing "big" IGF-II.
