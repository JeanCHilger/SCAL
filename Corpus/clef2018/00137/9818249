Disorders of the pancreas in children. In the past year, major advances in understanding pancreatic disease have been made through the tools of molecular biology. Genes responsible for both hereditary pancreatitis and pancreatic agenesis have been identified. The first description of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, a new noninvasive imaging study of the pancreatobiliary tree, was reported in children. Reviews of autoimmune pancreatitis, a newly described condition, pancreatitis in inflammatory bowel disease, tropical pancreatitis, and pancreatitis following liver transplantation were also published, as well as surgical and endoscopic therapy of pancreatitis.
