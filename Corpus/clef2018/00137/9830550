Splenic metastasis of a fallopian tube adenocarcinoma. Clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic characteristics of a case of a fallopian tube adenocarcinoma splenic metastasis are reported. This case illustrates the diagnostic difficulties of this situation. These difficulties are both related to the poorly specific symptomatology and the low specificity of the current imagery. Percutaneous biopsy aspiration guided by ultrasonography or CT-scan could be helpful. The treatment is surgery, eventually combined with adjuvant radiotherapy: it can allow a long survival time. Splenic metastasis should be systematically checked up in every tumoral context.
