High resolution breath-holding MR imaging of the abdomen with a phased-array multicoil. We prospectively compared standard resolution and high resolution breath-hold T1- and T2-weighted images of the upper abdomen with use of a body phased-array multicoil in 30 patients. The image quality of high resolution T1-weighted FLASH sequence was equal to that of standard resolution sequence, while the quality of high resolution T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence was slightly inferior to that of standard resolution sequence. The merit of high resolution image is appreciated especially on a T1-weighted FLASH sequence.
