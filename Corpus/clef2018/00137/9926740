Are pancreatic tumors hormone dependent?: A case report of unusual, rapidly growing pancreatic tumor during pregnancy, its possible relationship to female sex hormones, and review of the literature. The occurrence of a pancreatic tumor in a young patient is rare. However, when one identifies a pancreatic mass during pregnancy and particularly when the lesion is located in the tail of the pancreas, "unusual tumors" of the pancreas should be considered. The management of these tumors during pregnancy presents unusual challenges because of rapid tumor growth probably related to elevated levels of sex hormones. An immunohistochemical study was done to evaluate for hormone receptors of the tissue removed from the tumor. We present a case of a 37-year-old female patient in her 4th week of pregnancy who was found to have a pancreatic mass she was followed with ultrasonography. At the 23rd week of gestation, the tumor increased in size to more than 12 cm and required resection. Immunohistochemical studies were done to evaluate receptors for progesterone, estrogen, PS2-estrogen-related protein, pancreatic polypeptide antigen, flow cytometry, DNA ploidy, and proliferative activity in tumor cells. Pathology showed a low-grade multiloculated mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. There was a positivity for progesterone receptor and PS2-estrogen-related protein but not for estrogen receptor in the tumor. We conclude that a pancreatic mass detected during pregnancy requires a different consideration for its management. Early tissue diagnosis with CT or ultrasound-guided biopsy is essential. Even those lesions diagnosed as benign would require early intervention because of their rapid growth, probably influenced by female sex hormones.
