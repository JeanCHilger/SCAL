Inguinal tumor as the first manifestation of a pancreatic pseudocyst. We report a case of pancreatic pseudocyst in alcoholic pancreatitis, that presented as a mass in the inguinal region. The mechanism of this peculiar clinical presentation was the dissemination of the content of the pseudocyst along the psoas muscle. We review the involvement of psoas muscle in pancreatic pathology, giving emphasis to reports of inguinal or thigh masses as initial manifestations.
