Magnetic resonance tomography in diagnosis of vascular infiltration in malignant pancreas tumors. This study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in assessing venous or arterial infiltration in pancreatic cancer. In 90 patients MRA showed a sensitivity of 81.1%, a specificity of 90.2% and an accuracy of 85.9% in predicting venous infiltration and a sensitivity of 81.8%, a specificity of 90.7% and an accuracy of 88.1% in predicting arterial infiltration. From these data we conclude that MRA is an accurate method for detecting vascular infiltration in pancreatic cancer.
