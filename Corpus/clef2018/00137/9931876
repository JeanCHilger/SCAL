Radical surgery in cystadenoma of the pancreas--long-term experiences with 35 patients. We report on 15 patients with mucinous and 19 patients with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Cystadenomas were more common in female patients (22/12), and CT was the most sensitive diagnostic tool. There was no mortality in the short or the long term (median 6 years) however, mucinous cystadenomas tend to recur when not treated by radical resection.
