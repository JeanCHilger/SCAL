Pancreas: does hyoscyamine butylbromide increase the diagnostic value of helical CT? Among 50 patients referred for helical computed tomography (CT) of the pancreas, 24 randomly selected patients received 40 mg of hyoscyamine butylbromide to evaluate whether its administration improved image quality and diagnostic findings. Differences between the groups were not statistically significant. It was therefore concluded that hyoscyamine butylbromide does not contribute a diagnostic advantage at helical CT of the pancreas.
