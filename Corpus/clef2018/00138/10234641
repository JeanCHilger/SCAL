Traumatic pancreatitis: long-term review of initial non-operative management in children. To assess the safety and long-term efficacy of an initial non-operative approach to the management of pancreatic trauma in children.Retrospective case-note review of children admitted to our institution with the diagnosis of pancreatic trauma over a 10-year period from 1985 to 1994 inclusive.Fourteen children were identified with a diagnosis of traumatic pancreatitis. Eleven of the injuries were secondary to motor vehicle accidents or trauma from a bicycle handlebar. In seven patients there were associated intra-abdominal injuries and in eight patients the traumatic pancreatitis was complicated by development of a pseudocyst. Three pseudocysts settled without intervention, two resolved with percutaneous external drainage and the remaining three required open surgery. The mean in-patient stay was 21.2 days. The average length of follow-up was 7.7 years with no observed long-term complications.Non-operative management of traumatic pancreatitis in the absence of complete duct transection is safe in children and does not appear to be associated with adverse sequelae.
