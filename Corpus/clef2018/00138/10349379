Pancreatic metastasis of cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration. A case report. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a valuable technique in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors or their metastases.A rhabdomyosarcoma of the left atrium with metastasis to the pancreas was diagnosed by FNA in a 74-year-old female. The patient presented with dyspnea, weight loss and generalized weakness and was found to have a cardiac arrhythmia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9-cm mass in the left atrium and anterior mediastinum. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a 2.8-cm nodule within the head of the pancreas. The patient underwent CT-guided percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass on the first hospital day and, on the second day, transvenous FNA biopsy of the intracardiac mass. The cytologic morphology and immunocytochemistry of the aspirated material from both sites established a diagnosis of cardiac rhabdomysarcoma with metastasis to the pancreas.This is the fifth reported case of rhabdomysarcoma metastatic to the pancreas and the first in which the diagnosis was made by FNA, thereby eliminating the need for open biopsy.
