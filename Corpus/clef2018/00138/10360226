Pancreas divisum. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is diagnostic. Similarly, secretin stimulated ultrasonography may positively predict the outcome of minor papilla therapy. Computed tomography is only helpful for the detection of complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new noninvasive diagnostic tool in development. It is accurate and might replace ERCP for diagnosis. Clinically, symptomatic patients with PD may be divided into five groups: group 1, those with minimal symptoms group 2, those with recurrent acute pancreatitis or upper abdominal pain with no other cause
