Insulinoma diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biopsy. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) is a new technique that seems to expand the utility of EUS, making definitive diagnosis of pancreatic lesions possible. However, the exact indications for the method, as well as its limitations, are not fully defined. We report on a patient with an insulinoma in the tail of the pancreas undetected by other imaging modalities that was conclusively diagnosed by EUS-FNA. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a unique imaging modality for localization of small pancreatic lesions. In combination with FNA, it represents a significant improvement for the exact diagnosis of these tumors.
