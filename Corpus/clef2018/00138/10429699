Hemoperitoneum as the sole indicator of abdominal visceral injuries: a potential limitation of screening abdominal US for trauma. To determine, at screening ultrasonography, the prevalence, severity, and clinical outcome of clinically important abdominal visceral injuries, without associated hemoperitoneum, that result from blunt abdominal trauma.Computed tomography (CT) was performed at admission in 466 patients with visceral injury. A retrospective review was performed of findings from surgery and contrast material-enhanced spiral and conventional CT performed to verify abdominal visceral injuries in 467 (4%) of 11,188 patients with blunt trauma. These patients were admitted to a level 1 trauma center over 33 months to determine the presence of hemoperitoneum and to identify the grade of injury. Medical records of patients with abdominal visceral injury without hemoperitoneum were reviewed for the management required and for results of focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST).A total of 575 abdominal visceral injuries were identified at CT and/or surgery. Findings of CT at admission (n = 156) and of surgery (n = 1) revealed no evidence of hemoperitoneum in 157 (34%) patients with abdominal visceral injury 26 (17%) of whom also had negative FAST studies. Abdominal visceral injuries diagnosed in patients without hemoperitoneum included 57 (27%) of 210 splenic injuries, 71 (34%) of 206 hepatic injuries, 30 (48%) of 63 renal injuries, four (11%) of 35 mesenteric injuries, and two (29%) of seven pancreatic injuries. Surgical and/or angiographic intervention was required in 26 (17%) patients without hemoperitoneum.Reliance on the presence of hemoperitoneum as the sole indicator of abdominal visceral injury limits the value of FAST as a screening diagnostic modality for patients who sustain blunt abdominal trauma.
