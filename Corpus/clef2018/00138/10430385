Pancreaticoduodenectomy for chronic pancreatitis: a case report and literature review. This is a case report of a patient with chronic pancreatitis who presented with biliary, duodenal and portal vein obstruction, a mass in the head of the pancreas, and a CA 19-9 level of 372 U/ml. Thus, the concern was raised as to the possibility of pancreatic cancer in this patient. We discuss the difficulties in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis and the treatment options available for patients with chronic pancreatitis where the significant findings involve the head of the pancreas. Finally, a brief review is given describing the pertinent literature on the surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis and the current indications of pancreaticoduodenectomy for chronic pancreatitis.
