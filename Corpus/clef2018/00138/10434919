Metastases to the pancreas. Disparity in prognosis and management between primary and secondary pancreatic tumours makes recognition of metastases to the pancreas on CT and MRI an important goal. Three different patterns of secondary pancreatic tumours may be seen: localized, multifocal, or diffuse enlargement. CT findings include hypodense lesions, which show rim enhancement following intravenous contrast medium. On MR examination, the lesions are usually hypointense on T1 weighted and hyperintense on T2 weighted images.
