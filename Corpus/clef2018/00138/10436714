Laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Initial results of a Chilean experience. Laparoscopic adrenal approach was introduced in 1992 and is becoming the surgical method of choice for several adrenal diseases.To report the initial Chilean experience in laparoscopic adrenalectomy.A retrospective review of 17 patients subjected to the surgical procedure by the authors.The preoperative diagnosis were adenomas (8 patients), pheochromocytoma (3), cystic lesions (2), adrenal metastases (2), hyperaldosteronism (1) and a pituitary Cushing (1). The average lesion size was 5.4 cm, the operative time 2.5 hours and the hospital stay 2.5 days. Eight patients were discharged in less than 48 hours. Pain was managed with non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs in 14 patients. One subject required conversion to open surgery. Transfusions were required in complex cases with a diaphragmatic hamartoma, Cushing disease and in a combined adrenal and renal resection. One patient had to be re admitted due to a pancreatic pseudo cyst that was drained percutaneously. There have been no recurrences after a mean follow up of 2 years.This early experience with laparoscopic adrenalectomy shows good results. A good patient selection and experience with advanced laparoscopic surgery are requisites for a successful use of this surgical technique.
