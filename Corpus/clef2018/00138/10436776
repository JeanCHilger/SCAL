Computed tomography in the diagnosis and staging of cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma. This paper is a review of the current techniques and results of helical CT in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma of the intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts. CT has a diagnostic accuracy rate of over 95% for detection and diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma and close to 100% in staging unresectable tumors. The accuracy of staging surgically resectable tumors is about 80%. Accuracy of determining the level of biliary obstruction caused by cholangiocarcinoma is close to 100%. The accuracy of making a specific diagnosis is about 78%.
