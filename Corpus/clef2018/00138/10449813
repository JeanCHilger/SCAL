Laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography in the TNM staging of pancreatic carcinoma. A prospective study was performed comparing laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography (LapUS), transabdominal ultrasonography (USS), computed tomography (CT), and selective visceral angiography with portal phase venography (SVA) for the assessment of resectability in 50 patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer. The results were stratified by TNM stages. Tumor unresectability was demonstrated in 36 patients (72%). The sensitivity of LapUS for demonstrating the index lesion was 96%. Laparoscopic ultrasonography failed to predict factors precluding resection by T stage in six patients, and there were no significant differences in the ability of any modality to predict local resectability (predictive value 58-73%). Laparoscopic ultrasonography did not overestimate T stage and was significantly more specific for assessing unresectability compared with USS (100% vs. 64%, p<0.05) and CT (100% vs. 47%, p<0.005). No imaging investigation was able to assess the N stage accurately. Metastases were confirmed in 16 patients (32%), with LapUS proving significantly more sensitive than USS (94% vs. 29%, p<0.001) and CT (94% vs. 33%, p<0.005). The addition of LapUS to the laparoscopic examination did not change the M stage in any patient, as all metastases were superficially located. Laparoscopy with LapUS was the most reliable method for assessing overall tumour resectability and was significantly more predictive than CT (97% vs. 79%, p<0.005). These results confirm that laparoscopy is indispensable for detecting occult intraabdominal metastases. LapUS reliably predicts tumor unresectability, offsetting the tendency of USS and CT to overestimate T stage. Methods of accurate N staging remain elusive, and the use of routine SVA is not justified.
