Giant benign gastric ulcer penetrating into the liver, pancreas and mesocolon. Penetration of the liver, pancreas and transverse mesocolon by a giant benign gastric ulcer is relatively uncommon, and literature contains a few reports of this complication. The preoperative histological diagnosis may be difficult or impossible. A 63-year-old female patient with a history of seven months of lack of appetite, asthenia, epigastric pain, a remarkable weight decrease, presenting at physical examination a large, smooth margins, not pulsating, quite fixed abdominal mass, is reported. Echography confirmed the presence of a mass of approximately 14 x 19 cm, with solid and liquid content. Biopsy showed inflammatory elements and cellular detriti. Barium enema showed that the mass compressed the descendent colon, which appeared dislocated. Tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9, alpha-fetoprotein) where in the normal range. Endoscopy showed a giant angular ulcer whose bottom was represented by necrotic material (after the definitive histological examination it proved to be hepatic tissue). At TC scan of the abdomen, a remarkable thickening of the gastric wall was present. At surgery the stomach appeared increased in volume, with remarkably thickened walls, tenaciously sticking to II and III hepatic segments, to the pancreas and transverse mesocolon. A total gastrectomy was performed because of the depth of the ulcer penetration and the extension of the alteration of the gastric wall, even if the giant gastric ulcer, in the literature, is more frequently benign than malignant.
