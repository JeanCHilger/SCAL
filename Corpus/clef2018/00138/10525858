MRI of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Magnetic resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging technique able to provide projectional images of the bile ducts. Different sequences, using both breath-hold and non-breath-hold acquisition techniques, have been employed in order to obtain MRCP images. The authors discuss technical aspects, considering both three-dimensional non-breath-hold techniques and two-dimensional breath-hold, multi-slice and thick slab sequences. Clinical applications of MRCP are evaluated, presenting data from both the literature and personal experience. The main indication for MRCP study is represented by the evaluation of common bile duct obstruction, with the aim of assessing the presence of the obstruction (accuracy 85-100%) and, subsequently, its level (accuracy 91-100%) and its cause. The utility of associating conventional MR images to MRCP in malignant strictures, in order to characterize and stage the malignant lesion, is also discussed. Finally, data are presented regarding the indications and the utility of MR-pancreatography in the evaluation of patients with pancreatic duct anomalies and chronic pancreatitis.
