Pancreaticoduodenectomy of ampullary carcinoma. Thirty-two consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater who had curative resection by pancreaticoduodenectomy were analyzed to determine the accuracy of preoperative investigations and factors that influenced survival. Obstructive jaundice was present in 31 patients, and most patients had pain and weight loss. Ultrasound was more useful than CT in identifying biliary obstruction, whereas CT was more accurate in demonstrating pancreatic duct dilatation and an ampullary mass. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with biopsy and brush cytology was the most accurate investigation and proved or was suspicious of carcinoma in all patients. Nineteen patients had postoperative complications, three of whom died (9.4%)-two of sepsis and one from aspiration following hematemesis. Actuarial 5-year survival was 46 per cent. Stage of disease was the strongest predictor of survival. All patients with T1 lesions are alive more than 5 years after resection. Patients with lymph node metastases had a significantly shorter survival than node-negative patients (P = 0.00087). Pancreaticoduodenectomy is advocated for ampullary carcinoma in good-risk patients, with the anticipation of prolonged survival in those with early (T1) lesions and node-negative disease.
