Multiplanar spiral CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Investigation of the capabilities of MSCT and its value for the staging of pancreatic carcinomas.50 Patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma were examined with a biphasic multislice-spiral-CT protocol: slice collimation 4 x 1 mm, Pitch 3.5-4 mm. After administration of 120 ml contrast medium and 50 ml NaCl with a flow rate of 3.0 ml/s the examination was started with a delay of 40 s (pancreatic phase) and 80 s (portal venous phase).Multislice spiral CT allows the examination of the whole upper abdomen with nearly isotropic data sets. This is the premise for the optimal assessment of the tumor extent in all planes, excellent demarcation of the tumor against the adjacent vessels and organs and the demarcation of small peripancreatic lymph nodes.Multislice spiral CT and the use of interactive multiplanar reconstructions improve the staging of pancreatic cancer.
