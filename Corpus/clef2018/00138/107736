Ultrasonography of biliary tract dilatation without jaundice. The significance of intrahepatic biliary distension in the nonjaundiced patient was studied. Biochemical profiles and endoscopic and surgical findings were evaluated. Biliary tract disease was proven in 11 of 12 patients, with nine of the 11 having concurrent pancreatic disease. Ultrasound proved a more sensitive indicator of partial biliary obstruction than the serum bilirubin levels. The biliary tract of nonjaundiced patients with ultrasonographic evidence of biliary distension should be evaluated by additional studies regardless of the biochemical profile.
