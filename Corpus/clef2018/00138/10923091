A case report of ascariasis of the common bile duct in a patient who had undergone cholecystectomy. This is a case report of ascariasis of the common bile duct in a 65-year-old man from Colombia who had undergone prior cholecystectomy. The patient presented with postprandial epigastric pain and a 20-lb weight loss. The laboratory findings were remarkable for peripheral blood eosinophilia. The ultrasound finding was suggestive of periampullary or pancreatic neoplasm. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic extraction of a motile, live worm identified as Ascaris lumbricoides. Roundworm infestation should always be suspected in immigrants from endemic areas who present with hepatobiliary symptoms.
