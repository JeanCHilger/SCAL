Surgical treatment of leiomyosarcoma of the distal duodenum. Malignant tumors of the small intestine are rare. An uncommon finding of leiomyosarcoma located in the fourth part of the duodenum was diagnosed by gastrointestinal contrast studies, CT and angiography. Although malignant lesions of the small bowel are usually diagnosed late and thus are far advanced, curative resection was possible in our case. The location and histology of the tumor permitted a 'pancreas-preserving segmental duodenectomy'. The operative approach and exposure using the Cattell maneuver is described. It is emphasized that the more extensive pancreatoduodenectomy should be reserved for adenocarcinomas or lesions situated in the proximal part of the duodenum. Thirteen years following the operation, the patient is asymptomatic while CT and gastrointestinal contrast studies reveal no evidence of disease.
