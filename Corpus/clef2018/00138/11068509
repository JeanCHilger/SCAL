Pancreatic and biliary tract tumors--diagnosis: ultrasonic diagnosis--endosonography. Pancreaticobiliary tumors are mostly adenocarcinomas with a poor 5-year survival of less than 2%. Early diagnosis of resectable tumors improves outcome. Conventional ultrasound (US) is non-invasive and is the first modality employed on suspicion of these tumors. With adequate skills and equipment, pancreatic tumors from 1.5 cm in diameter can be detected. By contrast, US is less sensitive in the detection of lymph node involvement and infiltration of blood vessels. Depending on the location tumors of the biliary tract appear as a mass lesion intrahepatically or within the gallbladder. Perihilar and extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas cause proximal duct dilatation which is readily detected by US. Again, sensitivity in the detection of lymph node metastases or portal vein invasion is limited. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has emerged as the method of choice in detecting small pancreatic tumors (e.g. < 2 cm in diameter). An accuracy of over 90% in T-staging and blood vessel infiltration can be achieved whereas lymph node metastases are correctly diagnosed in only 67% of cases. EUS-guided biopsy is readily performed using a curved array scanner. This technique enables neurolysis of the coeliac plexus in patients with heavy pain. EUS adds valuable information in cases of distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer. The role of EUS is limited in perihilar and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Staging and palliative therapy of perihilar carcinoma is still a domain of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Intraductal EUS is restricted to specialized centers and plays no role for routine purposes.
