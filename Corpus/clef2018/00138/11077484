Indications for preoperative ERCP. The indication for preoperative ERCP is about to be changed after the introduction of MRCP. There are however advantages of ERCP especially if the option of a therapeutic procedure, e.g., extraction of stones or placing of stents is considered. Besides ERCP prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy which is discussed elsewhere in this journal, indications for preoperative ERCP consist in patients after concussion trauma and hyperamylasemia as long as CT or MRI are not able to show pancreatic duct rupture. In this context the possibility of a stent placement is a major advantage of ERCP, since surgery may be avoided by this procedure. Preoperative ERCP may be performed in patients with chronic pancreatitis and refractory pain with the option of endoscopic therapy in cases with limited findings (less than 3 stones located in the pancreatic head). Furthermore, ERCP plays an important role in the preoperative differentiation between cystic neoplasms and pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts may be cured by endoscopical placement of transpapillary, transgastric or transduodenal stents. But so far no prospective studies have compared surgical with endoscopical drainage of pseudocysts. Finally, ERCP in the primary diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma plays only a limited role and should be performed only if non-invasive methods are not able to clarify the situation.
