Cystic dystrophia of the duodenal wall with aberrant pancreas. Value of magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis. Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall is characterized by the development of cysts in heterotopic pancreatic tissue localized in the duodenal wall. Diagnosis is difficult and endosonography is considered as the most useful investigation.A 40-year-old man was hospitalized for abdominal pain triggered by ingestion of alcoholic beverages and for vomiting after food intake. The diagnosis of acute atypical cephalic pancreatitis was initially made. Magnetic resonance cholangiography then magnetic resonance imaging suggested the diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in a heterotopic pancreas which was confirmed by endosonography.Magnetic resonance imaging evidenced several cystic formations within a thickened duodenal wall leading to the correct diagnosis. MRI appears to provide all the elements necessary for the diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall, avoiding the need for invasive investigations.
