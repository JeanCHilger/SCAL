Echinococcus cyst of the pancreas: description of a case and review of the literature. The echinococcosis represents a common condition in many parts of the world with maximum incidence in Uruguay (32 cases/100,000/year), in Argentina (21 cases/100,000/year), and in Morocco (7.2 cases/100,000/year). Italy is among the middle-high risk countries with beyond 1000 annual surgeries for hydatid cyst. Liver (45-75%) and lung (10-50%) are the most frequent localizations of echinococcosis. The other localizations represents the 13% of total. The hydatid cyst of pancreas constitutes the 1%. The Authors report the clinical case of a 28 years old woman, admitted for abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound, angio-CT and angiography of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery have been undertaken and the presence of a 10 x 10 cm lesion in the body-tail of pancreas has been showed, and the diagnosis of pseudocyst or cystadeno-carcinoma of pancreas has been formulated. The patient underwent surgery with body-tail pancreatectomy plus splenectomy. The histopathological examination showed the presence of hydatid cyst contained clear fluid and daughter cysts. The treatment of this infrequent localization of hydatid cyst is exclusively surgical. The tactic and surgical technique must aim to radical cyst's removal, with the maximum saving of the stricken organ, maintaining a good pancreatic function, either exocrine and endocrine.
