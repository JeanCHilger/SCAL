Pancreatobiliary adenosquamous carcinoma (report of two cases). Adenosquamous carcinomas are rare malignant tumors of the pancreas and periampullary region. We present two cases of pancreatic and periampullary adenosquamous carcinoma with clinicopathologic, histo- and immunohistochemical findings. A 51-year-old and a 48-year-old man presented with right upper quadrant pain of three months duration and jaundice for two weeks. Both cases had an elevation of liver enzymes and CA 19-9. In the first case, computerized tomography showed a 3 cm-mass at the pancreatic head. In the second one, endoscopic retrograde choledocopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a mass at the ampulla Vateri localization. A pancreatoduodenectomy was performed for both cases. Gross pathologic examination displayed a solid, gray-white colored 4 cm-tumor at the pancreatic head and a solid, pink-white colored, 2 cm-tumor at the periampullary region bulging into the duodenal lumen. Microscopically, both tumors were composed of solid nests of squamous cells with pearl formation and mucin-containing glandular cells and diagnoses were adenosquamous carcinoma. Furthermore, histo- and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with microscopic diagnoses.
