Hemosuccus pancreaticus (bleeding into the pancreatic duct). A rare complication of pancreatitis. A 41-year-old man was admitted because of recurrent tarry stools and dizziness. Chronic pancreatitis induced by alcoholism was known. The main abnormal laboratory finding was anaemia (haemoglobin 4.6 g/dl, erythrocytes 2.28/fl).At endoscopy of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum, fresh blood was found in the duodenum, a small trickle of blood coming from the papilla of Vater. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography discovered no abnormality in the biliary system. Selective contrast imaging of the pancreatic duct demonstrated a short prepapillary stenosis and a prestenotic dilatation (up to 15 mm diameter) of the pancreatic duct with a cloudy contrast filling defect. After catheter withdrawal from the pancreatic duct blood spurted from the papilla. Emergency angiography revealed pseudoaneurysmatic dilatation of the gastroduodenal artery in the region of the head of the pancreas. At selective catheterization this artery was successfully occluded with metal coils placed both proximally and distally to the source of bleeding.Gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of pancreatitis. When searching for bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the papilla of Vater should be looked for as a possible source. Bleeding from the pancreas occurs particularly in pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst or pancreatic tumour.
