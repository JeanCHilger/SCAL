Hypervascular liver metastasis from hypovascular ductal cell carcinoma of the pancreas. In a case of hypervascular metastatic liver tumor, the vascularity of primary focus, pancreatic carcinoma was hypovascular. Based on the imaging findings, we thought before the operation that the two lesions were double cancers. Histological examination showed that the stromal volume of metastatic tumorous tissue was richer than that of the primary focus. It was suggested that the difference in the stromal volume was related to the difference of the vascularity. Some foctors originating in stromal cells might be involved in angiogenesis.
