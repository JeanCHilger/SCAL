Endoscopic treatment of cholestasis caused by Ascaris lumbricoides. The most common infection of the hepatobiliary system and of the pancreas is the infestation with Ascaris lumbricoides. Pancreatobiliary ascariasis may present as recurrent biliary colic, acalculous cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, or hepatic abscess. Although ultrasonography is a highly sensitive and specific method for the detection of the disease, endoscopy may have also therapeutical potential. The majority of these infections is registered in developing countries, but the number of reports from Europe and North America is increasing. So far there has not been any publication from Hungary. Both of the two reported patients were admitted the hospital with colic pain in the right hypochondrium. The laboratory parameters revealed cholestasis. The transabdominal ultrasonography was normal in one case, but suspected alien body in the choledochus in the other patient. Ascaris lumbricoides was identified with endoscopic procedure in the ductus choledochus in both cases. Endoscopic extraction of the worm resulted in cessation of the complaints in both patients, their cholestatic laboratory parameters became normal. Although the parasitic tests in the stool were negative in both patients and in their relatives, mebendazole therapy was administered.
