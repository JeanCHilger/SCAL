The role of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in the treatment of traumatic pancreatic duct injury. The status of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is the most important determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with pancreatic trauma. Early diagnosis and optimal treatment are critical, especially when there is MPD injury.Twenty-three patients with pancreatic trauma were studied prospectively with respect to clinical and laboratory findings, CT, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). Treatment modalities and clinical outcome were assessed in relation to ERP findings.The pancreatic duct was injured in 14 of 23 patients (11 MPD, 3 branch duct). Contrast leakage from the MPD into peritoneal cavity at ERP confirmed MPD injury in 8 patients, who underwent surgical exploration. Three patients with leakage from a branch duct into the pancreatic parenchyma recovered with conservative treatment. Three patients in whom ERP demonstrated contrast leakage from the MPD confined to the parenchyma underwent successful transpapillary stent insertion with complete resolution of the leak at 3-month follow-up. Patients who underwent ERP more than 72 hours after trauma had a significantly higher rate of pancreas-associated complications and a tendency to remain hospitalized longer than patients who underwent ERP earlier.Early ERP is one of the most useful methods for demonstrating MPD injury. ERP assists with treatment planning based on the degree of pancreatic duct injury.
