Technologic advances in abdominal MR imaging. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is finding an ever-growing role in the evaluation of a wide range of conditions in the abdomen. No longer confined to problem solving regarding abnormalities in solid organs, such as the liver and kidneys, MR imaging is increasingly being applied to the evaluation of the pancreatic and biliary ductal systems and even the bowel. Recent technical advances in hardware and software have allowed the acquisition of MR images that are largely free of artifact secondary to bowel peristalsis or respiratory motion images providing excellent anatomic detail can now be obtained routinely. Faster sequences have reduced image acquisition time, thereby improving patient acceptance and allowing more efficient utilization of machine time. New three-dimensional sequences allow rapid image acquisition, reducing section misregistration and motion artifact while improving multiplanar reformations. The potential of MR imaging to provide functional and anatomic information is intriguing, and new techniques, including diffusion and perfusion imaging, are being evaluated. This review considers the advances in imaging hardware and pulse sequence design that underlie the increasing role of MR imaging in evaluation of the abdomen and discusses evolving clinical applications.
