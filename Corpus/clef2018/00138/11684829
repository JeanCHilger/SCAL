Massive gastrointestinal bleeding caused by ectopic pancreas mimicking jejunal tumor. Ectopic pancreas is usually an incidental finding at surgery or autopsy and rarely produces clinical symptoms. But it is capable of producing symptoms, depending on its location, size and involvement of the overlying mucosa.We report a case with massive gastrointestinal bleeding from ectopic pancreas mimicking jejunal tumor, confirmed by emergency operation. A 40-year-old male was admitted to Chonnam National University Hospital with a 2-day history of melena. A technetium-99m-labeled RBC scan showed massive radioactivity in loops of small bowel due to active bleeding. Superior mesenteric angiography revealed a hypervascular stained mass supplied by proximal jejunal branch. A computed tomographic scan of abdomen revealed an enhancing mass in the proximal jejunum. At emergency operation, bleeding from the center of the mass was found situated approximately 30 cm from the Treitz ligament. Segmental resection of the involved jejunum and end-to-end anastomosis were performed. Histologic examination of resected specimen revealed an ectopic pancreas.So far, there have been no case reports of massive gastrointestinal bleeding from ectopic pancreas mimicking jejunal tumor as described in our case. In every patient in whom ectopic pancreas can definitely be seen to cause clinical symptoms including gastrointestinal bleeding, the lesion should be excised.
