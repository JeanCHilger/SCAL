Pseudotumor of the pancreatic head associated with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. A 68-year-old male presented with abdominal pain and obstructive jaundice. CT revealed a large mass in the pancreatic head that was initially interpreted as pancreatic carcinoma. Needle biopsy revealed only fibrous tissue with signs of chronic inflammation. Together with typical findings of an idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, the final diagnosis of multifocal idiopathic fibrosclerosis with focal pseudotumorous pancreatic head fibrosis could be made.
