Fibrous tissue(s): a key for lesion characterization in digestive diseases. Fibrosis is one of the hallmarks of inflammatory and repair processes in pathology. Various exogenous and endogenous stimuli, including tumor development, can induce inflammatory reactions. During the post-equilibrium phase after IV injection of non specific contrast media, CT and/or MR allow the study of these inflammatory answers to tumoral or infectious processes. Delayed enhancement of collagenic fibrous tissue during the late post-equilibrium phase is an essential complementary data in the characterization of many liver lesions: cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, fibrous metastasis. but also for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases (groove pancreatitis vs ductal adenocarcinoma) or of gastro-intestinal diseases (gastric adenocarcinoma vs lymphoma, mechanical complication vs inflammatory bouts of ileal Crohn's disease).
