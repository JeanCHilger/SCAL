Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): correlation with diagnosis using ERCP. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is non invasive imaging technique able to provide projection images of the bile and pancreatic ducts. Using breath--hold and non-breath--hold acquisition techniques, have been employed in order to obtain MRCP images. Clinical applications of MRCP are evaluated from presenting references and from personal experience. The main indication for MRCP imaging was in evaluation of common bile duct obstruction, with aim of present the level, and its cause. The utility of conventional MR images to MRCP in the malignant lesion is already discussed. At the end, the utility of MR pancreatography in evaluation of the patients with pancreatic disease is discussed from both the literature and personal experiences. The clinical indications to perform ERCP in patients with pancreatic cancer may include palliative stent placement in patients with known non-resectable pancreatic carcinoma invading the common bile duct obtaining tissue material in patients with atypical masses in the pancreatic head, particularly in the periampullary area
