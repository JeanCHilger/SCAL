Pancreatic pseudocyst extending into the liver via the hepatoduodenal ligament: a case report. A case of pancreatic pseudocyst extending into the liver via the hepatoduodenal ligament is reported. This is the first report clearly demonstrating that the hepatoduodenal ligament is another route of hepatic extension of pancreatic pseudocysts as well as the hepatogastric ligament, which is the most common. The importance of the topological anatomy of the peritoneum is emphasized in understanding the extrapancreatic extension of pancreatic pseudocysts.
