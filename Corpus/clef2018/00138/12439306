Helical CT of pancreatic endocrine tumors. Pancreatic endocrine tumors are rare neoplasms. It is important to distinguish them from the more common ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas because they are slowly progressive and specific treatments are available. The CT findings of pancreatic endocrine tumors usually vary according to the functioning or nonfunctioning status. In this article, the authors illustrate typical and atypical CT findings of pancreatic endocrine tumors with radiopathologic correlations and give examples of other pancreatic conditions mimicking pancreatic endocrine tumors.
