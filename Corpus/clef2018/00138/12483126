Endoscopic management of biliary and pancreatic ascariasis in Viet-Nam. Report of a series of 91 cases. Ascariasis is the most widespread helminthiasis in the world. Biliary and pancreatic involvement, frequently encountered in endemic areas, is a serious public health problem. Surgical management is often required. The purpose of our work was to assess the feasibility of emergency endoscopic treatment of biliary and pancreatic ascariasis in the Viet Duc hospital (Hanoi, Vietnam), and to evaluate outcome.A prospective study conducted over a 3-year period included 91 patients with biliary and pancreatic ascariasis. Diagnosis was based on clinical findings and abdominal ultrasound and was confirmed by endoscopic procedures.The 91 patients, 21 males and 70 females, mean age 41 +/- 17 years, underwent endoscopic procedures to retrieve the worm. The procedure was successful in 89 patients (97.8%). Mild pancreatitis occurred in four patients who underwent biliary sphincterotomy. The mean hospital stay was 3.1 days.Endoscopic management of ascariasis is feasible, with a very low morbidity and a high rate of success. With this treatment, hospital stay is greatly shortened.
