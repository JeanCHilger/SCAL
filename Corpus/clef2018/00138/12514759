Pitfalls in diagnosis of non-Hodgkin-lymphoma of the pancreas. A 74 year-old woman was admitted because of upper abdominal pain radiating to the back. The patient was in good health prior to onset of symptoms. Both ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound revealed a lesion of low echogenicity in the pancreatic head without indication of hepatic lesions, enlarged lymph nodes or vascular infiltration. An computed tomography (CT) did not show the lesion in the pancreas. Explorative laparotomy was performed. The biopsy specimen revealed a diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma. This case report illustrates, how simple ultrasound studies can detect lesions not seen in more expensive, complex, and time consuming imaging techniques like CT. The patient underwent a postoperative chemotherapy and is currently well.
