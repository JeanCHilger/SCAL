A case of advanced pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastasis that improved remarkably with use of low-dose cisplatin and TS-1. The prognosis and QOL of unresectable pancreatic cancer are very poor. A symptomless 60-year-old male was admitted for examination of a high serum CA19-9 level. Following ultrasound and abdominal CT, we diagnosed unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastasis. After we obtained his informed consent, we administered continuous infusion of 5-FU and low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) infusion (low-dose FP therapy) for 3 weeks. He then underwent combination chemotherapy with low-dose CDDP and TS-1 on an outpatient basis. During the chemotherapy, he did not experience any major adverse event and his QOL was relatively good. On follow-up CT 3 months later, the primary tumor in the pancreas was found to be stable. However, the size and number of liver tumors were remarkably reduced. The serum CA19-9 level had also remarkably decreased from 48,300 U/ml to 1,480 U/ml. In conclusion, the combination chemotherapy using low-dose CDDP and TS-1 can be effective in cases of unresectable pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastasis.
