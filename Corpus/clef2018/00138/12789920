Value of image-guided needle aspiration cytology in the assessment of pelvic and retroperitoneal masses. A study of 112 cases. To evaluate the diagnostic value of the noninvasive method of image-guided needle aspiration cytology (NAC) in the assessment of radiologically detected pelvic and retroperitoneal space-occupying lesions (excluding the pancreas, kidney and adrenal).NAC was performed under computed tomographic or ultrasound guidance on 112 patients suspected of having a pelvic or retroperitoneal mass. Cytologic examination was performed on site after staining smears with the Papanicolaou method. In addition, air-dried smears, fixed smears, filter preparations from needle washings and cell blocks were studied. The NAC diagnosis was supported by examining cell blocks further support was obtained with a tissue biopsy in some cases. Additionally, pertinent immunoperoxidase and/or histochemical studies were done.Eighteen cases were diagnosed as inflammatory lesions, 17 cases consisted of normal cellular elements, and 12 cases showed scanty material and were considered unsatisfactory/inadequate for a diagnosis. Five cases were suspicious for malignancy, and in 39 cases metastatic tumors were diagnosed from a previously known primary. Thirteen cases were diagnosed as lymphoma, and in 8 cases a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma was made. There were no false positive diagnoses of malignancy. Cell block preparations and immunohistochemistry were helpful with tumor typing, although lymphoma subtyping and soft tissue tumor typing generally required open biopsy.NAC, as the first-line investigation, is not only useful in the diagnosis of space-occupying lesions of the pelvic and retroperitoneal region but can also help in choosing appropriate management. The technique is most useful in diagnosing metastases but is also helpful in excluding malignancy in some cases and in suggesting diagnoses of lymphomas and soft tissue tumors.
