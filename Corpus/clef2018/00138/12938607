Pancreatic echinococcosis. Report of a clinical case and review of the literature. We report a case of a suppurative hydatid cyst of the pancreas treated surgically (internal drainage on Roux "Y" loop). Follow-up at 6 months revealed no evidence of the cyst. We emphasise the low incidence of the disease in a pancreatic site (02-2% in the literature). This was the first case in our experience despite the fact that Sicily is an area in which the parasite is endemic. We also emphasise the preoperative diagnostic difficulties: ultrasonography and computed tomography yielded very images very similar to those of a pseudocyst or cystic carcinoma. In most cases, in fact, as in the one reported here, the condition is diagnosed during surgery.
