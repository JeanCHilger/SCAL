A 20-year review of pediatric pancreatic tumors. Pancreatic tumors are rare surgical problems in infants and children. A 20-year audit (1971 to 1991) of this institution showed six patients ranging in age from 3 weeks to 16 years who were operated on for pancreatic neoplasms. Five of these tumors were malignant, bringing the reported experience to 71 cases. This series of malignancies included three solid cystic tumors, one insulin-secreting tumor, and one pancreatoblastoma. The clinical presentations varied: three had abdominal pain, one developed hypoglycemia, and one had an abdominal mass with jaundice. In five of the six patients pancreatic pathology was suspected preoperatively. All were treated primarily with pancreatic resection including one pancreatoduodenectomy. No radiotherapy or chemotherapy was used. The perioperative mortality was 0% with a morbidity of 50%. The long-term results are encouraging, with all patients alive after a mean follow-up of 7.8 years. These data suggest that aggressive surgical therapy is warranted in the management of pediatric pancreatic tumors.
