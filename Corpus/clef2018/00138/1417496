Tubular adenoma of the main pancreatic duct. We report a case of tubular adenoma of the duct of Wirsung with focal villous changes. To our knowledge, this is the 13th reported case of this uncommon neoplasm and the first with a primarily tubular histologic pattern. The patient presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea and was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography to have a mass in the head of the pancreas, which was confirmed by endoscopic ultrasound. Clinical and pathological features of the 12 previously reported cases are reviewed. Intraoperative testing failed to rule out adenocarcinoma which, in addition to difficulties presented by local anatomic relationships of the tumor, supports wide surgical resection as the preferred surgical solution.
