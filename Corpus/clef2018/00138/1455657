Ultrasonography and computed tomography in the detection of overlooked gauze surgical dressings. USI and CT were performed in 14 patients with textile foreign bodies left in the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space during operation on the biliary tracts (6 cases), kidneys (4 cases), pancreas (2), stomach (1), and during appendectomy (1). A decisive sign in USI that enabled one to detect gauze foreign bodies, was a stable echogenic zone corresponding to a proximal body contour with a solid acoustic shadow behind. Extra-organic localization of these changes contributed to making diagnosis. A certain amount of fluid could be seen around a foreign body during an exudative reaction. In CT, diagnosis was based on the detection of a formation with a capsule containing calcinates and air masses.
