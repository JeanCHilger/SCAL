Secretin-stimulating MRCP: the diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary reflux. Pancreaticobiliary malfunction is a clinically important condition that may cause the occurrence of biliary malignancies. It is widely accepted that continuous reflux of the pancreatic juice into the common bile duct (CBD) and/or gallbladder is essential as an etiology of biliary malignancies. It has been also mentioned that reflux of the pancreatic juice into the CBD/gallbladder is observed regardless of the presence of pancreaticobiliary malfunction. Secretin-stimulating MRCP may demonstrate not only outflow of the pancreatic juice to the duodenum but also the phenomenon of reflux of the pancreatic juice into the CBD/gallbladder as enlargement of the CBD/gallbladder. We investigated whether secretin-stimulating MRCP can diagnose pancreaticobiliary reflux.
