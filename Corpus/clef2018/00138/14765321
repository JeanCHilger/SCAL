Invasive intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas with simultaneous invasion of the stomach and duodenum. An 81-year-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and weight loss. She had been diagnosed with an intraductal papillary mucosal tumor (IPMT) 7 years previously, but had refused surgery for religious reasons. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a nodular, elevated lesion that was discharging mucin into the duodenal bulb and posterior wall of the upper body of the stomach. Endoscopic ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were carried out, and a highly invasive IPMT with simultaneous invasion of the stomach and duodenum was diagnosed.
