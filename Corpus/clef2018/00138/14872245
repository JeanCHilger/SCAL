T cell lymphoplasmacellular and eosinophilic infiltration of the pancreas with involvement of the gallbladder and duodenum in non-alcoholic duct-destructive chronic pancreatitis. Non-alcoholic duct destructive chronic pancreatitis is a rare entity with specific pathological features. The majority of the patients are from Japan. We report a case with involvement of the distal bile duct, the gallbladder, the duodenum and the ampulla, and present a review of patients from Europe and the USA since 1997.A 56-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of mild acute pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice, followed by increasing weight loss, lethargy and epigastric pain. CT showed a mass in the head of the pancreas. ERCP demonstrated a smooth stricture of the intra-pancreatic main bile duct and an irregular, incomplete, stricture in the main pancreatic duct. A pancreatic cancer could not be reliably excluded, and, therefore, he underwent a pylorus-preserving Kausch-Whipple's pancreatoduodenectomy.Histopathology showed typical peri-ductal T cell-rich lymphoplasmacellular and eosinophilic infiltration of the pancreas, with involvement of the distal bile duct but, also, unusual inflammatory infiltration of the gallbladder, the duodenum and the ampulla.The inflammatory process in non-alcoholic duct-destructive chronic pancreatitis can affect the entire pancreato-biliary region and mimics pancreatic cancer. Currently, there are no definitive criteria for pre-operative diagnosis, so it is very difficult for one to avoid resection.
