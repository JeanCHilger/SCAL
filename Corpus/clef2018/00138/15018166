Pancreatic Castleman's disease: MR findings. Castleman's disease can involve a number of organs/tissues but generally affects the mediastinum. Occurrence of Castleman's disease in the pancreas in either form of the disease, the hyaline vascular or the plasma-cell type, is very rare, with only a few case reports in which the imaging findings were described. The MR imaging of pancreatic Castleman's disease has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. We submit the MRI findings in a patient with the plasma-cell-type of Castleman's disease, which presented as an isolated smoothly marginated pancreatic mass, hypointense on T1-weighted fat-suppressed images, isointense on T2-weighted sequences, and that after contrast material injection showed peripheral rim enhancement during the arterial phase.
