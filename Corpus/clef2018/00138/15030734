Mediastinal enteric cyst: unusual clinical presentation and histopathology. A mediastinal enteric cyst is an uncommon entity which is rare in adults and usually found incidentally. In most cases the lesion is lined by gastrointestinal mucosa, and theories as to the origin of such lesions are diverse. We report an adult case of thoracic enteric cyst that presented with cardiac tamponade and for which histopathological examination revealed the presence of pancreatic tissue. Review of the literature yielded only 1 case of mediastinal enteric cyst with pancreatic tissue.
