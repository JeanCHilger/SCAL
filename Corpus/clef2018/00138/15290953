Vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer: value of multislice helical CT. The evaluation of resectability in patients with pancreatic cancer remains a diagnostic challenge, especially regarding the preoperative assessment of vascular invasion. Thin-slice multiplanar reconstructions obtained with multislice helical computed tomography provide an exact depiction of the spatial relation between the tumor and the potentially invaded vessels and thus have the capability to improve the assessment of local resectability.
