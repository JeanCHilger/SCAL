Emphysematous cystitis. We present a case of emphysematous cystitis in a diabetic patient with a poor glycemic control in the context of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. A 62-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department after being found on floor with confusion and vomiting. The clinical examination was unremarkable except she was undernourished, agitated and presented an hepatomegaly. Urine contained 5.104 leukocytes/mm3 and culture grew Escherichia coli, 10(7) Colony Forming Unit/ml. Abdominal plain film showed gas shadows along the wall of urinary bladder. CT scan of the pelvis confirmed the presence of gas, and diffuse thickening of the urinary bladder wall. A Foley catheter was placed and the patient was treated with antibiotics for 6 weeks. She was also treated with insulin, rehydratation, vitamin B1 and B6, and pancreatic enzyme replacement. Emphysematous cystitis is defined by the presence of gas in the urinary bladder wall. It complicates urinary tract infections especially in diabetic patients but other disabled general medical conditions may be present. Because this relatively uncommon disease may present with fairly nonspecific findings, the diagnosis is often made incidentally on X-rays. However, as early diagnosis and treatment improve the outcome, a high index of suspicion for unusual presentations is warranted. Every diabetic patient with a urinary tract infection who seems to be severely ill should have an abdominal X-ray as a minimal screening tool to detect emphysematous complications.
