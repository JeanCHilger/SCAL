Autoimmune pancreatitis--an uncommon type of chronic pancreatitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a recently recognized clinical entity characterized by narrow strictured main pancreatic duct on ERCP, diffusely enlarged sausage-shaped pancreas on CT scan and MRI, seropositivity for antinuclear antibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and excellent response to steroids. We report a 25-year-old man and a 53-year-old man with this condition.
