Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for papillary solid and cystic neoplasm of pancreas. Papillary solid and cystic neoplasm (PSCN) is a rare neoplasm of the pancreas with low-grade malignant potential and favorable prognosis. We report an 18-year-old girl with PSCN presenting with advanced disease. The tumor regressed with six cycles of gemcitabine and cisplantin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was then done. She is disease-free at 13 months' follow-up.
