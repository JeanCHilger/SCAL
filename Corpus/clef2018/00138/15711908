MRI in gastrointestinal diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been called the most important development in medical diagnosis since the discovery of the X-ray more than 100 years ago. The effectiveness of MRI has been expanded to a variety of gastrointestinal disorders. The gastroenterologist's attention is currently focused on biliopancreatic and bowel diseases. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has become a competitive replacement for diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in a variety of hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. MR enteroscopy has the potential to become the preferred method for evaluating the entire small bowel, while on the other hand virtual colonoscopy is far from being promoted as a tool for general screening purposes in suspected colon diseases. In summary, whether or not the survival of endoscopy is under debate, MRI could mark a historic turning point in gastroenterology. So, MRI hardware might interdisciplinarily be used by, e. g., radiologists and gastroenterologists.
