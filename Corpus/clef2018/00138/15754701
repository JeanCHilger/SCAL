Aberrant pancreas: a rare cause of epigastralgia. The Authors report their experience about a case of aberrant pancreas that lead epigastralgia.Report of 1 case and endoscopic treatment (upper endoscopy + EUS + endoscopic polypectomy + endoscopic biopsy of the base. Surgical effectiveness evaluation.Section of General and Thoracic Surgery, Department of General Surgery, Emergency and Organ Transplantation, Policlinico "Paolo Giaccone", Palermo.After correct and sure diagnosis, the patient was submitted to endoscopic polypectomy with radical and curative intention.Complete recovery. Hematochemical and endoscopic follow-up (1 months) negative.Diagnosis of aberrant pancreas is very hard and always post-resection. Symptoms are poor and makes the clinical diagnosis extremely difficult, except when the mass attains big dimension (>5 cm). The best treatment of aberrant pancreas is based on correct diagnosis (upper endoscopy + EUS + FNAB) and on a radical treatment that, if the lesion is mucosal, is totally endoscopic (endoscopic polipectomy), without specific risk.
