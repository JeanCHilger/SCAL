Current diagnostics and therapy for carcinomas of the biliary tree and gallbladder. Carcinoma of the biliary tree are rare tumours of the gastrointestinal tract with a rising incidence during the last years. Biliary neoplasms are classified into intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumour, middle and distal extrahepatic tumours), gallbladder cancer, and ampullary carcinoma. Transformation of normal into malignant bile duct tissue requires a chain of consecutive gene mutations, similar to the adenoma-dysplasia-carcinoma-sequence in colon cancer. Abdominal ultrasound, combined non-invasive magnetic resonance cholangiography/tomography (MRC/MRT), and facultatively endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) for unclear diagnosis, represent the gold standard for primary diagnosis. For ampullary carcinoma, endosonography and endoscopic biopsy are the diagnostic tools of choice. Cure is attainable only by formal curative radical surgical resection. Increasing surgical radicality within the last years enabled clearly improved 5-year survival rates. In contrast, there has been no clinical benefit for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies. For palliation, bile duct stenting and photodynamic therapy are established methods. Radio- and chemotherapy should be reserved for clinical studies. New therapeutic approaches include brachytherapy, the use of modern chemotherapeutics, COX-2- and tyrosine kinase-receptor-inhibitors.
