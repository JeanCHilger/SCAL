Value of the single-phase technique in MDCT assessment of pancreatic tumors. The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic value of single-phase MDCT in patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma.Seventy-one patients (41 men, 30 women mean age, 63 yearsA final histopathologic diagnosis derived from surgical findings was obtained in 42 patients in the remaining 29 patients, percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy coupled with a 1-year clinical follow-up to determine development of local, regional or distant neoplasm served as gold standard proof of diagnosis. Final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 40 patients (27 ductal adenocarcinoma, nine mucinous cystoadenocarcinoma, two neuroendocrine tumors, one lymphoma, and one papillary cystoadenocarcinoma) and chronic pancreatitis in 31. The mean tumor size was 2.4 cm (range, 4-1 cm). Values for the area under the curve (A(z)) for the assessment of tumor detection were 0.97 for reviewer 1 and 0.96 for reviewer 2 (p = not significant). A(z) values for tumor resectability were 0.90 for reviewer 1 and 0.90 for reviewer 2 (p = not significant). No statistically significant differences were observed between superior mesenteric artery and vein opacification with the hepatic parenchyma enhanced at a time closer to the peak hepatic enhancement, optimizing the detection of hepatic lesions.Thin-section single-phase MDCT is an accurate technique for the diagnosis and assessment of resectability in patients with a suspected pancreatic neoplasm. This technique provides optimal tumor-to-pancreas contrast and maximal pancreatic parenchymal and peripancreatic vascular enhancement. It allows visualization of the entire liver and the whole upper abdomen during the portal phase for accurate identification of liver metastases and peritoneal seeding.
