Radiology of the pancreas. The techniques and applications of pancreatic imaging and interventional pancreatic radiology continued to expand in 1991. The most notable progress was the use of MR imaging for evaluation of the pancreas, particularly the investigation of contrast agents to produce enhancement of the pancreatic parenchyma. These agents offer considerable promise for the future of pancreatic MR imaging. The use of CT for detection and evaluation of complications of pancreatitis continued to grow and new investigations appeared that attempted to define the role of surgery vis-Ã -vis percutaneous and endoscopic interventional techniques. Finally, further understanding of cystic pancreatic neoplasms developed as the result of new investigations.
