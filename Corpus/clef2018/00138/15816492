Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (inflammatory fibrosarcoma) of the pancreas: a case report. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (inflammatory fibrosarcomas) of the pancreas are extremely rare. We report a 29-year-old woman who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for a 6-cm tumor of the pancreas head causing obstructive jaundice. Tumor involvement was local, without apparent metastasis. The tumor was composed of proliferating fibroblastic/or myofibroblast-like spindle cells and aggregates of chronic inflammatory cells in a fibromyxoid matrix. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated reactivity only to vimentin. This tumor has often been found in the peritoneal cavity, the retroperitoneum, or the pelvic cavity, but only very rarely in the pancreas.
