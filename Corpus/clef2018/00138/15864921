Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction associated with biliary tract dilatation in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. We present the case of a 57-year old female patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) along with glomerulonephritis and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO). Dilatation of bile and pancreatic ducts not associated with malignant or litiasic obstruction is reported. The combination of bile duct associated with CIPO in a patient with lupus has not been previously reported in the literature and it probably suggests a smooth muscle dysmotility.
