Splenic cysts and tumors: diagnosis and management. Cysts and tumors of the spleen are rare and are often discovered fortuitously. They are most often asymptomatic but may present with abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant. Splenic cysts are far more common than solid lesions true cysts must be differentiated from pseudocysts of the pancreas and from cystic degeneration following splenic contusion or infarction. Cysts may be congenital (epidermoid cysts), infectious (abscess or hydatid cyst), or neoplastic (lymphangioma or angioma with tumor necrosis). Diagnosis can usually be established with the clinical context and imagery (ultrasound, CT, MRI). Surgery should be avoided for angiomas and pseudocysts. Spleen-conserving surgery is indicated for large symptomatic epidermoid cysts. Splenectomy is often required for hydatid cysts and tumors. Of the solid tumors, hemangiomas and lymphangiomas often have a characteristic fleshy appearance. For other solid tumors, whether benign or malignant, imaging may give some clues to the diagnosis, but diagnostic certitude often requires pathologic examination of the piece. Needle biopsy is contraindicated because of the risk of bleeding. Resection should be as limited as possible in order to avoid the risks of total splenectomy (overwhelming sepsis, thrombosis).
