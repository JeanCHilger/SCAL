Utility of fusion CT-PET in the diagnosis of small pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic carcinoma has a poor prognosis and early detection is essential for potentially curative resection. Despite the wide array of diagnostic tools, preoperative detection of small pancreatic carcinomas remains difficult. We report a case of small pancreatic carcinoma of the head of pancreas with indeterminate findings on US, ERCP, MRI and EUS which was successfully diagnosed via fusion CT-PET. This case illustrates the utility of CT-PET in the diagnosis of patients with small pancreatic carcinoma with equivocal findings on conventional diagnostic modalities.
