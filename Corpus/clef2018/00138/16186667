Mixed exocrine-endocrine tumor of the pancreas. Neoplasms of the pancreas usually show ductal, acinar or endocrine differentiation. Tumors with mixed exocrine and endocrine components are unusual. We herein describe a case of a mixed ductal-endocrine tumor.A 65-year-old woman was referred to our department with a diagnosis of carcinoma of the tail of the pancreas. The patient had a short history of upper abdominal pain, nausea and melena. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed gastric fundus varices and CT scan demonstrated an inhomogeneous tumor located in the tail of the pancreas infiltrating the spleen and the splenic vein. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and had an uneventful recovery. Pathological examination revealed a mixed ductal-endocrine tumor. The endocrine component was immunoreactive for glucagon, gastrin and somatostatin, and non-reactive for insulin.Because of the rarity and unpredictable biologic behavior of these tumors, the need for adjuvant therapy has not yet been well-defined. The patient has had a follow-up CT scan every six months, and one and a half years later remains disease free.
