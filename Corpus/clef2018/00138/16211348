Usefulness of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) has come into widespread use, mainly in Western countries, as an efficient and safe method for the cytologic or histologic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. However, it still has received relatively little attention in Japan. To evaluate the clinical status of EUS-FNAB in Japan, we retrospectively analyzed the results with regard to the ability of EUS-FNAB to diagnose pancreatic cancer, as well as its safety.A total of 52 patients (37 male, 15 female mean age, 62.5 yearsThe final diagnoses were malignant tumors in 32 patients and benign ones in 20. Insertion of the needle into the lesion was successful in 50 of the 52 patients (96.2%). Adequate specimens were obtained by EUS-FNAB from 47 of the 50 pancreatic lesions (94.0%). With five false-negative and no false-positive results, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 89.4%, 82.1%, 100%, 100%, and 79.2%, respectively. No complications occurred.EUS-FNAB is an efficient and safe method for the histologic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. It should be considered as one of the indispensable modalities for the histological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in Japan, as it is in Western countries.
