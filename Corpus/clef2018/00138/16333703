CT virtual pancreatoscopy: a new method for diagnosing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas. We sought to validate computed tomographic virtual pancreatoscopy (CT-VP) created by multidetector row CT (MD-CT) in the clinical diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas.Five cases of pancreatic IPMNs were included in this study. A nasopancreatic drainage tube was inserted and the pancreatic duct was filled with contrast medium, after which an upper abdominal scan was performed by MD-CT. CT-VP and three-dimensional (3D) CT pancreatographic images were created using a workstation and compared with images by conventional diagnostic techniques. All cases were evaluated by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) and three cases of main duct type were assessed by intraoperative real pancreatoscopy (RP).In the main duct cases, papillary projections in the main pancreatic duct and branch orifices were clearly detected by CT-VP. These lesions and structures were confirmed by intraoperative RP, and the CT-VP images were clearer than RP images. In branch cases, a surface-rendering method allowed protruding lesions to be clearly detected in the dilated branches.Compared with conventional ERP or RP, CT-VP and 3D-CT pancreatographic images were finer in quality, and the procedures were less invasive, faster, and less expensive. The potential shown by CT-VP with 3D-CT pancreatography in the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic IPMNs suggests that this approach may replace ERP in the near future.
