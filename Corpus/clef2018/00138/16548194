Curved planar reformations in multi-slice spiral CT in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: prediction of invasion of pancreatic and peripancreatic ductal structures. To investigate the clinical values of the curved planar reformation (CPR) in multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) in determining the malignant invasion of pancreatic carcinoma into the intrapancreatic and peripancreatic ductal structures.Thirty-seven patients having documented pancreatic carcinoma with tumor involvement of intrapancreatic or peripancreatic ductal structures were enrolled. All patients received dual-phase MSCT scan of upper abdomen. Images generated by CPR technique were used for evaluating the appearances of intrapancreatic and peripancreatic ductal structures.Malignant invasion of peripancreatic arteries was found in 28 patients and characterized by: obliteration of fat plane between tumor and the artery, with contact surface of more than 180 degrees stenosis or deformation of the arteryInvasion of intrapancreatic or peripancreatic ductal structures by pancreatic carcinoma has certain MSCT imaging features. CPR technique is valuable in depicting these imaging findings.
