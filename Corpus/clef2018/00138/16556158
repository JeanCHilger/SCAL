Acute appendicitis after solid organ transplantation. Appendicitis has rarely been reported following solid organ transplantation and never following liver transplantation. We reviewed records of all patients who received solid organ transplants at UCLA between 1989 and 2002 and subsequently underwent appendectomy for presumed acute appendicitis. Of nearly 8000 transplant patients, 17 (nine male, eight female) subsequently underwent appendectomy for presumed acute appendicitis. Average age at appendectomy was 37 yrs (range 6-73 yrs). Organ transplants included liver (seven patients), heart (four), kidney (three), kidney-pancreas (two), and heart-kidney (one). The mean interval from transplant to appendectomy was 1064 d (16-2977). Presenting symptoms and signs included abdominal pain in 16 patients (94%) nausea and or vomiting in 15 (88%)
