Relationship between adiponectin and beta-cell function in abdominal visceral obesity women. To investigate the relationship between adiponectin and beta-cell function in abdominal visceral obesity women.Nine abdominal visceral obesity women (VO), 9 normal subjects (C) and 7 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were enrolled in the study. Beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were determined by hyperglycemic clamp, fasting serum adiponectin was assayed by ELISA and regional body fat was measured by MRI.The levels of first phase insulin release (FPIR), glucose disposal rates (GDR), insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and adiponectin were significantly elevated in control group compared with VO group and T2DM group. As compared with T2DM group, the levels of adiponectin, FPIR, second phase insulin release (SPIR) and maximum insulin release (INS(max)) increased significantly in VO group. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that age, FPIR and GDR were positively correlated to adiponectin (B=0.145, 0.194, 0.277 respectively, all P<0.05), while waist-hip ratio was negatively correlated with adiponectin (B=-7.424, P<0.05).The visceral obesity women have lower adiponectin levels, and hyperadiponectinemia may be the link with insulin secretion.
