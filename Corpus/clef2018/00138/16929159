A case of adenosquamous carcinoma of the papilla of Vater. Adenosquamous carcinoma of the papilla of Vater is a rare tumor and only a few cases have been reported so far. Here, we report a case of adenosquamous carcinoma in a 76-year-old male who presented with jaundice and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Ultrasonography and enhanced abdominal CT scans showed dilated common bile duct (CBD) and intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) with a suspicious obstructing mass in distal CBD. On endoscopy, obstructing and ulcerated mass was noted on the papilla of Vater. Histopathological inspection of the biopsied specimens from mass showed adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the papilla of Vater. Since the patient refused operation, we inserted a self-expandable metallic stent in distal CBD. This is the first case report on adenosquamous carcinoma of the papilla of Vater in Korea.
