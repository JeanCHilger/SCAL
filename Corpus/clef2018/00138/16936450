A 13-year-old girl with a preoperatively diagnosed solid cystic tumor of the pancreas. We report on a 13-year-old girl with a solid cystic tumor of the pancreas. She was referred to our hospital with abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant. Physical examination revealed a firm mass in the abdomen. Ultrasonography showed a clearly demarcated round mass with a mixture of solid and cystic components. Computed tomography confirmed that the mass measured 5 x 5 cm with low density in the cystic region and soft-tissue density in the solid region. Magnetic resonance also showed a clearly demarcated mass with a solid portion of low intensity on T1-weighted images and high intensity on T2-weighted images. We diagnosed a solid and cystic tumor of the pancreas and subsequently performed distal pancreatectomy. A firm, well-encapsulated tumor was found in the pancreas tail. The cut surface of the tumor consisted of a solid area with hemorrhage and a cystic area. Light microscopy of the tumor confirmed small neoplastic cells. Pathological diagnosis was solid pseudopapillary tumor (solid cystic tumor) of the pancreas. Surgery was successful, and the postoperative course was uneventful.
