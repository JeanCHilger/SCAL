Pediatric pancreatic hemangioma: a case report and literature review. The pancreas is an unusual site for a hemangioma in an infant. A child with obstructive jaundice caused by a pancreatic hemangioma is presented and management strategies for this benign tumor are discussed.A 5-month-old girl presented with a 2-week history of jaundice, pale stools and dark urine. Liver function tests confirmed obstructive jaundice. An abdominal ultrasound scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing mass in the head of the pancreas. At laparotomy, a wedge biopsy of the pancreatic tumor was taken and a tube cholecystostomy inserted. Histological examination of the specimen revealed a pancreatic hemangioma with sclerotic features. The high volume of bile loss from the cholecystostomy proved problematic and biliary diversion with a Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy was therefore performed. The tumor subsequently regressed spontaneously and was no longer visible on follow-up imaging two years later. The child has since thrived.Pancreatic hemangiomas are rare and may cause diagnostic confusion. Pancreatic resection should be avoided since the natural history of these benign tumors is that of spontaneous involution. Various strategies can be used to manage any associated obstructive jaundice.
