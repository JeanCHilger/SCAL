Possible small-bowel neoplasms: contrast-enhanced and water-enhanced multidetector CT enteroclysis. To prospectively evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of contrast material-enhanced and water-enhanced multidetector computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis in depicting small-bowel neoplasms in symptomatic patients, with endoscopic, tissue, and follow-up findings as reference standards.The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Committee of the institution, and all patients gave written informed consent. Two hundred nineteen patients (108 male, 111 female age range, 17-98 yearsFindings of CT enteroclysis were positive in 55 cases and negative in 164. The overall sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients with small-bowel lesions were 84.7% and 96.9%, respectively. The negative and positive predictive values were 94.5% and 90.9%, respectively. Findings of pathologic examination confirmed small-bowel tumor in 50 patients with carcinoid tumor (n = 19), adenocarcinoma (n = 7), lymphoma (n = 5), jejunal adenoma (n = 9), stromal tumor (n = 5), ectopic pancreas (n = 2), angiomatous mass (n = 2), or metastasis (n = 1). Five examinations resulted in false-positive findings.Contrast- and water-enhanced multidetector CT enteroclysis had an overall accuracy of 84.7% for depiction of small-bowel neoplasms.
