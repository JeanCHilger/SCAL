Porcelain gallbladder complicated with pancreas divisum. We report a rare case of porcelain gallbladder associated with pancreas divisum (PD). A 60-year-old woman suffered from discomfort in the back of the right side. An abdominal radiograph revealed a calcified spherical mass in the right upper quadrant. Ultrasonography revealed a scattered echo with a posterior acoustic shadow in the gallbladder wall. A plain computed tomography (CT) scan showed flecks of intramural calcification in the wall of the gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed separate openings for the Santorini and Wirsung ducts. The patient underwent cholecystectomy after porcelain gallbladder and pancreas divisum had been diagnosed. The porcelain gallbladder resulted from a stone impacted in the neck of the gallbladder. Patients with PD should be followed carefully, because gallstones often accompany PD, and porcelain gallbladder may result, as in this patient.
