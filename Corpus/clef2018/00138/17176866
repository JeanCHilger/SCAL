Pancreatic and duodenal metastases from renal cell carcinoma 13 years after radical nephrectomy: a case report. A 52-year-old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of orthostatic vertigo, fatigue and weight loss, who underwent right total nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma(RCC) with curative operation 13 years ago (in 1992). Endoscopic examination revealed a submucosal tumor with erosion in the duodenum. The diagnosis made from the biopsy specimens was metastatic RCC in the duodenum. Abdominal CT scan revealed that his metastasis has spread to the pancreas. Five million units of interferon a was administered intramuscularly three times a week for 1 month. He received blood transfusions and palliative care. He died 5 months later because of disease progression. Metastases of RCC have been often reported in the lungs, the liver, and the bones, but rarely in the gastrointestinal tract. This is a very rare case of metastatic RCC in the duodenum, which was diagnosed 13 years after curative right nephrectomy. Since late recurrence is characteristic of renal cell carcinoma, careful long-term follow-up is needed. To our knowledge, this is the 19th case of duodenal metastasis from RCC reported in the literature.
