CT diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas. To investigate the CT and MRI manifestatitions of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas.Both clinical and imaging data of 12 pathologically confirmed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, of the pancreas were retrospectively analyzed.The pancreatic IPMN can be classified into two types based on CT image: the branch duct IPMN (n=7) originated from the head and uncinate process of the pancreas. The tumor consisted of lobulated or clustered small cyst lesions with septa among them, the wall and septa can be enhanced the combined IPMN (n=5) involved branch ducts of the uncinate process as well as the main pancreatic ducts with dilatation (diameter: 4-7 mm), one of these involved the branch ducts along the pancreatic body. The pancreatic IPMN was mainly found in elderly patient with a chief clinical symptoms of abdominal pain and/or pancreatitis.The intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas enjoys specific features in CT and MRI image, which are helpful to the diagnosis.
