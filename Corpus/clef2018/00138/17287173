Improved early diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas is insensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and surgery is at present the definitive treatment. Early and accurate diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma is crucial for increasing the five-year survival rate and the resectable rate. There is no definitive and effective method of early diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas in China and other countries.We compared endoscopic ultrasonography-guided (EUS-guided) fine needle aspiration biopsy combined with cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA19-9 examination with computed tomography (CT), B-ultrasonography (B-US) and serum CEA and CA19-9, to explore methods of early diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 126 cases of benign pancreatic lesion (90 cases) and cystadenocarcinoma (36).The sensitivity of B-US and CT for cystadeno-carcinoma was 52.8% and 77.8%, while the specificity was 78.9% and 86.7%, respectively. When measurement of CEA and CA19-9 of cyst fluid was combined with EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy, the sensitivity was 94.4%, higher than that of B-US and CT (P<0.05). The sensitivity of cyst fluid CEA, CA19-9 examinations was considerably higher than that of serum CEA, CA19-9 (P<0.05). Upper gastrointestinal barium meal and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) had low sensitivity and specificity.EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy combined with examination of cyst fluid CEA, CA19-9 is a credible means for early diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. B-US, CT and serum CEA, CA19-9 measurements are in common use, their findings are also very important.
