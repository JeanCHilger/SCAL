Nonneoplastic celiac axis occlusion in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Celiac artery occlusion occurs in a small percentage of the population. Identifying this is critical in planning for pancreaticoduodenectomy. We reviewed 332 patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy, and identified 14 patients with celiac artery occlusion.Between 1988 and 2006, 14 (4%) of 332 patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy had median arcuate ligament syndrome with celiac artery occlusion (6 men, 8 women mean age, 70 yPatients were diagnosed preoperatively (n = 13) and intraoperatively (n = 1) with celiac artery occlusion. Surgeries included classic pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 12), pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 1), median arcuate ligament release (n = 10), and vascular reconstructions (n = 4), with no surgical mortalities and postoperative complications in 6 patients (46%).We report our experience of median arcuate ligament syndrome with celiac artery occlusion in 4% of our patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients underwent median arcuate ligament release, vascular reconstruction, and/or stenting. Angiography diagnosed celiac artery occlusion and allowed preoperative planning. Pancreatic surgeons must understand the importance of identifying celiac artery occlusion before resection to prevent severe complications.
