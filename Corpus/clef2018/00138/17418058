Approach to pancreatic cystic lesions. Pancreatic cystic lesions are detected more frequently as a result of increasing use of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. The ability of imaging and cyst fluid analysis to predict the biologic behavior of the lesions has aroused much interest recently. A precise diagnosis is critical to help guide further management. The diagnostic criteria and the management principles have evolved dramatically over the past 10 years with the advent of endoscopic ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration. In this review, we summarize the recent publications that have examined the key issues in the diagnosis and management of cystic lesions of the pancreas.
