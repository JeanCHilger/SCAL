Surgery in Fasciola hepatica pancreatitis: report of a case and review of literature. Fasciola hepatica is a trematode rarely causing disease in humans. In symptomatic cases, while various pathologies such as damage to liver parenchyma, acute cholecystitis, and obstructive jaundice can be seen, the development of pancreatitis is rarely mentioned in the literature. The treatment of the disease is medical. In cases where no definite diagnosis can be made or in incidental cases where common bile duct exploration is being done, F. hepatica can be detected accidentally during operation. No consensus has yet been reached on the surgical procedure to be applied in this condition. We report on our case due to the rare occurrence of pancreatitis as a complication. In surgical cases, external drainage of the bile is both crucial in observing the response to the treatment, and also should be accepted as part of the treatment.
