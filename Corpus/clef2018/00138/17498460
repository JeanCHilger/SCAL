Two exceptional cases of pancreatic tumor. Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis. The only potentially curative treatment is surgical resection. However, this procedure can only be performed in a few cases due to presentation of the tumor in advanced stages. We present 2 exceptional cases of pancreatic cancer presentation. Case 1: A 59-year-old man presented with recurrent melena despite endoscopic sclerosis of a duodenal ulcer. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 7-cm mass in the head of the pancreas infiltrating the second portion of the duodenum. Duodenal biopsy showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Palliative pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Case 2: A 49-year-old man presented with sporadic pain in the right hypochondrium and a familial history of pancreatic cancer in first and second degree relatives. CT and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1-cm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas. Cytology showed mucoid material and atypia. Given a probable diagnosis of mucinous cystoadenoma, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed.
