Nine cases of childhood adrenal tumour presenting with hypertension and a review of the literature. To describe the clinical features, treatment and outcome of children adrenal tumors presenting with hypertension.The records of nine children under 16 years of age with adrenal tumours presenting with hypertension were analysed. Details were recorded for family history, clinical presentation, biochemistry, imaging, histology, treatment and outcome.Abdominal mass was palpable only in one patient at diagnosis. Besides hypertension-associated symptoms, Cushing's syndrome was the common presentation form (n = 4). Abdominal computed topography showed adrenal mass in all patients. Tumours were completely resected for each patient. The median tumour weight was 73 g (11-530 g) and the size ranged from 1.5 x 1.5 to 12 x 14 cm2. Pheochromocytoma (n = 2), adrenocortical adenoma (n = 3), adrenocortical carcinoma (n = 1), neuroblastoma (n = 2) and ganglioneuromas (n = 1) were found. In one case, adrenal pheochromocytoma first occurred and non-functioning islet cell tumour successively occurred at pancreas. A better status is common at a median follow-up time of 3.5 years.Childhood adrenal tumours presented with hypertension showed an atypical course, variable presentation. We report a unique case of adrenal pheochromocytoma followed by the occurrence of non-functioning islet cell tumour. Reversal of hypertension by surgery is crucial. Imaging techniques are important to detect adrenal tumours.
