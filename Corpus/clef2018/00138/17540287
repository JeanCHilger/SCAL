Renal subcapsular pseudocyst: findings on MRI. Pancreatic pseudocysts are common complications of pancreatitis. They may occur in unusual places as a result of spread along the path of least resistance. Penetration of Gerota's fascia and spread into the renal subcapsular space are uncommon. Their appearance on magnetic resonance imaging has not been previously documented. Given the increased use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for the investigation of patients with pancreatitis, the recognition that a complicated renal cyst in this clinical context could represent a benign condition is important.
