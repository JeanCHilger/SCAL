Solitary fibrous tumor of the pancreas: a case report. Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an unusual mesenchymal neoplasm that most often arises in the pleura however, it has recently been described in a number of extrapleural sites. This report describes an extremely rare case of a benign SFT arising in the pancreas. A 41-year-old woman presented in the clinic with right upper abdominal pain. Subsequent ultrasonographic studies revealed a 1.5x1.5x1.4 cm hypoechoic mass within the pancreatic body, which was later confirmed on both helical computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies. An endocrine tumor was clinically suspected. Laparoscopic enucleation of the mass was performed. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of bland uniform spindle cells arranged between collagen bundles. On immunohistochemical studies, these spindle cells were positive for CD34 and bcl-2 but negative for cytokeratin (AE1+AE3 and Cam5.2), smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100, and c-kit. Based on the light microscopic morphology and immunohistochemical staining profile, the diagnosis of SFT was rendered.
