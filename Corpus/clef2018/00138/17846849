Isolated periportal tuberculosis: characteristic findings of clinical imaging. Isolated periportal tuberculous lymphadenopathy is a rare clinical entity. This report describes a 56-year-old woman with the disease, who showed characteristic findings on clinical imaging studies. Computed tomography showed a low-density mass with peripheral enhancement and calcification, adjacent to the pancreatic head and caudate lobe of the liver. 2-[Fluorine 18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography imaging co-registered with computed tomography showed slightly increased uptake along the periphery of the lesion. The diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy. The manifestation of the disease is nonspecific, and preoperative differential diagnosis from neoplastic disease is often difficult. Its clinical and radiological features are briefly reviewed.
