Epidermoid cyst derived from an accessory spleen in the pancreas. A case report with literature survey. A rare case of splenic epidermoid cyst (SEC) of the pancreas discovered in a 32-year-old Japanese female is reported. The lesion, 5 x 6 cm in size including caseous material and serous fluid in the lumen, was discovered by ultrasonography and computed tomography at the tail of the pancreas and was easily removed. Histopathologically, the cystic wall consisted of three components: the inside was lined by mature squamous epithelium with keratinization, the middle layer consisted of splenic pulp with a sinus structure, and the peripheral layer was dense fibrous connective tissue in which some involutional pancreatic ducts and islets were recognized. The literature about SEC of the pancreas is discussed in comparison with other types of epidermoid cyst including lymphoepithelial cyst and dermoid cyst in the pancreas.
