Recent progress of diagnostic imaging in evaluating pancreaticobiliary malignancies. The increasing number of multislice CT detectors enables isotropic voxels, and ideal three-dimensional (3 D) images can be obtained easily. High-quality CTA and MPR are useful in diagnosing pancreaticobiliary diseases, and curved-MPR images serve to increase diagnostic accuracy in pancreaticobiliary malignancies. 3 D data acquisition has become a routine technique on MRI, and 3 D-dynamic study and 3 D-MRCP have become very effective diagnostic tools of MRI. It is expected that diffusion-weighted MRI can play an important role in diagnosing pancreaticobiliary malignancies.
