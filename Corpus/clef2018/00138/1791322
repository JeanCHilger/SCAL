Clinical regression of infected pancreatic necrosis. Case report. Infected pancreatic necrosis was diagnosed clinically and radiologically in a patient admitted for acute pancreatitis. As free gas in the pancreatic area was recognized, antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone) was empirically introduced, while surgical drainage was being planned. After the second week, the patient rapidly started to improve, to the point that he could be discharged home without operation. Control CT-scans and general laboratory tests, at this phase and later on, confirmed a still enlarged gland but free of infection or ongoing inflammation. Cholelithiasis, which had been identified in an early ultrasound scan, was electively treated by cholecystectomy 2 mo after the onset of pancreatitis, in the absence of sepsis, and with uneventful recovery. This case illustrates the rare possibility of spontaneous regression of infected necrotic pancreatitis, without any type of operation or nonoperative drainage.
