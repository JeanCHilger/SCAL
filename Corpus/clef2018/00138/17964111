Spontaneous rupture of the spleen as a rare complication of chronic calcifying pancreatitis. Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare complication of chronic calcifying pancreatitis. Anaemia and haemorrhagic shock may occur but pain is the first symptom making diagnosis more difficult. We report the case of a 32-year-old man suffering from chronic pancreatic pathology who developed a spontaneous splenic rupture. He complained of abdominal pain without haemorrhagic shock. An abdominal CT-scan revealed a rupture of the spleen with a haemoperitoneum.
