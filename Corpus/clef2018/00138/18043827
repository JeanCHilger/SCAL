Malignant pancreatic carcinoid tumour. Pancreatic carcinoid tumours are rare, particularly within the paediatric population. The clinical presentation is largely dependent on the functionality of the tumour. Although the tumour is generally slow-growing, surgical resection is still the mainstay of curative treatment. Morbidity is, however, significantly contributed by secretion of excess hormones in view of this, biotherapy is an important treatment strategy. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, has been shown to be successful in both symptomatic control and stability of tumour progression. We report a 12-year-old girl, who presented with hypertensive crisis, and showed good response to a combination of chemotherapy and octreotide.
