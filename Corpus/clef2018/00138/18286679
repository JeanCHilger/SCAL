Diagnostic approach to patients with acute idiopathic and recurrent pancreatitis, what should be done? Acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) is a common clinical condition that may be difficult to diagnose. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is proposed to be a safe first line test of choice in the majority of patients. When interventions are needed to remove biliary stones, evaluate sphincter of Oddi or pancreas divisum, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is recommended. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can be a suitable alternative from a diagnostic standpoint although may not be widely available. Finally, genetic testing is increasingly used to detect certain mutations that are associated with this diagnosis.
