Endoscopic ultrasonography findings in patients with non-specific changes of the pancreas on computed tomography: a single-center experience. Inconclusive findings on abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scans such as "enlarged or prominent pancreas" are commonly reported however, their clinical significance is not clearly understood. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in a cohort of patients with indeterminate findings on CT. We undertook a retrospective, single-center study at a tertiary care university hospital. About 107 consecutive patients (56 men) underwent EUS evaluation for inconclusive CT findings. The main intervention was EUS with fine needle aspiration (FNA) The main outcome measurement was to describe lesions identified by EUS in this cohort of patients. About 22 patients (21%) had pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 14 (13%) had chronic pancreatitis, 28 (26%) had benign lesions, and 35 patients (33%) had a normal EUS exam. Pancreatic cancer was more likely to be found on EUS in patients with significant weight loss (OR 10.1
