Acute pancreatitis: a lesser-known complication of aluminum phosphide poisoning. There have been no case reports on aluminum phosphide-induced pancreatitis in the literature available. In this report, we present the case of a young man who developed acute pancreatitis and probably acute myocarditis following ingestion of aluminum phosphide pellets in the absence of the usual risk factors and after exclusion of other possible causes of pancreatitis. In the absence of re-challenge, we put forth the probable causative association of pancreatitis with aluminum phosphide or phosphine gas, its active pesticidal component.
