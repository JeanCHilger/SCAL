Macrocystic pancreatic lesions: differentiation of benign from premalignant and malignant cysts by CT. To assess useful CT features for differentiating benign from premalignant and malignant macrocystic pancreatic lesions.Seventy-four patients with pathologically proven macrocystic pancreatic lesions were enrolled: 17 benign cysts (macrocystic serous cystadenoma, n=12 congenital cystOn univariate analysis, the differences for the shape (p=0.007), wall thickness (p=0.011), and internal surface (p=0.012) between benign and premalignant and malignant cysts were significant. A lobulated shape, a thin wall and a smooth internal surface were more frequent in benign cysts, whereas a round or oval shape or a complex cystic shape with tubular cyst, a thick wall and an irregular internal surface were more frequent in premalignant and malignant cysts. On multivariate analysis, the shape (p=0.002) and wall thickness (p=0.025) were significant CT features for differentiating benign from premalignant and malignant cysts.Shape and wall thickness are the main CT features for differentiating benign from premalignant and malignant macrocystic pancreatic lesions.
