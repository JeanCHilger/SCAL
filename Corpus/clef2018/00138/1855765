Angio-CT: diagnosis and detection of complications of acute pancreatitis. The ability of high-resolution, current-generation fast (sub-2 sec) CT scanners to display the precise cross-sectional anatomy of the pancreas and surrounding organs and structures had made it the most efficacious imaging modality for evaluation of patients with known or suspected acute pancreatitis. The use of angio-CT (automatic table incrementation, dynamic scanning mode, simultaneous intravenous infusion of a large bolus of contrast) has further extended its use for detection of parenchymal necrosis and vascular involvement. CT now plays a central role in diagnosis, prognostication (staging of severity of disease), detection of complications, and guidance for percutaneous techniques.
