Benign neuroendocrine and other rare benign tumors of the pancreas. Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms, which arise from cells of the islets of Langerhans. The most common NET are the insulinoma, gastrinoma and hormone inactive NET. Very rare entities are the schwannoma, leiomyoma, teratoma, intrapancreatic lipoma, hemangioma and the intrapancreatic accessory spleen. Essential for therapy, which in most cases is difficult, are an exact localization and various modalities of imaging diagnostics.
