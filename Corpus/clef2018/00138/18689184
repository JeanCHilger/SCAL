Single gallbladder and multiple pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma sixteen years after nephrectomy. We describe a case of female patient presenting with acute biliary symptoms and severe haemobilia due to the presence of a large metastasis in the gallbladder wall from renal cell carcinoma treated by radical nephrectomy 16 years before. CT examination also showed the presence of multiple small round metastases from renal carcinoma in the pancreas, subsequently confirmed surgically and pathologically.
