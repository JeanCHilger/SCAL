Cystic abnormalities of the pancreas: inflammatory pseudocyst or neoplasm. A 79-year-old woman presented with complaints of upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting since a few days. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities except for some indications of an inflammation. Based on the medical history, physical examination and findings from radiological examination, initially the diagnosis was 'chronic pancreatitis with formation ofa pseudocyst caused by alcohol abuse'. After one week the patient developed cholestatic liver function disorders with elevated serum pancreatic enzymes. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a dilated gallbladder and progression of the cystic lesion in the pancreatic head with compression of the distal common bile duct. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed and the findings fitted a diagnosis of an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Differentiation between an inflammatory or neoplastic origin of cystic lesions in the pancreas can be difficult. There is a risk ofmisdiagnosing a cystic neoplasm for a pseudocyst. This may lead to delays in making the correct diagnosis.
