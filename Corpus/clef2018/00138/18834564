Mucinous gastric adenocarcinoma and duodenal somato-statinoma. Case report. The Authors present a rare association of gastric adenocarcinoma and somatostatin-producing duodenal carcinoid. The pre-operative abdominal CT scan revealed the gastric lesions and a duodenal polypoid lesion, giving an important indication to perform a subtotal gastrectomy and a duodenal resection. The definitive diagnosis was possible with histological examination.
