Synchronous appearance of male breast cancer and pancreatic cancer 15 years after the diagnosis of testicular cancer--report of a case. The frequency of new neoplastic diseases among patients cured of testicular cancer is higher than in normal population. For these patients, synchronous occurrence of multiple neoplasms is not common. Also, less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer occur in males. We present herein a case having both breast and concurrent pancreatic cancer after being effectively treated for testicular cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of synchronous breast and pancreatic cancer in a male patient following testicular cancer. Second cancer is the most severe long-term complication of chemotherapy or radiotherapy for patients with testicular cancer and the possibility of multiple cancers has to be taken into consideration when multiple lesions are present.
