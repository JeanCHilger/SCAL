DNA repair gene polymorphisms and risk of pancreatic cancer. The current research was undertaken to examine the association between genetic variations in DNA repair and pancreatic cancer risk.We analyzed 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms of 7 DNA repair genes (LIG3, LIG4, OGG1, ATM, POLB, RAD54L, and RECQL) in 734 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 780 healthy controls using the Taqman method. Information on cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, medical history, and other risk factors was collected by personal interview.The homozygous mutant genotype of LIG3 G-39A [odds ratio (OR), 0.23 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.82These observations suggest that genetic variations in DNA repair may act alone or in concert with other risk factors on modifying a patient's risk for pancreatic cancer.
