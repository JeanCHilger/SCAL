Pancreaticoduodenectomy as the primary therapeutic choice in cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in heterotopic pancreas. On the basis of a review of the literature and description of a clinical case, the aim of this paper was to evaluate the role of pancreaticoduodenectomy as the primary therapeutic choice in a rare, serious condition such as cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in heterotopic pancreas. The diagnosis is difficult because of the non-specific clinical manifestations, and radiological and endoscopic imaging are decisive. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance are very useful for demonstrating the presence of cysts in a thickened duodenal wall but endoscopic ultrasonography is the most useful imaging examination. The choice of therapeutic option is still debated. Although some Authors have proposed a medical approach using octreotide or endoscopic treatment for selected patients, pancreaticoduodenectomy is usually proposed for symptomatic patients. When surgery is needed, pancreaticoduodenectomy should be preferred, reserving by-pass procedures for high-risk patients. Because of the non-specific clinical manifestations and the very difficult diagnostic and therapeutic management, these patients need to be studied and treated in specialised, dedicated centres.
