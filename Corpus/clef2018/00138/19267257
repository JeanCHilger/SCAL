A rare surgical case of multiple liver resections for recurrent liver metastases from pancreatic gastrinoma: liver and vena cava resection. Pancreatic gastrinoma is a rare non-beta islet cell tumor. Approximately 60% of gastrinomas are malignant despite the fact that they are usually slow growing, liver metastases have a major impact on prognosis. Most authors have advocated aggressive surgical management as being the only potentially curative therapy to improve survival as well as to provide outstanding relief from symptoms. We present a case of a 57-year-old man referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of liver metastases from pancreatic gastrinoma, with suspected involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC). At the age of 37 years, he was diagnosed in his local hospital as having a pancreatic gastrinoma, with liver metastases, and he underwent distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and enucleation of liver metastases. A liver tumor recurred twice, 7 and 9 years after the first surgery, for which double liver resections were performed: the first time he underwent enucleation of multiple liver metastases in segments II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII, with resection of the right hepatic vein and partially resection of the diaphragm
