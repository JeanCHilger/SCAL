Acute pancreatic graft fistula and peripancreatic fluid collection: demonstration by secretin-stimulated MRI. Peripancreatic fluid collections are among the common post pancreas transplant complications, which are mainly due to leakage from the anastomosis site to bowel and graft pancreatitis. Differentiation between these two entities is important because they are treated differently. In this case, secretin stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed gradual intraperitoneal fluid collection and accumulation of fluid in small bowel excluded leakage from the anastomosis of the pancreas to bowel and changed the management from surgery to medical treatment.
