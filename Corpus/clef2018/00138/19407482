Identification of a novel kindred with familial pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Hereditary pancreatic cancer comprises about 10% of pancreatic cancer cases. Multiple causative mutations have been identified. Here we describe a pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer (P/PC) family, which demonstrates pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer resulting from an uncharacterized mutation.Family members completed evaluations to determine signs of mutation status. Select patients were screened for mutations associated with hereditary pancreatic diseases.In generation II, 12 siblings exhibit 6 cases of pancreatitis, 3 pancreatic cancer, and 2 obligate carrier status. The average age at pancreatitis diagnosis of enrolled members is 32.5 years average age at pancreatic cancer diagnosis is 59 years. There is no association with known cancer syndromes. Those affected generally present with mild epigastric pain, and CT scans demonstrate characteristic fatty infiltration of the pancreatic body and tail with sparing of the head and neck. Full sequence analysis of genes associated with hereditary pancreatic disease failed to demonstrate known mutations or polymorphisms.Based upon pedigree evaluation and preliminary DNA analysis, we believe that the family members with P/PC carry a novel genetic mutation resulting in hereditary pancreatitis. This mutation is autosomal dominant, expressed with high penetrance, and is part of a unique hereditary syndrome that significantly increases pancreatic cancer risk.
