Primary extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the common bile duct manifesting as obstructive jaundice: report of a case. Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the common bile duct (CBD) manifesting as obstructive jaundice is extremely rare: to our knowledge, only 22 cases of primary NHL arising from the CBD have been reported. The patient in this case report was a 63-year-old man who presented with obstructive jaundice. Abdominal sonography, positron emission tomography, and computed tomography showed a mass with abnormal 18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in pancreatic head. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a strictured segment of the CBD with proximal bile duct dilatation. We performed pancreaticoduodenectomy for a presumptive diagnosis of pancreatic head carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma of the CBD. However, the histological diagnosis was a primary, diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma of the CBD. He received three courses of combination chemotherapy, including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). The patient remains well, without evidence of tumor recurrence, 8 months after surgery. In summary, primary NHL of the CBD, despite its rarity, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of obstructive jaundice. An accurate histopathologic diagnosis and complete surgical resection, followed by combination chemotherapy plus rituximab may be effective.
