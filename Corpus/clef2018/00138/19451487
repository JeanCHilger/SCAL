Current trends in pancreatic cystic neoplasms. To define how patients with pancreatic cysts are being diagnosed and treated.Retrospective case series.University-affiliated tertiary care center.Four hundred one patients evaluated in the Department of Surgery between January 2004 and December 2007.Clinical management, histological diagnosis, and results of surveillance.Pancreatic cysts were incidentally discovered in 71% (284 of 401) of patients. There was no statistically significant difference in age (60.4 vs 63.1 years P = .10), cyst size (31 vs 27 mmIncidentally discovered pancreatic cystic neoplasms composed 71% of our series, of which 50% were immediately resected. Subsequent morphologic changes or development of symptoms prompted an operation in 8% of patients after a period of surveillance. Invasive malignancy was present in 11% of all resected specimens but in 38% of main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
