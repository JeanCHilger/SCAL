A case of primary vertebral osteosarcoma metastasizing to pancreas. Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents and possesses a high potential for metastasis. The most common sites of osteosarcomatous metastases are the lungs, pleurae, and bone the pancreas being extremely rare.We report the computed tomography findings of a rare case of pancreatic metastasis in a 14-year-old boy with primary vertebral osteosarcoma being followed-up for 6 years. On abdominal CT, a huge mass containing necrotic and calcified areas and causing bone destruction was seen between thoracic vertebra 7 and sacral vertebra 1 involving both the vertebrae and paravertebral soft-tissue. A large metastatic mass with an irregular contour was also visualized in the pancreatic head and peripancreatic region having tomographic findings similar to the vertebral mass. Tru-cut biopsy of the pancreatic mass confirmed the diagnosis of osteosarcoma metastasis.Although extremely rare, osteosarcoma metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesions, particularly in patients with a primary tumor.
