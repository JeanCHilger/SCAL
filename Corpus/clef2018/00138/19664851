Emphysematous pancreatitis: Conservative or surgical treatment?. Emphysematous pancreatitis is a severe and rare complication of acute pancreatitis. This entity is diagnosed on clinical grounds and on the basis of the radiologic finding of gas in the retroperitoneum. Infected pancreatic necrosis is potentially lethal, with mortality rates of more than 35%. Surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in these critically ill patients. Endoscopic ultrasonography techniques, laparoscopic surgery and percutaneous drainage have the potential to offer a safe and effective alternative treatment modality. However, the precise role of these procedures requires further investigation. The treatment of these patients should be individualized, dynamic and multidisciplinary. We present two cases of emphysematous pancreatitis with distinct therapeutic management.
