Endosonographic diagnostics of hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. Clinical use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) diagnostics of 550 patients with diseases of hepatobiliary and pancreas was analyzed. The procedure of the examination was thoroughly described. Ultrasound semiotics of the pancreas, papilla Vateri and bile ducts' lesions was defined. Accuracy of EUS in the diagnostics of solid pancreas tumors was 81,6%. Accuracy of the method in the diagnostics of the vessel invasion was 81,6%. EUS was considered to be leading in the diagnostics of papilla Vateri and duodenal tumors, its accuracy was up to 97,2%, which is much higher then other radiological and endoscopic methods. EUS was highly effective in diagnostics of choledocholithiasis and comprised 90,2%. The introduction of thin-needle biopsy, Doppler mapping and elastography in the EUS protocol permitted further increase of the accuracy and value of the method for the surgical practice.
