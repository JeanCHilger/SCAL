Magnetic resonance imaging of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool in the assessment of the full spectrum of pancreatic disease. A standard MR protocol including noncontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced gradient-echo imagings is sensitive for the evaluation of pancreatic cancer. Optimal use of MRI in the investigation of pancreatic cancer occurs in the following circumstances: (1) detection of small non-contour-deforming tumors, (2) evaluation of local extension and vascular encasement, (3) determination of the presence of lymph node and peritoneal metastases, and (4) determination and characterization of associated liver lesions and liver metastases. The objective of this study was to describe the attribute of MRI for evaluating pancreatic cancer.
