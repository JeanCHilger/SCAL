Imaging of the pancreas with secretin enhancement. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a noninvasive imaging technique for evaluation of the pancreatic duct and the biliary tree. Secretin is a polypeptide hormone that has numerous physiological effects, including stimulation of the pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate-rich fluid and transient increase in the tone in the sphincter of Oddi. As a result, secretin administration usually results in distention of the pancreatic duct therefore, visualization of the pancreatic ductal anatomy is often substantially improved. Awareness of its value by referring clinicians and radiologists will increase its use in the future.
