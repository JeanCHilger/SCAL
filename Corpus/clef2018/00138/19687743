Treatment of arteriovenous malformation of the pancreas: a case report. Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare disease, generally asymptomatic, but sometimes complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding or pancreatitis. We report a case of a 55-year-old man presenting with a large pancreatic AVM. The diagnosis was obtained on a computed tomography scan. A treatment by transarterial embolization was carried out successfully. Selective arterial embolization of pancreatic AVM can represent an effective treatment in the first intention.
