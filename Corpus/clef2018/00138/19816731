Modern imaging techniques for liver trauma. Involvement of the liver is one of the most common injuries in addition to those of the pancreas following blunt force abdominal trauma. Due to the even now high mortality radiological imaging must provide a rapid, definitive and exact assessment of the extent of the damage. Despite conflicting study results ultrasound has become established as a rapid and relatively simple method in emergency room treatment and is irreplaceable for initial orientation diagnostics. The use of contrast medium-assisted examinations promises to be an advantage for diagnostics in the secondary phase. Due to the high sensitivity and specificity modern multidetector computed tomography is the most effective examination modality for the detection of liver damage and hepatobiliary complications and plays a central role in non-operative management following abdominal trauma. Shorter and shorter scan times even allow the examination of metastable patients and a rapid assessment even of large body volumes.
