Pancreatic cystic lymphangioma: report of a case. We herein present a patient referred to our clinic with the complaints of flatulence and left upper quadrant abdominal pain who was diagnosed to have pancreatic cystic neoplasia radiologically. The septated cyst was defined to be 9x12 cm in diameter by abdominal computed tomography and by ultrasonography originated from the tail of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy procedure with complete resection of the cystic lesion was performed in this patient. Pathologic examination revealed pancreatic cystic lymphangioma (PCL). Although PCL is very rare in adult patients, it can cause confusion due to the presence of other cystic pathologies of the pancreas. Complete excision of the cyst is mandatory to prevent recurrences. In our case, no recurrence was detected after a two-year follow-up.
