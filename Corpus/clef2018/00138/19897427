Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cholangiopancreatography and rendezvous techniques. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cholangiopancreatography (EUCP) has become an alternative to percutaneous drainage or surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice or pancreatic obstruction after failed conventional ERCP. The different techniques of biliary and pancreatic drainage are described and the literature is reviewed. Due to the technical complexity associated with this procedure, it should be reserved for endoscopists at tertiary care centers with advanced training in both EUS and ERCP.
