Diagnostic and interventional endoscopy in gastroenterology : from high-resolution chips and procedures for endoscopic resection to NOTES. In the past 10 years endoscopic diagnostics has benefited from technologies such as big chips, high-definition television (HDTV) and narrow band imaging (NBI). Video capsule endoscopy and double balloon enteroscopy have facilitated visualization of the entire small bowel. A number of studies on mucosal Barrett's and gastric cancers could prove that endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is oncologically equivalent to surgical resection when certain criteria are respected. However, EMR is less invasive and carries a substantially lower complication risk and mortality compared to surgery. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) facilitates en bloc resection with thorough histopathologic evaluation of the specimen, e.g. for mucosal lesions in the stomach and rectum. Endosonography (EUS) guided transgastric necrosectomy using a flexible gastroscope has set a milestone in the treatment of infected pancreatic necroses and has replaced open surgery in many centers. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) uses natural body openings as minimally invasive access to the abdomen and mediastinum. Interventional GI endoscopists and minimally invasive surgeons have profited from these innovations in micromechanics and microelectronics.
