Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. We saw a 54-year-old patient who had been treated for gastrointestinal ulcerations with bleeding complications now presenting with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The patient has been suffering from recurrent diarrhea for years. The suspicion of a neuroendocrine tumor had been made but could not be confirmed intraoperatively in the past. As suspicion was still high with high levels of chromogranin A and high gastrin levels the diagnosis now could be confirmed with a somatostatin scintigraphy. Finally the confirmed spot was identified to be a metastasis of a gastrinoma of still unknown primary localisation.
