Percutaneous transgastric computed tomography-guided biopsy of the pancreas using large needles. To assess the safety, yield and clinical utility of percutaneous transgastric computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy of pancreatic tumor using large needles, in selected patients.We reviewed 34 CT-guided biopsies in patients with pancreas mass, of whom 24 (71%) had a direct path to the mass without passing through a major organ. The needle passed through the liver in one case (3%). Nine passes (26%) were made through the stomach. These nine transgastric biopsies which used a coaxial technique (i.e. a 17-gauge coaxial introducer needle and an 18-gauge biopsy needle) were the basis of this study. Immediate and late follow-up CT images to detect complications were obtained.Tumor tissues were obtained in nine pancreatic biopsies, and histologic specimens for diagnosis were obtained in all cases. One patient, who had a rare sarcomatoid carcinoma, received a second biopsy. One patient had a complication of transient pneumoperitoneum but no subjective complaints. An immediate imaging study and clinical follow-up detected neither hemorrhage nor peritonitis. No delayed procedure-related complication was seen during the survival period of our patients.Pancreatic biopsy can be obtained by a transgastric route using a large needle as an alternative method, without complications of peritonitis or bleeding.
