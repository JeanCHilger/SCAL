Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with or without flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma - a case series. The role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) has not been previously described. Our aims were to describe the EUS features of PPL and the role of EUS-FNA with and without flow cytometry in the diagnosis of 16 patients. When EUS-FNA with flow cytometry was compared with EUS-FNA without flow cytometry, the sensitivities for diagnosing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were 84.6 % versus 30.8 %, respectively ( P = 0.01). EUS-FNA with flow cytometry is a valuable tool to diagnose PPL. Flow cytometry analysis complements traditional assessment by standard cytology.
