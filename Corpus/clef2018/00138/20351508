Epidermoid cyst in intrapancreatic accessory spleen: radiological findings including superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. It is crucial to differentiate between nonneoplastic and neoplastic cysts of the pancreas by images. An epidermoid cyst in intrapancreatic accessory spleen (IPAS) is a rare pancreatic cyst that should be managed nonsurgically as well as other nonneoplastic cyst. However, the imaging features of an epidermoid cyst in IPAS have not been organized. We therefore reviewed articles describing cases of epidermoid cyst in IPAS, with 6 additional cases to explore the imaging findings.
