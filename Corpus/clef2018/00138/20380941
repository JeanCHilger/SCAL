Heterotopic pancreas: typical and atypical imaging findings. Heterotopic pancreas is a common condition often encountered during laporotomy or autopsy. Prospective radiographic diagnosis is challenging because of the variable imaging appearances. The purpose of this review is to present the typical and atypical appearances of heterotopic pancreas on imaging studies. Familiarity with the spectrum of radiological findings in conjunction with biochemical markers is helpful to improve diagnostic accuracy.
