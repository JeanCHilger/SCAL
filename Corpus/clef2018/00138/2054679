Characterization of pancreatic adenocarcinoma by magnetic resonance imaging. In the past, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas has suffered from many technical obstacles that have precluded success, particularly in the evaluation of adenocarcinoma. However, with the improved quality of pancreatic MRI and the use of intravenous gadolinium as a contrast agent, MRI is now proving useful in the evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. MRI's main role is in accurate preoperative staging when computed tomography and ultrasonography provide equivocal results.
