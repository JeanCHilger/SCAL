State-of-the-art pancreatic MRI. The purpose of this article is to discuss the most current techniques used for pancreatic imaging, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art and emerging pulse sequences and their application to pancreatic disease.Given the technologic advances of the past decade, pancreatic MRI protocols have evolved. Most sequences can now be performed in one or a few breath-holds 3D sequences with thin, contiguous slices offer improved spatial resolution
