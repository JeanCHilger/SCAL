Ileoileal intussusception due to ileal ectopic pancreas with abundant fat tissue mimicking lipoma. A 26-year-old woman presented with symptoms of bowel obstruction. An emergent computed tomography (CT) scan was performed which showed ileoileal intussusceptions due to a fatty nodule. Exploratory laparotomy and removal of the involved small bowel was performed. The pathology showed the leading point of the intussusception to be ectopic pancreas with abundant fatty infiltration.
