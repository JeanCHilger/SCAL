Extrahepatic cholestasis of nonatretic origin. New diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. Nonatretic cholestatic disorders exhibit differential features in the pediatric age group, at times not too obvious but always discernible. These characteristic differences, with the aid of increasingly more precise exploratory techniques, make a rapid and sound diagnosis possible. At present, echography, transparietohepatic cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography allow us, within a short time, to reach a diagnosis of disorders that not long ago were only roughly profiled and on occasion were left undiagnosed. At the Children's Hospital Valle de Hebr√≥n, treatment has been afforded, in the last seven years, to seven patients with a choledochal cyst, four with a long common biliopancreatic duct, one with a choleperitoneum due to spontaneous perforation of a choledochal cyst and one patient with congenital stenosis of the common hepatic duct. In all cases where echography was performed, an intra- or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation could be demonstrated, or otherwise the diagnosis of a choledochal cyst was established. Furthermore, four transhepatic and three retrograde cholangiographic examinations were carried out, via a fiber duodenoscopy, in those cases that failed to show, on echography, the existence of a choledochal cyst.
