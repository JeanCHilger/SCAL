Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Ultrasonography and computed tomography findings. The radiologic findings in two cases of acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas are described. Sonographic findings were a midrange echogenic mass with heterogeneity, containing some small- and medium-sized low echogenic areas suggesting necrosis. Ultrasonic through-transmission was good. Computed tomography findings were a well-defined, hypodense, large mass having an enhancing, thin capsule. There were multiple small- and medium-sized irregular low-density areas suggesting necrosis. Small punctate calcific foci were present in one case. With these characteristics, acinar cell carcinoma can be distinguished from the locally invasive common adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, but the differentiation from some other less common pancreatic tumors remains difficult.
