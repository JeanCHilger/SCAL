Visceral artery aneurysms. Visceral artery aneurysms (VAA) are relatively rare disease patterns. With regard to the aetiology two different entities of VAA can be distinguished: (i)  real VAA, where arteriosclerosis plays an important role, particular in elderly patients, and (ii)  pseudo-aneurysms. Here, previous abdominal trauma or former inflammatory processes are considered to be the responsible factors for their occurrence. Most frequently, VAA are located in the splenic (60%) and common hepatic artery (20-50%). The common hepatic artery (80%) and the pancreatico-duodenal artery (75%) feature the highest rupture rates. Generally all VAA with a diameter exceeding 2 cm should be treated. Special attention has to be paid to young pregnant women (particularly multipara) who bear the highest risk of VAA rupture, especially during the third trimenon. Early therapy is essential to avoid fatal consequences for mother and foetus. Basically, interventional, endovascular (embolisation, stent) or surgical (resection with direct vessel anastomosis, graft interposition, aneurysmorraphy, ligature) therapy options exist. The choice of the intervention should be adapted to the patient's individual risk profile. In our own series of VAA (n=19 1996-2007), we evaluated both interventional and surgical procedures as valid therapy regimens with regard to the patients clinical condition.
