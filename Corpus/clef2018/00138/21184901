Biliary, pancreatic, and hepatic imaging for the general surgeon. Technologic advancements have allowed imaging modalities to become more useful in the diagnosis of hepatobiliary and pancreatic disorders. Computed tomography scanners now use multidetector row technology with contrast-delayed imaging for quicker and more accurate imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging with cholangiopancreatography can more clearly delineate liver lesions and the biliary and pancreatic ducts, and can diagnose pathologic conditions early in their course. Newer technologies, such as single-operator cholangioscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography, have sometimes shown superiority to traditional modalities. This article addresses the literature regarding available imaging techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of common surgical hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases.
