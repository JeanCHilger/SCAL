Nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor with extension into the main pancreatic duct: report of a case. Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) rarely involve the main pancreatic duct. We report a case of malignant nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor (NFPET) with prevalent intraductal growth. A 47-year-old woman was referred to us after ultrasonography at a routine health check showed diffuse swelling of the pancreas. Preoperative imaging showed a solid mass in the tail of the pancreas and a bulging intraductal mass in the main pancreatic duct. We performed total pancreatectomy because the tumor occupied almost the entire lumen of the main pancreatic duct. Histological examination confirmed well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma. We review reported cases of the intraductal growth of NFPETs and discuss the pathogenesis of these unusual tumors.
