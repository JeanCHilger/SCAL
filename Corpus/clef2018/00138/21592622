Pancreatic ascariasis mimicking a pancreatic tumor. Ascaris lumbricoides infection in Spain is anecdotal and is usually associated with travel to areas with high endemicity such as India and South America. Biliopancreatic disease caused by this parasite is both rare and one of the most feared complications. There are few publications in the literature about pancreatic involvement in ascariasis. We describe a case of pancreatic ascariasis diagnosed after a pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed for a suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.A 58-year-old man consulted for longstanding abdominal pain and diarrhea. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, endoscopy, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle cytology were performed. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head.Cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The postoperative course was favorable. A pancreatic fistula type B (ISGPF classification) developed and was resolved with conservative treatment. Analysis of the surgical specimen revealed the presence of a pancreatic pseudotumor due to Ascaris lumbricoides. After these findings, treatment was completed with oral albendazole.Pancreatic ascariasis in our environment is unusual, but should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumors and inflammatory processes of the pancreas.
