Primary hydatid disease of the pancreas mimicking pancreatic pseudo-cyst in a child: case report and review of the literature. Primary hydatid disease of the pancreas is very rare. We report the case of a 7-year-old girl who presented with abdominal pain and an epigastric mass. The Casoni and indirect hemagglutination test for hydatid disease were negative. A diagnosis of a pancreatic pseudocyst was established by ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography scan before surgery. Ultrasound guided percutaneous drainage was planned as treatment. During the procedure, the cyst was perforated and as germinative membrane was seen by US, we arranged surgery. Hydatid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all cystic masses in the pancreas, even if Casoni and indirect hemagglutination tests negative, especially in geographic regions like Turkey, where the disease is endemic.
