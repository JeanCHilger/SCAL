Sarcomas of abdominal organs: computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Sarcomas originating from abdominal organs are extremely rare, and literature in which investigators focus on their imaging features is scarce. This article aims to review the computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging features of these rare tumors and to help in clinical diagnosis. Various sarcomas (eg, angiosarcoma, undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, carcinosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) originating, respectively, from different abdominal visceral organs (liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, uterus, and prostate gland) are reviewed along with cases we encountered.
