Management of pancreatic fluid collections: a changing of the guard from surgery to endoscopy. The aim of this study was to assess for any trend in management of pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) and identify impacting factors. The endoscopy and surgical databases were queried for PFC patients. PFCs were categorized as pseudocysts (PP) or complex collections (CC) that included  abscess/necrosis. The outcome measures were to compare the utilization of surgery and endoscopy from 2004 to 2007 (group I) and from 2008 to 2010 (group II) and identify factors impacting practice patterns. A total of 285 patients were treated: group I included 119 and group II 166. Of 119  group I patients, 29 per cent were treated by surgery and 71 per cent by endoscopy. Of 85 endoscopy patients, 42 per cent were drained by conventional transmural drainage and 58 per cent by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Of 166 group II patients, 31 per cent were treated surgically and 69 per  cent endoscopically. Of the 115 endoscopy patients, 17 per cent were drained by conventional transmural drainage and 83 per cent by EUS. Compared with group I, all pseudocysts in group II were treated by endoscopy (84% vs 100%, P = 0.001). There was no difference in the rate  of CC treated by endoscopy between both groups (57.7% vs 56.8%, P = 0.9). PFCs not causing luminal compression (P < 0.0001) or measuring <9 cm in size (P < 0.0001) were more likely to require EUS. There was a significant trend at our institution in the  management of PFCs with all pseudocysts presently being treated only by endoscopy. The ability of EUS to access smaller size PFCs and those not causing luminal compression has significantly expanded the role of endoscopy in PFC management.
