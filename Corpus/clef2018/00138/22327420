Epidermoid cyst in intrapancreatic accessory spleen: computed tomography findings and clinical manifestation. This study aims to assess retrospectively the imaging features of computed tomography (CT) and clinical characteristics of epidermoid cyst in intrapancreatic accessory spleen (ECIPAS).Seven consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed ECIPAS were included. CT images and clinical data were analyzed. The CT features emphasized included the location, size, calcification, cystic features, surrounding accessory spleen, density, and enhancement of the lesions.Five patients were male and two were female with a mean age of 43.2 years ranging from 25 to 66 years. Most cases were incidentally detected. All lesions were situated in the pancreatic tail, wherein the mean size was 4.4 cm. The cyst appeared unilocular in four cases and multilocular in three cases. An accessory spleen surrounding the cyst was recognized in all seven cases, and the cystic wall of ECIPAS showed a contrast enhancement similar to that of the spleen during multiphasic scans.ECIPAS is an extremely rare entity. The diagnosis of an ECIPAS should be considered when enhancing the cystic wall of the lesion in the pancreatic tail similar to that of the spleen during multiphasic scans.
