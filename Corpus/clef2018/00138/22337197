Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour of the duodenum. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (IMTs) of the duodenum and head of the pancreas are rare. They are of probable immunological aetiology and preoperatively indistinguishable from adenocarcinomas of the pancreatic head. We describe a patient with duodenal IMT and gastric outlet obstruction, and present a review of pancreatic head and duodenal IMTs in the literature. IMTs of the pancreatic head present as obstructive jaundice, while those of the duodenum present as gastric outlet obstruction. Surgery is the primary modality of treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are controversial and reserved for incomplete resections and IMTs of a pathologically aggressive nature. Otherwise, recurrence is uncommon and surgery curative.
