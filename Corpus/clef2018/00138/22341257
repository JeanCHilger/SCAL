The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. EUS with FNA is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. However, in certain situations, such as in patients with chronic pancreatitis, this high sensitivity and specificity can significantly diminish. The use of new technology, such as EUS elastography, CE-EUS, and gene mutations detection in FNA specimens, can help to differentiate chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer. EUS has evolved from a diagnostic procedure to a therapeutic intervention in pancreatic cancer. EUS-guided fiducial insertion and EUS-guided delivery of antitumor agents, in addition to celiac plexus neurolysis, are the main therapeutic applications of EUS in pancreatic cancer.
