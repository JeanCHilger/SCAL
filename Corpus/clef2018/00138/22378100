A non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour: a case report. We present the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties encountered in a patient with a clinically advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. The report concerns a 60-year-old female patient with the diagnosis of non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET G1) with liver, peripancreatic lymph node and mediastinal metastases. Due to the presence of advanced disease (inoperable pancreatic tumour, presence of multiple metastases) the patient was considered ineligible for surgical treatment on two occasions. Tissue samples for histopathology were collected during an exploratory laparotomy, which made it possible to establish the diagnosis. As somatostatin  receptor scintigraphy was positive, the patient was started on somatostatin analogues and radionuclide therapy was initiated, resulting in satisfactory response in the form of complete remission of liver metastases and the decreased size of the primary tumour in the pancreas. The use of somatostatin analogues in the case of an inoperable neuroendocrine tumour which was assessed as clinically advanced, yet  possessing a low proliferative potential, is a promising therapeutic option.
