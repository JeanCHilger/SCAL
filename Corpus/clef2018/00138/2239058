Resectable leiomyosarcoma of inferior vena cava presenting as carcinoma of the pancreas. Case report. A 61-year-old woman was thought to have a cancer of the head of pancreas on ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). At laparotomy, however, the pancreas was normal, and the tumour originated in the inferior vena cava. Histological examination showed a moderately differentiated leiomyosarcoma. The outcome was uneventful after caval resection and reconstruction with a polytetrafluoroethylene (Goretex) patch.
