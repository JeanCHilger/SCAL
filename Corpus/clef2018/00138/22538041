Giant pancreatic pseudocyst. A 56 years old man presented with epigastric pain and abdominal distension. He suffered an attack of acute pancreatitis 6 weeks back followed by pseudopancreatic cyst formation. As the cyst kept on enlarging in size despite being on conservative management, the patient was operated after 5 weeks. A huge pancreatic pseudocyst was found containing about 4.5 liters of fluid. Cystogastrostomy was performed and the patient recovered un-eventfully. It was the third largest pancreatic pseudocyst reported so far.
