EUS-guided FNA of solid pancreas tumors. Although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is considered superior to MRI and CT in detecting pancreatic masses, it is the ability to target and place a needle into suspicious lesions that has made EUS indispensible in the evaluation of patients with solid pancreatic tumors. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided-fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is an accurate and safe technique to confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. EUS-FNA is now the principal technique applied to obtain the diagnosis of malignancy. We have designed this article to address a number of the key technical aspects of EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic masses.
