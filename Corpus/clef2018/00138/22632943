Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided diagnosis of subepithelial tumors. Subepithelial lesions are frequently discovered during routine endoscopic examinations. These lesions represent a wide spectrum of heterogeneous benign to malignant conditions. Most of these lesions are asymptomatic. There is no consensus regarding how to manage these lesions. Over the last 2 decades, the approach to these lesions has significantly improved owing to the introduction of endoscopic ultrasonography, fine-needle aspiration, immunohistochemical staining methods, and different treatment options. This article discusses the nature of subepithelial lesions, focusing on the most recent developments that use endoscopic ultrasonography to diagnose and manage these lesions.
