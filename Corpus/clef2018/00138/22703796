Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: a single-institution 20-year series of pediatric patients. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm. The objective of this study was to review our institution's experience and provide an update on current management in the pediatric population.Our pathology database identified all patients with SPT for a 20-year period (1991-2011). Demographics, clinical characteristics, operative details, pathology, and outcomes data were retrospectively reviewed.Eleven patients with SPT were identified. Most were female and Hispanic. Median age at resection was 14 years (9-17 years). Most patients presented with abdominal pain. Diagnostic imaging was most commonly an ultrasound or computed tomography. All tumors were resected en bloc. Median greatest tumor diameter was 5 cm (3.5-12 cm). Median length of stay was 8 days (5-19 days). Complications included pancreatic leak, chyle leak, delayed gastric emptying, fat malabsorption, and incisional keloid. Recurrence developed after 2.5 years in 1 patient with positive surgical margins. There were no metastases or deaths. Median follow-up was 1.4 years (0.6-5.9 years).This pediatric series of SPT from a single institution corroborates previous reports in the literature. In our experience, SPT behaves like a low-grade malignancy and has an excellent prognosis. Surgical resection is dictated by tumor location and remains the treatment of choice.
