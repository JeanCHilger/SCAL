Pancreatic large mucinous cystoadenoma with invasive ductal carcinoma in pregnancy. Case report. Cystic tumour of the pancreas are infrequent and malignancy of the pancreas during pregnancy is extremely rare. Mucinous cystoadenomas is the most frequent cystic pancreatic neoplasm and it is seen mainly in women suggesting a sex hormone influence. Its presentation during pregnancy is extremely rare and entails difficulties in diagnosis and therapy.A 28 year old woman was referred to our service for abdominal mass. She had given birth to her second child two weeks previously. Ultrasound and CT scan showed a large cystic lesion, with sepitation and inner solid growth portions, involved mainly the left sovramesocolic space. An ultrasound-guided aspiration of the cystic fluid showed high level of CEA and CA. 19-9. The patient underwent laparotomic body-tail pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The histological examination showed mucinous cystoadenoma with associated invasive ductal carcinoma, with ovarian-like stroma and a well delimited fibrous capsule. Hystochemical study revealed a strong positivity for progesterone receptors.To our knowledge this is the eighth case of mucinous cystoadenoma reported in English literature and the forth with an invasive adenocarcinoma associated. This pathological entity should always be kept in mind in case of patient with an hepigastric mass during or soon after pregnancy. Aggressive approach is mandatory.
