Imaging features of the less common pancreatic masses. Contrast-enhanced multiphase CT and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR have been validated in the literature as outstanding modalities for the evaluation of pancreatic pathology. In addition to the more frequently seen pancreatic adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and cystic lesions such as serous and mucinous cystadenomas and IPMNs, a variety of benign and malignant lesions may occur in the pancreas. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review the imaging findings of a variety of uncommon, benign and malignant, pancreatic neoplasms.
