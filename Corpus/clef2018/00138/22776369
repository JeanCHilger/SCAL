Successful treatment of duodenal carcinoid tumor by laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection with lymphadenectomy. Reports on endoscopic full-thickness resection of the duodenum using the endoscopic submucosal dissection technique are rare. Here we present a case of a duodenal bulb carcinoid tumor successfully treated by laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection (LAEFR). An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman had a 10-mm, submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb. Abdominal CT revealed an enlarged lymph node adjacent to the duodenum and pancreas. Although we informed the patient of the need for pancreatoduodenectomy with a lymphadenectomy, the patient expressly requested LAEFR. After negative nodal metastasis was confirmed by an intraoperative frozen section of the enlarged nodes, LAEFR was performed using the endoscopic submucosal dissection technique under the laparoscopic assistance. The duodenal wall defect was closed by laparoscopy with an Albert anastomosis. The entire circumferential margin of the specimen was histopathologically negative for carcinoid tumor cells. In summary, LAEFR enables en bloc and whole-layer excision of nonperiampullary duodenal lesions with a sufficient surgical margin, both vertically and laterally. LAEFR is a minimally invasive and effective treatment for selected patients with duodenal carcinoid tumor.
