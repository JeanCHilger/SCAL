Celiac artery dissection seen with ruptured pancreaticoduodenal arcade aneurysms in two cases of celiac artery stenosis from compression by median arcuate ligament. We report two cases of ruptured pancreaticoduodenal arcade aneurysms that were successfully treated by embolotherapy. In these cases, contrast-enhanced computed tomography, sagittal reformed images, and angiography revealed celiac artery stenoses due to compression by the median arcuate ligament. Computed tomography also showed acute localized dissection in the distal celiac axis, suggesting that aneurysmal rupture had occurred immediately after development of the dissection. When unruptured pancreaticoduodenal arcade aneurysms are identified in the context of celiac artery dissection, the possibility of rupture may be high and requires strict observation and consideration of embolotherapy.
