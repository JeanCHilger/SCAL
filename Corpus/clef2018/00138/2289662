Dermoid cyst of the pancreas. Case report and review of the literature. During an annual check-up in a 46 year-old man, a round mass was discovered in the left hypochondrium upon abdominal ultrasonography. Computed tomographic scan located the mass at the upper border of the body of the pancreas, suggesting an expansive process. Left pancreatectomy was performed, leading to the discovery of a dermoid cyst. This cyst was apparently part of the pancreatic parenchyma. Only 11 cases of dermoid cysts of the pancreas have been reported between 1918 and 1977. Elective enucleation of the cyst is thought to be adequate surgical treatment.
