Value of diffusion weighted imaging in diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. With the capability of measuring the water molecular diffusion qualitatively and quantitatively, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is currently the optimal and the only magnetic resonance method to observe water molecular diffusion motion in living tissues. Along with the advances in magnetic resonance technology, particularly the development of fast imaging sequences, DWI has been widely used in the imaging of liver, pancreas, kidneys and other solid organs. In recent years, DWI has been applied in the stomach. This article summarizes recent research on the application of DWI for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.
