Acute pancreatitis: the onset digestive manifestation, in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Acute pancreatitis is a common complication, which occurs with patients suffering from vesicular biliary lithiasis or chronic alcoholism. Hypercalcemia may determine acute pancreatitis, its causes being multiple: primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, metabolic diseases of the bone, metastatic bone neoplasm, as well as lymphoproliferative syndromes caused by the HTLV-1 virus-adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a malignant and aggressive lymphoproliferation with the T-cell, associated with the infection caused by the HTLV-1 retrovirus. Organomegaly, cutaneous conditions, and hypercalcemia represent the main characteristics of the disease. From a hematologic point of view, we can notice the atypical lymphocytes (also known as flower cells, due to the shape of their nucleus), with a distinct CD4+ CD25+ phenotype. There have been reported few cases of patients who showed acute pancreatitis in the onset of the disease. We will describe the case of a patient whose diagnosis has not been an easy one, as it showed multiple complications from a very early stage.The atypical onset of ATLL with acute pancreatitis is rarely reported. Its etiology seems to be hypercalcemia but pancreatic infiltration with ATLL cells cannot be ruled out. An attentive investigation of the peripheral blood sample and flow-cytometric tests of peripheral and medullar blood smear are very important for diagnosis. The patient showed from the very beginning severe neurological manifestations which developed to a coma. Causes could have been metabolic as well as CNS infiltration (as shown by the CT examination).
