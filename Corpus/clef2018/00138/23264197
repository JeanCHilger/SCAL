Hepaticojejunostomy after pancreatic head resection - technical aspects for reconstruction of small and fragile bile ducts with T-tube drainage. After pancreatic head resection the reconstruction of small and fragile bile ducts is technically demanding, resulting in more postoperative bile leaks. One option for the reconstruction is the placement of a T-tube drainage at the site of the anastomosis.Standard reconstruction after pancreatic head resection was an end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy with PDS 5.0, 15-25 cm distally from the pancreaticojejunostomy. For patients with a small bile duct diameter (≤ 5 mm) or a fragile bile duct wall the reconstruction was performed with PDS 6.0 and a T-tube drainage at the side of the anastomosis.The reconstruction with a T-tube drainage at the site of the anastomosis is technically easy to perform and offers the opportunity for immediate visualisation of the anastomosis in the postoperative period by application of water soluble contrast medium. If a bile leak occurs, biliary deviation through the T-tube drainage can enable a conservative management without revisional laparotomy in selected patients. Whether or not a conservative management of postoperative bile leaks will lead to more bile duct strictures is a subject for further investigations.A T-tube drainage at the site of the anastomosis can probably not prevent postoperative bile leaks from a difficult hepaticojejunostomy, but in selected patients it offers the opportunity for a conservative management resulting in less re-operations. Therefore we recommend the augmentation of a difficult hepaticojejunostomy with a T-tube drainage.
