The concept of laparoscopy-assisted pancreatobiliary EUS (LAP-EUS). While laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be performed for the diagnosis and management of pancreaticobiliary diseases in patients with Roux-en-Y (RY) anatomy the technical feasibility of performing laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is unknown.In this report, we describe the technique for performing laparoscopy-assisted EUS in two patients with RY gastric bypass anatomy who presented with obstructive jaundice, abnormal liver function tests, and dilated biliary tree.While the examination was normal in one patient, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic head mass revealed adenocarcinoma in the other.Laparoscopic assisted EUS examination including FNA is feasible in Roux-en-Y surgical anatomy.
