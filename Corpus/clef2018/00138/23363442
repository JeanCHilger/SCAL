Identification and usage of fluorescent probes as nanoparticle contrast agents in detecting cancer. As advancements in the field of nanoparticle imaging science are made, one of the first benefits will be in open and endoscopic conditions. There is considerable evidence indicating that the use of injected contrast agents can improve the detection of tumor margins and small metastases. New and innovative targeting and contrast agents including small molecules, antibodies and nanoparticles have to be developed for a broad range of tumor types such as breast, brain, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. At present, a number of organic dye molecules have been approved for human use including (1) indocyanine green (ICG), a near-infrared fluorescent dye (2) fluorescein, a green fluorescent dye
