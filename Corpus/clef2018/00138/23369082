Mucosal cutting biopsy technique for histological diagnosis of suspected gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach. The Japanese Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) therapeutic guidelines recommend endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy for histological diagnosis. However, before 2010, this technique was only carried out at a minority of medical institutions in Japan. In the present study, we investigated the usefulness of mucosal cutting biopsy.In 18 asymptomatic gastric submucosal tumors, mucosal cutting biopsies were carried out. We examined tumor size, tumor site (lower third: L middle third: MThe tumors had a mean size of 20.3 mm and were located at the L site in five cases, M in four, and U in nine. Histological diagnosis of submucosal tumor was obtained in all the cases. (GIST, n = 13 heterotopic pancreas, n = 2The mucosal cutting biopsy technique is a useful diagnostic modality for the diagnosis of gastric GIST and for selection of the appropriate treatment.
