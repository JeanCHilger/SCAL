Completely thrombosed splenic artery aneurysm mimicking cystic pancreatic mass: computed tomographic findings. A case of a completely thrombosed aneurysm of the splenic artery is reported. The central lumen of the aneurysm was not enhanced on computed tomography (CT) therefore, a cystic pancreatic mass could not be excluded. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a cystic peripancreatic mass with a calcified rim is detected on CT.
