Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the management of a case of autoimmune pancreatitis with extrapancreatic manifestations. Autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer share many clinical features like advanced age, painless jaundice, weight loss, and elevated serum levels of CA 19-9. The authors report a 58-year-old male patient provisionally diagnosed with periampullary carcinoma on the basis of ultrasonography and serological markers and planned for Whipple resection. (18)F-FDG PET/CT findings were suggestive of autoimmune pancreatitis, subsequently confirmed on cytological diagnosis. The follow-up PET/CT scan after 1 week of steroid therapy showed regression of FDG uptake in most of the lesions with appearance of salivary gland uptake.
