Systemic lupus erythematosus-related pancreatitis in children. We report on three patients who developed four episodes of acute pancreatitis while their systemic lupus erythematosus was active and being treated with prednisolone. In all three, gastritis was first considered and treated due to abdominal pain, vomiting, and epigastric tenderness, but their symptoms did not improve. Then pancreatic enzymes were measured, which confirmed pancreatitis. Imaging studies showed an enlarged pancreas in one case, a normal pancreas in two cases, and a focal hypodense nonenhancing parenchyma in one case. Corticosteroids were prescribed for both active SLE and SLE-related pancreatitis. Pulse methylprednisolone was prescribed in one episode, increasing oral prednisolone in one episode, and the same dose of prednisolone continued in the other two episodes. All cases recovered without complications. SLE-related pancreatitis should be considered in SLE patients when the SLE is active and a patient develops abdominal pain and vomiting.
