Surgical correction of complicated forms of chronic pancreatitis. In the clinic in 2009 - 2011 yrs 43 patients were operated for complicated forms of chronic pancreatitis (CHP). Basing on the CT and endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography data, the pancreatic pathology variants, significant for the operative method choice, were delineated. The intraoperative biopsy material estimation have shown, that the main sign of CHP in all the cases was prominent pancreatic fibrosis, and in the degree III fibrose the fibrous tissue have constituted 68.2-76.4% of pancreatic tissue, exocrine--16.2-24.8%, in the degree IV fibrose--79.5-95.5 and 2.3-10.8% accordingly. The indications for organ preserving resectional, resection-draining interventions and isolated, draining pancreatic duct system operations, were formulated. The rate of combined resection-draining interventions with duodenal preserving have constituted 30.2%. Total postoperative stationary mortality was 2.3%. The stationary postoperative patients stay was (9.1 +/- 0.8) days.
