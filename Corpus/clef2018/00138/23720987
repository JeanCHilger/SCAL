Pancreatic schwannoma: A case report and review of literature. Pancreatic schwannoma is an extremely rare neoplasm, derived from Schwann cells that line the nerve sheaths. It is also referred to as neurilemmoma. The authors report a case of a 46-year-old Thai female who presented with dyspepsia, weight loss and epigastric mass. An examination by ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a septated cystic tumor in the pancreatic head, 5.8x5.5x5.3 cm in size. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed to remove this tumor. A microscopic examination identified proliferating spindle cells that are consistent with neurilemmoma (schwannoma). No complications were found after the operation. At 18-month follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic and has no signs of recurrence.
