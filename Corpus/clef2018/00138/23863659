A case of pancreatic body cancer with multiple liver metastases experiencing long-term response by gemcitabine plus erlotinib therapy. We report a case of pancreatic body cancer with multiple liver metastases whose response duration was 295 days in a Japanese phase II trial of gemcitabine(GEM)plus erlotinib. The patient was a 64-year-old male. He visited our hospital with the main complaint of epigastralgia and weight loss in May, 2007, and was diagnosed as advanced pancreatic cancer with abdominal paraaortic lymph node metastasis and liver metastases(Stage IV)by abdominal computed tomography and percutaneous biopsy of liver metastases. Partial response(PR)was found at the end of the sixth course of GEM+erlotinib, and his serum concentration of CA19-9 remarkably decreased. PR continued for a long period until a new lesion was found at the initiation of the seventeenth course. This result suggests that GEM+erlotinib may provide long-term survival for pancreatic cancer patients with distant metastases.
