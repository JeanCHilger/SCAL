Cystic tumors of the pancreas - - our experience with diagnostics. Number of newly diagnosed cystic pancreatic tumors is permanently increasing. This fact is primarily related to the development of new diagnostic methods. The main representative ones are: serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystic neoplasm, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and solid pseudopapillar tumor. Because of the malignant potential of these lesions, proper indication of surgical treatment is extremely important. The article highlights and describes our experience in diagnostics and therapy of cystic pancreatic tumors diagnosed in the General Teaching Hospital Prague in the period: 1/ 2008- 12/ 2012. All patients were investigated by computerised tomography and endoscopic ultrasound with fine -  needle aspiration biopsy. Thirty seven patients in total were diagnosed with cystic pancreatic tumors: 19 with serous cystadenoma, 5 with mucinous cystic neoplasm, 5 with mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, 5 with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and 3 with solid pseudopapillar tumor. In 14 cases patients were indicated for surgery, in 1 case signs of malignant transformation were found. Determination of the optimal strategy for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in patients with cystic pancreatic tumors requires the dia-gnosis, treatment and followup observation in adequately equiped specialized centers.
