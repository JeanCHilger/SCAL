β-Cell dysfunction is associated with metabolic syndrome severity in adults. Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in adults characterized by increased visceral adiposity and insulin resistance (IR). However, the link between pancreatic β-cell function and metabolic syndrome severity in adults across the glucose spectrum is unknown. We hypothesized that poor β-cell function would independently predict a higher metabolic syndrome Z-score (i.e., severity).Seventy (12 normal glucose tolerant, 37 prediabetic, 21 type 2 diabetic) obese adults [62.4±1.1 year 34.6±0.6 kg/m(2)Compared to those with normal glucose tolerance, visceral fat and IR were higher and β-cell function was lower in adults with glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Elevated visceral fat and IR (HOMA-IR and Matsuda Index) correlated with elevated Z-scores (r=0.51, r=0.54, r=-0.49 all P<0.002, respectively). Basal, first-, and second-phase β-cell function correlated with low Z-scores (r=-0.59, r=-0.51, and r=-0.43, all P<0.001). Insulin secretion significantly predicted the Z-score independent of sex, body fat, blood lipids, blood pressure, IR, and glucose metabolism (P<0.005).β-cell dysfunction is highly correlated with the severity of metabolic syndrome in adults. Future work is warranted to elucidate the mechanism by which cardiometabolic disturbances influence insulin secretion.
