Acute intestinal obstruction secondary to left paraduodenal hernia: a case report. Paraduodenal hernia, the most common type of internal herniation, is rare in the etiology of intestinal obstruction. Delayed diagnosis and surgical intervention may result in significant morbidity and mortality risk. This report presents a case of left paraduodenal hernia resulting in acute intestinal obstruction. A 43-year old male patient was admitted with a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction. A left paraduodenal hernia was identified by computed tomography findings of an encapsulated cluster of dilated small bowel loops occupying the left upper quadrant between the stomach and pancreas, and the presence of an engorged and displaced vascular pedicle at the orifice of the hernia. Upon further investigation, the dilated proximal jejunal segments were found in the left paraduodenal fossa, enclosed in a hernia sac. After reducing the intestinal segments to the abdominal cavity, the orifice of the hernia sac was closed by suturing to the retroperitoneum. Paraduodenal hernia should be considered as a possible etiology in cases of acute intestinal obstruction with unremarkable presentations. Physicians should be familiar with the demonstrative imaging findings of computed tomography of a paraduodenal hernia. Early surgical intervention is critical to prevent the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.
