Performance of the forward-viewing linear echoendoscope for fine-needle aspiration of solid and cystic lesions throughout the gastrointestinal tract: a large single-center experience. A newly developed forward-viewing linear echoendoscope (FV-EUS) has recently become available. To date, however, only scanty data on the performance of the FV-EUS scope for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of lesions throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are available. This study aimed to evaluate the technical performance of the FV-EUS scope for FNA of solid and cystic lesions located throughout the GI tract in a large cohort of patients referred to a tertiary care center.All patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided FNA using the FV-EUS scope between January 2007 and December 2008 were included in this retrospective study. The performance of the FV-EUS scope for FNA was evaluated.During the study period, 285 patients with solid or cystic lesions throughout the GI tract underwent the procedure with the FV-EUS scope. A total of 300 FNAs were attempted, 6 (2%) of which could not be performed. Of the 294 successful EUS-FNA procedures, 130 (44.2%) were performed using a 22-gauge needle, 89 (30.3%) using a 25-gauge needle, and 75 (25.5%) using a 19-gauge needle. In all 67 cases of pancreatic cyst or dilated pancreatic duct, a specimen for cystic fluid analysis or cytologic examination could be obtained. Among the remaining 217 patients with solid lesion, a definitive diagnosis could be established for 211 patients (97.2%). The FV-EUS scope had a sensitivity of 74.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68.1-80.6%), a specificity of 100% (95% CI 89.9-100%), a positive likelihood ratio of infinity, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.251 (95% CI 0.196-0.323).The FV-EUS scope is highly effective for FNA of solid and cystic lesions throughout the GI tract. Prospective studies comparing the FV-EUS scope and a curved linear scope are needed.
