Initial experience in endoscopic ultrasonography in Edgardo Rebagliati Hospital, Essalud, Lima, Peru. Report our experience with endoscopic ultrasonography.In this report we analyze retrospectivement the data of 205 EUS studies done from January to December 2012 at the Hospital. Lima, Peru. Age, sex, endoscopic diagnosis and the results of fine needle aspiration (FNA) are analyzed.In this study 205 patients underwent to EUS. There were 116 patients (56.6%) females and 89 (43.4%) males. Mean age was 60.8 Â± 15.6 years (range: 17 - 84), 51.3% were over 60. 157 patients (76.6%) had upper GI EUS tract and 48 (23.4%) of the lower. In upper GI EUS the most frequent diagnosis was: Sub epithelial lesions (22.7%), malignant neoplasm (13.5%) and pancreatic cancer the most frequent one (6.7%). Stones in the biliary and pancreatic duct (12.2%) and pancreatic cystic disease (9.8%) were found. Rectal cancer was the most frequent diagnosis in the ano-rectal EUS (47.9%). 20 fine needle aspiration biopsies were performed. No complications were reported.This one year experience is the first step for the development of endoscopic ultrasonography in our country. Despite of problems with the design and number of patients, we believe we can say that GI EUS is a useful and safe for the diagnosis of different diseases of the GI tract and appropriate training is needed.
