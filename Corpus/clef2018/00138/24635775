EUS-guided FNA cytology of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET): a retrospective study of 132 cases over an 18-year period in a single institution. To determine the diagnostic accuracy and pitfalls of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET).A search of our laboratory information system was performed from July 1992 to June 2010 to identify all FNA cytology and corresponding surgical specimens in which the diagnosis of PanNET was rendered or considered.One hundred and thirty-two cases diagnosed by EUS-guided FNA were collected. Histological correlation was available for 77 (58%) of FNAs 55 patients may have been treated elsewhere or had no surgery because of advanced disease or co-morbidity. Among 56 cases diagnosed as PanNET on FNA, 54 (96%) were confirmed histologicallyOverall, 54 of the 70 histologically confirmed PanNET cases (77%) were correctly diagnosed by preoperative FNA as PanNET. FNA cases designated as no atypical cells identified and unsatisfactory (7/132, 5%) were attributable to sampling error. Diagnostic pitfalls in our study mainly included PDA, SPT and chronic pancreatitis.
