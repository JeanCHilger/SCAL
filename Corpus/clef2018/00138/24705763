Comparing the performance of visual estimation and standard uptake value of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography for detecting malignancy in pancreatic tumors other than invasive ductal carcinoma. The utility of FDG PET/CT for the detection and evaluation of invasive ductal carcinoma has been widely reported, but a few studies have assessed the utility of FDG PET/CT to detect malignancy in a variety of pancreatic lesions other than invasive ductal carcinoma.To compare the diagnostic performance of visual estimation with the semi-quantitative scores of FDG PET/CT for detecting malignancy in a variety of pancreatic lesions other than invasive ductal carcinoma.Images of pathologically proven pancreatic lesions from 32 patients were retrospectively evaluated: 14 benign lesions, 7 borderline (low malignant) lesions, and 11 malignant lesions. The average scores from visual estimation by the two observers were compared to two semi-quantitative analyses of FDG uptake in the lesions, namely the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean).Visual analysis value, SUVmax and SUVmean were 0.33 ± 0.21, 1.8 ± 0.7 and 1.5 ± 0.7 for the benign lesions, 0.70 ± 0.28, 5.0 ± 2.6 and 3.1±1.7 for the borderline lesions, and 0.73 ± 0.18, 4.7 ± 2.5 and 3.2 ± 1.6 for the malignant lesions, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the areas under the curves for detecting non-benign (malignant or borderline) lesions through visual analysis, SUVmax, and SUVmean were 0.914, 0.954, and 0.875, respectively.For a variety of pancreatic lesions other than invasive ductal carcinoma, visual analysis and semi-quantitative analyses all showed strong diagnostic performance. However, semi-quantitative analysis with SUVmax proved to be the most effective method for detecting non-benign pancreatic lesions.
