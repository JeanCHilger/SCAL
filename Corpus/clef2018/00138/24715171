Cystic fibrosis liver disease - from diagnosis to risk factors. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent monogenic genetic disease, autosomal recessive transmitted, characterized by an impressive clinical polymorphism and appreciative fatal prospective. Liver disease is the second non-pulmonary cause of death in cystic fibrosis, which, with increasing life expectancy, became an important management problem. Predisposing factors like male gender, pancreatic insufficiency, meconium ileus and severe mutation are incriminated to influence the occurrence of cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD). Our study included 174 patients with CF, monitored in the National Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Timisoara, Romania. They were routinely followed-up by clinical assessment, liver biochemical tests, ultrasound examinations and other methods like transient elastography, biopsy, in selected cases. Sixty-six patients, with median age at diagnosis 4.33 years, diagnosed with CFLD, without significant gender gap. CFLD was frequent in patients aged over eight years, with meconium ileus history, carriers of severe mutations (p=0.002). Pancreatic insufficiency, although present in 75% of patients with CFLD was not confirmed as risk factor, not male gender, in our study. CF children older than eight years, carriers of a severe genotype, with a positive history of meconium ileus, were more likely predisposed to CFLD.
