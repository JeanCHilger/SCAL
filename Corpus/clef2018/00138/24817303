Cystic pancreatic neoplasms: diagnosis and management emphasizing their imaging features. The incidence of cystic pancreatic neoplasms increased in the past decade, due to the recent advances in multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging several pancreatic cysts are incidentally encountered during diagnostic exams performed for non-pancreatic diseases. Indeed, cystic pancreatic tumors are currently considered relatively rare, accounting for approximately 10% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenoma, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and solid-pseudopapillary tumor represent about 90% of all pancreatic primary cystic tumours. The non-optimal diagnostic preoperative accuracy in distinguishing benign from malignant cystic lesions ensures that up till now there are no well-defined guidelines regarding the management of cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging findings often do not allow the diagnosis, because there is a considerable overlap among the cystic lesions
