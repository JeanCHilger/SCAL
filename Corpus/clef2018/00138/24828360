Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare pancreatic neoplasms comprising only 1% to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. In recent years, the number of incidentally discovered PNETs has greatly increased given the widespread use of axial imaging. However, a significant proportion of PNETs may not be visualized on conventional imaging such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an integral part of the diagnosis of PNETs because of its high sensitivity for detecting, localizing, and diagnosing PNETs. EUS-guided tissue acquisition provides histologic and immunologic confirmation, and may also allow prognostication about tumor behavior. In addition to preoperative assessment of these tumors, EUS has also been shown to have an important role in nonoperative management of small nonfunctional PNETs. Finally, recent developments suggest that interventional EUS may be used to aid intraoperative localization of PNETs and to deliver therapeutic agents for the treatment of PNETs. This review will discuss the endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of PNETs, with focus on recent advances in the utility of EUS in the clinical management of these tumors.
