Comparison of ERCP, EUS, and ERCP combined with EUS in diagnosing pancreatic neoplasms: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In the current study, we performed a systematic review of literature pertaining to the diagnostic value of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and combined ERCP plus EUS to pancreatic cancer. We searched MEDLINE, OVID, and the Cochrane Library for studies evaluating diagnostic validity of ERCP, EUS, and ERCP plus EUS between January 1989 and May 2014. We obtained pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC). A total of 10 studies that included 669 patients who fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria were considered for inclusion in the analysis. The pooled sensitivities of EUS, ERCP, and EUS plus ERCP were 76.7, 57.9, and 79.9 %, respectively. The pooled specificities were 91.7, 90.6, and 94.2 %, respectively. The *Q index estimates were 0.828, 0.862, and 0.896, respectively. The *Q indices for EUS and EUS plus ERCP were significantly higher compared with ERCP (P = 0.010 and 0.008, respectively). Our meta-analysis showed that ERCP plus EUS was associated with a high diagnostic value for the detection of pancreatic neoplasms compared with ERCP and EUS alone.
