Endoscopic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic disorders using endoscopy.The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic disorders continues to increase in importance. The use of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) provides therapy for many pancreatic disorders, including in the treatment of pancreatitis, its complications and pancreatic neoplasia. In recent years, there has been a focus on improving its safety in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis. Pancreatic endotherapy by ERCP for the treatment of biliary strictures and chronic pain in chronic pancreatitis will also be reviewed. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has a vital diagnostic role in pancreatic disorders however, much of the recent focus has been on its therapeutic role for simple and complex pancreatic fluid collections. As for the role of EUS in pancreatic cancer, recent technical advances in conjunction with on-site cytopathology service continue to improve pancreatic cancer diagnosis. EUS has an increasing role in treatment with fiducial placement for stereotactic body radiation therapy.In this review, I will examine the literature over the last year in ERCP and EUS as they apply to specific pancreatic disorders.
