Comparison of abdominal ultrasonographic findings with endoscopic ultrasonographic findings of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas. To compare abdominal ultrasonographic (AU) findings with endoscopic ultrasonographic (EUS) findings of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas, 13 patients (male-to-female ratio, 3:10 mean age, 36 years) with surgically proven SPN who underwent both preoperative AU and EUS were included in the study. Ultrasonographic findings of the 2 modalities were compared according to internal echogenicity, calcification, demarcation, internal septum, and main pancreatic duct dilatation. Nine cases showed hypoechogenicity on both AU and EUS. The remaining 4 cases showed different echogenicity on both modalities as follows: hypoechogenicity (n = 2) and isoechogenicity (n = 2) on AU
