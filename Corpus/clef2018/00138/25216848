Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for non-neoplastic conditions in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic regions: pearls and potential pitfalls in imaging interpretation. Potentially, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) can assess the functional information on concerning the status of tissue cellularity, because increased cellularity is associated with impeded diffusion. DWI in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic regions has demonstrated the usefulness to detect malignant lesions and differentiate them from benign lesions. However, it has been shown more recently that there is some overlap in ADC values for benign and malignant neoplasms. Moreover, some non-neoplastic lesions in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic regions exhibit restricted diffusion on DWI, because of pus, inflammation, or high cellularity. Focal eosinophilic liver disease, hepatic inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, granulomatous liver disease, acute cholecystitis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, focal pancreatitis, or autoimmune pancreatitis frequently exhibit restricted diffusion on DWI, which may be confused with malignancy in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic regions. Thus, DWI should not be interpreted in isolation, but in conjunction with other conventional images, to avoid the diagnostic pitfalls of DWI. Nevertheless, the presence of diffusion restriction in the non-neoplastic lesions sometimes provides additional information regarding the diagnosis, in problematic patients where conventional images have yielded equivocal findings. DWI may help differentiate hepatic abscess from malignant necrotic tumors, gallbladder empyema from dense bile or sludge in the gallbladder, and pylephlebitis from bland thrombosis in the portal vein. Therefore, knowledge of DWI findings to conventional imaging findings of diffusion-restricted non-neoplastic conditions in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic regions helps establishing a correct diagnosis.
