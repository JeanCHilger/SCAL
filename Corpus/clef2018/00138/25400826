¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT features and correlations with histopathologic characteristics in sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a clinicopathologically distinct variant of fibrosarcoma that is capable of recurrence and metastasis. Awareness of imaging features and histopathologic characteristics will be helpful for differential diagnosis from other common tumors. Here, we report a case of SEF metastasizing to the pancreas as a solitary mass mimicking primary pancreatic cancer, and summarize the reported cases with FDG PET/CT from the literature (n=4). PET/CT showed abnormal FDG accumulation (n=2), mild FDG uptake (n=1), or photopenic (n=1). The FDG PET/CT features are closely related to histopathologic characteristics regarding its differentiation and aggressiveness.
