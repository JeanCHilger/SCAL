Non-enhanced low-tube-voltage high-pitch dual-source computed tomography with sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm of the abdomen and pelvis. To investigate the image quality, radiation dose and diagnostic value of the low-tube-voltage high-pitch dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) with sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) for non-enhanced abdominal and pelvic scans.This institutional review board-approved prospective study included 64 patients who gave written informed consent for additional abdominal and pelvic scan with DSCT in the period from November to December 2012. The patients underwent standard non-enhanced CT scans (protocol 1) [tube voltage of 120 kVp/pitch of 0.9/filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction] followed by high-pitch non-enhanced CT scans (protocol 2) (100 kVp/3.0/SAFIRE). The total scan time, mean CT number, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image quality, lesion detectability and radiation dose were compared between the two protocols.The total scan time of protocol 2 was significantly shorter than that of protocol 1 (1.4±0.1 seconds vs. 7.6±0.6 seconds, P<0.001). There was no significant difference between protocol 1 and protocol 2 in mean CT number of all organs (liver, 55.4±6.3 HU vs. 56.1±6.8 HU, P=0.214 pancreas, 43.6±5.9 HU vs. 43.7±5.8 HU, P=0.785The high-pitch DSCT with SAFIRE can shorten scan time and reduce radiation dose while preserving image quality in non-enhanced abdominal and pelvic scans.
