Fatal clostridial pancreatitis following ERCP and percutaneous needle biopsy. A patient with a large necrotic pancreatic carcinoma underwent ERCP and percutaneous biopsy of the cancer and of a suspected hepatic metastasis. On the second day, she developed a massive hemolysis with a 50% drop of hemoglobin level and a rise of serum bilirubin level from 1.3 to 37.5 mg%. Gas was noted on followup CT scan of the pancreas. Clostridium perfringens was found by needle aspiration of the pancreas and on multiple blood cultures. Death resulted from sepsis on the fourth day. Since ERCP and percutaneous needle biopsy of the pancreas are being done with increasing frequency, and since this complication has not been previously described, this case report is presented.
