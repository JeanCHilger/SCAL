X-ray diagnostic strategies in liver and pancreatic tumors. The following publication describes the diagnostic approach in different benign and malignant space-occupying lesions of the liver and pancreas. An essential prerequisite is that all imaging methods are actually available and can be made use of. While taking the cost factor into consideration, flow diagrams are worked out for haemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases, as well as for carcinoma of the pancreas and for insulinoma.
