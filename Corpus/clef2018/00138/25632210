Isolated intrapancreatic IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis. Immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is frequently associated with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Association with AIP can be utilized in the diagnosis of IgG4-SC. However, some cases of IgG4-SC are isolated from AIP, which complicates the diagnosis. Most of the reported cases of isolated IgG4-SC displayed hilar biliary strictures, whereas isolated IgG4-SC with intrapancreatic biliary stricture is very rare. Recently, we have encountered 5 isolated intrapancreatic IgG4-SC cases that were not associated with AIP, three of which were pathologically investigated after surgical operation. They all were males with a mean age of 74.2 years. The pancreas was not enlarged in any of these cases. No irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct was found. Bile duct wall thickening in lesions without luminal stenosis was detected by abdominal computed tomography in all five cases, by endoscopic ultrasonography in two out of four cases and by intraductal ultrasonography in all three cases. In three cases, serum IgG4 levels were within the normal limits. The mean serum IgG4 level measured before surgery was 202.1 mg/dL (4 cases). Isolated intrapancreatic IgG4-SC is difficult to diagnose, especially if the IgG4 level remains normal. Thus, this type of IgG4-SC should be suspected in addition to cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer if stenosis of intrapancreatic bile duct is present.
