Pancreatic carcinosarcoma: first literature report on computed tomography imaging. Carcinosarcoma of the pancreas is an extremely rare tumor and has a dismal prognosis. To the best of our knowledge, the histopathological features of the lesion have been illustrated in the literature but to date no reported cases have been documented on imaging characteristics. We report a female case of pancreatic carcinosarcoma presenting as a mucinous cystadenoma on computed tomography (CT). We also summarize the CT characteristics according to the appended CT images in the reported cases. This is the first report of CT features of pancreatic carcinosarcoma in the English literature.
