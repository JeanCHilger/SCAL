A case of synchronous triple cancer treated with multidisciplinary therapy - cancers in the middle part of the extrahepatic bile duct, the pancreas head, and the supraglottis. An 83-year-old man was admitted to our institution for the purpose of investigation of hoarseness in January 2014. He was diagnosed with cancer in the supraglottis via biopsy while undergoing laryngeal microsurgery. Positron emission tomography (PET)evaluation for tumor staging revealed two hot spots, 1 in the hepatoduodenal ligament and 1 in the pancreas head. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with synchronous double cancer in the middle bile duct and the pancreas head. The treatment of the bile duct cancer and pancreatic cancer was performed prior to that of the supraglottic cancer. Curative pancreatoduodenectomy was performed, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Three weeks after the surgery, chemoradiotherapy for the supraglottic lesion was initiated. The tumor almost disappeared 2 months after the start of chemoradiotherapy, as observed by using a laryngoscope. Multidisciplinary therapy based on the therapeutic guidelines for each of the cancers was beneficial for the patient.
