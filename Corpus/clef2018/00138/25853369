Short-term Results of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Swedish Screening Program for Individuals at Risk for Pancreatic Cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. In approximately 10% of all patients with pancreatic cancer, it is possible to define a positive family history for pancreatic cancer or for one of the other related genetic syndromes. A screening program for individuals at risk is recommended however, surveillance modalities have not been defined yet.To analyze the short-term results of a prospective clinical surveillance program for individuals at risk for pancreatic cancer using a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based screening protocol.A prospective observational study of all patients with a genetic risk for developing pancreatic cancer who were referred to Karolinska University Hospital between January 1, 2010, and January 31, 2013, using an MRI-based surveillance program. All patients were investigated for the most common genetic mutations associated with pancreatic cancer.A noninvasive MRI-based screening protocol.The ability of MRI to identify potential precancerous or early cancers in individuals at risk for pancreatic cancer.Forty patients (24 women and 16 men) were enrolled. The mean age was 49.9 years. The mean length of follow-up was 12.9 months. The numbers of relatives affected by pancreatic cancer were 5 in 2 patients (5%), 4 in 5 patients (12.5%), 3 in 17 patients (42.5%), 2 in 14 patients (35%), and 1 in 2 patients (5%). In 4 patients (10%), a p16 mutation was found in 3, a BRCA2 mutation (7.5%)During a median follow-up of approximately 1 year, pancreatic lesions were detected in 40% of the patients, of whom 5 underwent surgery. Although the study time was relatively short, the surveillance program in individuals at risk seems to be effective.
