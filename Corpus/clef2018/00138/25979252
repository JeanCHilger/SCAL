Optimal number of needle passes in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for pancreatic lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is accurate in cytological diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. Our aim was to determine optimal number of needle passes in EUS-FNA for pancreatic lesions without onsite cytopathologist, who is not routinely available to participate in the procedure.Results of all needle passes in EUS-FNAs for 117 pancreatic neoplasms in 115 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Factors that required 2 or more needle passes for correct diagnosis were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. In each lesion group defined by the factors that required 2 or more passes and were known at the time of EUS-FNA, number of needle passes was regarded as optimal when an increase in diagnostic sensitivity by an additional needle pass did not reach 10%.Size of 15 mm or less (OR 4.58, 95% CI 1.70-12.3, P < 0.01), location of head (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.82-13.9, P < 0.01), and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) (OR 5.04, 95% CI 1.38-18.4, P = 0.01) independently required 2 or more needle passes. Optimal numbers of needle passes for lesions of 15 mm or less in the head, those of more than 15 mm in the head, those of 15 mm or less in the body or tail, and those of more than 15 mm in the body or tail were 3, 2, 2, and 1, respectively. When these numbers of needle passes were performed, 93% of pancreatic lesions were correctly diagnosed.Optimal numbers of needle passes in EUS-FNA for pancreatic lesions without onsite cytopathologist were between 1 and 3.
