Endovascular treatment of post-laparoscopic pancreatectomy splenic arteriovenous fistula with splenic vein aneurysm. Splenic arteriovenous fistulas (SAVFs) with splenic vein aneurysms are extremely rare entities. There have been no prior reports of SAVFs developing after laparoscopic pancreatectomy. Here, we report the first case. A 40-year-old man underwent a laparoscopic, spleen-preserving, distal pancreatectomy for an endocrine neoplasm of the pancreatic tail. Three months after surgery, a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an SAVF with a dilated splenic vein. The SAVF, together with the splenic vein aneurysm, was successfully treated using percutaneous transarterial coil embolization of the splenic artery, including the SAVF and drainage vein. After the endovascular treatment, the patient's recovery was uneventful. He was discharged on postoperative day 6 and continues to be well 3 mo after discharge. An abdominal CT scan performed at his 3-mo follow-up demonstrated complete thrombosis of the splenic vein aneurysm, which had decreased to a 40 mm diameter. This is the first reported case of SAVF following a laparoscopic pancreatectomy and demonstrates the usefulness of endovascular treatment for this type of complication.
