Insulin, Central Dopamine D2 Receptors, and Monetary Reward Discounting in Obesity. Animal research finds that insulin regulates dopamine signaling and reward behavior, but similar research in humans is lacking. We investigated whether individual differences in body mass index, percent body fat, pancreatic Î²-cell function, and dopamine D2 receptor binding were related to reward discounting in obese and non-obese adult men and women. Obese (n = 27 body mass index>30) and non-obese (n = 20
