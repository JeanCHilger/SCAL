Pancreatic paragonimiasis mimics pancreatic cystic-solid tumor--A case report. Paragonimiasis is frequently misdiagnosed owing to its various and complicated clinical manifestations. Although paragonimiasis has diverse manifestations, there is no report of paragonimiasis involving the pancreas. Herein we report the first case of pancreatic paragonimiasis, which was misdiagnosed as pancreatic cystic-solid tumor by CT scan. The pancreatic lesion was finally proved to be pancreatic paragonimiasis by pathological examination and serum antibody detection. The clinical manifestations and imaging features of this patient were analyzed. Pancreatic paragonimiasis should be an important differential diagnosis for pancreatic cyst-solid lesions.
