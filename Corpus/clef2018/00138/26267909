Pancreatic Insulinoma Misdiagnosed as Epilepsy for  Eight Years: A Case Report and Literature Review. A 58-year-old Chinese man presented with intermittent seizure episodes after being misdiagnosed with epilepsy for eight years. MRI revealed an abnormally strong signal in the distal pancreas. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic insulinoma based on the histological findings, and his symptoms improved following surgical removal of the tumor. The appearance of unusual manifestations of insulinoma makes it difficult to diagnose the condition. This disorder should be included in the differential diagnosis of epilepsy and mental illness.
