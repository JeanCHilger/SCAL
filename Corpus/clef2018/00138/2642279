Vascular complications of pancreatitis. Hemorrhage is one of the most life-threatening complications of pancreatitis. It is usually due to erosion of a major pancreatic or peripancreatic vessel with massive bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract or abdominal cavity, or to formation and subsequent rupture of an arterial pseudoaneurysm.
