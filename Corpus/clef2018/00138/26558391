99mTc-HYNIC-TOC increased uptake can mimic malignancy in the pancreas uncinate process at somatostatin receptor SPECT/CT. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence and frequency of increased physiologic uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC by the uncinate process of the pancreas in SPECT/CT images.Forty-six scans of 41 patients were evaluated retrospectively. The uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC was considered to be physiologic in patients with normal findings at dedicated abdominal CT or MR and lack of neoplastic lesions in clinical follow-ups. The intensity of uncinate process uptake was compared to the uptake of the normal liver.Focal uptake was attributed to the presence of pancreatic NET in 5 patients. Among the 36 patients without any evidence of malignancy in CT, MR and follow-up, 7 (19.4 %) showed increased uptake in the uncinate process. The intensity of uptake was lesser in 3 (8.3 %), similar in 3 and greater than the normal liver in 1 (2.8 %) case.Increased 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC uptake occurred in 19.4 % of those subjects without any evidence of neuroendocrine tumor in the uncinate process.
