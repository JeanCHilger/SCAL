Diagnosis of disorders affecting the solid organs of the supra-mesocolic compartment. Sonographic and computed tomographic (CT) examinations have modified the investigation of hepatic, splenic and pancreatic tumors. Because of advances in non-invasive diagnostic procedures, these different benign or malignant tumors are now more frequently detected and surgically treated. However, for these different lesions sonography is the gold standard imaging technique. The different indications for CT and magnetic resonance imaging are discussed for each tumor. For the diagnostic imaging of an acutely injured patient, sonography remains the useful examination in emergencies. The indications for CT scans are limited to the difficulties of sonographic diagnosis in stable trauma patients.
