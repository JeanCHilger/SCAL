Sonography in acute pancreatitis--diagnosis, assessment of etiology and evaluating prognosis. Fifty consecutive patients suffering from acute pancreatitis were studied prospectively with regard to the role of ultrasound (US) in diagnosis, in detection of a biliary origin, and in initial assessment of prognosis. In six patients the pancreas could not be visualised, whereas in 19 only partial examination was possible. In 34% no diagnostic abnormalities were found. US was superior to computed tomography (CT) in respect to the detection of small amounts of ascites, but less suitable than CT for the detection of necrosis. Compared to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography US was of little help in detecting bile duct stones. Neither a lethal outcome nor a severe course could be predicted with sufficient accuracy. The positive predictive value for the presence of necrosis was 33% and the negative predictive value 67%. The data demonstrate a limited role of US in diagnosis and staging in acute pancreatitis.
