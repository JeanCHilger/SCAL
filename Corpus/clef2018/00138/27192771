Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the required minimum in the diagnosis of abdominal and retroperitoneal space-occupying lesions. to determine the advantages of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) over contrast-free studies in the differential diagnosis of hepatic, renal, and pancreatic space-occupying lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A team of experienced radiologists retrospectively used CT data of patients with different space-occupying lesions of the abdomen and retroperitoneal space (liver, kidney, and pancreas).The diagnostic value of CT of the liver, kidney, and pancreas substantially decreases without using radiopaque contrast agents at the same time not only the differential diagnosis, but also visualization of some neoplasms are frequently impossible.The potential benefit of contrast-enhanced CT virtually always outweighs the risks associated with the injection of a contrast agent.
