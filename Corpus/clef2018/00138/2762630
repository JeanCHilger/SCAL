Acute pancreatitis: an infrequent complication of cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis). We comment the case of a 25-year-old woman, diagnosed since the age of 7 as cystic fibrosis, who presented acute pancreatitis, an exceptional complication of the underlying disease. In the ultrasonographic exploration and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was appreciated dilation of the pancreatic ducts, with mobile echoes and filling defects, respectively, compatible with mucus plugs. The etiopathogenesis of this type of acute pancreatitis and the procedure for reaching an etiological diagnosis are discussed. Although the patient presented moderate grade pancreatic failure, there is presently no agreement as to whether pancreatitis secondary to cystic fibrosis can be considered as chronic pancreatitis.
