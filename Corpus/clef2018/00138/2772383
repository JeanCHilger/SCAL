Computerized tomography findings in annular pancreas in an adult. We present a case of annular pancreas in an adult female studied by computerized tomography. CT demonstrated an enlarged pancreatic head in the center of which was visualized the contrast-filled duodenal lumen. We consider these findings to be sufficiently characteristic of annular pancreas to permit differential diagnosis with neoplastic processes of the pancreatic head without having to resort to more invasive diagnostic methods like endoscopic retrograde cholangiography.
