Therapeutic concepts and demands on radiology from the surgical viewpoint in liver and pancreatic tumors. The aim of modern diagnostic procedures in hepato-biliary and pancreatic tumours is the characterization of origin, type and resectability of a lesion and the staging of the tumour. Furthermore, preoperative diagnostic methods should reduce the operative risk by demonstration of anatomical variations i.e. hepatic blood supply. In addition alternative therapeutic concepts like chemoembolization should be kept in mind. A diagnostic procedure in liver and pancreas tumours is demonstrated following aspects of economical and surgical requirements.
