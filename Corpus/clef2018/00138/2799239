Costs in the hospital (in the diagnosis of liver and pancreatic tumors using imaging procedures). The proportion of inpatients with tumours of the liver and pancreas is rather small, being only 0.25% of all the patients. Nevertheless, imaging methods may still be employed to an extent that is out of proportion to the small number of such patients. Although it is not possible at present to assess the cost arising from using the imaging methods for the diagnosis of these particular patients, an analysis of the performance data stated in the annual balance sheets of hospitals definitely shows an upward trend in respect of the use of imaging methods in diagnostic procedures in general. Despite the reductions in individual methods, such as, for example, roentgenoscopic screening or fluoroscopy, there are disproportionate increases in the total number of x-rayed patients while at the same time other imaging methods such as sonography, computed tomography and endoscopy show steep increases. It can be assumed that this applies likewise to patients with tumours of the liver and pancreas. Side by side with the tendency to extend the spectrum of use there is also an individual cost increase per case. Whereas the total cost for all Hamburg hospitals increased by 5.2% between 1985 and 1986, cost of materials and equipment rose by 6.8% and specifically in the x-ray sector by 10.2%. Seen from this point of view, the x-ray sector has become a growing cost factor. Of course that does not mean that the multitude of procedures to which the patient is subjected is always meaningful and mandatory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
