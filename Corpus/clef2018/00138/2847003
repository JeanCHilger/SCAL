Diagnostic value of computed tomography for the detection of invasion of the caudate bile duct branch in carcinoma of the hepatic hilum. The visualization of the caudate bile duct branch (B1) in computed tomography (CT-scan) with a high dose of contrast medium was evaluated in 71 patients with carcinoma of the liver, biliary tract and pancreas, preoperatively. The patients were classified into four groups: Group A, 22 patients (twelve hepatomas, six gall bladder cancers and four cancers of the pancreas body or tail) without abnormal findings in the biliary tract Group B, two patients (cancer of the pancreas head and the common bile duct) with obstructive jaundice whose CT-scans were taken before percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage (PTCD)
