Clinical assessment of the complex diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound examination, X-ray computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography and angiography offer an effective means for pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Precise topic diagnosis and extent of tumor lesion cannot be established by application of either method. Preoperative diagnosis can be improved and lesion extent assessed by the complex use of said procedures. Complex examination saves time and allows the choice of a rational treatment modality.
