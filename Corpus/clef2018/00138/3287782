Value of computerized tomography and ultrasonic diagnosis in acute pancreatitis. While the diagnosis of the acute pancreatitis is now as ever made clinically, the significance of ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) lies above all in the demonstration of morphologic changes and their extent. When the statements of the ultrasonic diagnosis are sufficient in easy stages of the acute pancreatitis and for the recognition of a more severe stage as well as for the control of the course, an evident assessment of the haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis, in particular before operation, is possible only with the help of the CT. Only with its help we succeed in a comprehensive demonstration of the necroses, formations of abscesses, haemorrhages as well as of the ways of necrosis. The better availability and the riskless possibility of carrying out the ultrasonic diagnosis with altogether high evidence allow a narrow-meshed control of the course of the acute pancreatitis.
