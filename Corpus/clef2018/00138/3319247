Pancreatitis and choledochal cyst. A six years old girl was rushed to hospital with an acute abdomen. Because of the age of the patient, the clinical examination and the usual biology we diagnose an acute appendicitis. The fortuitous measuring out of the pancreatic enzymology allows us to correct our first diagnostic into the one of pancreatitis with angiocholitis. The check-up shows a congenital choledochal cyst with an abnormality of the choledochus-Wirsung junction explaining the physiological pathology presented. The surgical operation was made up of an cystectomy with cholecystectomy and hepatico-jejunostomy according to an Y shaped loop from Roux. Pancreatitis diagnostic is unusual in childhood, there is a good reason to suspect in those circumstances the existence of a choledochal cyst.
