The early diagnosis of splenic abscess. Five cases of splenic abscess seen between 1970 and 1984 are reviewed. The predisposing factors included preceding pyogenic infection, sickle cell disease, and contiguous disease in the pancreas. Abdominal pain and fever were the most frequent presenting symptoms. The most common physical finding was left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal tenderness. All patients were treated with splenectomy. In one patient percutaneous drainage was attempted prior to splenectomy but failed. The mortality rate was 20 per cent. Radiologic procedures developed in the last ten years make possible the early diagnosis and treatment of splenic abscess. The treatment of choice remains antibiotics followed by splenectomy.
