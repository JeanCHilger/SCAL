Correlation of abdominal CT imaging with autopsy findings in patients with malignant tumors. The value of abdominal computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing localized involvement of liver, pancreas, adrenals, and lymph nodes was evaluated in 117 patients with suspected or known malignant tumors by correlation with autopsy findings. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT for localized liver disease was calculated to be 80% (84%), 96% (97%), and 90% (92%) for pancreatic tumors: 81% (86%), 98% (100%), and 95% (97%)
