A case of spasmophilic syndrome. The case is described of a 43 year old woman with spasmophilic syndrome. For 12 years she had suffered from fainting fits, marked morning asthenia, anxiety, depression, widespread arthromyalgia, blood pressure fluctuations, precordial pains, paresthesia and painful nocturnal cramp. This clinical picture appeared in a subject with a double left kidney and stones in the supernumerary ureter, enlargement of the pancreatic head and tail revealed by a CAT scan and an earlier cholecystectomy. Given the multiplicity of symptoms diagnosis was necessarily by a process of elimination. The data providing grounds for optimism were a positive Chvostek's sign, stable calcium phosphorus profiles, a reduction in ionised calcium and favourable eletromyographic readings.
