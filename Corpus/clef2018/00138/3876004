Transgastric drainage of pancreatic fluid collections. Eight pancreatic fluid collections in seven patients were successfully drained percutaneously through a transgastric approach. The drainage catheters were left in place for 3-6 weeks to promote the formation of a fistulous tract between the stomach and the pancreatic collection. Computed tomography (CT) was used for diagnosis and for planning of the access route. Combined sonography and fluoroscopy were used for guidance. Radiologic follow-up examinations (CT and sinograms) have shown no recurrences (3-12 months). No complications were encountered.
