Ultrasonic diagnosis of renal lymphoma in children. A series of 18 cases. Ultrasound tomography imaging is a very effective diagnostic examination for lymphoma of the kidneys, organs which are frequently the site of these tumors (51,5% of cases). A total of 18 cases of renal lymphoma explored by ultrasound tomography over the last 2 years were reviewed, the first patients seen in this series also undergoing intravenous urography and two others a CT scan. In most cases diagnosis from ultrasound imaging was based on findings typical of renal lymphoma and on the almost constant detection of other parenchymatous localizations (liver, spleen, pancreas) or lymph node and/or serous lesions. Tumors were bilateral in 13 cases and unilateral in 5. Ultrasound images showed: a) nephromegaly that was usually bilateral (9 cases) or sometimes unilateral (2 cases), while the kidney or kidneys were of normal size in 4 patients b) the almost constant presence of hypoechogenic nodules scattered throughout the kidney or kidneys (16 cases)
