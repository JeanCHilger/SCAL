Endoscopic ultrasonography: a preliminary report. In order to define normal endoscopic ultrasonographic anatomy with particular emphasis on the pancreas, we studied 25 patients using a prototype ultrasound fiberoptic endoscope (model GF-UM1) and endoscopic ultrasound observation unit (model EU-M1) developed by the Olympus Corporation. We obtained a number of good quality scans of various retroperitoneal structures, and in several cases pancreatic texture and even the pancreatic duct could be appreciated. Differentiation of mucosal from intramural diseases of the hollow gut and from diseases of the retroperitoneal organs can be made by means of endoscopic ultrasonography.
