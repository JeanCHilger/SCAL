Ultrasonic methods in the differential diagnosis of the "postcholecystectomy syndrome" (author's transl). The "postcholecystectomy syndrome" as a collective term for all upper abdominal complaints following cholecystectomy is a common clinical picture. For the purpose of clarification the easily practicable sonography offers itself in addition to conventional cholangiography and to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP). By means of echography, pathological changes in the upper abdominal organs can be detected or excluded. Chronologically, echography should be carried out at the beginning of diagnosis as an informative, harmless and rapid method. The most invasive investigations can then be omitted or performed specifically as required.
