Retrospective comparison of radionuclide scans and computed tomography of the liver and pancreas. Computed tomography (CT) and radionuclide examinations of the liver and pancreas in 50 patients were compared retrospectively to evaluate their value as diagnostic tests. CT was superior to 75Se-selenomethionine in evaluating pancreatic disease. Both 99mTc-sulfur colloid scans and CT scans were sensitive detectors of liver masses however, there were more false positive 99mTc-sulfur colloid scans (16% compared to 4%). CT was superior in detecting biliary obstruction and ascites, in assessing diseases that involved the liver extrinsically, and in evaluating the status of adjacent organs. 99mTc-sulfur colloid scans were more sensitive in detection of diffuse non-neoplastic liver diseases (cirrhosis, hepatitis, and cholangitis). Simultaneous interpretation of CT and radionuclide scans was often more helpful than independent interpretation, and the two techniques are therefore complementary.
