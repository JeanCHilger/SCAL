CT of pancreatic islet cell tumors. In 41 patients with clinical evidence of pancreatic islet cell tumors, CT detected 21 of 27 tumors that were proved at surgery (sensitivity 78%) and correctly excluded the diagnosis in 14 of 14 patients with no evidence of tumor at long-term follow-up. Using rapid sequence CT scanning and bolus contrast material infusion, a vascular blush was identified in 13 of 16 tumors (81%). Tumors as small as 0.9 cm were localized. CT identified all malignant tumors, and staging accuracy was 100%. CT is useful as the initial imaging procedure for the diagnosis and staging of suspected islet cell tumors. Pancreatic venous sampling and angiography are complementary to CT for the detection of smaller lesions.
