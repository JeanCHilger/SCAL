Management of pancreatic pseudocysts. Fifty-five patients with pancreatic pseudocysts were evaluated over a ten year period and most of these cysts were diagnosed over the last five years with the aid of CT scans, ultrasound and ERCP. Among 39 patients who underwent surgical treatment, ultrasound was correct in 17 of 20 (10 per cent) and falsely positive in one patient out of 20 patients (5 per cent). The CT scan was correct in 12 of 13 patients (92 per cent) and falsely positive in one patient out of 13 patients (8 per cent). ERCP was correct in ten of 12 patients (83 per cent) with one false-negative (8 per cent) and one indeterminate (8 per cent) result. The mortality for 39 surgical patients was 21 per cent and most deaths were because of sepsis. Among 15 patients who did not undergo operative treatment, five had pseudocysts greater than 4 centimeters in diameter and only one patient had clinical regression of the pseudocyst. Ten of the 15 patients had pseudocysts less than 4 centimeters and nine of these patients had clinical regression of the pseudocysts. The results of the data suggest that pseudocysts 4 centimeter in size or smaller may be safely observed by serial CT examination or ultrasound.
