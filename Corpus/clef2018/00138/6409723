Value of hypotonic duodenography in pancreatic diagnosis. Comparison with computer-tomographic findings. 61 patients with suggested pancreatic disease were examined by Hypotonic Duodenography (HD) and Computed Tomography (CT). After all examinations had been carried out, 45 patients were found to have an abnormal pancreas, and 16 patients had a normal pancreas. HD had a sensitivity of 60%, and a specificity of 94%, whereas CT had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 100%. - HD is more sensitive than CT in detecting lesions originating from pancreatico-duodenal structures. In patients with uncertain clinical symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract HD is still a valuable basic examination. Only in patients with strongly suspected pancreatic carcinoma radiologic examination should start with CT because CT is more sensitive in detecting a pancreatic lesion and is helpful in assessing its extension and defining its etiology.
