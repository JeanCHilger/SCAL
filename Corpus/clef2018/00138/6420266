Comparison of computed tomography, automated multisector scanner (Octoson) and conventional ultrasound in pancreatic diseases. Two hundred and eighty-six patients suspected of having pancreatic disease were examined by computed tomography, Octoson and conventional ultrasound. Computed tomography with angio-CT had the highest sensitivity (87.4%). The Octoson, with a sensitivity of 77.16% was better than conventional ultrasound, which had a sensitivity of 65.35%. Specificity for CT was 91.2%, for the Octoson 88.67% and conventional ultrasound 85.5%. The better results of the Octoson examination are due to the thin air gap when the patient is prone and the greater focal length of the large transducer and the somewhat more stable focus.
