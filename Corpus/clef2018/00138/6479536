Role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis and treatment of choledochocele. Choledochocele is a rare abnormality involving the intramural segment of the common bile duct. It may present clinically as recurrent acute pancreatitis, biliary colic, or cholestatic jaundice. A choledochocele may be easily overlooked by the conventional diagnostic methods, such as upper gastrointestinal series, intravenous cholangiogram, abdominal ultrasound, and computed tomography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is helpful in demonstrating a choledochocele. Additionally, in selected cases, a choledochocele may be effectively managed by endoscopic sphincterotomy. We present the clinical, endoscopic, and radiographic findings in a series of 8 patients with choledochocele. The radiologic technique most useful in demonstrating a choledochocele at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is detailed. The pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, and relevant current literature pertaining to choledochocele are discussed.
