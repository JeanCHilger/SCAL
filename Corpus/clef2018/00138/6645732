Application possibilities of intraoperative sonography. Preoperative ultrasound, CT-scanning, arteriography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography have improved the diagnostic approach to abdominal and vascular diseases. The correlation between preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings sometimes is difficult. In these cases intraoperative ultrasound can be helpful. The application of B-Scan-Realtime-Ultrasonography during surgery will give additional information on vascular diseases, control of vascular anastomoses, on intraoperative flow-measurement, localization of tumors in the liver and pancreas and on defining margins of resection. Intraoperative sonography is a new device for the surgeon, which should be used to control the site of abdominal tumors as well as vascular anastomoses.
