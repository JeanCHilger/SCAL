Gastric adenocarcinoma: a comparison of the accuracy and economics of staging by computed tomography and surgery. We studied a series of 22 patient with proven gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent upper gastrointestinal radiography, computed tomography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and/or surgical exploration and resection. Based on the computed tomographic findings, gastric carcinoma was classified into one of four stages: stage 1, intraluminal masses without gastric wall thickening stage 2, gastric wall thickening (> 1 cm) and exophytic masses
