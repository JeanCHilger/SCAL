Cholestasis due to compression of the common bile duct by pancreatic pseudocysts. We studied 10 patients with pancreatitis who had persistent cholestasis secondary to compression of the common bile duct by a pancreatic pseudocyst. Elevation of the serum bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase levels, or both, (sensitive indicators of cholestasis) was present in each of our patients. The diagnosis of a pancreatic pseudocyst is best made by CAT scan and ultrasonography. These techniques will delineate the small intrapancreatic pseudocyst that otherwise may be difficult to recognize on inspection at operation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and pancreatography are desirable because they delineate the anatomic alterations of the pancreatic and common bile ducts and may contribute information pertaining to the possibility of common duct obstruction by pancreatic fibrosis. In our opinion, cholestasis secondary to bile duct compression by a pseudocyst is an indication for operation. Each of our 10 patients had drainage of their pseudocysts. Cystoduodenostomy, performed in seven patients, was the method most commonly used. If there is concern regarding the patency of the common duct after drainage of the cyst, intraoperative cholangiography should be performed. This was carried out in three patients. In each patient, the preoperative elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin levels returned to normal limits after operative decompression of a pancreatic pseudocyst alone without an accompanying or subsequent bilioenteric bypass being required.
