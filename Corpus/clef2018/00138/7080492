Mediastinitis and bilateral pleural effusion of pancreatic origin (author's transl). A case report is presented of a patient admitted to a thoracic specialist unit on account of predominantly pulmonary symptomatology. There was a left-sided haemorrhagic pulmonary effusion, which rapidly returned after tapping. The patient then developed a high fever and shock. Mediastinal widening was noted on X-ray, as well as a right-sided pleural effusion. Repeated tapping of the pleural effusions and drainage of a mediastinal abscess, which was diagnosed on mediastinoscopy as well as the administration of antibiotics led to an improvement in the patient's previously poor general condition. Sonography and subsequent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography were instrumental in eventually diagnosing chronic recurrent pancreatitis with cyst formation and retroperitoneal perforation into the mediastinum and pleural space. Laparotomy with removal of the pancreatic cysts and abdominal drainage led to complete recovery. The pathogenetic processes involved in the formation of internal fistulae, diagnostic problems and therapeutic management are discussed.
