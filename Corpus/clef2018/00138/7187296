Value of sonography in the control of pancreatic cancer. In 152 examinations, sonography was found to be a reliable screening method in the follow-up of curative and palliative surgery of carcinoma of the pancreas. By the effected changeover from compound scanning to the high-resolution real-time B-process, it has become possible to recognize at an early date even small locoregional recurring tumours (1.5 cm diameter), metastases of lymph nodes (1-1.5 cm diameter) and hepatic filiae (1.0 cm diameter) it has also been possible to detect typical changes, such as stenoses or thromboses, at the major vessels of the upper abdomen, well in time. If the findings are not clear, CT examination will be mandatory, if necessary in conjunction with bolus injection of a contrast medium. These methods have been able to largely replace the well-known invasive procedures, such as ERCP, angiography and laparoscopy in follow-up controls.
