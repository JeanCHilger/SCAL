Pancreatoduodenal resection for carcinoid of Vater's papilla. Papilla Vateri carcinoid is among the very rarely occurring locations of the lesion. The small lumen of the papilla is the underlying cause of becoming clinically manifest with icterus rather early. Accessibility of the process for endoscopic biopsy facilitates the diagnosis. Even histologically it is very difficult to differentiate benign from malignantly altered carcinoids. Only the existence of metastases confirm with certainty their malignant nature. An observation on papilla Vateri carcinoid in a 60-year-old woman, proved preoperatively through cytological study, is reported. Intraoperative--no metastases are discovered. Sparing pancreatoduodenal resection is performed with a good functional outcome, recorded at the checkup examination after two years.
