Endoscopic US of the gastrointestinal tract with endoscopic, radiographic, and pathologic correlation. Endoscopic ultrasonography (US) makes it possible to evaluate the layers of the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as surrounding structures. The authors have used endoscopic US to evaluate the gastrointestinal tract in 160 patients. In the esophagus, endoscopic US is useful in staging esophageal carcinoma, planning radiation therapy ports, and locating and characterizing esophageal masses. Endoscopic US of the esophagus is also used to identify varices and evaluate the results of therapy. Applications of endoscopic US in the stomach include staging of gastric carcinoma, localization and characterization of nonmucosal gastric masses, detection and evaluation of gastric varices, and evaluation of gastric lymphoma. In the pancreas, endoscopic US is used for detecting pancreatic masses staging pancreatic, distal common bile duct, and ampullary carcinoma
