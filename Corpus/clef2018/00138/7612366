Extrahepatic cholestasis: the echographic and CT findings. One hundred and fifty patients with jaundice and analytical suspicion of extrahepatic cholestasis were studied prospectively history laboratory investigation and ultrasound examination were done in all. Computerized tomography was performed in 46 patients. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 92.6% while that of computerized tomography was 87.2% for the identification of dilated biliary ducts. Computerized tomography demonstrated the level of obstruction with a sensitivity of 89.1%, being most useful at the suprapancreatic and ampullary levels, while ultrasound examination had a sensitivity of 80%. The accuracy of ultrasonography was higher than the one obtained in computerized tomography in cholangiocarcinoma (sensitivity: 77%) and gallbladder carcinoma (sensitivity: 100%). Computerized tomography recognized choledocholithiasis (sensitivity: 83%) and ampullary carcinoma (sensitivity: 75%) with better accuracy. However for pancreatic carcinoma (sensitivity: 87%) and pancreatitis (sensitivity: 88%) both examinations had the same accuracy.
