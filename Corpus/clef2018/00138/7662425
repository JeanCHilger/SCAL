True pancreatic cysts in adults. True or congenital cysts of the pancreas in adults are extremely rare entities. We describe two cases of true cysts located in the head of the pancreas, which presented with symptoms of epigastric pain, palpable mass and jaundice. CT scan was useful to demonstrate the location and extent of the lesion and its relation with neighbouring structures, but failed to determine the nature of the cyst. Diagnosis was obtained by the histological study of the cystic wall at surgery.
