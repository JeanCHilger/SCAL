Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of pancreatic disease. Significant technical advances have occurred in both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that have resulted in improved visualization of the pancreas by both techniques. In this article we will consider the advances in both modalities and consider the relative roles of each in imaging the spectrum of pancreatic pathology.
