Receptor scintigraphy using 111In-pentetreotide in endocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Receptor scintigraphy with 111In-pentetreotide is a complementary imaging technique with a sensitivity of 88% for the localization of the primary tumor and its metastases in patients presenting with the clinical and biochemical symptoms of an endocrine tumor of the gastrointestinal tract or the pancreas. As a whole-body scintigraphic technique it covers all body regions and is also able to reveal small tumors which can only be detected with difficulty or not at all by the usual imaging methods. In 104 patients with GEP tumors or after operative removal of such tumors, receptor scintigraphy proved to be superior to ultrasound and computed tomography in 34%, equal in 52% and inferior in 14% of the cases.
