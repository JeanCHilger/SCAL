Treatment of malignant occlusions of bile ducts by one-step technique using metallic endoprostheses. A multicenter study of 50 cases. Long-term patency and ease of insertion of self-expandable metallic stents seem to overcome the disadvantages of plastic stents, changing the therapeutic approach to unresectable biliary tree malignancies. Their high cost is the main problem of metallic stents and reducing hospitalization time is a real opportunity to overcome this problem. Self-expandable stents could be the turning point to reduce overall costs. Fifty patients with malignant biliary tree obstruction (Zubrod performance status < 3) were treated with percutaneous placement of 58 Wallstent endoprostheses by the one-step technique. All patients had undergone thorough diagnostic exams - i.e., US, CT, PTC, ERCP with biopsy or brushing. Two major complications occurred in this series: a iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm requiring selective catheterization and embolization with Gianturco coils and a hepatic abscess six months after stent placement. Late stent occlusion occurred in six patients (12%) and was resolved by balloon dilatations. All patients were followed-up with clinical examinations, US and laboratory tests until death median survival after stent placement was 122 days (range: 70 to 510 days). Average hospitalization time was 7 days with an acceptable cost reduction.
