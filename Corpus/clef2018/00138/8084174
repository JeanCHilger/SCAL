Invasive interventions with computerized tomography guidance. Invasive interventions (diagnostic and therapeutic) were conducted on 125 patients. Fifty-six has diseases of the lungs, 16 of the mediastinum, 4 of the pleura, 17 of the liver, 2 of the pancreas, one of the spleen, 15 of the kidneys, 7 of the retroperineal space, two of the soft tissues, and 5 patients had diseases of the skeletal bones. Biopsy was combined with aspiration of the renal cyst content in 7 cases. The diagnostic value of biopsy under control of CT was 86% (106 cases) negative and pseudonegative results were recorded in 18 (14%) patients. The efficacy of biopsy is determined by such factors as the size of the lesion and the depth of its localization in the involved organ, the character of the pathological process and the region of its localization, the site from which the material is collected, and the needles used. Among 7 patients with therapeutic interventions, 5 had good and 2 had satisfactory immediate results. Complications were revealed in 4 (3.3%) patients, pneumothorax was encountered most frequently.
