Fat-suppressed MR imaging sequences in the diagnosis of liver and pancreatic neoplasms at 1.5 tesla. We investigated 55 patients with suspected neoplasms of the liver and/or pancreas using fat-suppressed spin echo and gradient echo MR sequences. T1 and T2 weighted fat-suppressed spin echo sequences provided higher sensitivity for the detection of liver metastases. In the diagnosis of pancreatic tumours, T1 weighted fat-suppressed gradient echo sequences after application of intravenous and oral paramagnetic contrast agents offered more information than other sequences. Drawbacks of fat-suppressed sequences are an increase in scan time and inhomogeneous fat-suppression at the periphery of the image.
