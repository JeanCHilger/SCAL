MR imaging of the pancreas at 0.3 T using a super-paramagnetic oral contrast medium. Twenty patients with carcinoma of the pancreas identified with ultrasonography and/or CT and confirmed by histology, were examined with MR before and after administration of an oral super-paramagnetic contrast medium. Ten patients were examined after administration of the contrast medium through a duodenal tube. Ten patients drank the contrast medium mixed with a viscosity-increasing agent. Organ delineation and diagnostic information were improved in the postcontrast scans in both groups and the viscous contrast suspension yielded better delineation and diagnostic information than the aqueous suspension. The viscous contrast suspension also showed better tolerance, contrast distribution and less artifacts than the aqueous suspension.
