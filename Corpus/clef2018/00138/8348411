Pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting with ureteric metastases. Case report and review of literature. We report a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting with ureteric metastases. A low index of suspicion led to incomplete radiographic evaluation, and the etiology could not be established prior to laparotomy. The differential diagnosis of ureteric strictures is reviewed, with a view to providing a simple diagnostic flow chart that should prove satisfactory in all but the most exceptional cases.
