Use of the CA 19-9 tumor marker in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. The contribution of the tumor marker CA 19-9 to differential diagnosis between malignant and nonmalignant diseases of the pancreas was assessed in a group of 120 patients. On using border values of CA 19-9 80 U/ml, its sensitivity was found to be 84.4% and its specificity 84.8% for carcinomas of the pancreas. Correlation of CA 19-9 values with results of computer tomography and endogenous retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the patients studied yielded an over 80% accordance. In the light of the obtained results, the authors consider determination of CA 19-9 levels to be a suitable method supplementing the imaging examination methods in suspect carcinoma of the pancreas.
