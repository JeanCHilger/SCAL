Solitary true cyst of the pancreas in adults. Report of three cases and review of the literature. Solitary true cysts of the pancreas are extremely rare: to date, only eight cases have been reported in the English literature, four of which had clinical significance. An additional three cases of solitary true cysts of the pancreas are presented. One patient was incidentally found at operation, performed for other disease, to have a cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas the other two patients experienced abdominal pain and nausea. Abdominal US, CT, and MR showed a unilocular cyst in the body and tail of the pancreas. In both cases, preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasm was made. Two patients underwent excision of the mass and one distal pancreatectomy. Analysis of the cyst fluid revealed high CA 19-9 levels in two and CA 125 levels in one case. All cysts were lined by cuboidal epithelium, without morphological alterations. Preoperative differential diagnosis with the most common cystic pancreatic lesions (inflammatory or neoplastic) is difficult.
