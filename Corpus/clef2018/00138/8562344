Comparative study of CA242 and CA19-9 in chronic pancreatitis. CA242 has been proved to be useful in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanisms contributing to the high specificity of CA242 as compared with CA19-9 resulting from scarce serum elevation of this antigen in patients with chronic pancreatitis by correlating serum levels and endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreatography (ERCP) findings and by immunohistochemical analysis. Serum CA19-9 levels were significantly elevated in patients with calcification and with main pancreatic duct (MPD) stenosis or obstruction. On the other hand, serum CA242 levels showed no significant elevation in patients with such factors. Even though such pathological conditions were considered to lead to the stagnation of pancreatic juice, serum CA242 levels seemed to be less affected than serum CA19-9 levels. Immunohistochemical studies of chronic pancreatitis tissues revealed that CA242 was expressed less frequently and less intensely than CA19-9, and the difference in expression was more prominent in the centroacinar cells and terminal ductules. From the results of the present study, it is conceivable that CA242 is less influenced by the stagnation of the pancreatic juice than CA19-9 because of the low levels of expression in ductal systems, which results in the release of this antigen into the circulation in lower amounts than that of CA19-9.
