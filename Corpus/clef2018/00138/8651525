Urgent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography the stable trauma patient. Major ductal injury is a determinant of outcome after blunt pancreatic trauma. The retroperitoneal location makes physical examination and diagnostic peritoneal lavage unreliable, and computed tomography does not demonstrate ductal integrity. Urgent endoscopic retrograde pancreatography clearly delineates ductal anatomy, facilitating management of this potentially devastating injury.
