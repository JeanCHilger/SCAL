Assessment of pancreatic parenchymal invasion by bile duct cancer using intraductal ultrasonography. This study was performed to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) in assessing pancreatic parenchymal invasion by bile duct cancer.Preoperative assessment of pancreatic parenchymal invasion was carried out by IDUS via a percutaneous tract or a transpapillary route in 18 patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer. Various probes with diameters of 1.4, 2.0, 2.4, 2.6 and 3.2 mm, and frequencies of 7.5, 15, 20 and 30 MHz were used. All patients underwent angiography and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). In the first six cases, IDUS and EUS images were analyzed retrospectively without knowledge of the operative outcome or the results of other imaging tests. In the subsequent 12 cases, the IDUS und EUS images were prospectively reviewed prior to surgery. The diagnostic accuracy of IDUS was compared with angiography and EUS by means of a histopathological examination of the resected specimens.The accuracy of IDUS, EUS, and angiography in assessing pancreatic parenchymal invasion was 100%, 78% and 61%, respectively. However, IDUS could not assess pancreatic capsular invasion. The accuracy of IDUS in assessing horizontal tumor extension to the intrapancreatic bile duct and to the hepatic side was 83% and 72%, respectively.IDUS proved useful for assessing the extension of cancer invasion to the pancreatic parenchyma, but not to the pancreatic capsule or mucosal surface.
