Duodenal somatostatinoma associated with von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. This case report describes a 27-year-old man with von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis, manifested as cutaneous caf√® au lait spots and neurofibromas, associated with duodenal somatostatinoma. The patient presented with ultrasonographic evidence of dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, in absence of clinical symptoms. The reason for the performance of ultrasonography was to identify the cause of an increase of hepatic enzymes during the last two years. Diagnostic ERCP showed an ulcerated tumor in the papillary region and pathological findings were compatible with somatostatinoma. Endoscopic sphincterotomy with placement of endoprostheses was successful in achieving biliary and pancreatic drainage. Subsequently a curative resection of the tumor was performed by the Whipple procedure and provocative tests demonstrated normal plasma somatostatin concentrations.
