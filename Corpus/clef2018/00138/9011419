Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas. We report on three female patients with solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas. The histogenetic origin of this entity is still unclear. The tumor, usually occurring in young women, forms large masses (up to 10 cm in diameter) before becoming symptomatic. Metastases have very rarely been reported. In contrast to other pancreatic tumors, the main pancreatic duct was displaced, but of normal caliber without stenosis, in all our patients. Despite the large size of the tumors, they were curatively resected in all three cases. Two of the tumors infiltrated the parenchyma or adipose tissue of the pancreas but did not spread into the lymph nodes or other organs. All of the patients are alive and without signs of tumor recurrence up to 8 years after surgical resection.
