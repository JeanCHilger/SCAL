A case of afferent loop obstruction secondary to recurrent carcinoma of the stomach with ultrasound and C.T. scan findings. A case of afferent loop obstruction secondary to recurrent carcinoma of the stomach is reported. The patient presented in the early recurrence period with the clinical picture similar to that of pancreatic pseudocyst. This was the first reported case of afferent loop obstruction demonstrated by abdominal ultrasound and C.T. scan.
