A case report of pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma in a patient receiving chronic hemodialysis. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare, accounting for about 9 to 10% of cystic pancreatic lesions. A 63-year-old man, who had been receiving chronic hemodialysis due to diabetic chronic renal failure, was admitted after the discovery of cystic masses in the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed multiloculated cystic tumors. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated findings consistent with malignant tumors. Preoperatively, he was thought to have a cystadenocarcinoma in the pancreatic tail for which he underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Histologic analysis of the resected mass established the diagnosis mucinous cystadenoma. To our knowledge, pancreatic mucinous cystadenoma occurring in a patient receiving chronic hemodialysis has not been previously reported. Therefore, we present a novel case in this report.
