CT-guided core needle biopsy of abdominal, pelvic and retroperitoneal masses. CT-guided core needle biopsy of abdominal, pelvic and retroperitoneal masses is accurate and safe and can be performed on an outpatient basis. Between 1987 and 1995, 809 patients (age range 1-87 years) underwent 851 biopsies (minimal lesion diameter 1 cm). Cutting needles were always used, facilitating both cytological and histological diagnosis while minimizing risk of complications. A positive result (malignant, inflammatory or infectious) was obtained in 69% of the 809 and a negative result (normal tissue) in 17.4%, while in 13.6%, material for diagnosis was insufficient. Biopsy was repeated in 42 of them in whom radiological or clinical suspicion of malignancy was high. In 24 (60%) a positive result was obtained after the second biopsy. Significant complications occurred in 7 (0.8%). 1 hemo-rrhaged following liver biopsy and required blood transfusion. Pancreatitis occurred in 6 (2.6%) following pancreatic biopsy. An intraabdominal fluid collection in 1 necessitated percutaneous drainage. There was no mortality following the procedure and no documented case of needle-tract seeding of tumor. All outpatients were discharged within 3 hours of completion of the biopsy, without ill effects.
