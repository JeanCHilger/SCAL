Diffuse bronchiolo-alveolar cell carcinoma that produced both amylase and CA19-9. A 68-year-old man who worked as an editor was admitted to Aichi Medical University Hospital due to dyspnea on exertion and emaciation. The patient had noticed rapid weight loss during diet therapy for diabetes mellitus that started in the beginning of July, 1993. Laboratory examinations revealed elevated levels of LDH and amylase in serum. Ultrasonography disclosed minimal ascites. Dyspnea on exertion developed in September, 1993. Chest roentgenography showed diffuse bilateral small nodular or reticular opacities. CT-guided percutaneous needle aspiration was done and cytologic examination of a specimen of lung tissue revealed papillary adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis was bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. Serum levels of amylase were elevated. The amylase isozyme pattern was of the salivary type. Serum levels of CA19-9 and CEA were also elevated. The patient died of respiratory failure on December 4, 1993. Postmortem examination revealed diffuse small nodules in both lungs. Examination of the nodules showed bronchiolo-alveolar cell carcinoma. The tumor cells stained positively for amylase (salivary type, not pancreatic type) CA19-9, and CEA by the avidin biotin complex method, but they were immunohistologically negative for AFP. We conclude that this lung cancer produced amylase, CA19-9, and CEA. We know of only a few reports of cases in which lung cancer produced both amylase and CA19-9.
