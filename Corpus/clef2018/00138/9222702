Chronic calcifying pancreatitis in Taiwan: a multicentric study and comparison with western countries. This study investigates the clinical features of chronic calcifying pancreatitis (CCP) in Taiwan and also the comparative differences in the disorder as it affects orientals and occidentals.Medical records at seven tertiary hospitals relating to patients diagnosed with CCP between 1976 and 1996 are reviewed and analyzed. Ninety patients were enrolled. Defining the calcification of the pancreas is achieved by plain film, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or histology.CCP afflicts men more frequently than it does women, by a ratio of 3.5:1 (70 men and 20 women). The mean age is 45 years (male: 46 female: 41.4). For fifty-two patients (57.8%), alcohol is the major cause of the condition, while in others, the causes are non-alcoholic (idiopathic: 31 biliary: 4The clinical features of CCP in Taiwan are notably similar to those manifesting in western countries and in Japan. With the changes in life style and increased alcoholic consumption in Taiwan, the prevalence of CCP may increase and its demographic features may alter in the future.
