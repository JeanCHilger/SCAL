Blunt pancreatic trauma. Role of CT. To define the evolution patterns of blunt pancreatic trauma, and to point out the CT features most significant for the diagnosis.Ten cases of pancreatic trauma, observed over a period of about 10 years, were analyzed in retrospect. The cases were divided into 3 groups according to the time that had elapsed between trauma and first CT: early phase (within 72 h: n=3/10) late phase (after 10 days: n=3/10)In the early phase, one case showed a blood collection surrounding the pancreatic head and duodenum, and displacing the mesenteric vessels to the left. In the 2 other cases it was possible to demonstrate a tear in the pancreas at the neck, perpendicular to the main pancreatic axis. In the late phase in all 3 cases, one cystic lesion was present at the site of the tear, either surrounding the gland or embedded - more or less deeply - within the parenchyma. One of the lesions subsided spontaneously the 2 others required surgery. In the postoperative phase, an external fistula was demonstrated in 2 cases following percutaneous drainage of pancreatic cystsEarly demonstration of a parenchymal tear was difficult. At a later stage the diagnosis was easier owing to the demonstration of cystic lesions within the parenchyma at the site of the tear. The surgical drainage of this lesion does not usually lead to healing since an external fistula or a pseudocyst may develop.
