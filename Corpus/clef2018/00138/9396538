Pancreatoblastoma. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare pancreatic tumor with distinct acinar and squamoid cell differentiation that generally affects infants and young children. Just over 50 cases have been reported in the literature.Five cases of pathologically proven pancreatoblastoma treated at Seoul National University Hospital from 1984 to 1994 were reviewed. There were three girls and two boys who were 2 years to 5 years of age. All cases came to medical attention because of an abdominal mass.Abdominal pain was observed in one case and anorexia, vomiting, and weight loss in one case. There was marked elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (27,000 ng/mL) in one case of liver metastases. Complete excision was performed in two cases in which the tumors were located in the tail of the pancreas. Partial excision was performed in two patients who had unresectable tumors of the head of the pancreas. One patient had an unresectable tumor at diagnosis and needle aspiration biopsy was carried out under ultrasound guidance. Electron microscopy was performed on pathological specimens of three cases and showed zymogen granules but not neuroendocrine granules. Immunocytochemical studies for alpha-fetoprotein, insulin, glucagon and somatostatin were performed in one patient, and results were all negative. Of two patients who underwent complete excision, one patient presented with liver metastases 4 months after operation and received chemotherapy, but died of tumor 6 months after operation. The other patient had local recurrence 1 year after operation. Reoperation and chemotherapy were performed, and the child is now alive without evidence of disease for 32 months. All three patients who had unresectable tumor died of tumor despite adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.The authors emphasize that the diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma in childhood should be suspected with palpation of an abdominal mass, and the chance for cure may be determined by complete excision of the tumor.
