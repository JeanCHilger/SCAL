The effect of new diagnostic and treatment methods on the course and prognosis of pancreatic pseudocysts. We performed a retrospective analysis of 672 patients treated because of acute pancreatitis (AP) in the years 1962-1996. In 95 of them (14%) pancreatic pseudocysts (PP) were diagnosed. Two patient groups were compared: Ist (1962-1985), which consisted of 320 patients with acute pancreatitis, including 20 PP with IInd (1986-1996), comprising 322 patients with AP, including 75 PP. Pancreatic pseudocysts are diagnosed much more frequently nowadays (6-23%), especially in men with AP of alcohol etiology. Ultrasound CAT guided percutaneous drainage of PP proved to be an effective method of treatment in 64% of patients. Indications and complications of this method were discussed. Thirty-three patients underwent primary operative treatment. The indications were complications of PP and pathologic ER CP findings in pancreatic ducts. Secondary operative treatment was indicated in patients, where percutaneous procedure failed. Pancreatic pseudocysts produce complications much less frequently and the death rate decreased from initial 35 to 5% nowadays. It is mainly due to early diagnosis, monitoring and treatment after introduction of ultrasound and CAT.
