Endoscopic ultrasonography in the preoperative localization of a pancreatic tumor producing insulin (insulinoma). Pancreatic endocrine tumors include insulinomas, gastrinomas and some other less frequent neoplasms produce different GI hormones. Preoperative localization of the tumor in patients with evident clinical and biochemical features is usually difficult to obtain in conventional imaging methods. This is due to typically small size of these tumors. Non-invasive methods (conventional ultrasound, computerized tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, positron emission tomography) and invasive methods (visceral angiography, portal veins catheterization) are often of no use in such condition, as their sensitivity is low. Preoperative localization is of importance for the surgeon, as he can plan his operation for reducing the length of the procedure with obvious consequences. This paper describes for the first time on Polish literature the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography in preoperative assessment of insulinoma in one patient. This finding was confirmed during surgery. The operation led to enucleation of two small insulinomas in the head of the pancreas and resulting in complete healing of the patient as found in one year follow up.
