Abdominal fluid collection secondary to acute pancreatitis: treated with percutaneous catheter drainage. Complicated pancreatic inflammatory diseases are often life-threatening, multifocal, and multibacterial disorders. Untreated, these lesions often prove fatal. The purpose of the study is to describe interventional radiologic techniques for diagnosis and treatment of complicated peripancreatic fluid collections.Between January 1994 and December 1995, 17 patients with abdominal fluid collection from complicated acute pancreatitis underwent percutaneous drainage following initial diagnosis with computed tomography (CT). These patients required multiple CT examinations, multiple catheter insertions, multiple catheter manipulations, and long-term catheter drainage.Twenty-five infected fluid collections among these 17 patients were percutaneously drained. Sixteen (94%) patients were successfully treated with catheter drainage alone. Surgical treatment was necessary in one patient because of segmental stricture of transverse colon caused by inflammation and adhesion of transverse mesocolon. Catheter drainage duration averaged 31 days. Patients required an average of three catheter manipulations and four abdominal CT scans. Mean hospital stay was 42 days (range, 11-95 days), and mean ICU stay was 25 days (range, 1-70 days).The study confirms that complicated peripancreatic fluid collections can be safely and effectively treated in most patients with percutaneous catheter technique.
