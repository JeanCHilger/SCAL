MR cholangiopancreatography: technique, indications and clinical results. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new noninvasive imaging technique for the study of biliopancreatic disorders, providing projectional images of the biliary tree and pancreatic duct without any contrast agent.We used different sequences, with both breath-hold and nonbreath-hold techniques, to acquire MRCP images, first based on GE and then on FSE sequences. FSE images provide higher SNR and are less susceptible to artifacts (metal objects, motion and blood flow artifacts). At the Department of Radiology of the University of Rome La Sapienza, we acquired MRCP images with non breath-hold, 3D fat-suppressed TSE sequences (TR = 3000-2000, TE 700, turbo factor 128) optimized on a .5T magnet with 15 mT/m gradients. No patient preparation or sedation was required, although antiperistaltic drugs and oral administration of tap water were preferred. Four hundred and thirty patients were examined, all of them with an indication to conventional cholangiography.MRCP depicted the whole common bile duct and the first-order intrahepatic branches in all the normal cases. Its accuracy in identifying biliary obstruction level and site was 100%, versus 94.6% in characterizing its cause. MRCP had 96.3% diagnostic accuracy in choledocholithiasis, with some false positives and false negatives caused by: 1) small stones missed on MIP reconstructions 2) signal loss due to complete CBD obstruction by stonesMRCP combined with conventional MRI can completely replace CT and ERCP in bilio-pancreatic disorders.
