Value of dual-phase-helical CT in the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer--a prospective study. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of dual phase helical CT in suspected pancreatic cancer.Within one year 136 patients underwent helical CT with arterial and portal venous scans after bolus tracking and NaCl bolus injection. Evidence of pancreatic cancer and assessment of resectability were recorded using a standardised protocol. Suspected benign disease was verified by follow-up examination and clinical data, suspected malignant disease was correlated with biopsy or surgery.For the detection of tumor the overall concordance was 92%, the sensitivity 98% and the specificity 70% (6 false positive, 1 false negative). Resectability was correctly assessed in 90% with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 88% (4 false positive, 4 false negative). Vascular invasion was detected correctly in 91% (veins)-94% (arteries), lymph node invasion in 67% and liver metastasis in 94%.Dual phase helical CT is a very reliable tool in the assessment of resectability in pancreatic cancer.
