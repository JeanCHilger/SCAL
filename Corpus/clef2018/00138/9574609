Pancreatic tumors: comparison of dual-phase helical CT and endoscopic sonography. The purpose of this study was to compare dual-phase helical CT and endosonography for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors.Thirty patients with suspected pancreatic tumors underwent endosonography and dual-phase helical CT. A pathologic diagnosis was obtained in all cases with surgery (n = 23) or biopsy (n = 7), resulting in 27 neoplasms. Dual-phase helical CT and endosonographic findings were correlated with surgical and pathologic findings to determine diagnosis and resectability of pancreatic tumors.Overall diagnostic sensitivity was 92% for dual-phase helical CT and 100% for endosonography (p = .45). Overall accuracy for staging of pancreatic tumors was 93% for both dual-phase helical CT and endosonography. Overall accuracy for predicting resectability was 90% for both dual-phase helical CT and endosonography. Accuracy of predicting unresectability was 100% for dual-phase helical CT and 86% for endosonography (p > .80). Differences were not considered statistically significant.Dual-phase helical CT and endoscopic sonography do not differ significantly for diagnosis and assessment of resectability of pancreatic tumors.
