Uptake of mangafodipir trisodium in liver metastases from endocrine tumors. The purpose of the study was to investigate retrospectively whether mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP) can enhance the liver metastases from endocrine tumors. Thirteen patients with endocrine tumors and liver metastases underwent T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) and turbo gradient-echo (GRE) MRI conducted before and 20 to 60 minutes after i.v. infusion of MnDPDP. Additional 24-hour-delay scans were performed in 8 of 13 patients. MR signal intensity (SI) was measured in liver parenchyma and metastases, which was then related to that of paraspinal muscle. A total of 30 lesions on precontrast and postcontrast images and 18 lesions on 24-hour-delay images were measured. An enhancement by 49% in SE and 40% in GRE images (P = .0001) was observed in tumor tissues after MnDPDP infusion. In 24-hour-delay images, the SI of the lesions remained relatively high, but in liver parenchyma, it decreased significantly, and the tumor-liver tissue contrast was reduced.
