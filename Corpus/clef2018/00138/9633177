Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) versus endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): diagnostic usefulness. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new noninvasive technique to examine the biliopancreatic tract that have a high diagnostic accuracy. Thus it becomes an appealing modality that can avoid invasive approaches. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MRCP in comparison to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). We studied 41 patients (24 male, 17 female), median age 64.2 years (range 20 to 86 years), in which MRCP and later ERCP were performed results of both techniques were compared. In the assessment of biliary tract (n = 39), sensitivity/specificity was 100/94.4% in normal bile ducts (n = 18)
