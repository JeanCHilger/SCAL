ERCP in the management of pediatric pancreatitis. Although ERCP is commonly performed in children, the effect of findings at ERCP on the subsequent management of pediatric pancreatitis is unknown.We retrospectively reviewed charts to determine the impact of ERCP on the management of recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis in 17 consecutive children (3 boys and 14 girls, 3 to 16 years, mean 11.2 years) with recurrent acute (n = 13) or chronic pancreatitis (n = 4) who underwent ERCP. Radiographs were reviewed in a blinded manner, and the effect of ERCP findings on subsequent management was determined.In 16 of 17 patients (94%), the pancreatic duct was successfully visualized. Of the 16 studies, 9 (56%) had abnormal findings. A change in therapy occurred in all 9 patients as a result of the findings at ERCP. Of the 7 patients with a prior abnormal CT or ultrasound, 5 (71%) had an abnormal ERCP, all resulting in a change in therapy. Three of the 9 patients (33%) without radiographic abnormalities had an abnormal ERCP that, in each case, resulted in a change in therapy. Overall, findings at ERCP altered therapy in 52% of pediatric patients studied with recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis. A prior abnormal CT had a high predictive value with respect to ERCP resulting in a change in management (83%).ERCP is useful in the management of pediatric recurrent acute or chronic pancreatitis abnormalities are found at a rate similar to those found in adults.
