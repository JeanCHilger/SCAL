Dermoid cyst of the pancreas: a rare cystic neoplasm. Dermoid cysts of the pancreas, also called cystic teratomas, are a rare entity and are included in the group of neoplasms with a germ cell origin. Only twelve cases have been described in the world literature. The symptomatology is due to tumor compression of the neighboring tissues. Ultrasonography and computed tomography may be helpful, but there are no pathognomonic data for their preoperative recognition. The differential diagnosis should include all other cystic tumors of the pancreas. Complete surgical removal is mandatory. We describe the diagnostic and surgical procedures in a 74 year-old man with a pre-operatively unsuspected dermoid cyst. We review the previously published cases and emphasize the appropriate therapeutical management.
