Significant decreased insulin secretion in a diabetic patient with clinically probable multiple sclerosis. A 39-year-old man with chief complaints of aphasia, disorientation and acalculia was admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed as a clinically probable case of multiple sclerosis (MS) and his symptoms improved while on steroid pulse therapy. The patient had been diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus 16 years before the onset of MS and his insulin secretion further decreased with time. Slight insulin resistance was observed during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study. These results suggested that this patient developed diabetes mellitus mainly due to the decrease of insulin secretion.
