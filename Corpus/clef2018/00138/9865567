One-step endosonography-guided drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst: a new technique of stent delivery through the echo endoscope. We report here the first case of a one-step endosonography(EUS)-guided pseudocyst drainage. A prototype large channel curved array echo endoscope (Pentax FG-38 UX) and a prototype delivery system for placement of an endoprosthesis was used for the procedure. The delivery system (GIP MedicinTechnik GmbH/Medi-Globe Corporation) consists of a handle part with a piston, a metal ring sheath, a plastic catheter with a diathermy needle and a double pigtail endoprosthesis (8.5 Fr). When mounted on the endoscope the endoprosthesis can be advanced out of the distal end of the endoscope. The introduction of the stent as well as the stent release can be monitored entirely by ultrasound. The procedure was tested in a 76-year-old woman with a pseudocyst measuring 60 mm in diameter located in the tail of the pancreas. The procedure was well tolerated by the patient, and there were no procedural complications. The advantage of a large channel echo endoscope and our new prototype delivery system is that the endoprosthesis can be inserted in to a pancreatic cyst guided exclusively by EUS without exchange of endoscopes, catheters or guide wires. Further studies are warranted.
