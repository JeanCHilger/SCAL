Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the evaluation of pancreatic duct pathology. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may replace direct pancreatography in the evaluation of the pancreatic duct. The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate the usefulness of MRCP in the evaluation of pancreatic duct pathology. The examination technique included coronal, sagittal and axial breath-hold HASTE 2D imaging using a body phase array coil. We present the diagnostic features on MRCP of a variety of benign and malignant disorders of the pancreatic duct, and conclude that MRCP is a suitable method for imaging the pancreatic duct system.
