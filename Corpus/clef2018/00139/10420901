Combined use of MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography and contrast enhanced dual phase 3-D MR angiography in diagnosis of pancreatic tumors: initial clinical results. To evaluate the accuracy of a non-invasive "all-in-one" staging MR method in patients with pancreatic tumors.46 patients were prospectively evaluated by a combined MR imaging protocol including breath-hold T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequence, MRCP using a breath-hold 2D-RARE sequence, and breath-hold gadolinium-enhanced dual-phase 3D-MR angiography.All pancreatic tumors were detected by the combination of cross-sectional imaging and MRCP. In spite of the use of MRCP, definitive differentiation between pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis was not possible in 3 (6.5%) out of 46 cases. High quality 3D-MR angiograms were obtained in 43 (93.5%) cases. In 6 (13%) patients 3D-MRA showed an aberrant right hepatic artery. The overall accuracy of MRI in assessing extrapancreatic tumor spread, lymph node metastases, liver metastases, and vascular involvement was 95.7%, 80.4%, 93.5%, and 89.1%, respectively.Due to its high accuracy, the "all-in-one" MR protocol may become the most important modality after clinical examination and ultrasound in the diagnostic work-up for most patients with suspicion of pancreatic tumors.
