Juvenile xanthogranuloma presenting as obstructive jaundice. The authors report the case of a 9-month-old infant presenting with obstructive jaundice. Preoperative investigation findings showed distension of the extrahepatic biliary tract. Urine analysis result was positive for cytomegalovirus. At laparotomy, a 1-cm round mass was found within the head of the pancreas, near its upper border and in the course of the common bile duct. Findings on frozen sections could not rule out a malignant process and an hepaticoduodenostomy was constructed. Final diagnosis was juvenile xanthogranuloma. An association between cytomegalovirus and juvenile xanthogranuloma has been reported previously in the literature.
