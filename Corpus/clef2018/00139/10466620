Duodenal duplication cyst manifested by duodeno-jejunal intussusception and hyperbilirubinemia. A rare case of duodenal duplication cyst containing stones in a 17-year-old patient is presented. The cyst, acting as a leading point for duodeno-jejunal intussusception caused proximal small bowel obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia. Preoperative diagnosis was based on abdominal computerized tomography. At operation, the cyst wall was unroofed creating free drainage into the duodenal lumen without damaging the biliary and pancreatic ducts with resolution of symptoms.
