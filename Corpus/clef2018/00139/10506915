Hyperdense enhancement of pancreatic adenocarcinoma on spiral CT: two case reports. We are reporting two cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma that showed dense contrast enhancement on the early phase spiral CT scan and isodensity on the delayed phase scan. Both lesions were located in the head portion of the pancreas, with diameters of 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively. Despite its extremely rare incidence, adenocarcinoma may be included in the differential diagnosis of enhanced pancreatic tumor on early-phase spiral CT scan.
