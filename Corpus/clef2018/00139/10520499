Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas: diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Intraductal papillary and mucinous tumors of the pancreas (IPMT) have been recently well defined histologically. Recent reports have described their diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. The malignant potential of these lesions warrants their surgical resection. The main difficulty of their management is the pre-operative assessment of ductal extension and grade of dysplasia. Despite the use of various imaging modalities (ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasonography, CT scan, retrograde pancreatography, pancreatic MRI), examination of the pancreatic margin on frozen section remains mandatory to ensure complete resection of epithelial lesions. This usually requires partial pancreatic resection. The long-term outcome is favourable for lesions with no invasive component. Recurrence in case of invasive malignant transformation appear to be more frequent than previously reported.
