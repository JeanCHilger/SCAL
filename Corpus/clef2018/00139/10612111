Familial occurrence of hemangioblastoma. Haemangioblastoma is a benign vascular neoplasm accounting for approximately 1-2% of all intracranial tumours. Patients with haemangioblastoma are aged usually about 40 years, the tumour is situated mostly in the cerebellum, more frequently in males. The tumour is a component of the Hippel-Lindau syndrome with familial-hereditary dominant aetiology, often associated with retinal angiomatosis, cysts of the pancreas and kidneys, renal carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. A familial haemangioblastoma is reported in father and son. The father had the tumour in cerebellar vermis but the son had multiple tumours in cerebellum and medulla.
