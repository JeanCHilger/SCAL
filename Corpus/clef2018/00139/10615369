Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in evaluation of chronic pancreatitis. Part I: techniques and methods. Until recently, MR examinations of the pancreas were limited by motion artifacts, vascular pulsatility and poor spatial resolution. Today, new techniques have been developed, which allow to overcome these problems and provide additional information such as selective images of biliary and pancreatic ducts and vascular structures. MR examinations of the pancreas need to include either breath-hold or nonbreath-hold morphological T1- and T2-weighted images a contrast agent is required when the study is performed with fast imaging which allow the acquisition of dynamic images in arterial and portal venous phases. Recently, a new liver-specific contrast agent (Mn-DPDP) has been demonstrated to provide selective pancreatic enhancement. As a complement to baseline sequences, MR cholangiopancreatography images can be acquired, possibly integrated by functional examination after secretin administration. Finally, contrast-enhanced MR angiography opens new perspectives for vascular studies, particularly for the locoregional staging of pancreatic cancer.
