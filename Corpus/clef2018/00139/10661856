Papillary cystic and solid tumor of the pancreas--surgical therapy with the use of CUSA, and a review of the pediatric literature. Papillary cystic and solid tumor of the pancreas (PCSTP), so-called Frantz tumor, is a very rare tumor in children. Only 62 cases, 57 girls and 5 boys, have been reported in children since 1959. The tumor presents usually as a slowly growing abdominal mass with or without abdominal pain. Surgical resection of the tumor is an adequate mode of treatment, and the prognosis is excellent. The authors present 4 girls and 1 boy with PCSTP and demonstrate that the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA, Valleylab) is successfully used in surgical therapy.
