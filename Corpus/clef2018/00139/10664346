A chylous cyst of the mesentery: report of a case. A case is presented of an adult chylous cyst of the mesentery that was preoperatively diagnosed to be a pancreatic cystadenoma. A 66-year-old asymptomatic male was followed up for 15 months under the diagnosis of a benign pancreatic cyst. On October 1997, computed tomography showed a 45 x 40 mm cystic mass in the upper abdomen which came in contact with the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a multilocular mass with a 7 x 4 mm elevated lesion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed the cystic mass to be unrelated to the pancreatic duct. The preoperative diagnosis was a pancreatic cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. A laparotomy showed a 50 x 40 mm cystic mass containing chylous fluid, that arose from the mesentery of the upper part of the jejunum. The pathological diagnosis was a chylous cyst of the mesentery. The preoperative diagnosis in this case was very difficult because the chylous cyst appeared to be attached to the pancreas and this phenomenon is considered to be extremely rare.
