En bloc surgery for colon cancer: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 57-year-old woman in whom successful en bloc surgery was performed for locally advanced colon cancer. A fixed tumor was palpable in the right subcostal region, and computed tomography (CT) showed that it originated in the ascending colon and invaded the right kidney, duodenum, head of the pancreas, and liver. A right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy was performed combined with resection of the right kidney, duodenum, head of the pancreas, and liver. On microscopic examination, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon widely invaded the parenchyma of the kidney, the parenchyma of the pancreatic head, and the duodenal wall. Lymph node metastasis was found in one paracolic node. This case report outlines the procedures involved in this extended surgery.
