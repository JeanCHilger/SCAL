Detection of small, functional islet cell tumors in the pancreas: selection of MR imaging sequences for optimal sensitivity. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for depicting pancreatic small, functional islet cell tumors and the minimum number of sequences for expedient diagnosis.Twenty-eight patients clinically suspected to have functional islet cell tumors underwent T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) MR imaging with and without fat suppression, T2-weighted fast SE imaging, and spoiled gradient-echo (GRE) imaging before and after injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Sensitivity, specificity, and the best and minimum number of sequences for definitive diagnosis were determined.MR images depicted proved islet cell tumors in 17 of 20 patients (sensitivity, 85%). Images were true-negative in eight patients with negative follow-up examination results for more than 1 year. Specificity was 100% positive predictive value, 100%MR imaging accurately depicts small islet cell tumors. T2-weighted fast SE and spoiled GRE sequences usually suffice. Gadolinium-enhanced sequences are needed only if MR imaging results are equivocal or negative.
