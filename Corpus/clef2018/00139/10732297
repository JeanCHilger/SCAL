Kaposi's sarcoma of the pancreas mimicking pancreatic cancer in an HIV-infected patient. Clinical diagnosis by detection of HHV 8 in bile and complete remission following antiviral and cytostatic therapy with paclitaxel. Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is usually made by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and corresponding findings in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. Kaposi's sarcoma, a frequent tumor in individuals with a late-stage HIV infection, can be located in the gastrointestinal tract and cause identical symptoms to carcinoma of the same site. A close correlation of this tumor to human herpes virus 8 (HHV 8) has been known for several years and there are reports of successful antiproliferative therapy.Aspirated pancreatic juice and bile was investigated for the presence of HHV 8 by polymerase chain reaction. The clinical course of the patient under antiviral therapy and treatment with paclitaxel was studied.A 47-yr-old HIV-infected man with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma of skin and lungs caused by obstructive jaundice in the years before was admitted. ERCP showed a typical double-duct sign and CT revealed a tumorous infiltration of the pancreatic head, highly suspicious for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A mutation of the ki-ras gene could be ruled out and molecular analysis of bile identified HHV 8 by PCR. Intensive antiviral therapy, including foscarnet and treatment with paclitaxel led to a complete remission within 8 m.o.Kaposi's sarcoma of the pancreas possibly mimics pancreatic cancer in HIV-infected subjects. Diagnosis may be made by identification of HHV 8 in pancreatic juice or bile, and successful clinical outcome is possible by intensive antiviral and cytostatic treatment with paclitaxel.
