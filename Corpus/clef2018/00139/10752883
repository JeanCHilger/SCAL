MR cholangiopancreatography before and after oral blueberry juice administration. Blueberry juice was used in 37 patients who underwent MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) examination. Quantitative and qualitative comparison between pre- and post-blueberry juice oral administration was made. Common bile duct and main pancreatic duct depiction improved statistically significantly (p < 0.05) after blueberry juice administration. Blueberry juice may be used routinely in MRCP studies as a natural, safe, and inexpensive negative contrast agent with high efficacy.
