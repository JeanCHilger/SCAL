Pancreatic pseudocyst: unusual presentation of polyarteritis nodosa. Even though pancreatic involvement in case of polyarteritis nodosa is uncommon, it reveals infrequently the disease. Furthermore, the occurrence of pancreatic pseudocyst in case of polyarteritis nodosa is rare. One case of intrapancreatic pseudocyst complicating chronic pancreatic during polyarteritis nodosa is reported. CT scan showed non specific intrapancreatic cystic lesion for which the diagnosis of mucinous cystic tumor of the pancreas was considered. After surgical resection, histopathologic analysis led to the diagnosis of intrapancreatic pseudocyst secondary to polyarteritis nodosa.
