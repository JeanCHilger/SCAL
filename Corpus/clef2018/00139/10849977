Deep-seated thoracic and abdominal masses: usefulness of ultrasound and computed tomography guidance in fine needle aspiration cytology diagnosis. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed under ultrasound and CT guidance in 120 cases. These included abdominal masses (85 cases) and thoracic masses (35 cases) biopsied over a two and a half year period (March 1996 to September 1998). The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of clinico-imaging evaluation and image-guided FNAC to the management of patients with deep-seated mass lesions. Aspirations in the abdomen were performed from various anatomic sites such as liver (56 cases), lymph nodes (18 cases), gastrointestinal tract (three cases), pancreas (six cases), and kidney (two cases). In the thorax, biopsy was performed in the lung (19 cases) and mediastinum (13 cases). In 112 cases (93.4%) FNAC was diagnostic. Of the lesions that were successfully aspirated, 85% were < or = 5 cm in size. No major complication was encountered. All the successful aspirates could be defined as malignant or non-malignant, but tissue differentiation was possible in 63.7% of malignant lesions and 53.8% of benign lesions. Combined clinical and imaging evaluation for malignancy showed 80% sensitivity and 59% specificity. Although clinicoradiological parameters themselves have certain limitations in diagnosing benign versus malignant lesions, in conjunction with guided FNA they are very accurate and safe in diagnosing deep-seated mass lesions in the thorax and in the abdomen. However, the role of FNA in tissue differentiation of solid lesions such as lymphoma requires further study.
