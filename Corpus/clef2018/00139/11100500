Inflammatory pseudotumour of the pancreas in a child. We describe a 4-year-old girl with an inflammatory pseudotumour of the pancreas, which was preceded by varicella-zoster infection. Inflammatory pseudotumour may involve a variety of tissues, the lungs and liver being typical sites of predilection. Imaging and laboratory tests are nonspecific, and for this reason the diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumour is rarely made prior to surgery. These benign but locally aggressive masses simulate malignancy in the majority of cases. Inflammatory pseudotumour should, therefore, be considered when a mass arises in an unusual location in the paediatric age group.
