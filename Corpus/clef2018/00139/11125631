Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors: a case report and review of literature. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors are slow growing cystic neoplasms of pancreas with favorable prognosis. A case report of such a tumor in an octogenarian is presented. Excessive mucin secretion with ectatic dilatation of pancreatic ducts is a hallmark of this tumor. K-ras and p53 mutations are less frequent then in ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings are diagnostic and include a patulous papilla and amorphous filling defects in dilated pancreatic ducts. Magnetic resonance pancreatography, endoluminal ultra-sound, and pancreatoscopy are also helpful in diagnosis. Complete surgical resection is recommended.
