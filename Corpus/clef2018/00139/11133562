Traumatic disruption of the pancreatic duct: diagnosis with MR pancreatography. OBJECTIVE. We evaluated the ability of MR pancreatography to reveal traumatic disruptions of the pancreatic duct compared with retrograde pancreatography. CONCLUSION. MR pancreatography is an adequate noninvasive test for the detection of complete traumatic disruptions of the main pancreatic duct. MR pancreatography is especially useful for delineating the segments of the duct that cannot be evaluated with retrograde pancreatography.
