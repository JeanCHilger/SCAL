Early operation in children with pancreas transection. The preferred treatment for children with major pancreatic ductal injury remains controversial. This report compares our results using early operation with previously reported series using both operative and nonoperative management.This is a retrospective analysis of all children with pancreatic transection identified at Children's Medical Center of Dallas, Texas, from 1995 through 1999.There were 11 children with pancreatic transection. There was a delay of 2.3 days before presentation to a hospital in 6. Transection was diagnosed within 12 hours of presentation in 5 children. In the other 6 there was a mean delay of 36 hours. Nine children underwent operation within 72 hours of injury. Two late presenters initially were treated nonoperatively, and both developed a pseudocyst. The length of hospital stay in patients undergoing early operation averaged 11 days. Early postoperative morbidity occurred in 4 children and late morbidity in 1.Major pancreatic injuries are uncommon in children, and the diagnosis often is delayed. A high index of suspicion and repeated computed tomography scans should lead to earlier diagnosis. When compared with nonoperative management, early pancreatic resection more expeditiously returns the child to good health and lessens the inconvenience and emotional stress associated with prolonged hospitalization.
