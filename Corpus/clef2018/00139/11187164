Diagnostic imaging of annular pancreas. Annular pancreas is a rare congenital anomaly. A ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the second part of the duodenum and results in varying degrees of obstruction. When the first symptoms occur in adults, they are non-specific and may consist in epigastric pain, fullness after meals, indigestion and nausea. Concomitant lesions such as ulcer or pancreatitis may obscure the diagnosis.A case report documents that radiologic examination with barium meal disclosed the duodenal stenosis.A properly performed CT examination revealed the ring of pancreatic tissue which encircled the duodenum. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography may show a duct with a characteristic circular pattern around the duodenum. MR and endoscopic ultrasonography are supplementary examinations in equivocal cases.A CT examination is a good non-invasive primary examination when annular pancreas is suspected.
