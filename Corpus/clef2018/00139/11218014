Helical CT without contrast in choledocholithiasis diagnosis. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the helical CT without contrast in suspected cases of choledocholithiasis, comparing this test with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Forty patients with possible choledocholithiasis were studied prospectively. There were 23 women and 17 men, ranging in age from 24 to 91 years. Helical CT was performed immediately before ERCP (time interval between the two procedures was less than 1 h). A biliary area previously selected was studied with a technique of pitch 1 and slice thickness of 3.2 mm. Average time was 30 s. Reconstruction with different increments and windows were made. Stone presence was evaluated in bile duct and Vater's ampulla. Biliary dilation was evaluated too. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography found stones in 19 patients and absence of stones in 20. One case was failed, but stones in bile duct were demonstrated during intraoperative cholangiography. Helical CT demonstrated stones in 15 of the 19 patients with positive ERCP. There were no false positives with CT. Patients without stones in ERCP were also negative in CT. The patient having the failed ERCP was considered positive in CT. The CT sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 100%, with an accuracy of 90%. Helical CT without contrast has sensitivity and specificity good enough to be used as a screening technique in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis.
