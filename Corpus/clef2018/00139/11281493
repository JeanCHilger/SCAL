Insulinoma in childhood. A 9-year-old boy with convulsions is herein described. He was diagnosed and treated for epilepsy and insufficient adrenal function for four years with no response. Hypoglycemia from hyperinsulinism was found and the source of the hyperinsulinism was a tumor of the tail of the pancreas--located by computerized tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging. Distal pancreatectomy was performed with good results. Histology of the tumor showed islet cell tumors with capsular invasion. For this type of patient, long-term follow-up should include: prevention of metastasis or recurrence, and testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
