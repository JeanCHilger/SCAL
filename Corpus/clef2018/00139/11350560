Advanced gastric cancer with multiple lymph node metastasis successfully treated with etoposide, adriamycin and cisplatin. Gastric cancer usually shows poor sensitivity to chemotherapy, and the presence of lymph node metastases is associated with extremely poor prognosis, especially when the number of such nodes is more than 10. We report here a case of advanced gastric cancer with histopathologically confirmed metastases in 15 regional lymph nodes, in which the recurrent tumor was sensitive to combination chemotherapy. Distal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed for the primary tumor. A hard (recurrent) tumor was detected in the upper abdomen 5 months postoperatively. Abdominal CT revealed two tumors measuring 3.5 x 1.8 and 3.3 x 2 cm in diameter at the front of the pancreatic head, which suggested recurrence. Etoposide, adriamycin and cisplatin (EAP) chemotherapy (20 mg/kg adriamycin, 100 mg/kg etoposide and 50 mg/kg cisplatin (CDDP)) was administered every 6 weeks. The tumors regressed and became undetectable on CT after four cycles. At that stage, CDDP was replaced with 400 mg/kg carboplatin, which was administered every 1 or 2 months. The patient had no recurrence 8 years after surgery. For treatment of advanced gastric cancer with multiple lymph node metastases, a wide resection of the tumor should be performed followed by treatment of the residual tumor cells with a suitable combination chemotherapy taking into consideration the characteristics of the tumor and the condition of the host. We present a patient with gastric cancer and histopathologically confirmed metastases in 15 regional lymph nodes, who was successfully treated by surgery followed by EAP adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient remains alive and well at 8 years after surgery.
