A case of pancreatic serous cystadenoma obstructing the distal pancreatic duct. We present a case of resected serous cystadenoma of the pancreas inducing marked dilatation of the main distal pancreatic duct. A 68-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, presented with upper abdominal pain. Abdominal US revealed a highly echoic mass in the pancreas. A CT scan disclosed a low density mass in the pancreas and dilatation of the main peripheral pancreatic duct. The mass demonstrated homogeneous and high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selective abdominal arteriography showed the mass strained by the celiac artery. The tumor markers were CEA (2.4 ng/ml) and CA19-9 (6.1 U/ml). After the diagnosis of serous cystadenoma of the pancreas, the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The tumor (2.5 cm in diameter) consisted of grayish-white nodules and occupied the body of the pancreas. The tail of the pancreas was atrophic. Histopathological examination of the specimen showed a multilocular lesion containing numerous cysts with the inner surfaces evenly lined by one layer of cuboid or flat epithelial cells which stained positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), evidencing serous cystadenoma. The patient is doing quite well one and a half years after the operation.
