Abdominal cystic tumors containing small amount of fat in the septa: report of two cases. We present two cases of abdominal cystic tumors containing small amounts of fat in their septa. Although the final pathologic diagnoses of these tumors were cystic lymphangioma and angiomatosis, the computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging features were almost identical and indistinguishable a purely cystic mass around the region of the pancreas head associated with little mass effect on the surrounding organs and septa containing a radiologically evident fatty component. Radiologists should be aware of these two entities as differential diagnoses of abdominal cystic masses containing small amounts of septal fat.
