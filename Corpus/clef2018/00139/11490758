Pancreatoblastoma: a rare malignant neoplasm in early adulthood. Here we report the ninth case of pancreatoblastoma in an adult.At the time of diagnosis the female patient was 22 years old. She had a tumor in the left upper abdomen, measuring 9 cm in diameter. Preoperatively the diagnosis of a pancreatoblastoma was suspected and an explorative laparotomy was performed followed by radical tumor extirpation and intraoperative radiotherapy. After the diagnosis of a pancreatoblastoma was confirmed by definitive histopathological examination, combined Radiochemotherapy was performed.Special features in histomorphological characterization of the tumor and problems concerning diagnosis and differential diagnosis as well as the lack of a definitive therapy regime are discussed.
