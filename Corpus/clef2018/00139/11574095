Spatial assessment by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for preoperative imaging in partial pancreatic head resection. Partial pancreatic head resection has been recommended for intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT). We report the usefulness of preoperative assessment by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).We studied 12 cases of surgically resected IPMT in the pancreatic head. The MRCP and ERCP images were interpreted, and we examined the detection rate of each imaging technique for the Wirsung duct, the Santorini duct, the entire cystic tumor, and the communication between the tumor and the ducts.In all cases MRCP correctly identified the entire cystic tumor, and the communication between the tumor and the pancreatic ducts was seen in 64% of cases. In contrast, the detection rate by ERCP of the entire cystic tumor and of the communication between the cystic tumor and the ducts was only 8% and 18%, respectively.MRCP clearly showed the relationship of the cystic tumor and the pancreatic ducts and was very useful for preoperative imaging for partial pancreatic head resection.
