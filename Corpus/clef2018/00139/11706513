Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. Authors present a case of a retroperitoneal lymphoepithelial cyst, which occurs rarely in this localisation. The histological picture is reminiscent of a branchiogen cyst. Usually it is recognised accidentally, with US or CT examinations performed for other reasons. In case the general condition of the patient is satisfactory, the surgical removal of such a tumour is recommended, since it is almost impossible to differentiate from more harmful lesions by CT or US examination, and if there are no tumour cells on the smears obtained by fine needle aspiration, there is always the doubt of sampling error.
