Miliary, ganglionar, pancreatic and costal tuberculosis. Clinical presentation and literature review. A 42-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with fever, abdominal pain and miliary radiological pattern. The amylase and lipase in serum, and the amylase in urine were increased. The tuberculin skin test was negative. The thoracic and abdominal CT scan showed costal affectation, multiple focal hepatic lesions and large necrosing peripancreatic lymphadenopathies. The transbronchial biopsy and the pancreatic punction demonstrated granulomatous necrotic lesions, and M. tuberculosis grew in the bronchial washing culture. The specific treatment normalized the pulmonary, costal and pancreatic lesions.
