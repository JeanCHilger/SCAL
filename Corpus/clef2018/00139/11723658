Chronic pancreatitis in endoscopic ultrasonography--analysis of newly diagnosed cases during a 28-month period. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is an imaging method visualising the entire pancreas by use of high-frequency ultrasound probes introduced into the close proximity of the pancreas. During the 38-month period, our clinic has examined 148 patients with the diagnostic conclusion of chronic pancreatitis. This diagnosis was newly assessed in 72 of them. Approximately one third of cases with chronic pancreatitis were in their early stages. Despite this fact, in 22% of them, the first manifestation of chronic pancreatitis was represented by biliary duct stenosis while in 15% of cases the stenosis was not caused by the presence of any focal process, but by diffuse inflammatory changes. This proportion is unusually high in comparison with literature data. (Tab. 5, Ref. 22.)
