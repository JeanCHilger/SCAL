Pancreatic cystosis in cystic fibrosis: case report. We describe a 19-year-old cystic fibrosis patient, with pancreatic insufficiency since the age of 4 who presented at the age of 13 with postprandial abdominal pain. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed several pancreatic cysts that progressively increased in diameter over 6 years. The lack of association with clinical and biochemical signs of acute pancreatitis is highlighted.
