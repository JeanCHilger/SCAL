Renal vein and inferior vena cava thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis. Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is a well-recognized complication of the nephrotic syndrome, but it is extremely rare in patients with acute pancreatitis. Vascular thrombosis complicating pancreatitis is thought to be due to release of proteolytic enzymes from the pancreas and direct vasculitis. Peripancreatic vessels are most commonly involved in the complications associated with pancreatitis. Renal vein and inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis, however, is an exceptionally rare complication of pancreatitis. Awareness of this complication will help physicians in its early diagnosis and management. We report a case of renal vein and IVC thrombosis in a patient with acute pancreatitis.
