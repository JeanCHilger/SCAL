Pharyngeal and laryngeal hamartoma: case report. In this report a case of laryngeal hamartoma is presented. Macroscopically this lesion is quite similar to a tumor but is actually a malformation derived from an error in the development of a healthy organ. Histologically, the hamartoma is composed of a proportionally abnormal mixture of tissues as compared to what is normally present in its anatomic site. The lesion is extremely rare and usually appears in the head and neck district, spleen, pancreas, lung and liver. The diagnosis is essentially based on histological examination. The treatment of choice consists of surgery and periodic follow-up. Differential diagnosis must consider other rare neoplasms such as rhabdomyoma and teratoma.
