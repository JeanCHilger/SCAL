Laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy in a porcine model. Surgical extirpation remains the only known curative treatment for cancer of the pancreas. Because of locally advanced or metastatic tumor, up to 80% of patients are unresectable at the time of initial diagnosis [13]. Other investigators previously have suggested that laparoscopy before laparotomy aids in the diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic cancer in a fair number of patients even after negative computed tomography scans [3, 17]. Many surgeons are reluctant to incorporate laparoscopy into the workup of patients with cancer of the pancreas because of the frequent need for surgical bypass in the management of either biliary tract obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction [9, 13]. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy combined with gastrojejunostomy in a porcine model, as well as the individual accomplishment of laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy. The purpose of this study was to document the feasibility of performing laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy with gastrojejunostomy.Under general anesthesia, seven pigs underwent laparoscopic choledochojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy using an intracorporeal hand-sutured technique.The mean operating time ranged from 150 to 450 min. All the animals recovered completely from the operation and had patent anastomoses at the time of necropsy. One pig died of gastric bleeding on postoperative day 13, and two animals had intraabdominal fluid collections discovered at the time of necropsy.These results suggest that synchronous laparoscopic bypass of biliary and gastric outlet obstruction is feasible, and can be performed in a manner similar to that used in open operations. We believe this lends support to the argument promoting laparoscopy in the evaluation of pancreatic cancer.
