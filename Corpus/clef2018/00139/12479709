Imaging of cystic diseases of the pancreas. Although the majority of cystic lesions of the pancreas seen in clinical practice represent postinflammatory pseudocysts, it is important for the radiologist to be knowledgeable of the wide spectrum of cystic masses of the pancreas and the variable prognoses they possess. As a result of similarities in the imaging features of these lesions, a definitive diagnosis is often not possible. By combining imaging features with clinical history, a reasonable differential diagnosis can be offered to the referring physician. In some cases, biopsy or fluid aspiration may be required prior to surgery. In a patient without the appropriate history of pancreatitis and the presence of a cystic pancreatic mass, it is incumbent upon the radiologist to offer alternative diagnoses of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.
