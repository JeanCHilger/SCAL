Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor and mucinous cystic neoplasm: CT and MR findings. Cystic lesions of the pancreas are increasingly detected by imaging at daily clinical practice. Among them mucinous cystic tumor and intradcutal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas are clinically important since they are latently or overtly malignant and still have potentially good prognosis after resection. In this review article we describe history, clinicopathology and differential diagnosis of two entities, and findings and role of CT and MR imaging as well as MR cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis and evaluation of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor.
