Imaging of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are uncommon neoplasms of the pancreas that can occur sporadically or in association with various syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN I). Patients can present with a specific clinical syndrome related to biochemically functioning tumors or with nonspecific symptoms related to mass effect or metastases. The size, function, consistency, and malignant behavior of neuroendocrine tumors are integrally related. Imaging has a major role in the preoperative localization of the primary tumor and detection of metastases. Several techniques are available including ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), MR, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, angiography, and arterial stimulation with venous sampling each with unique advantages and limitations. The reported performance for these techniques vary widely, and as a result, recommended imaging algorithms are controversial. Recent technical advances in ultrasound, CT, and MRI have occurred that may improve the sensitivity of some of the techniques. Further improvements are likely in the future. In this chapter we will review imaging techniques used to study the pancreas as it relates to the detection of neuroendocrine tumors, imaging findings of these tumors using various imaging modalities, and the advantages, limitations and results obtained with each technique.
