Management of 100 consecutive cases of pancreatic serous cystadenoma: wait for symptoms and see at imaging or vice versa? Pancreatic serous cystadenomas have a low malignancy rate. When nonsymptomatic, in selected patients, they can be managed without surgery however, a high degree of diagnostic reliability is crucial. We admitted 100 consecutive cases (87 women with a median age of 51.86 years). Of these, 44 were symptomatic and 56 were diagnosed incidentally. Ultrasound correctly diagnosed 53% of the cases, incorrectly 31%, and was nondiagnostic in 16%. Computed tomography scan had similar rates (54%, 34% and 12%, respectively), while magnetic resonance imaging improved diagnostic accuracy to 74% and reduced incorrect diagnoses to 26%. In 21 cases, exploratory needle aspiration of the cyst was carried out
