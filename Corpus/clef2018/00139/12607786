Nonmucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms. This article discusses serous cystadenomas, the most common of the nonmucinous cystic lesions of the pancreas. These microcystic lesions were previously known as "glycogen-rich" cystadenomas because of the presence of glycogen within the cyst epithelium. A small percentage of these lesions are macrocystic, and it may be difficult to differentiate them from mucinous lesions however, endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration can provide diagnostic material from the cyst fluid. The second most common nonmucinous cyst, the islet cell tumor, is also discussed. These rare cystic tumors may or may not be accompanied by excess hormone production. The prognosis for the rare cystic tumors is good if they are resected successfully.
