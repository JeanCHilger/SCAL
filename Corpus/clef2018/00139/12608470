Severe jaundice in Sweden in the new millennium: causes, investigations, treatment and prognosis. The aims of the study were to assess the causes of jaundice in Gothenburg, Sweden, to study the types of investigations applied in cholestatic and hepatocellular types of jaundice and treatment and to evaluate the prognosis of these patients up to a year from the diagnosis.Over a 3-month period, all adult patients with bilirubin > 100 micromol/l were identified by the clinical chemistry laboratory serving all three hospitals in Gothenburg. Relevant clinical information was obtained from medical records. Follow-up was performed 9-12 months later.A total of 173 patients were identified 40% were under surgical care while 38% were in the care of internists. The most common cause of jaundice was malignancy in 58 patients, liver metastases in 20, cholangiocarcinoma in 16, pancreatic cancer in 13, cancer of papilla Vateri in 2 and primary liver cancer in 7. Alcoholic liver disease was the second most common cause, found in 29 patients, followed by bile duct stones (28 patients). Only 3% had viral hepatitis. Ultrasound and/or CT were performed in 95% of those with cholestasis and ultrasound had been performed in 75% of those with hepatocellular type and CT in almost 50%. Thirty-two patients were operated on, 27 patients were treated endoscopically and 17 patients required liver transplantation. Total mortality was 51% and in malignancy 82%.Malignancy and alcoholic liver disease are the most common causes of severe jaundice, whereas viral hepatitis is a rare cause. Many patients are under surgical care, probably due to historical reasons as surgery is rarely indicated.
