Necrolytic migratory erythema as the only presenting sign of a glucagonoma. We describe a 39-year-old man with a 3-year history of a recalcitrant psoriasiform eruption that was accentuated in the intertriginous areas. Hsitopathology was consistent with psoriasis. A glucagon level was 744 pg/mL with the upper limit of normal being 130 pg/mL. Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen revealed a 5-cm mass in the tail of the pancreas. The tumor was removed and found to be a glucagonoma (pancreatic islet tumor). The clinical eruption resolved promptly with surgical excision. Neither the clinical eruption nor the tumor has recurred for 6 months. The course of disease confirms the diagnosis of necrolytic migratory erythema associated with a glucagonoma.
