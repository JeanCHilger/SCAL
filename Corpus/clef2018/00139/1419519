Cystic tumors of the pancreas: a case of cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head. Cystic tumors of the pancreas are important, although rare, lesions representing nearly 1% of all neoplasms and 10-15% of pancreatic cysts. The Authors compare clinical data of the case observed with those reported in literature. The described case confirms the peculiar characteristics of pancreatic mucinous cystoadenomas: slow growth, not specific symptoms, poor trend to give local or distant metastases, difficult preoperative differential diagnosis and satisfying oncological resection. Taking into account these parameters and the potential malignant evolution of such tumors, the Authors underline the importance of a radical surgical therapy.
