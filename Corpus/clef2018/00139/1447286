Hepatic artery aneurysm simulating a pancreatic mass. A 61-year-old man presented with a mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Computer tomography scanning (CT) had initially suggested that the location was in the head of the pancreas. Further examination with ultrasonography and celiac angiography documented that the mass was an aneurysm of the common hepatic artery. The successful approach to its surgical management is described.
