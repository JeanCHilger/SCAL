MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo and spin-echo T1-weighted fat-suppressed techniques in diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. To evaluate the value of MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMPSPGR) and spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted fat-suppressed techniques in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.Eighteen cases of pancreatic carcinoma verified by surgical and pathologic results were examined by MR, and the MR sequences included SE T1WI, FSE T2WI, SE T1-weighted fat-suppressed and dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced FMPSPGR.Of 18 pancreatic carcinomas, 10, 6, and 2 tumors showed respectively hypo-intensity, iso-intensity and hyper-intensity on SE T1WI, meanwhile, 8, 6, and 4 tumors displayed hyper-intensity, iso-intensity and hypo-intensity on FSE T2WI in comparison with the normal pancreatic tissue. All of the tumors showed hypo-intensity on SE T1-weighted fat-suppressed and also obvious non-enhancement or slight enhancement on MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced FMPSPGR images during the arterial dominant phase scanning.SE T1-weighted fat-suppressed and MR dynamic Gadolinium-enhanced FMPSPGR sequences could evidently improve the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.
