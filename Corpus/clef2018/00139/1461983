Splenic complications in inflammatory pancreatic diseases. Pancreatitis in combination with splenic and vascular complications is dangerous and potentially lethal. The most common complications are intestinal or intraperitoneal hemorrhage resulting directly from either vascular changes, such as erosion of the splenic artery, formation of a pseudoaneurysm, hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, or rupture of a pseudocyst with perforation into the colon, or complications in the spleen, such as anemic or hemorrhagic infarction, abscess or rupture. CT is the method of choice for the diagnosis of splenic complications of pancreatitis. Angiography is indicated in every severe hemorrhage in the presence of pancreatitis, to demonstrate vascular changes and to localize the source of hemorrhage. In addition, acute arterial bleeding can be successfully treated with catheter embolization.
