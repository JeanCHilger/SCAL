Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography on postoperative work-up in children with choledochal cysts. This study aimed to assess the clinical usefulness of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) as a postoperative diagnostic tool in children with choledochal cysts. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed postoperatively in 19 patients and image quality was compared with that obtained by intravenous cholangiography spiral computed tomography (IVC-SCT). While the detectability by MRCP was inferior to that by IVC-SCT, MRCP highly (84.2%) depicted the anastomotic site together with the reconstructed bowel and intrahepatic bile ducts. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography also clearly delineated the postoperative condition of pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM), residual distal common bile duct, common channel, and pancreatic duct. Since MRCP is noninvasive and requires neither radiation exposure nor a contrast agent, and is useful for detecting both anastomosis and pancreatico-biliary ducts around PBM, MRCP might be superior to IVC-SCT as an imaging technique for outpatient clinics performing long-term follow-up studies in children with choledochal cysts.
