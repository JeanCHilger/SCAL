Laparoscopic wedge resection with handsewn closure for gastroduodenal tumors. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic wedge resection with handsewn closure in gastroduodenal tumors.Laparoscopic wedge resection was performed in 16 patients with gastroduodenal tumor between May 2000 and December 2002. Every case, except one, was performed via an extragastric approach a transgastric approach was adopted in a single case. Excision of the lesion was performed manually by means of electrocautery or ultrasonic coagulating shears and closed by manual intracorporeal running suture.Among the 16 cases, two cases were treated using a laparoscope-assisted method, but there was no case of conversion to open surgery. Mean size of lesions was 27.9 mm in diameter and the mean operation time was 219 minutes. In all cases, a complete tumor excision with negative surgical margins was obtained. The final pathologic diagnoses were ectopic pancreas (4 cases), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (3 cases), leiomyoma (2 cases), adenomyoma (2 cases), tubular adenoma (1 case), Brunner's gland hyperplasia (1 case), carcinoid tumor (1 case), eosinophilic granuloma (1 case), and post-endoscopic mucosectomy state for early gastric cancer (1 case). The average numbers of days to first postoperative oral food intake and hospital stay were 3.1 days and 6.0 days, respectively. There were no postoperative complications.Laparoscopic wedge resection with handsewn closure should be considered as a valid treatment option for selected gastroduodenal tumors in terms of feasibility, safety, and cost. A more efficient surgical instrument and technique should be developed in future.
