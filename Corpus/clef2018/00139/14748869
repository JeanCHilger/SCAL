Role of endoscopic ultrasonography in diseases of the extrahepatic biliary system. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is one of the most recent advances in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Available EUS devices include echoendoscopes, such as radial scanning and linear array echoendoscopes, and catheter ultrasound probes. Endoscopic ultrasonography has various applications, such as staging of gastrointestinal malignancy, evaluation of submucosal tumors, and has grown to be an important modality in evaluating the pancreaticobiliary system. With regard to the biliary system, EUS is useful for the detection and staging of ampullary tumors, detection of microlithiasis and choledocholithiasis and evaluation of benign and malignant bile-duct strictures. Endoscopic ultrasonography may be used as an adjunct to transabdominal ultrasound for the detection and characterization of gallbladder polyps. In addition, EUS is helpful in the staging of gallbladder cancer as well as in diagnosing anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction with its associated pancreatobiliary diseases. The present paper reviews the current applications of EUS for imaging and intervention in diseases of the extrahepatic biliary system.
