Gastrointestinal infection in the immunocompromised (AIDS) patient. In the past two decades acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become one of the most devastating illnesses in human history. As the epidemic continues to spread increasingly, AIDS patients are no longer confined to a few specialized AIDS hospitals and are now seen in general hospitals and clinics everywhere. Radiologists need to recognize the appearances, to understand how-safely-to care for patients with this disease, and to know enough about the illness to be able to counsel their patients. This article presents a review of current knowledge about the wide range of gastrointestinal hepatic, splenic, biliary, and retroperitoneal manifestations in AIDS, and how the role of modern medical imaging techniques and diagnosis and treatment can be applied. The imaging aspects (conventional double-contrast gastrointestinal studies, ultrasound, CT, and MR) of the diseases of the luminal gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, biliary tract, and retroperitoneum will be systematically discussed. Candidiasis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, isosporiasis, salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, unusual mycobacteria, and viral infections account for the majority of non-neoplastic disorders.
