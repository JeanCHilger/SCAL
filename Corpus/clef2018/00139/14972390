Abdominal imaging studies: comparison of diagnostic accuracies resulting from ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging in the same individual. We retrospectively compared the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies performed on the same individual to determine the relative performance of these modalities in the evaluation of disease processes, arising from different intra-abdominal organ systems. We retrospectively reviewed all procedure codes accrued by our abdominal imaging section during a 1-year period to determine how many patients underwent all three imaging procedures in our institution within a 2-week interval. These cases were then further evaluated to determine: (1) the primary organ system of disease involvement, (2) the final diagnosis, and (3) the imaging modality that provided the most accurate information upon which appropriate medical management was based. Imaging findings were determined by review of diagnostic reports, and medical management was determined by chart review. Two thousand six hundred-ninety five patients underwent ultrasound, 4,394 patients underwent CT, and 872 patients underwent MRI for the investigation of abdominal disease. Among these 5,126 patients, 26 underwent sequential US, CT, and MRI evaluation within a two-week interval. Appropriate clinical management was based on the US findings in 12/26 cases (46% 95% CI: 27-67%), CT findings in 16/26 cases (62%
