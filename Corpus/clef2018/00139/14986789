Innovative methods of biliary tract diagnosis: intraductal ultrasound and tissue acquisition. Tissue can be acquired from the bile and pancreatic duct with either brush cytology or biopsy forceps, often without the need for sphincterotomy. Although the diagnosis of malignancy with these sampling techniques is often specific, the sensitivity is limited, and a wide range of diagnostic accuracies has been reported. A combination of biopsy and brush cytology along with some newer techniques in the development stage may increase the sensitivity. Intraductal ultrasound is a newer technique offers the endoscopist the ability to image the bile and pancreatic duct wall, adjacent organs, and vascular structures with a high degree of detail. This visualization can be accomplished during the course of an ERCP or percutaneously under fluoroscopic guidance. Indications for the procedure include detection of choledocholithiasis, differentiation of benign and malignant ductal strictures, pancreaticobiliary tumor staging, and detection of various pancreatic tumors. Continued research into the design of the probes, which could improve durability and extend the depth of penetration, may promote more widespread use of this novel technology.
