Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for inflammatory pseudotumor of the pancreas. An 82-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, and weight loss of ~25 lb over 6 months. A CT scan and MRI of the abdomen revealed a mass in the tail of the pancreas that was suspicious for malignancy. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and was discharged home on the 4th postoperative day after an uneventful course. Pathology revealed an inflammatory pseudotumor of the pancreas (IPT). Pancreatic IPT is a rare entity, and this case represents the first report of laparoscopic resection of this lesion. The presentation, diagnosis, histologic features, and therapy of IPT of the pancreas are reviewed.
