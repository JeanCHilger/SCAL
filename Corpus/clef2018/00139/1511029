Imaging of gastrointestinal malignancies. Many advancements in the imaging of gastrointestinal malignancies have been seen in the past year. Endorectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging with an endorectal surface coil allow for more accurate staging of the depth of bowel wall invasion by rectal carcinoma. Monoclonal antibody imaging may detect metastases not found by other modalities while computed tomography arterial portography and intraoperative ultrasound improve our ability to identify liver metastases. Endoscopic ultrasound is also useful in the preoperative assessment of esophageal cancer and pancreatic endocrine tumors.
