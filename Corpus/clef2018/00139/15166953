Appropriate timing of cholecystectomy in patients who present with moderate to severe gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid collections. Standard management of gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis calls for cholecystectomy to be performed during the same hospitalization after acute symptoms have subsided. However, infectious complications are common when cholecystectomy is performed sooner than 3 weeks after severe acute pancreatitis. Fluid collections, common in patients with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis, are additionally problematic. No previous study has examined the role of peripancreatic fluid collections and subsequent pseudocyst in outcomes after cholecystectomy in these patients.We compare results of delaying cholecystectomy after moderate to severe acute pancreatitis with early cholecystectomy.Since 1987, all patients with moderate to severe gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis and associated fluid collections were addressed. Moderate to severe acute pancreatitis was defined as > 5 Ranson prognostic indicators. Fluid collection was established by computed tomography (CT) scan. Patients were evaluated for duration of hospitalization, complications of cholecystectomy, resolution or persistence of pseudocysts, nonoperative interventions performed on pseudocysts, intercurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis during the monitoring period, episodes of sepsis, and mortality.A total of 187 patients with moderate to severe gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis survived their acute stage 151 had peripancreatic fluid collections. Seventy-eight of the 187 had early cholecystectomy, 62 of whom had fluid collectionsCholecystectomy should be delayed in patients who survive an episode of moderate to severe acute biliary pancreatitis and demonstrate peripancreatic fluid collections or pseudocysts until the pseudocysts either resolve or persist beyond 6 weeks, at which time pseudocyst drainage can safely be combined with cholecystectomy.
