Urinoma masquerading as pancreatic pseudocyst. In this article, we report on a patient with recurrent pancreatitis who had received multiple celiac plexus injections for control of pain, and then developed a cystic mass adjacent to the body and tail of the pancreas suggestive of a pancreatic pseudocyst. The cystic mass proved to be a urinoma. The distinction between pancreatic pseudocyst and urinoma was made by CT scan with intravenous contrast utilizing delayed films, which demonstrated leakage of contrast into the cystic structure. This is the first report of a urinoma that resembled a pancreatic pseudocyst.
