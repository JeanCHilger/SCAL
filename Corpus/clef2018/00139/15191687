Interventional endoscopic ultrasound in pancreatic disease. The use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in pancreatic disease is rapidly evolving as the field moves from a primarily diagnostic role to one of therapeutic intervention. Therapeutic EUS includes techniques such as the celiac block and transmural pseudocyst drainage. Newer techniques include EUS-guided fine-needle injection therapy in which a variety of agents are being investigated for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Novel EUS-guided techniques are being devised to drain and alleviate pancreaticobiliary and gastroduodenal obstruction.
