Screening for pancreatic neoplasia in high-risk individuals: an EUS-based approach. Relatives of patients with pancreatic cancer and persons with certain inherited syndromes are at increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of screening for pancreatic neoplasia in high-risk individuals.Individuals from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds and a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome underwent screening endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). If the EUS was abnormal, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and spiral computed tomography (CT) were performed. Patients with abnormalities suggesting neoplasia had surgery.Thirty-eight patients were studied 31 (mean age, 58 yrEUS-based screening of asymptomatic high-risk individuals can detect prevalent resectable pancreatic neoplasia but false-positive diagnoses also occur.
