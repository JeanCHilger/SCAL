Magnetic resonance imaging of bile and pancreatic ducts: a retrospective study. To assess the value of magnetic resonance in the diagnosis of pancreatobiliary ductal system changes.The study included 103 patients (44 men, 59 women, mean age 57, age range 1 month - 91 years) with pancreatobiliary duct changes. The patients underwent a routine liver and pancreas MR imaging that included a MR cholangiopancreatography sequence. Comparison was made with findings at surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopacreatography performed within 14 days, and follow-up, as a reference standard.The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of magnetic resonance for the evaluation of lithiasis were 87%, 90.2% and 89.3% respectively 100%, 97.8%, and 98%, respectively for cholangitisMagnetic resonance is a reliable imaging technique for the evaluation of biliary and pancreatic ducts
