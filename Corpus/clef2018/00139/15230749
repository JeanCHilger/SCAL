Identification and staging of pancreatic tumours using computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Pancreatic malignancy can be staged by a number of different investigations, either alone or in combination. The purpose of the present study was to compare the use of endoscopic ultrasound, CT and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MRI for the staging of pancreatic malignancy, particularly with respect to determining resectability prior to surgery. Twenty-seven patients referred for the investigation of a suspected pancreatic malignancy were entered into the trial. All patients had contrast-enhanced CT, gadolinium and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MRI, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Images were assessed for nodal staging, tumour staging and resectability for each investigation, and the results compared with findings at surgery. The results for the accuracy of MRI, CT and EUS, in detecting T4 disease versus T3 or lower was 78, 79 and 68%, respectively nodal involvement was 56, 63 and 69%, respectively
