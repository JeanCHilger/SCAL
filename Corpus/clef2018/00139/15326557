Primary diagnosis of hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma during pregnancy and after birth -- a rare occurrence. About seven to ten percent of all brain tumours are neoplasias of the pituitary gland. Pituitary gland tumours can cause different clinical symptoms often making it difficult to come to the correct diagnosis. They can lead to severe complications such as hypopituitarism with secondary hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and adrenocortical insufficiency, compression of the optic tract or obstructive hydrocephalus. We report on two patients with hormone-secreting pituitary tumours that were unknown prior to pregnancy. The first woman suffered from a growth hormone-producing pituitary adenoma, causing persistent headaches after birth. The second woman showed a significant loss of vision and visual field defects in the 32nd week of gestation, caused by a prolactin-producing pituitary tumour.
