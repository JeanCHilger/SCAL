ERCP or EUS for tissue diagnosis of biliary strictures? A prospective comparative study. The accuracy of ERCP-based brush cytology or forceps biopsy for tissue diagnosis is relatively low (usually not exceeding 70%). By contrast, reported accuracy rates for EUS-guided FNA of pancreatobiliary masses are over 80%. This prospective study compared these two modalities for the first time in the diagnosis of indeterminate biliary strictures and pancreatic tumors.Fifty consecutive patients (29 men, 21 women mean age 62.1 years) with obstructive jaundice in whom a tissue diagnosis was required were included. During ERCP, intraductal specimens were obtained with a forceps and with two different types of brush (conventional and spiral suction) in random order. During EUS, only visible mass lesions or localized bile duct wall thickening were aspirated (22-gauge needle), with at least two passes yielding material sufficient for assessment. A cytopathologist was not present in the procedure room to evaluate specimen adequacy. The reference methods were surgery, other biopsy results, follow-up until death, or the conclusion of the study (mean follow-up 20 months).The final diagnoses were malignancy, 28 (16 pancreatic, 12 biliary), and benign biliary stricture, 22. Sensitivity and specificity for ERCP-guided biopsy were 36% and 100%, respectively for ERCP-guided cytology (when using conventional and spiral suction brushes), 46% and 100%, respectivelyFor biliary strictures, combined ERCP- and EUS-guided tissue acquisition seems to be the best approach to tissue diagnosis. From a clinical standpoint, it appears reasonable, when a tissue diagnosis is required, to start with ERCP if biliary malignancy is suspected and with EUS when a pancreatic tumor is thought to be the cause of a biliary stricture.
