Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater: results of surgical treatment of a single center. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate our experience with ampulla of Vater tumors at the Creighton University and to establish the role of curative pancreaticoduodenectomy on the long-term survival rate of patients.Between 1975 and 1997, 21 patients (15 M, 6 F) with ampulla of Vater tumors were identified using our tumor registry database. The mean age at diagnosis was 74 years (range 45-85). Family history of other types of cancers was positive in 11 patients. The two most common presenting symptoms were painless jaundice (75%) and abdominal pain (31%).Thirteen patients (62%) underwent curative pancreaticoduodenectomy and eight patients (38%) underwent palliative biliary bypass procedures. Pathological staging of thirteen pancreaticoduodenectomy patients included stage I, 5 patients stage II, 1 patientRadical surgery such as pancreaticoduodenectomy seems to confirm long-term survival in patients with ampulla of Vater tumors especially when no nodal or distant metastases are present at the time of surgery. An aggressive approach, therefore, in such patients is justifiable.
