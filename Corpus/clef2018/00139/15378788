Diagnostic role of secretin-enhanced MRCP in patients with unsuccessful ERCP. To evaluate the value of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in patients in whom endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was unsuccessfully performed by experts in a tertiary center.From January 2000 to June 2003, 22 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The indications for ERCP were obstructive jaundice (n = 9), abnormal liver enzymes (n = 8), suspected chronic pancreatitis (n = 2), recurrent acute pancreatitis (n = 2), or suspected pancreatic cancer (n = 1). The reasons for the ERCP failure were the postsurgical anatomy (n = 7), duodenal stenosis (n = 3), duodenal diverticulum (n = 2), and technical failure (n = 10). MRCP images were evaluated before and 5 and 10 min after i.v. administration of 0.5 IU/kg secretin.The MRCP images were diagnosed in all 21 patients. Five patients gave normal MR findings and required no further intervention. MRCP revealed abnormalities (primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic pancreatitis, cholangitis, cholecystolithiasis or common bile duct dilation) in 10 patients, who were followed up clinically. Four patients subsequently underwent laparotomy (hepaticojejunostomy in consequence of common bile duct stenosis caused by unresectable pancreatic cancer hepaticotomy+Kehr drainage because of insufficient biliary-enteric anastomosisMRCP can assist the diagnosis and management of patients in whom ERCP is not possible.
