Clinical features and management of pancreatic cancer with bone metastases. Prognosis of pancreatic cancer is one of the worst among various cancers, however, incidence of bone metastasis has been increased even in pancreatic cancer in recent years. Therefore, we examined clinical features of pancreatic cancer presenting bone metastases who were treated in our cancer center, and propose how to manage these patients. We experienced 13 patients (7.3%) with pancreatic cancer with bone metastases during 2000-2003. Among these patients, pancreatic cancer was located at pancreatic body to tail in 10 cases, while it was located at pancreatic head in 3 cases. Liver metastasis was noted in 7 of 13 cases with bone metastases. Radiographical imagings of bone lesions revealed osteolytic bone destruction, and serum levels of bone resorption marker, 1CTP, were elevated in these patients. Stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption is a critical step for bone metastasis, thus, serum levels of cytokines (PTHrP, IL-6, VEGF), which exert a promotive effect on bone resorption, were measured. Serum levels of IL-6 and VEGF were elevated in most of these patients, while elevation of serum PTHrP levels was found in 3 of 13 patients with bone metastases. Survival periods of pancreatic cancer patients with bone metastases was not long, however, treatment for bone metastases is important in terms of quality of life (QOL). An earlier diagnosis is essential to prevent deterioration in the QOL of pancreatic cancer patients presenting bone metastases. Periodical measurement of serum 1CTP in addition to bone scintigraphy is helpful for the earlier diagnosis for bone metastases.
