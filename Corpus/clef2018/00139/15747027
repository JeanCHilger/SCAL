The roles of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Over 20 years have passed since the development of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and this technique is now widely used for the diagnosis of digestive and pancreaticobiliary diseases. EUS plays a number of roles in the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic tumors including detection of small tumors, differential diagnosis of tumors, and evaluation of tumor extent.We evaluated the ability of EUS to detect pancreatic carcinoma in comparison with ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT).The overall tumor detection rates were: US, 69% CT, 79%The following points are the future themes of EUS. (1) It will be necessary to foster a large number of operators and to establish a standard EUS scanning technique. (2) Development of a new instrument with high resolution and deep penetration is anticipated. (3) Development of a new medium that can be infused into a vein and that allows diagnosis from B-mode images is much anticipated.
