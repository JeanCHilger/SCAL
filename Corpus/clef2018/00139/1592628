Hemorrhage-induced rupture of the pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage from pseudocyst may be the most serious complication of chronic pancreatitis: the mortality from such hemorrhage approaches 80%. The bleeding arises from a major artery--the artery is eroded by the basic process of autodigestion, and the pseudocyst is converted into a pseudoaneurysm. The wall of the pseudoaneurysm is subjected to arterial pressure and may perforate into the peritoneal cavity, an adjacent segment of the gastrointestinal tract, or the pancreatic ductal system. Clinical signs and indications of complicated pseudocyst are sudden abdominal pain, hypotension, sudden increase in abdominal tenderness, decrease of hematocrit and sudden disappearance of the mass. Sonography, CT and angiography accurately define the bleeding lesion and greatly aid in planning operative strategy. Surgery, angiographic embolisation, or a combination of both may be employed. Transcystic arterial ligation and internal drainage of the pseudocyst or distal pancreatectomy are the operative procedures of choice and give the best results.
