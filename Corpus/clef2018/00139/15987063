Magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas: the future is now. MR imaging has made significant advances in recent years, with an increasingly important role in the detection, characterization, and staging of pancreatic diseases. MRI is appealing as a noninvasive imaging modality as it can evaluate the pancreas, the vasculature, and the pancreaticobiliary ducts in a single examination. Advantages of MRI include its excellent soft tissue contrast resolution and anatomic detail and absence of ionizing radiation. This article reviews the utility of MRI and its use not only as a problem-solving tool but its potential use as a primary examination (similar to CT) in a wide variety of pancreatic diseases.
