Management of pancreatic fistulas after pancreaticoduodenectomy: results in 437 consecutive patients. Pancreatic fistula (PF), a common and potentially lethal complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy, can be managed nonoperatively in most cases.Retrospective case series.Major academic medical and pancreatic surgery center.A total of 437 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for various diagnoses between January 1, 1988, and August 31, 2004.Conservative management of PF with an intraoperatively placed closed-suction drain near the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis, computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage, and surgery.Incidence of PF after pancreaticoduodenectomy and patient outcomes.Fifty-five patients (12.6%) developed a PF, which was most common after resections for ampullary tumors (21.1%) and cystic neoplasms (31.3%), and uncommon after resection for pancreatic cancer (6.5%). The mean number of complications (excluding PF) was greater in the PF group (PF, 1.24 no PF, 0.54Pancreatic fistula is a common problem after pancreaticoduodenectomy. It is associated with increased morbidity, but it does not affect the mortality rate. More than 90% of PF cases can be managed nonoperatively without significantly prolonging hospital stay.
