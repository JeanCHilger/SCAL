Comparison of 2D and 3D sequences for MRCP. Clinical value of the different techniques. Magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreaticograpy (MRCP) is a non-invasive imaging modality of the pancreatico-biliary system which plays an increasingly important role in the clinical and diagnostic workup of patients with biliary or pancreatic diseases. The present review is designed to give an overview of the currently available and appropriate sequences, their technical background, as well as new developments and their relevance to the various clinical issues and challenges. The impact of the latest technical innovations, such as integrated parallel imaging techniques and navigator-based respiratory triggering, on the diagnostic capacities of MRCP is discussed. In this context, the individual value of RARE, T2w single shot turbo/fast spin echo (SSFSE) and the recently introduced 3D T2w turbo/fast spin echo sequences (T2w 3D-T/FSE) is reviewed. RARE imaging may be preferred in severely ill patients with limitations in cooperation, SSFSE is particularly effective in differentiating benign and malignant stenosis, and 3D-FSE offers additional advantages in the detection of small biliary concrements.
