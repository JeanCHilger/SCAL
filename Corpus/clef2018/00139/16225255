Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas discovered after diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and acute pancreatitis. Imaging of the pancreas soon after diagnosis of diabetes can help screen for tumors.A 45 year-old man with recently diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes and no other notable history was found to have intraductal papillary mucinous tumour of the pancreas (IPMTP), a month after an unexplained and benign acute pancreatitis.The histology of IPMTP differs from that of the adenocarcinomas usually described in these circumstances, and they are far rarer. Because they carry the risk of malignant degeneration, early diagnosis is important. Surgery is the only curative treatment and should therefore be discussed.
