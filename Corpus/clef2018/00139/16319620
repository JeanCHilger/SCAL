First case of laryngeal glomangiomyoma. Glomus tumors are derived from the normal glomus body, which is an arteriovenous confluence involved with thermoregulation. These true glomus tumors are different from the "glomus tumors" derived from the paraganglion system often encountered by the otolaryngologist. Glomus tumors have been reported in a variety of locations including the pancreas, perineum, nasal cavity, and torso however, most are found in the extremities. We present the first case of a laryngeal glomangiomyoma. Furthermore, this lesion was successfully excised endoscopically with a CO2 laser.
