Diagnosis of duct disruption and assessment of pancreatic leak with dynamic secretin-stimulated MR cholangiopancreatography. The management of pancreatic duct disruption is complex and depends on several factors including the cause, morphology, and degree of disruption. ERCP can show duct disruption in as many as 75% of patients but is invasive and cannot detect disruption beyond an obstruction. We studied the role of secretin MR cholangiopancreatography in patients with suspected pancreatic duct disruption.Secretin MR cholangiopancreatography is a safe, noninvasive test that can provide additional useful information about duct integrity and facilitate management.
