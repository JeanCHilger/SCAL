Utility of endoscopic ultrasonography on localization of insulinomas. Case report and review of the literature. Insulinoma is the most common endocrine tumors of the pancreas. The diagnosis is suspected by clinical symptoms and confirmed by biologic tests. Because the majority of insulinomas have a small size, the real problem is the localization of these tumors. The non invasive radiologic exams (US, CT Scan, angiography or RMI) are not sensitive for the topographic localization of insulinomas. The invasive exams like per operative US and palpation of the parenchyma or dosage of insulin by transhepatic catheterization of portal vein or in hepatic vein after intrarterial stimulation are very sensitive. The only noninvasive preoperative exam with high sensitivity to localize insulinomas is endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). We report a case of insulinoma localized by EUS with review of the literature.
