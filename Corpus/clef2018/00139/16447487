Pancreatic mass of unusual etiology: case report of metastatic disease after a prolonged lag phase. Although not a typical site, the pancreas does occasionally harbor metastatic disease. Management of these metastases differs from the management of conventional primary cancers. Our case is one of an 85-year-old female presenting with obstructive jaundice and whose workup revealed a pancreatic mass. Her past medical history included a mastectomy 14 years previous for invasive lobular carcinoma. She underwent celiotomy, and an intraoperative diagnosis of metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast was made based on frozen section. Due to pulmonary metastasis and vascular infiltration, which precluded pancreatoduodenectomy, the patient underwent palliative bypass and fared well postoperatively. With more aggressive management of primary breast cancers in the past decade, isolated metastatic disease is of increasing concern and raises questions about surgical strategies to be implemented with these patients. For instance, should palliative treatment be considered or should a radical intention to cure procedure be performed despite the metastatic disease? Factors favoring radical procedures include prolonged lag phase between the primary and the recurrence presence of well-differentiated tumors
