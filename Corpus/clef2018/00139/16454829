Prospective endoscopic ultrasonographic evaluation of the frequency of nonfunctioning pancreaticoduodenal endocrine tumors in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. The frequency of pancreaticoduodenal endocrine tumors in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) remains unknown.To evaluate prospectively with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) the frequency of nonfunctioning (asymptomatic) pancreaticoduodenal tumors.MEN1 patients without functioning pancreatic involvement underwent systematic pancreaticoduodenal EUS in nine GTE (Groupe des Tumeurs Endocrines) centers. Demographic and clinical factors predictive of pancreatic involvement were sought, and standardized biochemical measurements obtained.Between November 1997 and July 2004, 51 patients (median age: 39 [range: 16-71] yr) were studied. MEN1 had been diagnosed 3 [0-20] yr earlier, notably by genetic screening for 26 (51%) with asymptomatic disease. Twenty-five patients had minor biochemical anomalies (<2 x normal (N)) and serum somatostatin was 10.8 N in 1 EUS detected pancreatic lesions in 28 patients (54.9%The frequency of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors is higher (54.9%) than previously thought. The size and number of these tumors can increase over time. Pancreatic EUS should be performed once MEN1 is diagnosed to monitor disease progression.
