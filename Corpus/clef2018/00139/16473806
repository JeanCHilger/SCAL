Magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of pancreatitis and pancreatic neoplasms. This article presents current magnetic resonance imaging techniques for the diagnosis of acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic neoplasms. It emphasises the need for a comprehensive protocol combining imaging sequences of the pancreatic parenchyma with magnetic resonance angiography and secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in order to evaluate the full range of pancreatic inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Imaging characteristics that may indicate a specific diagnosis are discussed.
