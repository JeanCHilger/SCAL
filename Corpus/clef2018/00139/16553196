Severe acute pancreatitis--diagnostic and therapeutic strategy. To establish the optimal diagnosis and therapeutical strategy in severe acute pancreatitis. 94 (56.9%) severe acute pancreatitis (79 males and 15 females, aged between 26 and 81), selected from 165 acute pancreatitis admitted in the last 5 years (2000-2004) were analyzed. The disease was assigned as severe when one or more of the following criteria were present: Ranson score >3 on admission or at 48 hours, APACHE II score >8, visceral failures, Balthazar CT score C, D or E and local complications (infected necrosis, pseudocyst or pancreatic abscess). Medical treatment (aggressive supportive intensive care therapy, minimizing pancreatic secretion and antibiotic therapy) was the first therapeutical step in all cases. 49 (52.1%) patients were operated on: 20 as early surgery imposed by biliary sepsis (16 cases) or by an acute abdomen with uncertain etiology and unfavourable evolution, and 22 as late surgery (at least 12 days after onset), imposed by the presence of the infected pancreatic necrosis, visceral failures or other local complications, the necrosectomy being the main surgical procedure for infected necrosis. 77 (81.9%) cases had a fair evolution. The conservative treatment led to a complete recovery in 37 (37.2%) cases. We registered an overall mortality rate of 12.7% and postoperative mortality rate of 14% we also registered 5 (10.2%) postoperative complications: 4 pancreatic and 1 colonic fistulae. (1) The treatment of the severe acute pancreatitis must be performed only in the specialized multidisciplinary well equipped centers with very well trained staff. (2) Medical conservative treatment (aggressive supportive intensive care therapy and antibiotic therapy) is the main therapeutical method within the acute phase (first two weeks). (3) Very restrictive surgical indications within the acute phase. (4) Necrosectomy is the main surgical procedure for the infected necrosis.
