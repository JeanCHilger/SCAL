ERCP: current uses and less-invasive options. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is well suited for the evaluation and treatment of diseases of the bile ducts and pancreas, but it carries the risk of inducing pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasonography have exceptional value in imaging the gallbladder, common hepatic duct, common bile duct, and pancreas. These imaging studies have replaced ERCP for diagnostic purposes in patients with a low pretest probability of finding lesions amenable to endoscopic therapy, such as bile duct stones.
