Outcomes of surgery for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas. Our objective was to evaluate outcomes of surgery for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (IPMN) in terms of the clinicopathological features.Fifty-seven patients with IPMN were examined using clinicopathological analyses to evaluate appropriate surgical treatment, including total pancreatectomy (TP). IPMN was classified into two types: main-duct type (MD, n = 33) and branch-duct type (BD, n = 24).Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) examinations easily revealed the main site of the lesions. Intraoperative US was the most useful device for diagnosis of lateral spreading, and accuracy rates were 74% for MD and 96% for BD. TP was performed on 16 patients and was appropriate for removing neoplastic lesions with malignancy or malignant potential in 12. Three patients who underwent partial pancreatectomy with involved cancer died of progressive disease. MD is a strong predictive factor in malignancy and indicative of TP. Concerning long-term outcomes, 5 of 16 patients suffered from severe hypoglycemia, and 2 of 16 died from this condition.Partial resection with cancer clearance was applied for BD-type IPMN. TP should be performed on selected patients with MD-type IPMN.
