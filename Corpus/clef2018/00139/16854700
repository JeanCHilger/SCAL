Metastatic pancreatic cancer in late pregnancy: a case report and review of the literature. The occurrence of pancreatic carcinoma in a young patient is rare and even more so in pregnancy. In this case report, we discuss the presentation and management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with lung and liver metastases, diagnosed in a woman in her third trimester of pregnancy (28 weeks). Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging scans were carried out and pancreatic mass biopsy during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed. Severe preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction occurred. A female infant was delivered by cesarean section at 30 weeks of gestation for worsening of maternal clinical conditions and hepatic and pancreatic tests. The patient died 50 days after delivery. Although pancreatic cancer is a very rare event in pregnancy, it should be suspected when epigastric abdominal pain and laboratory parameters suggestive of biliary tract obstruction occur in pregnancy to ensure, at the least, a better pregnancy outcome.
