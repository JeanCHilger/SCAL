Necrolytic migratory erythema as the first manifestation of glucagonoma. A 49-year-old woman suffered from recurrent episodes of necrolytic migratory erythema over the lower legs, lower abdomen, and buttocks for more than two years. Stomatitis, glossitis and vaginitis were the accompanying symptoms and signs during each episode. The result of skin biopsy revealed superficial necrosis in the upper half of the epidermis. Laboratory examinations revealed mild glucose intolerance and hypoaminoacidemia. Fasting plasma glucagon level measured by radioimmunoassay was 890 pg/mL. Oral glucose loading test showed a paradoxical increase in plasma glucagon level up to 1,500 pg/mL. Abdominal echo, computerized axial tomography, and celiac angiography demonstrated a hypervascular tumor, 4 cm in diameters, located at the pancreatic head. Glucagonoma syndrome was confirmed and diagnosed. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor mass. Necrolytic migratory erythema disappeared thereafter, and the plasma glucagon level declined to 120 pg/mL. Histologically, the tumor revealed an islet cell carcinoma composed of moderately uniform cells with a few mitosis, arranged in cords and nests. Abundant characteristic secretory granules of the pancreatic A cell were found within the tumor cells by electron microscopic examination.
