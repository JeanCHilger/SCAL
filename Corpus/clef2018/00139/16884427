Solid and cystic papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas in an 11-year-old girl: imaging features with pathological correlation. Solid and cystic papillary epithelial neoplasms (SCPEN) of the pancreas are rare tumours seen in young women. Pancreatic masses in children are extremely rare and SCPEN should be considered in the radiological differential diagnosis. Although there have been many series of SCPEN reported in the published literature in adults, only two series have focused on paediatric patients. The radiological and histopathological features of SCPEN in a paediatric patient are presented.
