Isolated pancreatic metastasis of extremity myxoid liposarcoma: Report of a case. Myxoid liposarcoma (ML) has a high predilection for extrapulmonary sites of metastases, including intra-abdominal metastases, but pancreatic involvement is extremely rare. Here, we report the case of a 66-year-old male patient, who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for isolated pancreatic metastasis of ML of the left lower extremity that had been excised 6 years before. Completion pancreatectomy was necessitated afterwards for a delayed haemorrage associated with pancreatic fistula. Currently the patient is alive with no evidence of disease. Highly selected patients with isolated pancreatic metastasis of soft tissue sarcoma may benefit from a curative surgical resection.
