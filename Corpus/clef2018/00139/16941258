Hypoplastic pancreas and ectopic spleen as an abdominal mass: a case report. We report a 35-year-old female patient who presented with pseudotumoral abdominal mass with final diagnosis of ectopic spleen and hypoplastic pancreas. Clinical diagnosis is difficult due to lack of symptoms. Laboratory findings are commonly non-specific diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging studies. This patient complained only of abdominal painless mass. The laboratory findings were all within normal limits. Diagnostic images revealed ectopic spleen and absence of the dorsal pancreas. This interesting and rare combination has not been reported previously in the literature.
