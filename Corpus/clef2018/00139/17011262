Highly resolved free-breathing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnostic workup of pancreaticobiliary diseases in infants and young children--initial experiences. A new generation of magnetic resonance imaging scanner offers a 3-dimensional magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) with very high spatial resolution using a non-breath-hold technique with prospective navigator gating. The study aimed to investigate the new technology of the MRCP in infants with suspected pancreaticobiliary diseases.Seven patients (4 girls, 3 boys mean age, 2.8 yearsThe high spatial resolution of the images without breathing artifacts allowed an excellent demonstration of all relevant pancreaticobiliary ducts and of the pathologic findings. All patients (n = 4) with choledocholithiasis were identified through MRCP. The finding of a high pancreaticobiliary junction (n = 3) was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in all cases. The length of the common channel ranged from 16 to 24 mm. In 1 patient, the long common channel was associated with a choledochal cyst. In a 1.7-year-old boy with recurrent abdominal pain and mild pancreatitis, the rare case of a gastric duplication with connection to the main pancreatic duct was diagnosed. A regular gastric wall with normal mucosa and parts of the duodenal wall with a circular layer of muscle (pylorus-like) were found in histology after surgical resection of the mass.The newly developed technique may be a reliable tool in the workup of pancreaticobiliary diseases in infants.
