Chronic alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis. Much of the late morbidity and mortality of acute pancreatitis (AP) is attributed to complications of pancreatic necrosis (PNEC). Early diagnosis of PNEC in high-risk patients is critical to management. Hemoconcentration is one risk factor for PNEC, but additional risk factors are likely implicated.(1) To evaluate a series of preselected clinical factors in a prospectively collected cohort with AP to identify risk factors for PNEC and (2) to verify the relative risk of any newly identified factor(s) by retrospective analysis of a large patient cohort.Phase I: 102 AP patients were prospectively ascertained, of which 77 (mean age 49 yr 35 women, 42 men) underwent contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) and were studied. Eleven subjects developed PNEC (14%). Binary logistic regression was performed to identify any clinical factors associated with PNEC. Phase II: 1,474 anonymized patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of AP were electronically reviewed to identify 359 subjects (mean age 54 yrIn Phase I, only chronic alcohol consumption was identified as a significant new risk factor for the development of PNEC (6/19 vs 5/58, p= 0.02, OR 4.8, CI 1.27-18.2). In Phase II, it was verified that excessive alcohol consumption was a significant risk factor for PNEC (18/52 vs 58/307, p= 0.012, OR 2.27, CI 1.19-4.30).Chronic alcohol consumption seems to constitute a strong risk factor for PNEC.
