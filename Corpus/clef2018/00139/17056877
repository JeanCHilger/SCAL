MRI of islet cell tumors of the pancreas. CT is the most widely used imaging technique for the diagnosis of islet cell tumors, but MRI may be better for detecting small lesions and metastases because of its optimal contrast resolution and ability to easily perform dynamic imaging. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to highlight the MRI features of these tumors and underscore potential pitfalls.Although classically considered well-defined, arterially enhancing lesions that are bright on T2-weighted sequences, pancreatic islet cell tumors have quite a broad spectrum of appearances. MRI is well suited for detecting and characterizing pancreatic islet cell tumors as well as their local effects and metastases.
