Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy: first experience in Mexico. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a recently described diagnostic method that has demonstrated its usefulness in certain clinical conditions.Descriptive and retrospective analysis of the initial experience with EUS-guided FNA at the Hospital General "Dr Manuel Gea Gonz√°lez", during the period between March, 1998 and December, 1999. A Pentax FG 32UA linear echoendoscope was used for all cases, as well as two different types of needles. Procedures were performed under sedation and a cytopathologist was not present during the FNA. The biopsy site, quality of the material obtained, cytological as well as final diagnosis and complications are described.A total of 40 procedures were done. FNA was performed on the pancreas, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, mediastinum, rectum and lymph nodes. A diagnosis was obtained in 75%. In the remaining cases, the material obtained was either inadequate or insufficient for diagnosis. FNA results were confirmed histologically in all cases that underwent surgery. Complication presented in 2.5%, and consisted of one case of self-limited and clinically irrelevant bleeding. The best results were obtained in lymph nodes, mediastinum, liver and pancreatic tumors.This study demonstrated the utility of EUS-guided FNA to obtain cytologic material for diagnosis in a high percentage of cases and with minimal complications. Some factors that could lead to better results were also identified.
