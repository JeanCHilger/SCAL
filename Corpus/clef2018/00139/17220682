Successful CPT-11 treatment in a patient with pancreatic cancer associated with multiple liver metastases and chronic renal failure. A 56-year-old woman, who had been receiving treatment for chronic renal failure, was admitted to our Department because of a tumor of the pancreas head and multiple liver masses diagnosed by abdominal CT scans. Gastroduodenoscopy revealed a tumor which had invaded the Vater's papilla the lesion was histopathologically pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Due to the presence of multiple metastases to the liver, we therefore performed general chemotherapy after obtaining the patient's informed consent (IC). CPT-11 was selected as the carcinostatic agent because the patient suffered from renal failure. The initial dose of CPT-11 was 80 mg, and we thereafter made minor adjustments in the dosage depending on the occurrence of side effects. After four courses of the treatment, a CT scan revealed both the tumor of the pancreas head and the multiple liver masses to have almost completely disappeared. Our clinical results indicate that CPT-11 may therefore be a strong candidate for first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, especially in patients with renal failure.
