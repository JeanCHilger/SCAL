Arterio-venous aneurysm of splenic vessels--a rare differential diagnosis for cardio-circulatory symptoms. Patients with arterio-venous fistula of the splenic hilum seek medical assistance because of abdominal discomfort and symptoms of portal hypertension. We report on a 43 year old female who was diagnosed with an arterio-venous aneurysm after suffering from dyspnoea, tachycardia and extrasystolies for several years. After uncomplicated distal splenopancreatectomy the patient was discharged free of symptoms.
