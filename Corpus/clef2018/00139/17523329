Celiac axis occlusion of a patient undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy after distal gastrectomy. In patients with celiac axis occlusion, performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy involves sacrifice of the gastroduodenal artery which results in a risk of hepato-pancreato-biliary and other organic ischemia. Celiac axis occlusion does not recently seem an uncommon finding in cases of pancreaticoduodenectomy but diagnosis of celiac axis occlusion may be difficult in patients with former abdominal surgery. The present case report shows a patient with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, in whom a preoperative diagnosis of celiac axis occlusion was not proved because of displacement of the celiomesenteric arterial branches based on former distal gastrectomy with Kocher's maneuver. A 56-year-old man with malignant obstruction of the lower bile duct was referred to our hospital for undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. In his past history, the patient had undergone distal gastrectomy reconstructed with Billroth I method due to gastric ulcer. In preoperative abdominal angiography, the celiac axis was not detected at the normal position and was incorrectly recognized to be anomalously originated from the superior mesenteric artery. During surgery, hepatic arterial flow was markedly diminished by clamping of the gastroduodenal artery. Celiac axis occlusion was then proved and the thick and tight median arcuate ligament was detected. Hepatic arterial blood flow was recovered by a complete division of the median arcuate ligament. Postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. In cases of pancreaticoduodenectomy, careful preoperative angiographic diagnosis is needed for patients with celiac axis occlusion who have undergone former gastric surgery because the celio-mesenteric arterial branches have been displaced by Kocher's maneuver. The present report also demonstrates another patient with a typical celiac axis stenosis.
