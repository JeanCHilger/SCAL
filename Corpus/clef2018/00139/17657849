Adult duodenal intussusception associated with congenital malrotation. Enteroenteric intussusception is a condition in which full-thickness bowel wall becomes telescoped into the lumen of distal bowel. In adults, there is usually an abnormality acting as a lead point, usually a Meckels' diverticulum, a hamartoma or a tumour. Duodeno-duodenal intussusception is exceptionally rare because the retroperitoneal situation fixes the duodenal wall. The aim of this report is to describe the first published case of this condition. A patient with duodeno-duodenal intussusception secondary to an ampullary lesion is reported. A 66 year-old lady presented with intermittent abdominal pain, weight loss and anaemia. Ultrasound scanning showed dilated bile and pancreatic ducts. CT scanning revealed intussusception involving the full-thickness duodenal wall. The lead point was an ampullary villous adenoma. Congenital partial (type II) malrotation was found at operation and this abnormality permitted excessive mobility of the duodenal wall such that intussusception was possible. This condition can be diagnosed using enhanced CT. Intussusception can be complicated by bowel obstruction, ischaemia or bleeding, and therefore the underlying cause should be treated as soon as possible.
