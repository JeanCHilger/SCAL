Successful surgical management of a ruptured true pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm following failed transcatheter embolization. A ruptured splanchnic artery aneurysm is a rare clinical entity. Its diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion, and management usually requires a multidisciplinary approach. We present a case of ruptured true pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm in an 83-year-old woman who was initially treated with transcatheter embolization, but it failed to arrest the bleeding, and she subsequently required laparotomy and surgical ligation. The clinical course and management are discussed with a review of the literature.
