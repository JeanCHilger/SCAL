Simultaneous ectopic production of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. Two patients with cancer were evaluated in whom there was evidence for the simultaneous ectopic production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin (CT). One patient had a gastric carcinoid and the other had a pancreatic islet cell carcinoma. Abnormal concentrations of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin were demonstrated by radioimmunoassay in the peripheral blood of each patient and in the gastric tumor. In the pancreatic tumor, immunohistologic studies also demonstrated the presence of CT and PTH and suggested that each hormone was produced by different cells of the tumor. Plasma concentrations of the hormones responded to functional tests of secretion and to tumor chemotherapy. These studies demonstrate the simultaneous ectopic production of the two physiologically antagonistic hormones, PTH and CT, and confirm their value as diagnostic markers for several types of malignancies.
