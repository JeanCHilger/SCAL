Endoscopic ultrasonography coupled with fine needle aspiration biopsy of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumours of the pancreas. Tool or gadget? A report of three cases. We report three cases of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumour of the pancreas, occurring over a brief period in our surgical unit. Symptoms were aspecific in two cases, while only one of the patients presented a picture of acute pancreatitis. Preoperative investigations included ultrasonography, abdominal CT-scan and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) of the cyst. EUS furnished invaluable data about the neoplasm and pancreatic duct morphology, while EUS-FNAB was crucial in revealing cytological features highly suggestive of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumour. All three patients underwent surgical resection, (two pylorus-preserving pancreatico-duodenectomies and one total pancreatectomy). The histological features of the resected specimen confirmed the preoperative EUS-FNAB diagnosis. After a medium-term follow-up, patients have been free of abdominal symptoms with no evidence of recurrence at CT-scan. In the present study we analyse the feasibility and effectiveness of EUS and EUS-FNAB in diagnosing intraductal papillary-mucinous tumours and in predicting their malignancy.
