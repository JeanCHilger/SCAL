Diagnosis of pancreatic lesions: possibilities of cytology. The pancreas is relatively inaccessible to conventional methods of study and is difficult to investigate because of its anatomic location. Different imaging techniques have made it possible to detect tumors with diameters in the range of 1 cm. Endoscopic methods (lavage and cytologic brush methods) never proved successful enough to obtain diagnostic material. Combination among aspiration cytology, different X-ray methods, and ultrasound scanning have been reported to give astonishingly accurate results: many reports indicate its value. The following paper describes our experiences with this method for examination of pancreatic lesions and presents our own results.
