Adenocarcinoma and concomitant intraductal papillary adenoma in the pancreas. A 72-year-old man was found to have a 12 mm solid lesion in the pancreatic tail and an 8 mm cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas by computed tomography carried out during a routine follow-up study of his adult-onset diabetes mellitus. A distal pancreatectomy was performed revealing the pancreas to have an adenocarcinoma in the tail and a conglomeration of intraductal papillary adenoma in the body. A review of the literature disclosed similar coexistences of cystadenoma and carcinoma in four patients, none of which was documented with preoperative imaging features such as we had.
