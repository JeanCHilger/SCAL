Pancreatic tuberculosis: an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice accessible to endoscopic management. Tuberculosis of the pancreas is unusual and often secondary to generalized tuberculosis. In most cases clinical presentation is obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic mass lesion. Although diagnosis is usually obtained after resection of the mass lesion, endoscopic procedures might avoid non-necessary surgical procedure. We report a clinical case of pancreatic tuberculosis diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy and treated by biliary stenting.
