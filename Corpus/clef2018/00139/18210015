CA 19-9 in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. CA 19-9 is still used in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. As it has been shown to be elevated in many other non-pancreatic diseases--sometimes even extraordinarily--this marker should not be used to set the diagnosis of a pancreas carcinoma anymore. Especially if there is a concomitant cholestasis there is no diagnostic value to perform the measurement of CA 19-9. As the histological confirmation is the only way to get the exact diagnosis endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy should be considered in lesions of the pancreatic head.
