Imaging-guided percutaneous abdominal biopsy. Guided percutaneous biopsy has become an important means of diagnosing abdominal lesions. This technique provides necessary pathologic information without resorting to open biopsy. Fluoroscopy, sonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be used for needle guidance, depending on the patient's condition and the size and location of the lesion. These variables also influence selection of needle gauge, tip configuration, and sampling mechanism. The authors describe appropriate techniques for percutaneous biopsy of hepatic, renal, pancreatic, adrenal, and retroperitoneal lesions.
