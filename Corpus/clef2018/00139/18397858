Clinical analysis of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: report of 15 cases. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas (SPTP) is an uncommon and enigmatic pancreatic neoplasm that occurs mainly in young women. Although more and more cases have been reported in recent years, misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment still frequently take place. This study was designed to stimulate consideration of this tumor.We retrospectively reviewed the experience of diagnosis and treatment of 15 patients with SPTP and compared them with 516 patients with pancreatic cancer from January 1997 to March 2007.Most of the SPTP cases were asymptomatic except for one palpable mass. Almost all SPTPs demonstrated a solid structure with hypo- or iso-attenuation, cystic structure with hypo-attenuation on pre-contrast CT scan, and enhancement of solid portions on post-contrast CT scan. By contrast, most cases of pancreatic carcinoma had multiple symptoms and abnormal blood results. The tumors showed hypo-attenuation on both pre-contrast and post-contrast CT scan, and only a few showed iso-attenuation on post-contrast CT scan. All cases of SPTP in our group were cured by surgical resection, while only 16.86% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma could undergo a radical resection.Clinical features and CT scans were helpful to differentiate SPTP from pancreatic carcinoma. Radical surgical resection was the most effective and safe method for the treatment of SPTP.
