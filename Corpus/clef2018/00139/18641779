Pancreatic adenocarcinoma in young patient diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography. The Pancreatic adenocarcinoma appears generally in patients with more than 60 years old. Their finding in young people is very rare. We report the case of a man of 29 years diagnosed and treated in the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases (INEN), that presented symptoms as: dorsalgia, jaundice and weight loss. The tomografic image showed a mass located in the head of the pancreas with hepatic and ganglionar metastases. It was evaluated by means of endoscopic ultrasonography (USE) and performed a directed fine needle puncture aspiration (PAAF), that obtained a bad differentiated adenocarcinoma from the pancreas. An endoscopic biliary drainage by PCRE was realized later and treatment with chemotherapy started. We present the case by the unusual occurrence in the related age group and by the importance of the puncture guided by endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis and handling of this pathology [corrected]
