A comparative study of endoscopic ultrasonography versus endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in children with chronic liver disease. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a less invasive modality and may be equal or superior to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in visualizing the biliary tree. Its role and feasibility in children need to be accurately defined.This study aimed at evaluation of EUS in assessment of children with chronic liver disease (CLD) in comparison with ERCP.The present study was carried out between September 2004 and February 2006 on 40 children suffering from CLD. Patients were selected from the Pediatric Hepatology Unit, Cairo University Children's Hospital, Egypt. They were included if they had: sonographic (n = 8) or histopathological evidence of biliary pathology (n = 2) autoimmune hepatitis with high gamma glutammyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels and/or not responding to immunosuppressive therapy (n = 15)Three of six cases with intrahepatic biliary radicle dilatation had Caroli's disease by EUS and ERCP and the other 3 had sclerosing cholangitis. EUS was equal to ERCP in diagnosis of biliary pathology. However, one false positive case was described to have dilatation and tortuosity of the pancreatic duct by EUS as compared to ERCP. EUS could detect early pancreatitis in 5 cases. One case with cryptogenic liver disease proved to have sclerosing cholangitis by both EUS and ERCP.EUS is an important diagnostic tool for biliary pathology and pancreatitis in children with pancreatico-biliary pathology. ERCP should be reserved for therapeutic purposes.
