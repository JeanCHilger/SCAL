Three elderly cases of renal cell carcinoma with pancreatic metastasis. Three elderly patients, (an 80-year-old female, 78-year-old female and 78-year-old male) suffering from renal cell carcinoma with pancreatic metastasis were reported. In all cases, renal cell carcinoma had been diagnosed previously. Pancreatic tumors were revealed by computed tomography and ultrasonic study during subsequent admission in all cases. In the first case, laparotomy and histological examination proved that pancreatic tumor was metastatic from renal cell carcinoma. In the other cases, according to their clinical course and other laboratory data, we considered the pancreatic tumors to be metastatics from renal cell carcinoma though histological diagnosis was not obtained.
