The role of contrast enhancement in the computed tomography for pancreas cancer diagnostics. Data of abdominal CT scan of 33 patients with morphologically verified cancer of the pancreas are analyzed. Advantages of bolus contrast enhancement for the CT diagnostics of pancreatic cancer are proved. Low diagnostic value of manual contrast injection in comparison with its bolus introduction is stated. Pancreas cancer can not be detected in 64% of patients at the native CT scanning, and in 58% at the deferred phase of contrast excretion. Whereas only 6 and 9% of cases fail to prove the disease at arterial and portal contrast excretion phases, correspondingly. Thus, execution of the wrong modality of CT scanning and method of contrast introduction leads to misdiagnosis of the disease.
