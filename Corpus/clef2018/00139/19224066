Annular pancreas in an adult patient: diagnosis with endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Annular pancreas is an uncommon congenital anomaly that usually presents early in childhood. The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of this condition has been only sparsely reported. We present annular pancreas in a 50-year-old man the anomaly was initially suspected during endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography, and subsequently confirmed on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.
