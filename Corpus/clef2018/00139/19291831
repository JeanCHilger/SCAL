Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in chronic calcifying pancreatitis: egg or hen? Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is an increasingly reported entity. Extensive pancreatic calcification is generally thought to be a sign of chronic pancreatitis, but it may occur simultaneously with IPMN leading to diagnostic difficulties. We report a case of a patient initially diagnosed with chronic calcifying pancreatitis who was later shown to have a malignant IPMN. This case illustrates potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of IPMN in the case of extensive pancreatic calcification as well as clues that may lead the clinician to suspecting the diagnosis. The possible mechanisms of the relation between pancreatic calcification and IPMN are also reviewed.
