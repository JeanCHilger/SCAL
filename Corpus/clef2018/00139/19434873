Pancreatic tumors. The management of pancreatic cancer is complex and prognosis is poor. The etiopathogenesis of pancreatic cancer has been related to several factors, such as diabetes mellitus, smoking and alcohol use, the presence of pancreatic cystic lesions and distinct genetic syndromes. Among the diagnostic options, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) continues to be developed, with the use of elastography, contrast agents and EUS-guided aspiration and the application of technical improvements that increase diagnostic efficacy (such as the use of specific stains, new aspiration needles, etc.). New biomarkers are also being sought that would help in differential diagnosis, such as M2PK, adiponectin, and Reg4. Among prognostic factors, the importance of nodal involvement and study of surgical resection margins has been confirmed. The role of individual predisposition in determining response to specific treatments continues to be investigated. Research also continues into the development of EUS-guided injection of therapeutic substances and the role of oncological treatment, with new data on the utility of gemcitabine and of statins as mediators of angiogenic suppression or of high-dose vitamin C with cytotoxic effects. Notable in the field of palliative treatment is the development of new biliary stents that aim to reduce obstruction rates. The development of EUS and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration has been crucial in cystic pancreatic tumors, especially in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions or those with potential for malignant transformation (presence of mural modules, dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, the presence of masses, CEA levels, etc.). The characteristics of these tumors must be determined to evaluate whether surgery or conservative management is the best therapeutic option.
