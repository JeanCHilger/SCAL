Pancreas divisum. Pancreas divisum is the most frequent congenital disease of the pancreas. It results from the failure of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to fuse. It is responsible primarily for recurrent acute pancreatitis, chronic abdominal pain, and chronic pancreatitis. It is diagnosed today by MRI. Treatment is recommended only for symptomatic patients. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is the main treatment, and its results are good for most patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis. Surgical sphincteroplasty is indicated if endoscopic treatment fails.
