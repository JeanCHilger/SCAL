Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy coupled with KRAS mutation assay to distinguish pancreatic cancer from pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis. Differential diagnosis between pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PADC) and pseudotumoral forms of chronic pancreatitis remains difficult. Mutation of KRAS oncogene is present in 75% to 95% of PADC. This study aimed to evaluate whether the combined analysis of KRAS mutation with cytopathological findings from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) might improve discrimination between PADC and chronic pancreatitis.This prospective multicenter study included 178 patients with solid pancreatic masses (men 104, women 74 mean age 64.5 years). Cytopathological examination and KRAS mutation analysis (codon-12 and codon-13, restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP] and direct sequencing) were performed on EUS-FNAB material. Final diagnoses were obtained on EUS-FNAB analysis and/or a second biopsy and/or clinical follow-up and/or surgery: PADC, n = 129KRAS status analysis was successful in all EUS-FNAB samples. Codon-12 KRAS point mutation was found in 66% of PADC samples. No case of chronic pancreatitis displayed KRAS mutation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of cytopathology alone for diagnosis of PADC versus chronic pancreatitis were 83%, 100%, 100%, 56% and 86%, respectively. When KRAS mutation analysis was combined with cytopathology, these values reached 88%, 100%, 100%, 63% and 90% respectively.Although the value of KRAS analysis in addition to EUS-FNAB is limited for distinguishing pancreatic mass lesions, when chronic pancreatitis presented as a pseudotumor a negative finding (wild-type KRAS), was useful in strongly suggesting a benign lesion.
