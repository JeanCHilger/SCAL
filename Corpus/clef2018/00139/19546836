The usefulness of perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in advanced pancreatic cancer. Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the changes of signal intensity in tumors. We evaluated the prognostic value of perfusion-weighted MRI in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (PC).Perfusion-weighted MRI was performed before treatment on 27 consecutive patients with advanced PC. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages of patients were as follows (8, stage III 19, stage IV). Imaging acquisition was continually repeated with echo planar sequence every 2 seconds for 2 minutes after a bolus injection of gadolinium. We made a time intensity curve of PC and calculated the signal ratio (SR) on perfusion-weighted imaging. We assessed the relation between SR and clinical factors including tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, and so on. Patients were divided into low and high SR group and compared SR with the overall survival.All cases showed transient decreases signal intensity (SR, 6.9-55.7%). These patients were classified into 2 groups at cutoff median SR of 22.0% The high SR group significantly correlated with the higher stage (P=0.03) and the presence of lymph node metastasis (P=0.04). The high SR group had significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.04).Perfusion-weighted MRI may predict the survival in advanced PC patients.
