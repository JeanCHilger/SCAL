Pancreatic fusocellular sarcoma. The importance of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration in the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic tumors. In the presence of a pancreatic tumor, the main diagnostic problem is to determine the benign o malignant nature of the lesion, and then to evaluate its resectability. A preoperative biopsy was usually rejected based on the fact that negative results do not exclude malignancy, that such biopsy may hamper the possibility of curative surgery because of potential seeding along the biopsy s trajectory, that surgical morbidity and mortality are low, and also because of the high diagnostic sensitivity of the various imaging techniques. Biopsy for solid pancreatic tumors was limited to irresectable tumors, and isolated cases with suspicion of tuberculosis, lymphoma or neuroendocrine tumors. Nowadays the performance of a pancreatic biopsy is becoming essential for the correct management of solid lesions, and is useful not only to establish malignancy, but also for a better knowledge of all kind of pathologies and, thus, for better therapeutic management. In this context, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has proven a safe technique with a low rate of complications and a diagnostic accuracy superior to other procedures, this being considered the method of choice for the study of solid pancreatic lesions. An illustrative example is the case we report in this article -a patient diagnosed of a solid, locally advanced-stage pancreatic tumor with imaging techniques (abdominal ultrasounds and EUS) under EUS-guided FNA the procedure could establish a final diagnosis of pancreatic fusocellular sarcoma.
