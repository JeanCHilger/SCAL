Are pancreatic calcifications specific for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis? A multidetector-row CT analysis. To retrospectively establish the most frequently encountered diagnoses in patients with pancreatic calcifications and to investigate whether the association of certain findings could be helpful for diagnosis.One hundred and three patients were included in the study. The location and distribution of calcifications presence, nature, and enhancement pattern of pancreatic lesionsPatients had chronic pancreatitis (n=70), neuroendocrine tumours (n=14), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n=11), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=4), serous cystadenoma (n=4). Four CT findings had a specificity of over 60% for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis: parenchymal calcifications, intraductal calcifications, parenchymal atrophy, and cystic lesions. When at least two of these four criteria were used in combination, 54 of 70 (77%) patients with chronic pancreatitis could be identified, but only 17 of 33 (51%) patients with other diseases. When at least three of these four criteria were present, a specificity of 79% for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was achieved.Certain findings are noted more often in chronic pancreatitis than in other pancreatic diseases. The presence of a combination of CT findings can suggest chronic pancreatitis and be helpful in diagnosis.
