Hepatic and pancreatic tomometry. Radioanatomy and application to hepatic pathology. More than 250 hepatic and pancreatic tomometries were carried out on a first generation tomometer. Anatomical and tomometric correspondances carried out on the cadaver led to precise radiological anatomy of the abdomen. Tomometry either alone or carried out after impregnation of the liver parenchyma with an emusion of lipiodol in low dosage permits one to demonstrate hepatic lesions of the order of one centimeter diameter whatever their localisation. Densitometry differentiates not only solid lesions from fluid lesions but permits in certain cases a diagnosis of the nature of the lesion.
