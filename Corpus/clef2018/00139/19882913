A case of Hodgkin's lymphoma in a patient with sarcoidosis. A 61-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for examination of an abnormal shadow on her chest X-ray film taken in October 2006. Chest CT film taken in November 2006 revealed lymphadenopathy in the left side of the neck, as well as in the supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, and hilar areas, as well as around the pancreas. Diffuse small nodules were seen along the bronchovascular bundles and interlobular pleura. Bronchoscopic examination revealed lymphocyte accumulation and increased CD4/8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Based on noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas seen in transbronchial lung biopsy, we diagnosed having sarcoidosis. In April 2008, she complained of abdominal discomfort and a skin lesion. New lymphadenopathy was palpated on the right side of the neck and the left axillary region. On a chest X-ray film and chest CT film, multiple swollen lymph nodes which became even more swollen than those in November 2006 were observed. She received surgical resection of the neck lymph nodes and a pathological diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma was established. This was a rare case of sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome.
