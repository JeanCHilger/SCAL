A long-term survival case of pancreatic cancer with hepatic metastasis after pancreaticoduodenectomy successfully treated by s-1 and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy. Gemcitabine monotherapy is accepted as a standard first-line treatment for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. On another front, S-1 and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy is challenging but promising. We report a long-term survival case of pancreatic cancer with hepatic metastasis after surgical resection treated by S-1 and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy. A 59-year-old woman was diagnosed as locoregionally advanced pancreas head cancer without metastatic disease. Pancreatoduodenectomy with regional lymph node dissection was performed after preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Pathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A solitary hepatic metastasis was detected by CT imaging one year after the surgery. The patient received 35 courses of S-1 and gemcitabine combination therapy. The metastatic tumor was disappeared, and serum CEA decreased to a normal level. S-1 and gemcitabine combination therapy is not only effective but also well tolerated and safe. This combination therapy should be considered one of selective choices for advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
