Single-session endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for evaluation of pancreaticobiliary disorders. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) often are required in the evaluation and treatment of patients with pancreaticobiliary disorders. Few reports of single-session EUS-ERCP have raised questions regarding its safety and accuracy or about which procedure should be performed first.Data from 2005 to 2009 were reviewed from a prospectively maintained EUS-ERCP database at a single tertiary care cancer center. Sensitivity and specificity of EUS and fine-needle aspiration (FNA), bile duct cannulation rate, duration of procedure, and complications were evaluated.Of the 35 patients (15 men and 20 women) studied, 28 had a final diagnosis of malignancy, and 7 had benign disorders. All the patients underwent ERCP and EUS, with FNA performed for 28 patients (80%). For 22 of the 35 patients (62.8%), EUS was the first procedure performed. The sensitivity of EUS-FNA for malignancy was 96.4%. The bile duct cannulation rate during ERCP was 97.1%. Five patients required a precut sphincterotomy for bile duct access, and one patient with chronic pancreatitis had a failed cannulation despite a EUS-guided rendezvous. A stent was successfully placed in 29 patients (96%). No major complications occurred, and no contrast leak was seen when FNA was performed before the cholangiogram. One patient had periduodenal bleeding after FNA, which was managed conservatively. The mean duration of the procedure was 83.7 min.Single-session EUS-ERCP can be performed safely and with efficacy similar to that of the procedures performed separately.
