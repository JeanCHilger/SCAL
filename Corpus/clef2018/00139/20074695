Analysis of anatomic variants of mesenteric veins by 3-dimensional portography using multidetector-row computed tomography. It is important to be aware of mesenteric venous variants to perform peripancreatic surgery. We investigated the usefulness of 3-dimensional (3-D) portography.Vessels were reconstructed using computer software in 102 patients undergoing multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) scheduled for gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery.The superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was composed of single and double trunks around the splenoportal confluence in 78 and 24 patients, respectively. The inferior mesenteric vein joined the splenic vein (68.5%), SMV (18.5%), and splenoportal confluence (7.6%). The left gastric vein joined the splenic vein (46.3%), portal vein (39.0%), and splenoportal confluence (14.7%). Seventy-nine patients showed a gastrocolic trunk, mostly composed of the right gastroepiploic vein and veins from the colonic hepatic flexure. Intraoperative findings were identical to 3-D diagnosis in 68 gastrectomized and 9 pancreatectomized patients.Although mesenteric venous tributaries are complex, 3-D portography is helpful for surgeons to safely perform peripancreatic surgery.
