Malignant insulinoma with hepatic and pulmonary metastases associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Case report and review of the literature. Malignant insulinomas are rare tumors (10% of insulinomas) that often present as mnulticentric macro nodules with multiple liver metastases before diagnosis. We report the case of a 55 year old female with a medical history of severe hypoglycemic attacks for two months. Blood tests showed a decreased value of glycemia (30 mg/dl) associated with increased insulin level (l6 microU/ml) and an increased glycemia/insulinemia ratio of 1.87 supporting the diagnosis of insulinoma. Abdominal CT showed a 1.5 cm mass localized in the head of the pancreas with disseminated hepatic tumors, confirmed as neuroendocrine metastases by biopsy (which proved the presence of a malignant insulinoma). Primary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed based on mild elevation of calcium (10.4 mg/dl) associated with a high level of PTH (71.2 pg/ml). The coexistence of the two endocrinopathies suggested the presence of type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 1). Because of multiple hepatic masses and liver function impairment, surgery and hepatic artery embolization were not performed. Somatostatin analog therapy was started with symptomatic control in the beginning, but rapid loss of beneficial effect. Finally, systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin was administered, but the disease was progressive and after three months we decided to stop it. The patient died at home after one month, probably in hypoglycemic coma.
