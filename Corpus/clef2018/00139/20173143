Pathways of extrapancreatic perineural invasion by pancreatic adenocarcinoma: evaluation with 3D volume-rendered MDCT imaging. The purpose of this article is to familiarize radiologists with the common pathways of extrapancreatic perineural invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to highlight the potential value of 3D volume-rendered MDCT in its diagnosis.The perineural plexuses closely follow peripancreatic vessels, which are well depicted by contrast-enhanced 3D volume-rendered imaging, thus facilitating the diagnosis of extrapancreatic perineural invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
