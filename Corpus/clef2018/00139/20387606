Treatment of patients with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudoaneurysms of the celiac trunk basin arteries. The authors have analyzed results of treatment of 26 patients with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudoaneurysms. Hospitalization and treatment of such patients should be performed in specialized hospitals which can fulfill special examination in detail and carry out roentgen-endovascular operations. Intraintestinal bleeding is an absolute indication for emergent surgery for performing hemostasis. Conservative treatment is indicated for intestinal bleedings and after arrest of bleeding the patients should be transported to specialized institutions. Two types of the appearance of pseudoaneurysms were established depending on the pathological mechanism: when there was a relationship of the pseudocyst with the main pancreatic duct (I type) and when there was not (II type). For the I type roentgen-endovascular treatment (RET) followed by operation is indicated, for the II type RET is thought to be enough.
