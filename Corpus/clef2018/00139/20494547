Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas: long-term follow-up measurement of growth rate. To measure the growth rate of microcystic subtype serous adenomas of the pancreas diagnosed by imaging.For this retrospective study, 241 imaging studies were reviewed from 1998 to 2005. Thirty-one patients met our strict diagnostic imaging inclusion criteria and had at least 18 months of imaging follow-up. Patient demographics and lesion imaging characteristics were tested as predictors of growth.Growth was measured over a mean period of 42 months. There was a significant (P = .0004) linear growth of tumour for the population. There was significant clustering (P = .001) of the population into 2 growth rates: 0.50 mm/y (n = 23) and 5.5 mm/y (n = 8). The diameter of the lesion at presentation was significantly correlated with growth (r = 0.45 P = .01).The microcystic subtype of serous cystadenomas of the pancreas diagnosed with imaging criteria demonstrates 2 distinct and slow growth rates. The size of the lesion at presentation is correlated with growth rate.
