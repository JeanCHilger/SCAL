Insulinoma associated with pregnancy. A 42-year-old woman was found by her husband with unconsciousness and seizure at night three weeks after delivery of her fifth child. At a blood glucose level of 25 mg/dl, she received an intravenous infusion of glucose by the called emergency physician, leading to a rapid improvement of her symptoms.The following examination showed a low basal blood glucose level as well as pathological levels of insulin and C-peptide. These findings together with the Whipple trias (hypoglycaemia, neurological symptoms and rapid improvement after infusion of glucose) were highly suspicious of an insulinoma. Whereas CT, MRI and DOTATOC-PET were negative, endoscopic ultrasound showed a mass of 13 mm in the tail of the pancreas.The tumour was resected from the tail of the pancreas by laparoscopic enucleation. Histological examination revealed an endocrine tumour (insulinoma) of the pancreas. Postoperative blood glucose levels were within the normal range. The patient and her healthy newborn child could be dismissed from hospital on the third day after surgery.Despite its rarity, an insulinoma represents an important differential diagnosis of hypoglycaemia during and right after pregnancy.
