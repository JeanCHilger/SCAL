CT angiography of the celiac trunk: anatomy, variants and pathologic findings. Celiac trunk variants and pathologies are relatively common occurrences. With the advent of computed tomography (CT) technology, these conditions are being diagnosed with an increased frequency even among asymptomatic patients. CT angiography is used noninvasively for preoperative staging and vascular mapping in patients with pancreatic and hepatobiliary neoplasm. Multidetector-row CT (MDCT) also allows the accurate depiction of the abdominal splanchnic vessels for stenosis, collateral vessels and atherosclerotic plaques. In this study, we describe the normal anatomy and variants of the celiac trunk as well as associated pathologic conditions, such as stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm and median arcuate ligament compression syndrome. The overall aim of this study was to emphasize the clinical importance of these abnormalities.
