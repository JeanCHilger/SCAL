Diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is based on a typical history with recurrent flares of acute inflammation, imaging procedures and some laboratory tests. Using imaging procedures (abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), a diagnosis can only be made when alterations in size (enlargement or atrophy) or shape of the pancreas or changes in intrapancreatic structure (dilation, obstruction of ducts), calcifications, or changes in peripancreatic organs have occurred. Tests of exocrine pancreatic function are not essential for making a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
