Abdominal imaging in child abuse. Abdominal injuries in abused children are less common than musculoskeletal and craniocerebral injuries however they carry high mortality and morbidity rates. In every case of trauma, regardless of aetiology, radiologists are responsible for the documentation and evaluation of injuries.Any abdominal injury pattern maybe observed following physical abuse and none is specific for abuse. However, a high index of suspicion should be maintained for every case of pancreatic, hollow viscous and other solid organ injuries, especially when there is delay in seeking help, a history of trauma to the child or siblings, young age, undernourishment, ecchymosis in non-ambulatory children or a non-plausible explanation for the injuries based on the provided history and the psychomotor condition of the child.CT with intravenous contrast material is the imaging modality of choice in every suspected inflicted abdominal injury. US could be the first imaging test for abused children with a low probability of abdominal injury and for follow-up. Upper gastrointestinal series could reveal acute or resolving mural haematomas in children with equivocal CT or US findings.Child abuse should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal symptoms in young children.
