Pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma 25 years after radical nephrectomy. We report a case of pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma detected 25 years after radical nephrectomy. A 74-year-old man, who had undergone radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma at age 49, was found by computed tomography to have a strongly enhanced mass on the pancreatic head. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and the pathological diagnosis was metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This was evidently a slow growing tumor because the metastatic pancreas tumor was well demarcated and the metastasis was found 25 years after the primary operation. Aggressive surgical treatment of isolated metastatic lesions offers a chance of long-term survival. Patients with a history of RCC should undergo a long-term follow-up to detect and evaluate metastasis to pancreas as well as other organs.
