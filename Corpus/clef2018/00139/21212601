A case of severe acute pancreatitis and ischemic gastropathy caused by acute aortic dissection. A 49-year-old man presented with chest pain and was given a diagnosis of aortic dissection based on computed tomography (CT) findings. Two days later the dissection reached the origin of the celiac artery and there was poor blood flow from the body to the tail of the pancreas and fundus of the stomach wall. Severe acute pancreatitis developed. Endoscopy showed a near-circumferential gastric ulcer in the gastric cardia and we diagnosed ischemic gastropathy. A fistula between the area of infected pancreatic necrosis and the stomach had formed spontaneously and the necrotic tissue was draining into the stomach. His recovery was uneventful.
