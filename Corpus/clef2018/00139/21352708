Complex partial seizure in patient with insulinoma: importance of early diagnosis. Insulinoma, usually benign (90%), is clinically characterized by symptoms as tremulousness, tachycardia, weakness, sweating, fatigue, hunger, headache, dizziness, disorientation and unconsciousness. However rarely it has an unusual presentation. We present a case of insulinoma misdiagnosed as neurologic disease. A 48-year-old man was admitted to our Emergency Division because of car accident caused by loss of consciousness. A diagnosis of complex partial seizure was made one year before. The patient appeared pale, tachycardic, BP 130/85 mmHg. Laboratory tests showed a severe hypoglycemia (30 mg/dl). He was treated with hypertonic glucose solution and the resolution of symptoms was obtained. Dosages of insulin and C-peptide, CT-scan and RMN confirmed a diagnosis of insulinoma. Seizure disappeared after surgical excision. The diagnosis of insulinoma is sometimes delayed up to more than 20 years. Neurologic or psychiatric presentation like disorientation, personality changes, amnesia, irritability, seizures, bizarre behavior, visual difficulties, neuropathy in patients affected by insulinoma could be cause of misdiagnosis. Diagnosis of insulinoma should always be considered whenever these symptoms occur, especially if unresponsive to specific therapy. Insulinoma is curable in most cases and an early diagnosis can avoid adverse consequences including neurologic damage.
