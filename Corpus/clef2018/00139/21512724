Diffusion-weighted MRI of focal cystic pancreatic lesions at 3.0-Tesla: preliminary results. To determine the utility of 3.0-Tesla diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for focal cystic pancreatic lesion (FCPL) characterization.55 FCPL (34 IPMN, 5 serous cystadenoma, and 16 inflammatory) were evaluated. Two radiologists reviewed in consensus DW-MRI images. Reference standard was obtained from patient history, cytological and histopathology data, FCPL fluid analysis, and follow-up imaging results. Signal intensity (SI) and apparent diffusion coefficient values (ADC) of FCPL and normal pancreas were measured. FCPL-to-pancreas SI and ADC ratios were also calculated.Qualitatively, 11 of 21 non-mucinous vs. 4 of 34 mucinous lesions appeared hyperintense at b value of 1,000 s/mm(2) (P = 0.02). Three FCPL demonstrated restricted diffusion: all inflammatory. Significant differences in mean ADC between neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic (P = 0.009), and mucinous vs. non-mucinous (P = 0.013) lesions were demonstrated. FCPL-to-pancreas ADC and SI ratios demonstrated significant differences between neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic lesions [ADC, (P = 0.019) SI for b values 750 (P = 0.010) and 1,000 s/mm(2) (P = 0.017)] and mucinous vs. non-mucinous lesions [ADC (P = 0.018)Although mean ADC values and FCPL-to-pancreas SI and ADC ratios may be helpful in differentiating FCPL, characterization of individual FCPL by means of 3.0-Tesla DW-MRI appears limited.
