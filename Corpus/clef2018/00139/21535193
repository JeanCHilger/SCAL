The role of linear array EUS for diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies in the current situation. Over the last few decades, the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies has greatly increased by allowing earlier diagnosis and appropriate staging. The development of linear array EUS also allows fine needle aspiration (FNA) to be carried out under real-time EUS guidance and offers definitive diagnosis, which has fundamentally changed the diagnostic approach to pancreatic malignancies. Moreover, linear array EUS with the EUS-FNA technique has a therapeutic application that has expanded the role of this procedure in the management of pancreatic malignancies. This review will focus on the features of linear array EUS and discuss the current role of linear array EUS in the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies.
