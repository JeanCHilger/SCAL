Histological diagnosis by EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in pancreatic solid masses without on-site cytopathologist: a single-center experience. There are few reports on the histological diagnostic ability of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in a large-series of pancreatic masses. In the present study therefore we retrospectively evaluated the histological diagnostic ability of EUS-FNA in pancreatic masses without on-site cytopathologist. In 355 patients with pancreatic solid masses, EUS-FNA was carried out. EUS-FNA histology showed accuracy, 90.7% sensitivity, 89.5%
