Pancreatic splenosis demonstrated by contrast-enhanced sonography. Pancreatic splenosis is a very rare condition whose features on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported. We present the imaging findings in a case of pancreatic splenosis, in which a confident diagnosis was achieved with the use of CEUS and confirmed by a labeled heat denatured red cell scan. Accumulation of ultrasound contrast microbubbles in splenic tissue can be readily visualized on late-phase CEUS and this technique has already been used to confirm the nature of intrapancreatic accessory spleens. This case shows that it can also confirm the diagnosis of splenosis.
