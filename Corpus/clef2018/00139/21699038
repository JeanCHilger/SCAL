Exceptional, potentially fatal combination of emphysematous pancreatitis and gas-forming cholecystitis: successful multidisciplinary conservative treatment supported by repeated CT-staging. Usually considered as a life-threatening disease, emphysematous pancreatitis requires early diagnosis and aggressive multidisciplinary treatment including the Departments of Gastroenterology, Intensive Care Medicine, Interventional Radiology and even Surgery. The prognosis for emphysematous cholecystitis is also quite poor. It requires surgery even if a percutaneous cholecystostomy can contribute to a temporary stabilization of the patient. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice to detect emphysematous pancreatitis and gas-forming cholecystitis. It enables their grading and helps identify their complications. Moreover, it proves essential in the follow-up of the lesions.
