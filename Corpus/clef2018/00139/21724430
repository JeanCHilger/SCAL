Adenocarcinoma arising in an ectopic mediastinal pancreas. Pancreatic ectopia in the mediastinum is rare, and there are no reports that it has ever given rise to malignancy. Here we report a case of adenocarcinoma arising in ectopic pancreatic tissue in the mediastinum of a 66-year-old woman. The tumor arose in a partially cystic and partially solid ectopic pancreas containing both exocrine and endocrine components. Thorough clinical examination and clinical follow-up did not reveal other primary sites. The tumor was partially resected but metastasized to the anterior sternum 6 months later and was re-excised. No other similar cases of primary mediastinal pancreatic adenocarcinoma are on record in medical literature.
