Detection of KRAS gene mutations in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy for improving pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) is a useful tool in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses. Genetic analysis of these samples could increase the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a novel method for the detection of mutations in the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma-2 virus) gene for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.EUS-FNABs were performed on 82 patients with pancreatic masses, including 54 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 28 of non-malignant pancreatic masses. The biopsies were histopathologically and cytopathologically evaluated, and the detection of KRAS gene mutations (codons 12 and 13) was performed through peptide nucleic acid-directed polymerase chain reaction clamping and DNA sequencing.In the pancreatic cancer cases, 88.9% (48/54 95% confidence interval (CI): 80.5-97.2%) had KRAS mutations, while 61.1% (33/54Our method for the detection of KRAS gene mutations may be useful to supplement histo/cytopathologic evaluations for pancreatic cancer, and is superior to serum CA19-9 in EUS-FNAB histo/cytopathology-indeterminate patients. Results warrant further verification in other patient populations.
