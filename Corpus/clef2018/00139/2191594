Clinical application of endoscopic ultrasonography. During the course of routine clinical practice in 48 patients, 50 endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examinations were performed over a 1-yr period, with all patient data collected prospectively. Organs examined were the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, ampulla, pancreas, common bile duct, and gallbladder. There were 18 staging exams of known neoplasms, and 24 examinations to evaluate possible mass. Forty-three examinations were successful, four failed due to instrument malfunction, and three were technical failures. Among 35 exams for masses, follow-up pathology was available in 21 and confirmed EUS findings in 90%. EUS yielded additional information, not available by other imaging studies, in 60% of successful exams. No complications were seen. The recent literature is reviewed in approximately 2000 patients. We conclude that EUS is an accurate and safe method for evaluating upper gastrointestinal pathology, particularly for staging neoplasms.
