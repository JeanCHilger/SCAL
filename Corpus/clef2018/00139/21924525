Solitary pancreatic metastasis from renal carcinoma. We present the case of a 60-year-old man with a history of left radical nephrectomy due to Fuhrman nuclear grade II renal carcinoma 8 years previously. Abdominal computed tomography was performed due to a closed abdominal injury, revealing a solid, 4-cm hypervascular mass in the head of the pancreas. The suspected diagnosis was pancreatic metastasis from renal carcinoma. Cephalic duodenopancreatectomy was performed. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological analysis. At 23 months of follow-up, the patient remains disease free.
