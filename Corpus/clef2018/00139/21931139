MR imaging of the abdomen and pelvis in infants, children, and adolescents. Recent developments in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have profoundly changed the investigation of abdominal and pelvic disease in pediatrics. Motion reduction techniques, such periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction, or PROPELLER, have resulted in reliable imaging with quiet breathing. Faster imaging sequences minimize artifact and allow for more efficient studies. Diffusion-weighted imaging has become increasingly important in the evaluation of neoplastic disease, depicting disease with increased cellularity and helping to differentiate benign from malignant masses. MR enterography helps visualize intra- and extraluminal bowel pathologic conditions. MR cholangiopancreatography can depict congenital and acquired causes of pancreatic and biliary abnormalities. MR urography is an effective technique for a one-stop-shop evaluation of structural urinary tract abnormality and renal function. Three-dimensional acquisitions allow volumetric display of structures from multiple angles. Specialized techniques allow quantification of iron and fat in the viscera in children with hemolytic anemia and obesity, respectively. This article covers current techniques and strategies to perform and optimize MR imaging of the abdomen and pelvis in infants, children, and adolescents and describes important practical applications.
