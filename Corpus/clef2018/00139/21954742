Spontaneous duodenal intramural haematoma imitating pancreatic pseudocyst. Spontaneous intramural duodenal haematoma develops mostly as a complication of anticoagulation therapy. Other causes were reported only as case reports. CT diagnostics has some typical features in an intramural haematoma of the small bowel. This is especially hyperdensity of the bowel wall during the first 10 days from the onset of symptoms (30-80 HU), which could contribute to the differentiation from other infiltrative processes. These features are fully expressed only in a certain part of patients. We reported a 54 year-old female treated for epigastric pain. The patient's history, laboratory data, ultrasonography and CT findings resulted in a mistaken diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, necrosis of the pancreatic body with a subsequent development of pancreatic pseudocyst. The CT guided drainage was performed. The correct diagnosis was made one year later--surgical treatment was indicated for clinical signs of GI obstruction and CT findings of pseudocyst recurrence. During the operation, there was a finding of intramural haematoma in the duodenojejunal border. We performed an evacuation of the haematoma and gastroenteroanastomosis.
