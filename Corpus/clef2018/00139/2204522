Endosonographic diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. 140 patients (72 men, 68 women mean age 57 [26-83] years) with suspected pancreatic tumours were investigated by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and also by conventional ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The EUS scans were performed with an echo-endoscope in the descending part of the duodenum (for the head of the pancreas) or in the stomach (for the body and tail). The definitive diagnosis or exclusion of a pancreatic tumour (malignant n = 85, benign n = 4, inflammatory n = 23, no tumour n = 28) was made at operation (n = 63), by needle biopsy (n = 35), at necropsy (n = 4) or by clinical follow up (n = 38, mean 10.5 months). The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasound (99% and 100%) were superior to the results given by conventional ultrasound scans (71% and 39%), CT (82% and 46%) and ERCP (89% and 64%). This was also true of small tumours of 3 cm or less (EUS 100%, conventional ultrasound 57%, CT 68% and ERCP 89%). However, the differential diagnosis between malignant and inflammatory masses in the pancreas was not feasible by endoscopic ultrasound, either prospectively (detection rate 69%) or by comparative analyses of echo structure. Endoscopic ultrasound appears to be a valuable aid to the diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatic tumours. When conventional ultrasound and CT give negative or doubtful results it can be used in conjunction with or instead of ERCP to confirm the diagnosis.
