Dorsal agenesis of the pancreas - a rare cause of abdominal pain and insulin-dependent diabetes. Dorsal agenesis of the pancreas is a rare congenital disorder. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with mild abdominal pain and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a short pancreas with no pancreatic tissue ventral to the splenic vein. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) visualized the absence of a dorsal duct system and confirmed the suspicion of complete agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was also performed to rule out pancreatic malignancy.
