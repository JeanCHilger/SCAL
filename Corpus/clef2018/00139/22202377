A case report of stage IV inoperable gastric cancer demonstrating a cCR treated with S-1/Paclitaxe (l PTX) therapy. We report a case of Stage IV inoperable gastric cancer demonstrating a cCR treated with S-1/PTX. The patient was a 65-year-old female with advanced gastric cancer. CT scan suggested an invasion of tumor into a pancreatic body, jejunum and transverse colon. Staging laparoscopy showed it to be positive with peritoneal washing cytology and peritoneal dissemination. The surgical findings were T4a (SE) N2M1H0P1CY1, Stage IV. Chemotherapy was conducted with a combination of S-1/CDDP. After 2 courses of this regimen, the endoscopy findings did not show an improvement, so we decided to change the chemotherapy to S-1/PTX as second-line treatment. After 2 courses of this regimen, the endoscopy findings revealed a reduction of the primary tumor. After 19 courses, histopathological examination of biopsy specimen showed Group 1. Second-line chemotherapy was continued for 28 courses. The patient has had no recurrence without chemotherapy and been alive for 91 months after diagnosis.
