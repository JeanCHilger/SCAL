Infected pancreatic necrosis occurring in a jejunal aberrant pancreas: report of a case. Acute pancreatitis occurring in an aberrant pancreas (acute aberrant pancreatitis) is a rare clinical condition. A 67-year-old male was referred to the emergency department complaining of severe epigastralgia. He was evaluated by computed tomography, and the findings suggested jejunal penetration into the mesentery and abscess formation. We performed emergency surgery and found a mass located in the jejunal mesentery. Intraoperatively, we diagnosed it to be a malignant tumor complicated by penetration, and we performed a partial resection of the jejunum to remove the mass. Based on the pathological results, it was evident that this was a case of acute aberrant pancreatitis occurring on a background of chronic pancreatitis. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. This report is the first presentation describing the possible mechanism that contributes to the process of infected pancreatic necrosis in an aberrant pancreas.
