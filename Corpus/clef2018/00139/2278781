Computed tomography after modified Whipple procedure with pancreatic duct occlusion. Eighty-two CT examinations performed on 28 patients who had undergone a modified Whipple procedure including pancreatic duct occlusion were reviewed. Reduction of the antero-posterior diameter of the body and tail of the pancreatic remnant was observed on consecutive scans in 8 patients (29%). Decreasing liver attenuation was seen in 4 patients (14%) postoperatively, and pseudocysts in the pancreatic remnant in 6 (21%). In 10 examinations performed because of suspected intraabdominal abscess postoperatively, abscess was diagnosed in 2 patients. In 62 routine follow-up CT examinations, significant positive findings were diagnosed in 5 patients: tumor recurrence or metastases in 4, and a large pseudocyst in one. CT is of value in the early postoperative phase to reveal postoperative complications and in the follow-up of patients with specific symptoms indicating tumor recurrence or metastases.
