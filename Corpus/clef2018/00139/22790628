Large serous cystic adenoma at the pancreas tail mimicking mucinous cystic neoplasm. A 62-year-old woman presented with left abdominal pain. A large and multi-cystic lesion at the pancreas tail was recognized on imaging examinations. MRI revealed low and high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, with focal and bright components in the nodule adjacent to the septum on T2-weighted imaging. Distal pancreatectomy was performed, and the cystic lesion was diagnosed as serous cystic adenoma with hemorrhage. The characters of serous cystic components on imaging examinations could help to distinguish the lesion from mucinous cystic neoplasm.
