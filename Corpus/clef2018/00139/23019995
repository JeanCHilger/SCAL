Combination of partial situs inversus, polysplenia and annular pancreas with duodenal obstruction and intestinal malrotation. Situs inversus is a challenge to the physician, both for the diagnostic and for the therapeutic. A combination of partial situs inversus, annular pancreas and polysplenia with bowel malrotation has been reported in a newborn who presented as duodenal obstruction. Situs inversus is rare especially without heart malformation. All the abnormalities in this combination can be explained on the basis of multiple organ malrotation. It also demonstrates the necessity of meticulous investigation and precise description of the anomaly as far as the management of this case is concerned.
