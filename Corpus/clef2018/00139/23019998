Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the pancreatic head. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are rare, especially in the pancreas. It is sometimes difficult to obtain a definitive diagnosis with radiological imaging and there is not yet consensus about treatment. We report a case of a 56-year-old man with recurrent abdominal pain particularly in the right upper quadrant without other symptoms. The imaging results showed a pancreatic hypovascularized mass with stenosis of the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct without metastasis. The FDG PET scanner showed two hypermetabolic foci in the head of the pancreas. The biopsies of the mass were not diagnostic. The therapy adopted was Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy with a histological diagnosis of the inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.
