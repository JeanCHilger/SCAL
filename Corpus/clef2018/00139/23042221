Does general anesthesia increase the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic masses? : Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the pancreas has become the preferred method for tissue diagnosis for pancreatic solid masses. The yield of EUS-FNA in this setting is influenced by multiple factors. We hypothesized that general anesthesia (GA) may improve EUS-FNA yield by improving patient cooperation and stillness during the procedure. Our objective was to assess the association between the sedation method employed and the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA.: A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving consecutive patients who received EUS-FNA for diagnosis of a solid pancreatic mass at the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH) gastrointestinal endoscopy units from 2007 to 2009. We compared the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA between patients receiving GA provided by an anesthesiologist (GA group) and patients receiving conscious sedation (CS) provided by a qualified registered nurse (CS group).: Of 371 patients, a cytological diagnosis was obtained in 73/88 patients (83%) in the GA group and 206/283 patients (73%) in the CS group. Anesthesiologist-delivered GA was associated with an increased odds of having a successful diagnosis as compared with CS (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.56 [1.27-5.17], P = 0.01). However, the incidence of complication during or after the procedure was not different between the groups (P > 0.99).: Anesthesiologist-delivered GA was associated with a significantly higher diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA. GA should be considered a preferred sedation method for EUS-FNA of a solid pancreatic mass.
