von Hippel-Lindau disease: radiologic screening for visceral manifestations. The visceral manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The authors prospectively screened 37 persons from a single kindred. Twenty-five subjects underwent abdominal ultrasound (US), contrast material-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT), and nonenhanced abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Eight subjects younger than 16 years of age underwent abdominal US and MR imaging only. Scrotal US was employed in 25 male patients. Eleven subjects had renal cysts or tumors. Contrast-enhanced CT depicted renal abnormalities in 10 of these subjects, US in seven, and MR imaging in nine. Among 12 subjects with pancreatic cysts or tumors, CT showed pancreatic abnormalities in all 12, US in nine, and MR imaging in nine. Three subjects (mean age, 34.5 years) had renal tumors, and three had pancreatic masses. Scrotal US revealed epididymal cystadenomas in seven subjects two of these tumors were surgically verified. A combination of contrast-enhanced CT and scrotal US in male patients appears to be the best way to screen for visceral manifestations of VHL disease.
