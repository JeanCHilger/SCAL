Happy experience of a medical doctor curing from pancreatic cancer: a 60-day diary. Pancreatic cancer was found by an abdominal CT scan in a medical doctor, the author of this article, before the appearance of any symptoms. After considering all the imaging findings including the CT, MRI, and PET, a diagnosis was made. He was admitted in the University of Tokyo Hospital on the 14th day after the CT finding. On the 18th day, the operation was successfully performed, and no tumor invading to adjacent tissue was seen. On the 29th day, 11th day after the operation, he left the hospital with a drain still in place to excrete abdominal exudation. The remaining drain was finally removed on the 60th day, and the treatment by the surgeon was completed. The chronological events that occurred during these 60 days are described in diary form. There is nothing superior to early detection and early treatment in the fight against cancer. He recommends everybody to receive periodical medical examinations before praying for good luck.
