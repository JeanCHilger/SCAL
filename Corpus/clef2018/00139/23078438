A prospective multicenter evaluation of a new side-port endoscopic ultrasound-fine-needle aspiration in solid upper gastrointestinal lesions. Diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-fine-needle aspiration (FNA) varies depending on the equipment used and the site targeted. Multiple needle passes are usually required to obtain a diagnosis. A new needle incorporating a side-port carries a theoretical advantage regarding acquisition of cytological material. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Olympus side-port needle in solid upper gastrointestinal indications.A prospective multicenter evaluation of patients referred for EUS-FNA for solid lesions was performed across six tertiary gastroenterology referral centers in four capital cities in Australia. The main outcome measures include cytological diagnosis, number of needle passes required for diagnosis and complication rates.Thirty patients (17 men 13 women) with a mean age of 67.5 years were studied. Indications included pancreatic or biliary mass in 24 patients, retroperitoneal or periduodenal mass in 2, enlarged lymph node in 2, a gastric submucosal tumor in 1 and a subcarinal mass in 1. The mean size of the lesions was 3.47 cm (range, 0.5-8 cm). All but one case had a diagnosis made (96.7%). The mean number of passes required to reach a diagnosis was 1.7. In neoplastic lesions the diagnosis was made with a mean of 1.6 passes. No complications were encountered.The new EUS-FNA needle with side port appears effective and safe in solid upper gastrointestinal EUS-FNA indications.
