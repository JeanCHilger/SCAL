A case of rapidly progressing retroperitoneal differentiation type liposarcoma. A 75-year-old man visited our hospital in August 2011 due to general malaise and loss of appetite. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed a retroperitoneal tumor. Therefore, we performed resection of the retroperitoneal tumor, pancreas tail, and spleen. The pathological diagnosis was dedifferentiation-type liposarcoma with invasion of pancreas. Abdominal computed tomography scan 2 months after the operation showed peritoneal dissemination and multiple liver metastasis. The patient selected the best supportive care. An effective cure for dedifferentiation-type liposarcoma, besides surgical resection, is not yet established. Therefore, complete resection is important. Moreover, since the rate of recurrence is high, the development of an effective systemic chemotherapy is desired.
