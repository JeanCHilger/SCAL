Evaluation of splenic injury by computed tomography and its impact on treatment. We reviewed 37 consecutive, hemodynamically stable patients (16 adults, 21 children) who had splenic injuries diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan to compare the CT evaluation with operative assessment of injury and eventual treatment. Computed tomographic scans and operative findings were graded by a splenic injury scoring system. Two patients were classified as having grade 1, 21 as grade 2, 11 as grade 3, and 3 as grade 4 splenic injuries. Computed tomography underestimated the degree of injury in 9 of 17 (53%) operated patients (mean CT score, 2.6 mean operative score, 3.3
