A prospective, randomized trial comparing 25-gauge and 22-gauge needles for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic masses. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is widely performed for pancreatic masses. The 25-gauge needle (25G) might be easier to be manipulated and expected to be associated with fewer complications since it is thinner and more flexible than the 22-gauge needle (22G) although obtaining adequate specimens is questioned. In this randomized trial, the authors tried to compare prospectively 25G and 22G in diagnostic accuracy, manipulability from the operator's viewpoint and procedure-related complications.A total of 188 consecutive patients undergoing EUS-FNA for solid or cystic pancreatic masses were consecutively enrolled and 94 patients were randomized to either 25G or 22G group, respectively.Baseline characteristics were similar except that more masses of 25G group were located in the head or uncinate process of pancreas than those from 22G group. Although there was no difference in diagnostic accuracy (89.4% vs. 88.3% with p = 0.82), 25G was easier to be manipulated (p = 0.004) and related with fewer procedure-related complications (10.6% vs. 3.2% with p = 0.004).25G can be chosen in preference to 22G when performing pancreatic EUS-FNA because 25G was significantly superior to 22G in terms of manipulability and complications although both were effective for accurate diagnosis.
