Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas can be easily misdiagnosed and mistreated by the surgeon unfamiliar with the pathology, natural history, and operative strategy specific to these uncommon tumors. The authors have treated nine patients over a seven-year period involving four cystadenocarcinomas, two mucinous cystadenomas, two serous cystadenomas, and one solid and papillary epithelial tumor. Our experience illustrates the inaccuracies in both clinical and pathologic diagnosis. Suspected cystic neoplasms are optimally managed by resection. Their slow growth and late metastasis permits curative surgery after a previous drainage or bypass procedure. An aggressive surgical approach is therefore warranted, and multimodal treatment with radiation and chemotherapy may be clinically applicable to large, invasive cystadenocarcinomas.
