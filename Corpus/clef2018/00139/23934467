Groove (paraduodenal) pancreatitis: Report of two cases. "Groove" pancreatitis is a rare segmental form of chronic pancreatitis that involves the area located between the common bile duct, head of the pancreas and duodenum. It is more common in middle-aged males who have a history of alcohol abuse. The differential diagnosis varies from anatomic variants to malignancies. The most relevant differential diagnosis of groove pancreatitis is adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Most of the cases were diagnosed after pancreatic resection. Thus, the correct diagnosis of this rarely seen disease is very important to avoid unnecessary tests or procedures and to determine the definitive treatment.
