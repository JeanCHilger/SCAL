Pancreatic β-cell function increases in a linear dose-response manner following exercise training in adults with prediabetes. Although some studies suggest that a linear dose-response relationship exists between exercise and insulin sensitivity, the exercise dose required to enhance pancreatic β-cell function is unknown. Thirty-five older obese adults with prediabetes underwent a progressive 12-wk supervised exercise intervention (5 days/wk for 60 min at ~85% HRmax). Insulin and C-peptide responses to an OGTT were used to define the first- and second-phase disposition index (DI β-cell function = glucose-stimulated insulin secretion × clamp-derived insulin sensitivity). Maximum oxygen consumption (Vo2max) and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography) were also measured before and after the intervention. Exercise dose was computed using Vo2/heart-rate derived linear regression equations. Subjects expended 474.5 ± 8.8 kcal/session (2,372.5 ± 44.1 kcal/wk) during the intervention and lost ~8% body weight. Exercise increased first- and second-phase DI (P < 0.05), and these changes in DI were linearly related to exercise dose (DIfirst phase: r = 0.54, P < 0.001
