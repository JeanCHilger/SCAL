Impact of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration on incidental pancreatic cysts. A prospective study. Widespread use of imaging procedures has promoted a higher identification of incidental pancreatic cysts (IPCs). However, little is known as to whether endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) could change the management strategy of patients having IPCs. This study has aimed to evaluate the management impact of EUS-FNA on IPCs.Patients with pancreatic cysts (PCs) who were referred to EUS-FNA were recruited prospectively. The referring physicians were questioned about the management strategy for these patients before and after EUS-FNA. The impact of EUS-FNA on management was then evaluated.A total of 302 PC patients were recruited. Of these, 159 (52.6%) patients had asymptomatic IPCs. The average size was 2.3 cm (range: 0.2-7.1 cm), and 110 patients having smaller than 3 cm sized cysts. Lesions were located in the pancreatic head in 96 (61%) cases, and most patients (94%) had only a single cyst. The final diagnoses, obtained by EUS-FNA (91) and surgery (68), were 93 (58%) benign lesions, 36 (23%) cysts with malignant potential, 14 (9%) noninvasive malignancies, 10 (6%) malignant precursor lesions (PanIN), and 6 (4%) invasive malignancies. Management strategy changed significantly after EUS-FNA in 114 (71.7%) patients: 43% of the cases were referred to surgery, 44% of the patients were discharged from surveillance, and 13% of the cases were given further periodical imaging tests.EUS-FNA has a management impact in almost 72% of IPCs, with a major influence on the management strategy, either discharge rather than surgical resection or surgery rather than additional follow up.
