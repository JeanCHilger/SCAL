Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in ectopic pancreas. Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall is a rare complication of the ectopic pancreas that is characterized by cyst/s formation within thickened duodenal wall.A 61-year-old male with recurrent abdominal pain, weight loss (about 25 kg) who had been moderate alcohol abuser and heavy smoker was presented. On ultrasonography, very thickened duodenal wall (2.5 cm), an enlarged head of the pancreas with cyst of 3 cm in diameter as well as dilated pancreatic duct (< 6 mm) were seen. Barium meal showed stenosis of the first and second part of the duodenum. CT and endoscopic ultrasound confirmed the ultrasonographic finding.The patient underwent surgery. The pathologic finding was established only on first two portions of the duodenum and limited part of the head of the pancreas along duodenum while the rest of the pancreas was normal. Due to poor general condition, gastrojejunostomy was performed. Although some improvement was evident, the patient did not become asymptomatic, and, therefore, four months later a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy was carried out which made him fully asymptomatic. A year later, the patient was symptom-free and in good health. Histologic examination showed a cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall in the ectopic pancreas.Unless there are strong contraindications, cephalic duodenopancreatectomy is best treatment of the disease.
