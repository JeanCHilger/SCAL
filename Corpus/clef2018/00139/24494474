Pancreatic ectopia: a case report. Pancreas ectopia / Ectopic pancreas (EP) is a rare congenital disease, most typically diagnosed in asymptomatic patients by incidental detection during surgery or at autopsy. It is defined by the presence of pancreatic tissue localized in various places drifting from the foregut or mesentery. It is subject to the same various inflammatory or neoplastic disorders that may affect the orthotopic pancreas, e.g. pancreatitis or pancreatic tumours. Upper GI endosonography is a key examination (tool) in detecting and defining gastroduodenal ectopic pancreas. However its diagnosis remains difficult. The final diagnosis relies on histopathologic analysis of the resected tumor required to confirm the diagnosis. Its treatment is based on patients' condition and symptoms as well as the kind of surgery depending on the location of the ectopic pancreatic tissue.
