Familial chylomicronemia syndrome related chronic pancreatitis: a single-center study. Hypertriglyceridemia induces acute recurrent pancreatitis, but its role in the etiology of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of 7 patients with CP due to type 1 hyperlipidemia compared to CP patients with other or undefined etiological factors.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of 7 CP patients with type 1 hyperlipidemia compared to CP patients without hypertriglyceridemia. These 7 patients had multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis and had features of CP on abdominal CT, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasonography.All CP patients were classified into two groups: a group with type 1 hyperlipidemia (n=7) and a group with other etiologies (n=58). The mean triglyceride level was 2323+/-894 mg/dL in the first group. Age at the diagnosis of CP in the first group was significantly younger than that in the second group (16.5+/-5.9 vs 48.3+/-13.5, P<0.001). The number of episodes of acute pancreatitis in the first group was significantly higher than that in the second group (15.0+/-6.8 vs 4.0+/-4.6, P=0.011). The number of splenic vein thrombosis in the first group was significantly higher than that in the second group (4/7 vs 9/58, P=0.025). Logistic regression analysis found that younger age was an independent predictor of CP due to hypertriglyceridemia (r=0.418, P=0.000).Type 1 hyperlipidemia appears to be an etiological factor even for a minority of patients with CP. It manifests at a younger age, and the course of the disease might be severe.
