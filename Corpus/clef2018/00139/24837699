Squamous-lined cyst of the pancreas: Radiological-pathological correlation. Pancreatic cystic lesions are increasingly being detected incidentally because of the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Squamous-lined cysts of the pancreas (lymphoepithelial cyst, epidermoid cyst, and dermoid cyst) are rare cystic lesions lined with squamous epithelium. Distinguishing squamous-lined cysts from other cystic lesions of the pancreas is important to avoid unnecessary surgery, because squamous-lined cysts of the pancreas have no malignant potential. The purpose of this review is to describe findings on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and the histopathological characteristics of squamous-lined cysts, and to summarize the key points of differential diagnosis for pancreatic cystic lesions.
