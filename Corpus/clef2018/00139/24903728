Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome resulting from repeat bortezomib usage. Bortezomib is a chemotherapeutic agent that acts via proteasome inhibition resulting in cellular apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. Although widely accepted as treatment of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, it has also been shown to be efficacious in a variety of solid tumours such as pancreatic and colonic. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neuroradiological syndrome characterised by vasogenic oedema involving the postero-occipital cortical and subcortical white matter resulting in visual disturbances, seizures and altered mental status. Although in most cases PRES is reversible with removal of the provoking condition or drug, if not appropriately recognised and treated it may lead to permanent and life-threatening sequelae such as intracerebral haemorrhage and ischaemic infarction. We report a case of PRES associated with bortezomib therapy and contrast it with four other previously reported cases. Recognition of this potentially severe neurological complication is important with the increasingly widespread use of bortezomib.
