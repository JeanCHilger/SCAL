Sensitivity of alternative testing for pancreaticobiliary cancer: a 10-y review of the literature. Biliary strictures present a diagnostic challenge to differentiate benign disease from hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) malignancies. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography cytology is commonly performed in these patients however, its sensitivity for diagnosis of HPB malignancy is poor (41.6%). Many adjunctive tests have been investigated to improve the sensitivity of HPB biopsies. To determine the best tests available, however, we reviewed the literature and performed a comparative analysis of all recently investigated tests and their sensitivities.A PubMed search identified articles published between 2003 and 2014, describing alternate methods for diagnosing HPB malignancies, reported sensitivity, final pathology, and had data available online. Meta-analysis was conducted for tests with multiple articles. Tests with the highest sensitivity and specificities were reported.A total of 77 studies were identified. Meta-analysis was performed on the sensitivity of EUS-FNA (74.2%), fluorescence in situ hybridization (54.2%), immunostain of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding Protein 3 (IMP3 80.4%), IMP3 + cytology (86.4%), K homology domain containing protein overexpressed in cancer (KOCWe recommend immunostaining with a panel of IMP3+KOC + S100A4 + cytology to achieve maximum sensitivity and specificity from HPB biopsies. One biliary protein (carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 6) and several RNAs (bile and blood) offer exceptional sensitivity and specificity and should be tested prospectively in larger populations. Overall, this review identifies several tests to improve the sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms to identify HPB malignancies.
