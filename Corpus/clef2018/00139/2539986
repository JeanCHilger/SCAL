Pancreatic biopsy under visual control in conjunction with laparoscopy for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Two cases of histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer are reported. Histological diagnosis was obtained after pancreatic biopsy was carried out under visual control in conjunction with laparoscopy using pancreatic biopsy forceps designed by us. In Case 1, localized swelling of the pancreas was observed on abdominal ultrasonography (US) and computer tomography (CT) scan, and interruption of the main pancreatic duct was demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In Case 2, a pancreatic tumor was detected by abdominal US and CT scan, but ERCP findings were only those of chronic pancreatitis.
