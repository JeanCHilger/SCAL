Clinical and genetic complexity of Mitchell-Riley/Martinez-Frias syndrome. Mitchell-Riley syndrome/Martinez-Frias syndrome (MRS/MFS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder with multisystem involvement and poor prognosis. Most reported cases have been associated with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RFX6 gene, a transcriptional regulatory factor for pancreatic morphogenesis. Given the limited number of reported cases, the syndrome may be under-recognized. When the particular phenotype of MFS includes a mutation on the RFX6 gene and neonatal diabetes, it has been called Mitchell-Riley syndrome. Because of this, we propose that MFS/MRS is a symptom continuum or an RFX6 malformation complex. We report an infant with all of the key clinical features of MRS/MFS without a definable mutation in RFX6 gene, supporting the consideration of these features as a symptom complex, and raising the question of genetic heterogeneity.
