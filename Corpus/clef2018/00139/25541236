Pancreatic perfusion data and post-pancreaticoduodenectomy outcomes. Precise risk assessment for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) may be facilitated using imaging modalities. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) of the pancreas may represent histologic findings. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of CTP data for the risk of POPF after PD, in relation to histologic findings.Twenty patients who underwent preoperative pancreatic CTP measurement using 320-detector row CT before PD were investigated. Clinicopathologic findings, including CTP data, were analyzed to assess the occurrence of POPF. In addition, the correlation between CTP data and histologic findings was evaluated.POPF occurred in 11 cases (grade A, 6 grade B, 5CTP data for the pancreas were found to be correlated with the occurrence of POPF after PD. Alterations in the blood flow to the remnant pancreas may reflect histological changes, including fibrosis in the pancreatic stump, and influence the outcome after PD. CTP may thus facilitate objective and quantitative risk assessment of POPF after PD.
