Hybrid imaging for pancreatic malignancy: clinical applications, merits, limitations, and pitfalls. The role of PET/CT in pancreatic malignancy is evolving with new scientific evidence emerging continuously. PET/CT applications in imaging the pancreas and its organ-specific merits, limitations, and potential pitfalls are still evolving. This article provides an overview of the state-of-the-art applications of PET/CT imaging in evaluating pancreatic malignancy, comparing with conventional imaging modalities, such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Current PET/MRI is also reviewed, along with brief discussion on cost-benefit analysis.
