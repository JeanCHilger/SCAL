A case of good syndrome presumed secondary to metastatic pancreatic thymoma in a patient presenting with a myasthenic crisis postthymectomy. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibodies against the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4, and agrin. The incidence of thymoma in MG is reported as âˆ¼10%-15%. The incidence of extrathoracic metastatic thymoma is exceedingly rare and may present years after resection. Associations between thymoma and immunodeficiency have also been described, including Good syndrome.We describe the clinical course, investigations, and treatments performed in a patient presenting with a myasthenic crisis in the setting of acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized MG 10 years postthymectomy. Computed tomography imaging revealed 2 pancreatic lesions, but no residual thoracic thymoma. Biopsy confirmed metastatic pancreatic thymoma, which was successfully resected. His course was further complicated by cytomegalovirus retinitis with a depressed CD4 count and perniosis.This presentation was felt to be consistent with Good immunodeficiency syndrome.
