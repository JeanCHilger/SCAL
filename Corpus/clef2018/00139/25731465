A case of locally advanced pancreatic cancer successfully resected after gemcitabine+S-1 therapy. A 6 1-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital because of obstructive jaundice. He was diagnosed with locally advanced cancer of the pancreatic head on computed tomography. Gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m² on days 8 and 15, every 21 days) + S-1 (6 0 mg/m² on day 1-15, every 21 days) chemotherapy was administered because the tumor had invaded the common hepatic artery and portal vein. The tumor was reduced following 9 months of chemotherapy. Thus, subtotal stomach- preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD)was performed. The histopathological findings indicated no invasion of the cancer into the surrounding tissues. No recurrence has occurred 7 months after surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is important for effective treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
