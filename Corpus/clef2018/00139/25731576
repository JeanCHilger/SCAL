Multiple extracranial metastases from meningioma treated with surgical resection - a case report. A 73-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for an atypical meningioma in 1993, and underwent re-excision for local recurrence 4 years later. In 2008, a chest X-ray film revealed 2 nodules in the right lung. A wedge resection of S2 and a middle lobectomy of the right lung were performed. Pathological findings indicated that the 2 tumors originated from the intracranial meningioma resected in 1993. In 2013, a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated hypervascular masses in the liver (S4), pancreatic body, and lower portion of the right kidney. She underwent partial hepatectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and partial nephrectomy, and the final diagnosis was hepatic, pancreatic, and renal metastases from meningioma. After 10 months, a transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was performed for hepatic recurrence (S5). She is presently doing well, 5 months after TAE, without any signs of recurrence.
