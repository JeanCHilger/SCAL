Accessory pancreatic lobe with gastric duplication cyst: diagnostic challenges of a rare congenital anomaly. Reports of combined congenital abnormalities of gastric duplication cysts and accessory pancreatic lobes are rarely reported. Patients with such anomalies may require appropriate surgical intervention tailored to the individual patient for complete cure. A multimodality diagnostic approach using ultrasonography, CT and MRI is useful for appreciation of the relevant anatomy of the congenital abnormality and for proper surgical planning. We present a case of a gastric duplication cyst with accessory pancreatic lobe and ectopic pancreatic rest in a 5-year-old child presenting with symptoms of recurrent pancreatitis.
