Magnetic resonance imaging of tumor with a self-traceable polymer conjugated with an antibody fragment. A (13)C-enriched phosphorylcholine polymer ((13)C-PMPC) as a self-traceable MR (magnetic resonance) tag was conjugated with a fragment (scFv) of Herceptin, a clinical antibody against antigen Her2. When injected in model mice bearing Her2(+) (gastric) and Her2(-) (pancreatic) tumors, the antibody-tag conjugate (13)C-PMPC-scFv selectively accumulated in the Her2(+) tumor with a rapid build-up/decay (accumulation/clearance) profile and, with the use of the (1)H-(13)C double-resonance (heteronuclear correlation) technique, the Her2(+) gastric tumor was clearly MR imaged.
