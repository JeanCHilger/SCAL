Feasibility and repeatability of PET with the hypoxia tracer [(18)F]HX4 in oesophageal and pancreatic cancer. To investigate the feasibility and to determine the repeatability of recurrent [(18)F]HX4 PET scans in patients with oesophageal (EC) and pancreatic (PC) cancer.32 patients were scanned in total seven patients (4 EC/3 PC) were scanned 2, 3 and 4h post injection (PI) of [(18)F]HX4 and 25 patients (15 EC/10 PC) were scanned twice 3.5h PI, on two separate days (median 4, range 1-9days). Maximum tumour to background ratio (TBRmax) and the tumour hypoxic volume (HV) (TBR>1.0) were calculated. Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Agreement in localization was calculated as the distance between the centres of mass in the HVs.For EC, the TBRmax in the tumour (mean±SD) was 1.87±0.46 with a coefficient of repeatability (CoR) of 0.53 (28% of mean). The HV ranged from 3.4 to 98.8ml with a CoR of 5.1ml. For PC, the TBRmax was 1.72±0.23 with a CoR of 0.27 (16% of mean). The HV ranged from 4.6 to 104.0ml with a CoR of 7.8ml. The distance between the centres of mass in the HV was 2.2±1.3mm for EC and 2.1±1.5mm for PC.PET scanning with [(18)F]HX4 was feasible in both EC and PC patients. Amount and location of elevated [(18)F]HX4 uptake showed good repeatability, suggesting [(18)F]HX4 PET could be a promising tool for radiation therapy planning and treatment response monitoring in EC and PC patients.
