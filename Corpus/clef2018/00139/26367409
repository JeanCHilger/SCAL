Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas with concomitant Bochdalek's hernia. The first reported case. Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are rare. The diagnosis is difficult because of its clinical and radiological polymorphism. It was described in the literature that this entity can be associated with congenital malformation. We report an exceptional case associating solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas to Bochdalek's hernia.A 31 year-old woman presented with abdominal pain. Radiological findings (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI) showed a heterogeneous mass evoking a stromal tumor of duodenal origin associated to a hernia through the foramen of Bochdalek. The patient underwent tumorectomy without lymphadenectomy with a hernia repair. Pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. The 3-years follow- up was uneventful.Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare benign tumor with a good prognosis after resection. Recognition of the association of congenital malformation with solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is useful as it could have implications on the diagnosis and treatment.
