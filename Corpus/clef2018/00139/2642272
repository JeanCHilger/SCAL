Pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Cystic neoplasms are an uncommon group among pancreatic tumors. Because of advances in noninvasive diagnostic procedures, these lesions are more frequently detected and surgically treated. New pathological entities have been recently described with their own prognosis. 1. In a large number of cases, the imaging procedures can differentiate microcystic adenoma from mucinous cystadenoma, the more frequently encountered lesions. A well-defined mass with innumerable small cysts producing a honeycomb appearance with central stellate septae is suggestive of microcystic adenoma. A well-defined multilocular mass containing thin, straight or curvilinear septae with papillary projections and local thickening is suggestive of mucinous cystadenoma. 2. No sonographic or CT finding allows the differentiation between mucinous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, however the imaging features depend on the grade of malignancy. 3. Thus, in the majority of cases of cystic lesions, fine needle aspiration with appropriate stains is recommended.
