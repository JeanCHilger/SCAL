Plasmacytoma of the pancreatic head. Plasmacytomas of the pancreas are extremely rare. This is a report of a patient with plasmacytoma of the head of the pancreas who also had an extramedullary plasmacytoma of the epipharynx 19 months earlier. Computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed a multilobular homogeneous mass in the pancreas. Endoscopic biopsy of adjacent polypoid lesions in the duodenum allowed confirmation of the diagnosis.
