Cystic changes in the liver in our 5-year ultrasonographic study. The authors examined during 1983-1987 by ultrasonography the liver in a group of 13,672 patients with an average age of 54.8 +/- 4.1 years. The group comprised 7830 women (57.27%) and 5842 men (42.73%). Cystic changes were detected in 39 patients (0.28%). During subsequent examinations they revealed that in four patients metastases of tumours were involved. The correctness of the ultrasonographic diagnosis was confirmed in 35 patients (89.7%). Non-inflammatory and non-parasitic cysts were present in 31 patients (0.23%), incl. 20 women (0.26%) and 11 men (0.19%) with a sex ratio of 1.4:1. Concurrent cystic changes on the kidneys were found in 22.6% and on the pancreas in 12.9%. The spleen was not affected by cystic changes in any of the patients. The diagnosis of cysts was supplemented by laboratory, laparoscopic, scintigraphic, computed tomographic peroperative and aimed bioptic examinations, depending on the character of changes. An inflammatory cyst (tuberculous cavity) as well as three cases of echinococcal cysts were treated by operation. In the conclusion the authors discuss contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic methods in cystic liver diseases.
