Mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Pancreatic cystadenomas are rare neoplasms that represent 10% of all benign cystic lesions of the gland. Their biological features are not clearly delimited from cystadenocarcinoma, which has a similar aspect, making exhaustive histological study necessary after exeresis. A case is presented of mucinous cystadenoma of the body-tail of the pancreas that debuted as a painful abdominal mass in a patient with a history of acute pancreatitis, simulating a pseudocyst. It was diagnosed by imaging techniques (ECHO, CAT) and later needle cytology and peroperative cystography. Treatment was corporocaudad pancreatectomy. Criteria of differential diagnosis with other benign and malignant cystic lesions of the pancreas are discussed. Present trends in surgical treatment are described and the literature is reviewed.
