Serous (microcystic) pancreatic adenoma. Microcystic pancreatic adenoma is an extremely rare tumor, arising in exocrine pancreatic tissue, which may lead to severe abdominal pain. To date malignant transformation has not been reported. There is a conspicuous, statistically significant, association of microcystic pancreatic adenoma with various other diseases. This report describes a 57 year-old woman with associated clinical signs of scleroderma. Therapeutic modalities are primarily aimed at complete removal of the tumor, which may--depending on the localisation--require major pancreatic resections.
