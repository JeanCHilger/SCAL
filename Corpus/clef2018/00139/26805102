A Case of Resected Lymph Node Recurrence of Cancer of the Papilla of Vater. We report the successful resection of lymph node recurrence of cancer of the papilla of Vater after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). A 67-year-old man had undergone PD for adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater, and histopathological examination revealed well differentiated papillotubular adenocarcinoma, ly1, v0, T1, n (0), pStage â… B. One year after surgery, abdominal computed tomography revealed a mass at the left side of the residual inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (IPDA). We resected the mass, which was diagnosed as lymph node recurrence of cancer of the papilla of Vater. The patient remains alive without any evidence of recurrence 5 years since the second operation. We suggest that complete resection of lymph node surrounding the IPDA is an important surgical procedure for cancer of the papilla of Vater. There still is only limited experience with resection for recurrence of cancer of the papilla of Vater, but our case shows that it may provide for long-term survival from recurrence of cancer of the papilla of Vater.
