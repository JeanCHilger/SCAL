A Case of Gemcitabine Refractory Lung Metastasis after Distal Pancreatectomy for Pancreatic Cancer, Effectively Treated with S -1 as Second Line Chemotherapy. A 64-year-old man was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer by abdominal computed tomography (CT). The examination showed a pancreatic tail cancer and a distal pancreatectomy was performed in 2010. Histopathologically, this tumor was a moderately-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. He received gemcitabine adjuvant chemotherapy for a year. In 2012, a chest CT scan revealed 4 nodules in the lower left lobe. We diagnosed gemcitabine-refractory lung metastases after distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. S-1 chemotherapy was administered as a second line chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. After 2 courses of this regimen, the lung metastases were reduced. After 6 courses, a clinical complete response was obtained. Four years and 6 months after the operation, the patient is well without any signs of recurrence, and S-1 chemotherapy is still ongoing.
