R0 Resection of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer after Combination Chemotherapy with Gemcitabine and S-1. A 68-year-old female was referred to our institution in October 2014 for additional therapy for cancer of the head of the pancreas. Utilizing a computed tomography scan, he was initially diagnosed with locally advanced unresectable cancer because of massive invasion to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Combination chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and S-1 was administrated for 10 months. Since the tumor was remarkably reduced after chemotherapy, pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with portal vein resection was performed. Since the histopathological findings indicated few residual cancer tissues, our chemotherapy was considered dramatically effective. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient remains well and without any recurrences 14 months after the surgery. We therefore report a case of locally unresectable pancreatic cancer, which achieved R0 resection after combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1.
