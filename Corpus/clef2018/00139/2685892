Asymptomatic calcified aneurysm of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery--differential diagnostic considerations. A calcified aneurysm of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery with simultaneous occlusion of the celiac axis but without any local symptoms is presented. In the description of the diagnostic procedure, the considerations relating to differential diagnosis against solitary circumferentially calcified masses in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are discussed. As a result of increasingly sophisticated examination techniques, especially digital subtraction angiography, computed tomography and ultrasonography, these aneurysms, which were formerly thought to be rare, are now discovered surprisingly often. Knowledge of this vascular malformation and its differential diagnoses helps to avoid risky methods of examination.
