A new case of cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas. The authors describe a new case of cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas treated surgically by cephalic duodeno-pancreatectomy associated with right hemicolectomy. Following a review of the literature, they recall the anatomo-pathological and clinical characteristics of vascular connective tissue tumors of the pancreas. From a therapeutic viewpoint, they conclude on the necessity for complete removal of these unusual tumors, either by tumor resection or by appropriate pancreatic resection, which are the only guarantees of a definitive curve.
