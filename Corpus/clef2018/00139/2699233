Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas--an incidental finding. Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas is a rare benign pancreatic tumour usually occurring in elderly females. These tumours have characteristic radiological appearances that should allow their differentiation from the potentially malignant macrocystic adenoma as well as other cystic lesions of the pancreas. A case of a large micro-cystic adenoma of the pancreas found incidentally in a patient with carcinoma of the kidney is presented.
