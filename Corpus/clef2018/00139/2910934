Pancreatic pseudotumor in pancreas divisum: CT characteristics. We report a case in which a focally spared area of pancreatic tissue in a gland otherwise replaced by fat created a "pseudomass" mimicking neoplasm on sonography and CT. The "pseudomass" appearance was related to the anomalous ductal anatomy in pancreas divisum. The spared area of pancreas creating a "pseudomass" was drained by the dorsal duct and the remainder of the pancreas that had undergone relative fatty replacement was drained by the ventral duct.
