Gas in the pancreas: value of computed tomography. Intrapancreatic gas in acute pancreatitis is generally due to infection with gas-forming organisms. CT provides evidence of pancreatitis, its extent and complications. The demonstration of gas in an inflamed pancreas indicates abscess formation and is an indication for surgical intervention. A review of our own patients has shown abscess formation in six out of seven patients with gas in the pancreas. The differential diagnosis of gas collections in the region of the pancreas is discussed and illustrated by examples.
