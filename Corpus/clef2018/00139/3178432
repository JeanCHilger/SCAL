Angiosarcoma of the adrenal gland. We report the first case of primary angiosarcoma of the adrenal gland, to our knowledge. A 54-year-old man presented with chronic left upper quadrant abdominal pain, and a left adrenal mass was subsequently found on computed tomography of the abdomen. The tumor was surgically removed and a diagnosis of adrenal angiosarcoma, supported by findings of immunoperoxidase and ultrastructural studies, was made. Seven months later, recurrent tumor resulted in an en bloc resection of lateral gastric wall, tail of pancreas, left kidney, and spleen. One year after the initial surgery, the patient was free of tumor. Angiosarcoma should be added to the list of possible primary adrenal gland malignancies.
