Recurrent meningioma with malignant changes and extracranial multiple metastases. A case of recurrent meningioma with malignant change and extracranial multiple metastases is reported. A 51-year-old female was operated on and left parasagittal meningioma was extirpated by Simpson grade II. Histological diagnosis was fibroblastic and transitional meningioma with slight atypism. Six years later, however, the tumor (transitional meningioma with slight mitosis) recurred in the same portion and was removed again by Simpson grade II. Further more, four years after the second operation, bilateral parasagittal meningioma (atypical meningioma transitional type) was extirpated by Simpson grade I including superior sagittal sinus and falx. Only eight months after the last operation, a few tumors with central necrosis were demonstrated in the bilateral parasagittal area on a computerized tomography scan and she received radiation therapy. But the tumor had metastasized to the extracranial multiple organs including lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal gland, muscles, multiple bones and lymph nodes. Post mortem diagnosis was malignant meningioma. We reviewed and discussed the characteristics of metastasizing meningioma, the effectiveness of radiation therapy on the prevention of recurrence of meningioma and the curative effect of radiation therapy for recurrent or metastasized meningioma.
