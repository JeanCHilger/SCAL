Left side renal cell carcinoma removed with the spleen, pancreas body, pancreas tail, and about one third of the left diaphragm: a case report. A 61-year-old woman was admitted with the chief complaint of left lumbodorsal pain. Left renal cell carcinoma invaded to the spleen, pancreas body, pancreas tail and left diaphragm, which was diagnosed by computed tomography. Transabdominal radical nephrectomy with en bloc resection of the spleen, pancreas body, pancreas tail and one third of the left diaphragm was performed. A similar case was first reported by Suzuki et al. in 1982. This case seems to be the second in the Japanese literature.
