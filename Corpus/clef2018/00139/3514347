Pancreatic cystadenoma: diagnostic value of ultrasonics and x-ray computed tomography. We report six cases of pancreatic cystadenoma (three mucinous cysts, three microcystic adenomas). All patients were women. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 50 years (with a range from 24 to 70 years). The mean age of patients having mucinous cysts (36.6 years) was lower than that of patients having microcystic adenomas (63.3 years). Abdominal pain was the first symptom in five patients. A palpable abdominal mass was found in three cases. The type of the tumor was demonstrated by ultrasonography and computed tomography and was confirmed by laparotomy in five cases. The tumors involved the body and tail of the pancreas. A distal pancreatectomy was performed in five cases, with a splenectomy in four cases. The post-operative course was uneventful. One patient was not operated. The histological examination of the three mucinous cysts showed benign tumors. This study emphasizes the usefulness of ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of pancreatic cystadenomas. Surgical therapy is mandatory for mucinous cysts because of their potential malignancy, but a careful follow-up might be proposed for poor-risk patients having a microcyst adenoma, since this tumor is benign.
