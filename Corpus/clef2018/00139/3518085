Ultrasonographic demonstration of a gas-containing pancreatic abscess. A case report. A 24-year-old man presented with acute pancreatitis. Serial ultrasonographic examination showed the development of bright echoes within the pancreatic parenchyma compatible with gas formation. This was confirmed on subsequent computed tomography and at laparotomy. The value of serial ultrasonographic examinations in pancreatitis is emphasized.
