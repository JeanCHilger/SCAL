Value of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of carcinoma of Vater's ampulla. Apropos of 9 cases. In ten patients where ampullary carcinoma was proved, ultrasonography has been performed in 9 cases and failed in 1 case. The results reported, could be put into two different groups. In 7 cases out of 9, sonogram did not show any specific signs: In 3 of these cases, it mimicked a pancreatic carcinoma in the other 4 cases, dilatation of biliary and/or pancreatic ducts has only been evaluated. In the 2 remaining cases (20% of the 10 patients of the series) the diagnosis of ampullary carcinoma could be suggested on sonographic features. It showed the "double duct sign" and a bulging mass filling the lumen of the distal common bile duct. In one of these 2 cases, the mass was also detectable in the second duodenum, previously filled with water. Endoscopy with biopsy is the most reliable procedure in the diagnosis of ampullary carcinoma but the interest of ultrasonography is: 1 degree to show suggestive findings when the tumor bulges in the common bile duct and the duodenum
