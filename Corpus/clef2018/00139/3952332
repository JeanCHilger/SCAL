Upper abdominal trauma: pitfalls in CT diagnosis. Medical records and computed tomographic (CT) scans of 83 patients with upper abdominal trauma were retrospectively reviewed to determine errors in diagnosis using CT. Patients with possible pancreatic injury, small bowel perforation, or injury to an occult malignancy represented the most difficult diagnostic cases. A false-positive diagnosis of pancreatic injury occurred in seven of 77 patients (9%) and represented the most frequent error in the series. In three patients with subsequently surgically proved small bowel perforation, one duodenal and two proximal jejunal, the injuries were not correctly diagnosed on CT scans. In retrospect, positive CT findings were present in the case of duodenal rupture. Additionally, in two patients, duodenal rupture was suspected based on CT findings of extraluminal gas and fluid near the duodenum, but both cases were proved normal at surgery. The series included three patients with trauma involving unsuspected tumors in the liver, kidney, and stomach.
