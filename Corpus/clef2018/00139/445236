Computerized axial tomography and fine-needle biopsy in surgery of the pancreas. Notable advances have been made in the investigation of pancreatic disorders. However, many of the diagnostic tests required are still of an invasive nature and are attended by difficulty and risk. The authors have found that the noninvasive method of axial tomography is highly reliable for the evaluation of pancreatic lesions, especially in cases in which a pancreatic mass is present or the duct of Wirsung is dilated. This procedure can also be helpful in the follow-up of patients who have suffered from acute or chronic pancreatitis. The same diagnostic problem is present at operation. To obtain a quick and reliable diagnosis of pancreatic lesions, the authors performed fineneedle aspiration biopsies followed by immediate staining and examination of the specimen. Among 43 patients an accurate diagnosis was obtained in 41 instances and no complication was ascribed to this diagnostic procedure.
