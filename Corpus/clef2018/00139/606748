Tumor location with 1-aminocyclopentane [11C] carboxylic acid: preliminary clinical trials with single-photon detection. High specific activity [11C] Carboxyl-labeled 1-aminocyclopentane-carboxylic acid ([11C] ACPC) was tested as a tumor-scanning agent in thirty-eight patients. This artificial amino acid clears the blood to a level of less than 12% within 45 min thus, imaging is possible within the useful life of C-11. [11C] ACPC can be produced in amounts adequate for clinical scanning. Doses between 12 and 45 mCi were given by i.v. injection, and scans obtained only in the single-photon mode gave clinical information on the sites of tumors. There was no evidence of any toxic effects from [11C] ACPC, and the radiation doses as extrapolated from animal data are approximately 0.01 rad per mCi for the whole body and less than 0.06 rad per mCi for the pancreas. In all but five of the 38 patients [11C] ACPC scans were compared with those obtained with Ga-67 citrate. There were 19 positive [11C] ACPC scans and 24 positive Ga-67 scans. The results indicate that [11C] ACPC is likely to be of diagnostic value for cancer patients if used in conjunction with positron tomography instrumentation.
