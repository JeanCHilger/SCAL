Diagnostics in islet cell tumours (author's transl). With modern imaging systems like sonography and computer-tomography it is mostly not possible to identify adenomas of the islet-cell-apparatus of the pancreas. These tumours are mostly too small to deform the contours of the pancreas, but because of their intense vascularisation they can be well diagnosed by angiography in form of selective coeliacography, mesentericography or superselective angiography of the pancreatico-duodenal artery. This invasive method is not only necessary to confirm the tentative diagnosis of an adenoma, but also important for its localisation, which is essential for surgery.
