Computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of pancreatic islet cell tumors. Eleven patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors smaller than 2.5 cm were examined by use of computed tomography (CT) and new scanning protocol. Seven of 11 tumors were localized and CT accurately assessed multiple lesions, retroperitoneal invasion, or liver metastases when present. CT is now the initial imaging procedure of choice for diagnosis and staging of islet cell tumors. Nuclear magnetic resonance can distinguish islet cell tumors from normal retroperitoneal structures and appears to be a promising new pancreatic imaging modality.
