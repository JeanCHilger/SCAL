The use of contrast media in computer tomography (author's transl). There are a variety of applications for contrast media in CT. They can be used for better anatomic demonstration or for showing pathological processes. Nearly all available contrast media may be found useful. Intravenously injected renographic contrast media are most commonly employed. In addition to their inherent contrast, specific pharmaco-kinetic changes may be of diagnostic value. This adds some knowledge of function to the purely morphological information obtained by computer tomography. For this purpose, contrast has to be injected rapidly and a fast scanner must be used (so-called angio-CT).
