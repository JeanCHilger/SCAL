Splenic rupture in chronic pancreatitis. Study of 2 cases and review of the literature. The authors have observed 2 new cases of splenic rupture due to pancreatic pseudocyst and have made a review of the literature on the subject (40 cases). The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of this rare but sometimes dramatic complication of chronic pancreatitis have been analyzed. Diagnosis should be suspected in the case of abdominal pain, mass and anemia in the male subject with previously known chronic pancreatic or alcoholic disease. Sonography completed by either angiography or CT scan if time permits are the best diagnostic methods. Ideal management should include treatment (excision or drainage) of the pseudocyst and splenectomy.
