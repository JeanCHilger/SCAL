Effect of computer tomography on the diagnostic findings and therapy planning in diseases of the epigastrium. Computed tomography is a reliable and non-invasive, however quite expensive diagnostic method. Its use as a screening procedure should be avoided until conventional X-ray and endoscopic examinations are exhausted, as tumours in the gastrointestinal tract might be overlooked and, on the other hand, radiation exposure should not be underestimated. The specific application of CT in finding a diagnosis and planning a therapy of upper abdominal diseases, especially concerning pancreas and malignant tumours, is of considerable importance in spite of occasional errors. In any case a critical point of view is indicated.
