Magnetic resonance (MR) in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease. New methods of examination are measured in terms of the efficiency of their predecessors. The introduction of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and computerised tomography (CT) constituted a turning point in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease. In its incipient stages as a clinical diagnostic method, the question is raised whether or not there is evidence that magnetic resonance (MR) can supplement, improve upon or replace the customary methods. It must, however, be taken into account that the technical development of MR is still in progress and that clinical experience with MR in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease, as in other areas, is still insufficient. At this point it is only possible to survey the trends.
