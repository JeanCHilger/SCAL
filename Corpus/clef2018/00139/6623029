Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts. Report of 2 cases and review of the literature. Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts are rare complications occurring in the course of pancreatitis. Two patients are described with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis who developed mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts. The most prominent clinical findings were, respectively, recurrent pericardial and pleural effusions and dysphagia. The elevated amylase values in serum and urine and in the pericardial and pleural effusions pointed to pancreatic disease. The mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts were found preoperatively by ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Surgery was performed. In one case the pseudocyst was treated by external drainage and in the other case by marsupialization into the left pleural space. In each case pancreaticojejunostomy was performed in addition. Etiology, symptoms, diagnosis and therapy in 32 published cases are discussed on the basis of experience with these two patients.
