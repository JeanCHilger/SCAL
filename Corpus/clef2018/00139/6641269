Computed tomography in the diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytoma. Extramedullary plasmacytomas involving the retroperitoneum are rare. Review of the literature reveals only one case in which computed tomography (CT) findings were illustrated, and this case involved the pancreas. Described here is unusual case in which pancreatic and renal plasmacytomas occurred in a patient who 18 months previously had presented with a solitary plasmacytoma of bone. The clinically unsuspected renal masses was diagnosed by CT, allowing easy biopsy and radiotherapy planning.
