Diagnostic value of computed tomography in pancreatic carcinoma: a comparison with other radiologic methods. Computed tomography (CT) performed on 54 patients with pancreatic carcinoma showed evidence of pancreatic disease in 44, but a definite diagnosis of an inoperable pancreatic carcinoma could be made in only 16 by revealing liver metastases. Differentiation between neoplastic and inflammatory disease was impossible in most patients, particularly in patients with resectable tumors. CT was found to be inferior to angiography, PTC and ERCP in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma. CT was also significantly less sensitive than angiography in assessing operability. However, in patients where CT demonstrated liver metastases, angiography and ERCP may be avoided.
