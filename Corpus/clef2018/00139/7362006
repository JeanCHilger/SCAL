Postcholecystectomy syndrome and its association with ampullary stenosis. Fifty-six consecutive patients returning with recurrent or persistent upper abdominal pain after cholecystectomy were studied by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, abdominal ultrasound and morphine neostigmine test. In 44 patients, pain recurred within 6 months after cholecystectomy. Forty patients were demonstrated on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to have moderate to marked ampullary stenosis, which occurred as an isolated abnormality in 32 patients and in association with pancreatitis in 8. Thirteen patients were found to have pancreatitis, and 6 had retained common duct stones. In five patients no definite abnormality was demonstrated. The morphine neostigmine test was positive in 16 of 17 patients with isolated ampullary stenosis and in only 1 of 8 with pancreatitis. This test may be helpful in patients who are to undergo cholecystectomy. In those with positive results, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography would help assess the size of the ampullary sphincter so that sphincteroplasty could be done at the time of cholecystectomy in appropriate patients.
