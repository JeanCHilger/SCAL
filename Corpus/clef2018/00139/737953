A clinical evaluation of isotope scanning, ultrasonography and computed tomography in pancreatic disease. In a prospective study of 46 patients with suspected pancreatic disease the provisional diagnoses arrived at independently by isotope scanning (IS), ultrasonography (USS) and computed tomography (CT) have been compared. In the control group, IS and CT were associated with a higher false positive rate than USS The isotope scan was abnormal in most patients with proven chronic pancreatitis and cancer. The results from USS and CT were similar when structural changes were present. USS was superior in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma and was a convenient means to follow the progression of acute pancreatitis to final resolution or the development of a pseudocyst. CT proved especially useful in accurately delineating cysts, pseudocysts and calculi prior to planning surgery and in assessing disease in contiguous viscera.
