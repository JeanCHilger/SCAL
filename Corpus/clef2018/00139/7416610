Sarcoidosis of anterior mediastinal nodes, pancreas, and uterine cervix: three unusual sites in the same patient. Sarcoidosis rarely involves anterior mediastinal nodes, pancreas, or uterine cervix. A 47-yr-old woman with sarcoidosis was found to have enlargement of the anterior mediastinal lymph nodes with "eggshell" calcifications on a lateral chest roentgenogram. This finding was confirmed by lateral tomography and thoracic computerized tomography. A review of 100 lateral chest roentgenograms of patients with documented sarcoidosis failed to reveal other examples of anterior mediastinal node enlargement. At laparotomy for total abdominal hysterectomy, a mass in the head of the pancreas and diffuse, nodular enlargement of this organ was found. A pathologic study of the pancreas and uterine endocervix demonstrated noncaseating granulomas. Sarcoidosis in these 3 unusual sites is discussed.
