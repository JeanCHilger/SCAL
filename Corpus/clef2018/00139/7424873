Mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas demonstrated by ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare lesions. They may undergo subclinical malignant transformation hence, establishment of the diagnosis prior to surgical exploration is of great importance. The case herein reported is of interest because the use of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and ultrasound strongly supported a clinical suspicion of a true cyst of the pancreas. It also represents the second case reported studied by these diagnostic modalities.
