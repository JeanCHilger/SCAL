Vascular complications of pancreatic transplantation: MR evaluation. To determine the value of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and MR imaging with dynamic gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced gradient-echo (Gd-GRE) sequences in detection of vascular complications of pancreatic transplantation.Three radiologists evaluated findings of 32 MR examinations in 20 adult patients who underwent pancreatic transplantation. The images were obtained with a surface coil and T1-weighted and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, Gd-GRE sequences, and MR angiography. Vascular abnormality was confirmed at surgery or biopsy, and vascular patency with clinical correlation.Absence of flow was found in six of 32 studies (19%): acute vascular thrombosis of the vascular pedicle and/or branch vessels in four studies (three patients) and chronic pancreatic rejection in two studies (one patient). Gd-GRE images helped identify infarction in two patients. The sensitivity of MR angiography for detection of acute vascular compromise was 100%, and the specificity was 93%.MR angiography and MR imaging with Gd-GRE sequences allow detection of vascular complications of pancreatic transplantation.
