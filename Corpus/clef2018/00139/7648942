Report of a case of glucagonoma misdiagnosed as "eczema" and "hepatic angioma" for three years and review of literature. Glucagonoma is a rare pancreatic tumor, necrolytic migratory erythema is its distinctive feature and it is often associated with diabetes mellitus, weight loss, anemia, hypoaminoacidemia, glossitis and stomatitis. We reported a case of glucagonoma misdiagnosed as "eczema" and "benign hepatic anginoma" for 3 years. His blood glucagon level was 1,758 ng/L. The results of abdominal B-mode ultrasonography and CT scan were negative, but selected arteriogram showed a tumor mass between the pancreatic body and tail. Before operation, treatment with octreotide and supply of amino acids were given with improvement of the skin lesion. After resection of the tumor from pancreas, necrolytic migratory erythema disapeared, but his blood level of glucagon and amino acids did not improve. It is suggested that any diabetic patient with chronic skin damage should be checked for blood glucagon level. In suspected cases, selected arteriogram will be helpful for location of the tumor. Vigorous resection of the pancreatic tumor should be done as soon as possible, even though there is already metastases.
