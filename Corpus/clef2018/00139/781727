Computed tomography of the pancreas. Computed tomography (CT) has proven useful in diagnosing inflammatory and neoplastic disease of the pancreas. Neoplasms of the pancreas produce enlargement of the gland and loss of surrounding fat planes. Acute pancreatitis also produces enlargement but correct diagnosis can be made with the clinical correlation. The usefulness of CT in chronic pancreatitis depends upon the state of the disease. Distinction between an inflammatory and a neoplastic mass is not possible on the basis of a CT scan alone. CT is also useful for needle guidance for aspiration biopsy of the pancreas.
