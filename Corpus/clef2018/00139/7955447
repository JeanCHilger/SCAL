Imaging in endocrinology: use of a potential methodology for audit consensus development. To explore areas of consensus in the use of imaging techniques in the investigation of endocrine disorders.A postal questionnaire sent to members of the Endocrine Section of the Royal Society of Medicine following a meeting of the Section in January 1993 on Imaging in Endocrinology.Fifty-two specialists completed the questionnaire which was sent in the first mailing after the meeting.Consensus statements were defined as those in which greater than 75% of respondents either agreed or opposed the statement. Majority support or rejection was defined as greater than 50% in favour with less than 25% opposed or vice versa.Many areas of consensus were defined particularly in the field of the use of imaging in the investigation of pituitary disease. The questionnaire highlighted difficulties in obtaining a consensus view on the imaging techniques which should be employed in the investigation of thyroid, parathyroid and pancreatic disorders.The results are a useful guide to areas in which further discussion and/or research is required. This methodology could, and we believe should, be applied to other areas of endocrine practice. Such results provide an initial data base to develop national audit guide-lines on the use of imaging techniques in endocrine disorders.
