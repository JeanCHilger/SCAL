Laparoscopic pancreatocystojejunostomy without entero-entero-anastomosis. The gradual enlargement of a persistent pancreatic pseudocyst generally requires intervention. When the decision to carry out an operative procedure is made, preference should be given to internal rather than external drainage. We have developed a simple technique in which the pseudocyst is approached directly, to make a pancreatico-cystojejunostomy, which does not require a Braun- or Roux-en-Y anastomosis. We present our laparoscopic method, which opens up new possibilities in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.
