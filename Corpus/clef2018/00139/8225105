Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst: endoscopic cysto-enterostomy. Pancreatic pseudocysts occur in 20% of cases of chronic pancreatitis. Spontaneous resolution is seen in about 9% of the cases, but most cysts persist and frequently cause complications, such as compression of adjacent organs or infection. Endoscopic cysto-enterostomy has recently been reported as a new nonsurgical invasive approach. We present a 40-year-old alcoholic man with a large pancreatic pseudocyst compressing the distal choledochus and pancreatic duct, who was treated successfully by endoscopic cysto-duodenostomy.
