Idiopathic hemochromatosis: MR imaging findings in cirrhotic and precirrhotic patients. The authors reviewed T2-weighted and T2*-weighted abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) images in 19 pathology-proved cases of hepatic iron overload to compare patterns of iron distribution among cirrhotic and precirrhotic patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis (IH), as well as nontransfusional hepatic siderosis of other causes. Fifteen patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of IH. Four patients without IH had cirrhosis with moderate siderosis. In the MR images of all 19 patients, the liver had low signal intensity. The pancreas of 10 of 11 cirrhotic patients with IH had low signal intensity. All four precirrhotic patients with IH and all four cirrhotic patients without IH had pancreas with normal signal intensity at MR. Thus, pancreatic signal intensity was decreased only in cirrhotic patients with IH in this limited series. Conversely, pancreatic signal intensity is often normal in precirrhotic patients with IH prior to the development of cirrhosis, a stage at which definitive diagnosis by means of quantitative liver biopsy is important because early phlebotomy may prevent morbidity and mortality from IH. In cirrhotic patients with MR evidence of increased hepatic iron, the cause of cirrhosis is less likely to be IH if pancreatic signal intensity is normal.
