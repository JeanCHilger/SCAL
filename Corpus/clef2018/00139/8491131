Staging of pancreatic carcinoma by endoscopic ultrasonography. The ability of EUS to diagnose small pancreatic cancer is well known. In this study, we present our experience with EUS in the local staging of 29 patients with pancreatic carcinoma who underwent surgery. EUS was 79, 83 and 79% accurate in determining anterior (including gastric), duodenal and retroperitoneal (vascular) invasion by the tumor. Ultrasonography (48, 39 and 55%, respectively) and CT (38, 33 and 41%, respectively) were less reliable. EUS was equal to angiography in diagnosing vascular involvement. EUS was more effective in detecting splenoportal infiltration (sensitivity 88%, specificity 78%) than arterial involvement (accuracy 50%). EUS was also less reliable in determining the N stage (66%) and in stage grouping (72%). Although EUS is superior to ultrasonography and CT in the local staging of pancreatic carcinoma, further studies must show whether improved staging criteria will lead to better results.
