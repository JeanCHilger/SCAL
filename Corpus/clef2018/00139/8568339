A case of macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. A case of macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is presented, and literature is reviewed. A 35-yr-old woman presented with mild upper abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasonography and an abdominal computed tomography revealed a multiloculated and calcified cyst in the body of the pancreas. A T1-weighted image, using magnetic resonance imaging, revealed a low-intensity multiloculated, pancreatic mass. In contrast, T2-imaging of the tumor showed a high-intensity mass. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed no contact between the main pancreatic duct and the tumor. The preoperative diagnosis was a mucinous cystic neoplasm. Tumor enucleation was performed. Subsequent microscopic examination of this tumor suggested the diagnosis of a macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas.
