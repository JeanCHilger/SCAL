Hemochromatosis: diagnosis and management. Hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron metabolism that causes progressive damage to the liver, pancreas, heart and other organs. It is the most common autosomal recessive disorder among whites, and it occurs five times more frequently in males than in females. Manifestations include diabetes mellitus, hepatic dysfunction, congestive heart failure and other end-organ insufficiency. The presentation of hemochromatosis is often nonspecific, requiring the clinician to maintain a high index of suspicion. The diagnosis is suggested by abnormal iron studies, most notably an elevated serum ferritin level and/or transferrin saturation. Liver biopsy can confirm the diagnosis and document the presence of cirrhosis. The diagnosis is also supported by characteristic findings on a magnetic resonance imaging scan, and a diagnostic response to repeated phlebotomy (a hematocrit level that rapidly returns to normal). Phlebotomy treatments reduce the total body iron load, prevent continuing deposition of iron in the tissues, and prevent premature morbidity and mortality. Screening is recommended in affected families, and screening programs for wider populations are being evaluated.
