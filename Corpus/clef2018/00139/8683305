Cost-effectiveness analysis of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. We analyzed the results of conventional imaging and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in 150 patients with neuroendocrine tumors.The outcomes of combinations of imaging modalities were compared in terms of tumor localization, effect on patient management and financial costs.In patients with carcinoids, a combination of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, chest radiograph and ultrasound of the upper abdomen had a high sensitivity for tumor localization, and detected lesions in patients in whom no tumor was found with conventional imaging, justifying the greater cost. In patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy adds little to the information obtained with conventional imaging and therefore should not be used as a screening method. In patients with paraganglioma, CT scanning of the region where a paraganglioma is suspected, followed by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy to detect multicentricity has the best cost effectiveness ratio. In patients with gastrinomas, the combination of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and CT scanning of the upper abdomen had the highest sensitivity. The relatively high cost of this process is outweighed by its demonstrating a resectable tumor. In patients with insulinomas, the highest yield against the lowest cost is obtained if somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is only performed if CT scanning fails to demonstrate the tumor.Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy should be performed in patients with small-cell lung carcinoma because it can lead to a change of stage and may demonstrate otherwise undetected brain metastases. The cost increase is outweighed by the omission of unnecessary treatment for some of the patients and by the possibility of irradiating brain metastases at an early stage, which may lead to a better quality of life.
