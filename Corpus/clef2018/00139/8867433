Development and experimental use of receptor-specific MR contrast media. The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function. Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands. This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity. Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection. Specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function. Future design concepts of novel MR contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs (ovaries, adrenal glands, lymph nodes etc.) with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.
