Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of pancreaticobiliary maljunction associated with congenital cystic dilatation of bile duct. The concept of congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) was established by Alonso-Lej whose classification has been widely accepted and become a standard. Todani, Komi and several investigators then added additional subclassifications and/or made a proposal of new classification. The trias, abdominal pain, abdominal mass and jaundice, had been characteristically found in these cases, but recently asymptomatic cases are often found. Many reports have shown that the cases with cystic dilation of the biliary duct frequently associated with biliary carcinoma and pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM), an anomalous union of pancreatic duct with biliary tree since the Rabbit's first report. Whereas extracorporeal ultrasound and CT scan are minimally invasive diagnostic procedures for these cases, a direct cholangiography, ERCP and PTC are the diagnostic procedures that make a definite diagnosis for the appropriate treatment. Recently, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), helical CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopan-creatography (MRCP) have drawn an attention since these methods are less invasive than those ever being used. In particular, MRCP will be suitable for the screening of preoperative examination. Whereas cystoduodenostomy used to be performed in the past for these cases, the resection of dilatted bule duct along with the diversion of bile from pancreatic juice should be performed to prevent biliary carcinoma. Cholecystectomy along with the resection of bile duct and the biliary diversion from pancreatic juice should also be performed for cases of PBM without CBD because mutagenicity of bile mixed with pancreatic juice and K-ras point mutation in noncancerous bile duct epithelium in cases of PBM without CBD were demonstrated.
