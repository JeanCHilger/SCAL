A rare case of severe acute pancreatitis complicated with pancreatic pseudocysts, obstructive jaundice and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. A 58-year-old man visited our hospital because of back pain. Blood examinations revealed the presence of acute inflammation and an increase of pancreatic enzymes. Abdominal computed tomography indicated pseudocysts in the pancreas. The patient was diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis with pseudocysts formation. During the course of the disease, a newly formed pseudocyst in the pancreatic head compressed the common bile duct, leading to the obstructive jaundice. In addition, the rupture of a pseudocyst in the pancreatic tail caused intraperitoneal hemorrhage. This is an interesting case of acute pancreatitis with pseudocysts in which two rare complications developed.
