Papillary cystic and solid tumor of the pancreas. The papillary cystic and solid tumor of the pancrease (PCSTP) is a primary pancreatic neoplasm of unknown etiology occurring most commonly in young women and regularly containing hemorrhagic areas. Clinical symptoms are non-specific. Although these tumors reach an average diameter of 10 cm, they are often discovered by accident. Because patients with surgically resected PCSTP have very good prognoses, it is important to distinguish these tumors from other growths in the pancreas, for example mucinous cystadenoma. Whereas, due to the variable proportion of fluid components, these tumors offer non-characteristic structure at ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) possesses high specificity for PCSTP, particularly when calcifications are present. Angiography distinguishes these tumors from hypervascular neoplasms, such as the endocrinologically inactive islet cell tumor. Magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is especially suited for imaging the hemorrhagic areas in solid tumor formations, as well as hemorrhagic debris in the fluid portions and layer phenomena are frequently observed.
