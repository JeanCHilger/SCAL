Late solitary pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. A 76-year-old woman was admitted for a pancreatic mass. Twenty-one years previously she had undergone a left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. A computerized tomography-guided needle biopsy of the pancreatic mass raised the suspicion of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Final pathologic examination of the resected mass after distal subtotal pancreatectomy confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
