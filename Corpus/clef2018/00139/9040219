AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the pancreas. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a common complication in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection that most frequently affects the gastrointestinal tract. We describe the first case report of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma primarily involving the pancreas in a 27-yr-old white man who presented with epigastric pain, weight loss, and jaundice (and was later found to be HIV seropositive). Endoscopic ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen showed a large mass arising from the body and head of the pancreas obstructing the common bile duct. An attempted ERCP was unsuccessful due to extrinsic compression and distortion of the second part of the duodenum. A percutaneous CT-directed true-cut needle biopsy of the pancreas revealed a small noncleaved B-cell lymphoma. The patient was started on combination chemotherapy. His pancreatic mass, epigastric symptoms, and jaundice resolved completely. This case report illustrates an otherwise rare presentation of isolated pancreatic involvement of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. An approach to its diagnosis and management is summarized.
