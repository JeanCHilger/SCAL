Renal cell carcinoma of the spindle cell type with metastasis to the pancreas: a case report. We report a case of renal cell carcinoma in a 49-year-old man with multiple metastases, including some to the pancreas which were initially diagnosed as primary pancreatic carcinoma. The first clinical manifestation was jaundice caused by a large metastatic lymph node. Computed tomography showed tumors in the body and tall of the pancreas as well as in the left kidney. Angiography showed that all of the lesions were hypervascular. The patient was finally diagnosed as having renal cell carcinoma. Cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed. Intraoperative biopsy of the lymph nodes along the common hepatic artery showed spindle cell carcinoma which was compatible with renal cell carcinoma. Since renal cell carcinoma with pancreatic metastasis is rare, special attention should be paid to its differentiation from primary pancreatic carcinoma in patients with tumors in both the pancreas and kidneys.
