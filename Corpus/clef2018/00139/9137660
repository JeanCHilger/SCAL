Analysis of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), (1984-1994) decade. Comparison with a past series. Between 1984-1994 records of 190 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) were reviewed. Diagnosis was confirmed by surgery in 141, by necropsy 1 (75%), and for the remaining patients, by CT and clinical evaluation. Female 122 were female (64%), male 68 (36%), mean age 41 years (range 7-82 years). The etiologic factors were gallstones in 129 (68%) with 4 deaths (3%), alcoholic in 26 (14%) with 5 (19%) deaths, idiopathic in 24 (13%) and miscellaneous 11 (5%), the last 2 without mortality. The overall mortality was 5% (9/190). Surgical treatment was indicated in 141 (74%) and endoscopic treatment in 2 (1%), 47 patients (25%) received only medical treatment. One-hundred and fifty-four patients (81%) were mild forms with a Ranson mean score 2.2 without mortality. In this group, emergency surgery was indicated in 7 (6%), early in 3 (3%), late in 1 (0.9%) and elective in 99 (90%). In the severe group were 36 patients (19%) with a mean Ranson score of 4.2. Nine patients died (25%), 31 were surgically treated, by emergency surgery in 17 (47%), 1 (3%) early surgery and 13 (36%) late surgery. The mortality rate of this group was compared with previous series of the same hospital (1975-1984 series). The 1984-1994 group showed a significant overall mortality decrease 4.7% vs 12.7% (p = 0.0047) 3.1% vs 11.2% (p = 0.0087) for the gallstones group
