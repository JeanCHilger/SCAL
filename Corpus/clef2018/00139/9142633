Clinical update: management of acute pancreatitis. The management of acute pancreatitis commences with confirming the diagnosis and establishing the aetiology. Improved methods of assessing the biliary tree may reduce the number of patients regarded as having idiopathic pancreatitis. Detailed clinical and laboratory protocols, designed to assess severity, have no major advantage over clinical assessment. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan is important to assess the degree of pancreatic necrosis and to detect local complications. The treatment of pancreatitis continues to be largely supportive. However, controlled studies support the use of antibiotics in severe acute pancreatitis and indicate a possible role for the use of octreotide and antioxidants. The place of endoscopic and surgical intervention is becoming better defined. Once an attack has passed, further investigation is often required in a bid to prevent further episodes of inflammation.
