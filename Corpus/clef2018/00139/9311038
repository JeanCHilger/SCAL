Computed tomography of the retropancreatic peritoneal recess: a case of gastric leiomyosarcoma. We report computed tomography of the retropancreatic peritoneal recess in a case in which gastric leiomyosarcoma developed. Because of its location behind the pancreas, an abnormal finding in the retropancreatic peritoneal recess may be radiologically mistaken for a retroperitoneal abnormality. Knowledge of anatomy of posterior peritoneal recesses and understanding of fetal development are important in the radiological diagnosis of the lesions behind the pancreas.
