Excision of the duodenojejunal angle for tumor. From simple excision to locoregional excision. Locoregional extensions are often observed in tumors of the duodenojejunal angle, either because of their anatomic situation or in cases diagnosed late. Endoscopic and radiographic explorations (basically abdominal CT scan) are indicated to search determine the degree of extensions to neighboring organs and vessels. Colic and mesocolic involvement are at the limit of preoperative explorations. Based on 4 observations of increasing complexity, we describe our operative strategy allowing tumor exeresis in a single block. Extension to the superior mesenteric artery is the main contraindication for exeresis.
