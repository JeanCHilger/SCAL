Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall: radiologic findings. To determine the radiologic characteristics of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall.Ten patients with cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall and chronic pancreatitis underwent ultrasonography (US) (n = 10), computed tomography (CT) (n = 10), endoscopic US (n = 5), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (n = 9). Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall was classified as either cystic or solid. The imaging findings were retrospectively analyzed and compared with findings at pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 10).The more frequent cystic type (n = 7) of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall was characterized by the presence of easily recognizable cystic lesions (diameter, more than 1 cm), located within the thickened wall of the second portion of the duodenum. The solid type (n = 3) of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall demonstrated fibrous thickening of the duodenal wall within which small cysts (diameter, less than 1 cm) were present. The intraduodenal cysts were usually elongated or bilobate with a thick wall. The thickening of the duodenal wall appeared as a solid layer between the duodenal lumen and the pancreas, hypoechoic at US, isoattenuating at unenhanced CT, and hypoattenuating in the early phase (after initiation of infusion of contrast material) and isoattenuating in the late phase (after completion of infusion) at contrast material-enhanced CT. Findings at retrospective analysis of CT and endoscopic US images were characteristic.Imaging modalities, notably CT and endoscopic US, helped establish the diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall.
