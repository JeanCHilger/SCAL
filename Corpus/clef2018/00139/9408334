Surgical treatment of pancreatic head and periampullary tumors. The aim of this study was the comparison of the postoperative results of standard Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy (WP), pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) and palliative bypass operation performed for treatment of pancreatic head and periampullary tumors. In the period from Jan. 1992 to 1996 106 patients had tumors located in the head of pancreas and 21 patients had periampullary tumors. The diagnosis was established by ERCP, transabdominal ultrasonography and computer tomography. We assessed the morbidity, mortality, prognostical data of the surgery of pancreatic head and periampullary tumors. Tumor markers such as CEA, CA 19-9 and CA 125 were also studied. The operability rate was 26% in case of pancreatic head tumors and 69% in peri ampullary tumors. The mortality rate was 6%. Postoperative complications were in 23 patients(18.1%). There was no significant difference between the survival of WP and PPPD group, but we found much better survival in patients with periampullary tumor. After palliative operation the survival rate was 6.1 months in case of pancreatic head carcinoma and 11 months in case of periampullary tumors. Our data provided many evidences about the advantage of PPPD in the patients with malignant periampullary and pancreas head tumors and the long-term results and quality of life is much better after PPPD.
