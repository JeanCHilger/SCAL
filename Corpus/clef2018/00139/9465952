MR cholangiopancreatography using an open low field system of 0.2 tesla: early clinical results compared with a high field system (1.5 tesla) and ERCP. To evaluate MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) using an open low magnetic field apparatus in normals and in patients with mechanical cholestasis.MRCP was performed on five normals and on 30 patients, using both an 0.2 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla apparatus. With the low field system, rapid acquisition by relaxation enhancement was used, for the high field system, half Fourier acquisition single shot turbo spin-echo sequences were used. In all patients, sonography and ERCP or PTC was performed 23 underwent surgery.In all normals it was possible to show the bile duct, hepatic duct, gall bladder and intrahepatic ducts of the first order. Using the high field system, second order ducts could be shown and sometimes third order ducts. In the patients, MRCP, using either system, demonstrated all 21 obstructive sites due to tumours or stenoses. Stones were shown in 69% by the low field system and in 88% by the high field system.MRCP can be successfully carried out using the low field system. In the presence of mechanical cholestasis, image quality is adequate for the localisation of stenoses and occlusions, and, using an open magnet, is suitable for planning further intervention.
