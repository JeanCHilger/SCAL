Islet cell tumor in von Hippel-Lindau disease. We describe a 42-year-old man with von Hippel-Lindau disease and islet cell tumor of the pancreas. He had retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas. His sister had pheochromocytoma. A pancreatic tumor was detected by ultrasonography at his periodical medical checkup. Contrast enhanced computed tomography and abdominal angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the pancreatic head. Histological examination of the resected tumor revealed characteristics of islet cell tumor of the pancreas, which was positive for chromogranin-A, S-100 protein, and pancreatic polypeptide, but was negative for insulin, gastrin, glucagon, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, serotonin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone.
