Pictorial review: Radiological diagnosis of duodenal abnormalities. This article depicts the radiological findings of many common gastrointestinal entities. Specifically, examples of disease processes that affect the stomach, gall bladder, small intestine, pancreas and colon are shown. In most cases there is correlation between ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopic imaging. The major emphasis of the article, however, is to demonstrate classic barium imaging of a large number of gastrointestinal disease processes.
