Infections complicating pancreatitis: diagnosing, treating, preventing. The most important risk factor in patients suffering from acute necrotizing pancreatitis is pancreatic infection, a factor that determines the course of the disease, its therapeutic management, and its outcome. The bacterial infection route is very likely via the colon. In patients with acute pancreatitis, the infection rate is about 40 to 70% within the first 3 wks. Bacteria most frequently found are those from the gastrointestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, Streptococcus fecalis, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Screening methods for infected necrotizing pancreatitis include fine needle puncture by ultrasonography or computed tomographic guidance with Gram staining and culture of the aspirate. We previously investigated different broad-spectrum antibiotics with regard to their efficacy at preventing infection. This analysis indicated that antibiotics have different efficacy factors based on pharmacodynamic properties. Imipenem and quinolones, in combination with metronidazole, are the drugs of choice for treating or preventing pancreatic infection, whereas aminoglycosides do not enter the pancreas and therefore are not indicated. Based on increasing evidence that patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis will benefit by early and appropriate antibiotic therapy, we altered the approach in such patients with an immediate start of antibiotic therapy continued for at least 14 days. We have found a reduction of the infection rate to 33% (11/32) in the third week after the onset of the disease. This treatment of the infection and the possibility of delaying operative intervention resulted in optimal surgical conditions. However, further prospective, controlled, and randomized studies are necessary to determine which antibiotics and antimycotic therapeutic regimens should be chosen.
