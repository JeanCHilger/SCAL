Congenital short pancreas. Report of a new case observed during the course of a recurrent acute pancreatitis. A new case of congenital short pancreas (partial agenesis or hypoplasia of the dorsal pancreas) is reported. The patient was a 61-year-old caucasian man, referred for two episodes of non-severe acute biliary pancreatitis. Clinical and laboratory findings and the presence of ultrasound biliary sludge in the gallbladder supported the biliary origin of pancreatitis. Computerized tomography revealed a slightly enlarged and hypodense head of the gland but could not identify any pancreatic tissue in the region of the body and tail. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a short pancreas with a duct system in communication both with the accessory and main papilla. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and no further episodes of abdominal pain occurred. Short pancreas is a rare congenital abnormality consisting in the parenchyma and ductal system restricted to the head with some residual dorsal tapering and arborizing ducts communicating with the minor papilla. This anomaly can be an incidental finding and its association with episodes of recurrent pancreatitis needs to be proven.
