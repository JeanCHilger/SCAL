Value of MR cholangiography in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. To compare magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.The authors retrospectively reviewed MRCP and ERCP images obtained in 56 patients with pancreatic diseases and 192 controls. Detectability of the pancreatic duct and its branches and diagnostic usefullness were evaluated.MRCP was successful in almost all the patients without ascitic fluid or ileus. Findings of the main pancreatic ducts (i.e., dilation, stenosis and obstruction) were similarly demonstrated by ERCP and MRCP. The degree of ductal narrowing tends to be overestimated with MRCP.MRCP appears to be less invasive than ERCP. MRCP could provide sufficient information and play a complementary role in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.
