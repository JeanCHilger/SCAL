Advanced primary Hodgkin's disease of the spleen cured by surgical resection: report of a case. We describe herein the case of a 61-year-old man who underwent successful resection of advanced primary Hodgkin's disease of the spleen. On admission, computed tomography and ultrasonography showed a fist-sized, slightly enhanced mass, and angiography demonstrated a typical neoplastic tumor stain in the spleen. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a hard mass invading the splenic hilar lymph nodes, gastric upper body, transverse colon, pancreatic tail, and left lateral segment of the liver. The patient underwent splenectomy with combined resection of the surrounding organs invaded by the tumor, followed by postoperative chemotherapy. Histological examination showed many Reed-Sternberg cells, and the tumor was subsequently diagnosed as Hodgkin's disease of the spleen. The patient is currently well without any signs of recurrence 4 years after surgery.
