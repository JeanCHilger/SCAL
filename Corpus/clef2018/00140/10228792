Resection of triple synchronous cancers: a case report. We herein present a case of synchronous triple cancer, which was successfully resected in a curative manner. These cancers consisted of primary duodenal, pancreatic and lung cancers, which were diagnosed in an asymptomatic 74 year-old male, who was referred to our department on December 14, 1996. On admission, his laboratory data showed no abnormality, including tumor markers (CEA 1.0, CA 19-9 1.0, AFP 8.1 U/ml), but he did show an impaired pulmonary function (FEV1.0: 57%). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a smooth surfaced duodenal tumor measuring 4 cm in size. The second tumor was found at the head of the pancreas by computed tomography (CT), showing a hypervascular mass measuring 3.0 cm, along with neighboring multiple cysts. In endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), marked mucous secretion was observed through the papilla, while a filling defect was found in the dilated pancreatic duct. In a routine chest X-ray, a third tumor, which measured 1.5 cm in diameter, was recognized in the right upper lobe of the lung, and a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was also detected by a percutaneous CT guided biopsy. The pancreatic and duodenal tumors were surgically resected by a pancreatoduodenectomy (Stage I) in January 1997 and, 5 months later, a lung tumor underwent partial resection (Stage I). This patient tolerated these surgical procedures well and presently leads a normal, healthy life after discharge. In summary, a successful resection of synchronous triple cancers, which has never been previously reported in this specific combination, is described.
