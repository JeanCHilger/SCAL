Neuro-endocrine tumors and von Hippel-Lindau disease. 3 cases. Neuroendocrine tumors can occur in patients with hereditary syndromes predisposing to multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) and Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL).We report the cases of three men with pheochromocytomas, one with an associated neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. In one case, diagnosis was suggested by the familial context of VHL in the patients father. In the two other cases, the bilateral character of the pheochromocytoma, and in one case the associated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor led to the diagnosis of VHL. Systematic biological surveillance gave the diagnosis of contralateral pheochromocytoma in two cases. Search for associated tumoral lesions led to the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma of the cerebellum in two patients and pancreatic cyst in the third. No renal or retinal lesions were observed. Molecular study of the VHL gene evidenced point nonsense mutation of the gene in all three patients, involving codon 184 in two and codon 167 in the third (identical to the proband case). Systematic investigations in the families of the two other patients remains to be completed.The diagnosis of HVL disease should be suggested in case of familial pheochromocytoma and/or bilateral localizations, but also in case of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas associated with another cardinal lesion of the disease. Early screening and treatment of this potentially fatal disease is essential.
