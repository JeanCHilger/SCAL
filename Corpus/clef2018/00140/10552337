Giant solid cystic tumor of the pancreas with a fibrous septum caused by extracapsular growth in middle-aged woman: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 57-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital for treatment of rectal carcinoma and incidentally found to have a giant cystic tumor, 20 cm in diameter, in the body and tail of the pancreas. Several imaging procedures, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, showed that this tumor was round and hypovascular, and had a septum with protuberant lesions. The capsule was 3-4 mm thick with partial calcification. A preoperative diagnosis of a solid cystic tumor (SCT) of the pancreas was made, even though these tumors are rarely found in females in their fifties. Moreover, few reports of SCT with a septum have been described. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed, and the tumor was found to be filled with massive necrotic tissue. Microscopically, the tumor was confirmed to be a SCT with a fibrous septum. We present this case due to the atypical findings, including the age of the patient and the existence of a septum caused by extracapsular growth.
