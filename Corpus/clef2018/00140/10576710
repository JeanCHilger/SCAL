Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: comparison between respiratory-triggered turbo spin echo and breath hold single-shot turbo spin echo sequences. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative conspicuity of the pancreaticobiliary tree on respiratory-triggered three-dimensional turbo spin echo (3D TSE RT) and breath hold single-shot turbo spin echo (SSTSE BH) acquisitions respectively in MRCP imaging. Both techniques were applied to 61 patients with clinically suspected pancreaticobiliary disease using a 1.0 T MR system. All images were reviewed blindly. Qualitative comparison was made by grading subjectively the conspicuity of extrahepatic, intrahepatic, and main pancreatic ducts. Quantitative comparison included calculations of signal-to-noise ratio of the common bile duct, main pancreatic duct, gallbladder, liver, and contrast-to-noise ratio, relative contrast between common bile duct, gallbladder, and liver. 3D TSE RT provided significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio of the common bile duct (mean value 163.19) and main pancreatic duct (mean value 95.37) compared to SSTSE BH (mean values 76.24 and 26.22, respectively). 3D TSE RT was inferior to SSTSE BH for the depiction of intrahepatic ducts and pancreatic duct (head portion). 3D TSE RT and SSTSE BH sequences provide complimentary information in the visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Further comparative clinical studies are needed to redefine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRCP using both sequences.
