Intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) of the pancreato-biliary duct system. Personal experience and review of literature. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) represents a major advance in endoscopic imaging. Usefulness and effectiveness of EUS have been established during the past few years. However, endosonography using dedicated echoendoscopes (7.5/12 MHz) has some serious drawbacks: (1) combining endoscopy and ultrasonography in one instrument increases the diameter of such echoendoscopes (13 mm) (2) as a result of the large diameter insertion into the pancreato-biliary duct system is not feasible at all
