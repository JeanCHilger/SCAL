Diagnosis and surgical treatment of pancreatic carcinoma. The aim of the study was presentation of our experiences in the diagnostics and treatment of pancreatic carcinoma in confrontation with current opinions. Between 1983 and April 1998 308 patients (198 males and 110 females with mean age 61 years) were treated at our department. In 211 cases tumor was primarily localized in the head and in 97 cases (31.5%) in the body or tail of pancreas. The diagnosis was determined on the basis of clinical symptoms and laboratory investigations. Diagnostic accuracy of performed investigations was as following. Ultrasonography-86%, CT-scan-95%, and ERCP-94%. Ultrasonography or CT guided biopsy and serodiagnostics improved detectability of resectionable carcinoma in the last past years. Among 308 patients, 292 underwent surgery. Since 1997 an intraoperative ultrasonography and cholangioscopy of common bile duct and Virsung were performed as a routine. The procedures depended on the localization and the grade of advance of the tumors. UICC classification of pancreatic tumors, pTNM (4th edition 1987) it was used. Only in 25 patients (8%) (tumors pT1a-bN0M0) it was possible to perform radical operation (resection of the pancreas). However in 172 patients (56%) only palliative procedures were done (pT2N1M0). In 95 patients (31%) only laparotomy and biopsy were performed (tumors pT2N1M1). The study shows that although diagnostic methods are improved, the tumors of the pancreas are diagnosed in stages making unable the radical procedures. Only about 10% of carcinomas are resectable. It is caused by with non-characteristic picture of the disease in its early stage.
