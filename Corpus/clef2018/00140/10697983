A case of retroperitoneal pancreatic abscess spreading to the femoral region. Authors report the case of a 47 years old male patient with acute femoral abscess. The examinations made with urgency found proceeding acute pancreatitis, fluid collection in the right pleural cavity, exceeding fluid collections in the retroperitoneum and right paracolic region. The inflammatory infiltrate and collection in the upper third of the right thing seemed to be in connection with the proceeding pancreatitis. Because of the process endangering also the viability of the limb and severe septic state, an acute operation was performed, in the course of which extension of the retroperitoneal abscess to the thing was observed. After abdominal oncotomy expanded to thigh and inguinal region, lavage, drainage operations, therapy with wide spectrum followed by aimed antibiotics general condition of the patient improved. On the 18 postoperative day a new feverish state manifested. Image forming examinations showed newer purulent collections in the abdominal cavity and on the thigh in addition to the previous abscesses. Because of this repeated exposure was necessary. After the second operation the patient recovered without complaint and further complications. Authors think the case worth attention because of the extensive and unusual localization of abscesses formed beside the relatively discrete abdominal complaints.
