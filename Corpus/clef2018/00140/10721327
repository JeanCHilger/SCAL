Pancreatic serous cystadenoma associated with islet cell tumour. We report the case of a 29-year-old female patient with a diffuse type of serous cystadenoma involving the entire pancreas except for part of the head, which was replaced by islet cell tumour. Ultrasound and CT showed multiple cysts in the entire pancreas and a solid mass with calcification in the head. MRI characterized the fluid content of the cysts and the extent of disease.
