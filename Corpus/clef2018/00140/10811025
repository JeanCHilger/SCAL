A case of pancreatic carcinoma with marked ductal dilatation: what contributed to the dilatation? We report the case of an 82-yr-old man with invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreatic head, in which the main pancreatic duct and duct of Santorini were markedly dilated, measuring 1.6 and 1.1 cm, respectively, in diameter on computed tomography.A preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma of the pancreatic head was made, and Whipple's procedure was carried out.Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, and the resected pancreatic parenchyma showed low papillary mucous cell hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia in dilated ductular branches. Conclusion. Even among patients with tubular adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, if the patient is aged and has chronic pancreatitis, the main pancreatic duct and duct of Santorini may dilate to the same degree as in mucin-hypersecreting neoplasm.
