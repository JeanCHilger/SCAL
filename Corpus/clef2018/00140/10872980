Ultrasound-guided laparoscopic resection of pancreatic islet cell tumors. Pancreatic islet cell tumors represent a diverse group of neuroendocrine lesions. These tumors may be singular or multiple, benign or malignant, sporadic, or part of the constellation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tumors such as insulinomas and gastrinomas produce gastrointestinal peptides that lead to diagnosis. Nonfunctioning lesions may be found incidentally or by screening patients at high risk for such tumors. Successful management of patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors relies on accurate localization and sound operative technique. With proper preoperative localization, advanced laparoscopic methods can be used to manage patients with these pancreatic neoplasms. Preoperative localization of pancreatic islet cell tumors was difficult in the past. Standard imaging and localizing modalities, such as computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, transabdominal sonography, and portal venous sampling, yield only 24% to 75% accuracy. Consequently, many biochemically suspected lesions cannot be imaged with current techniques. Decreased tactile sensation of laparoscopy adds complexity to intraoperative identification. Endoscopic sonography and laparoscopic sonography provide accurate preoperative and intraoperative localization to enhance laparoscopic and open resection. The authors treated two patients with islet cell neoplasms using endoscopic sonography to preoperatively visualize the tumors and laparoscopic sonography to guide laparoscopic enucleation. Their approach and difficulties are discussed.
