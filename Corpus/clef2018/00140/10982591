A novel technique for multiple pancreatectomies: removal of unicinate process of the pancreas combined with medial pancreatectomy. Preservation of normal pancreatic tissue in the surgical treatment of benign tumors of the pancreas offers advantages over more extended pancreatic resections. Removal of the uncinate process of the pancreas with the preservation of Wirsung's duct allows resection of a localized tumor within the uncinate process of the pancreas, maintains the flow of pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and preserves the dorsal part of the head of the gland. A pancreatic duct stent is particularly useful to identify the pancreatic duct (Wirsung's duct) intraoperatively to avoid injury which causes postoperative pancreatic leak. We have developed and employed a novel technique whereby tumors are completely excised, in combination with medial pancreatectomy, for the management of multiple mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas localized in the uncinate process and in the body of the pancreas. The cut end of the head of the pancreas is closed by interrupted sutures. Reconstruction for the distal pancreas is effected with a Roux-en-Y pancreatico-jejunostomy to the tail of the pancreas. Recovery was uncomplicated in our patient, with no endocrine or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency after 2-year follow-up.
