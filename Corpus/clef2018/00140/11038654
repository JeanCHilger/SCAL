Pathology of the pancreas. Analysis of 172 resection specimens. New sophisticated surgical methods enabled interventions on pancreas which kept remaining without attention of gastrointestinal surgeons for a long time because of previously unsolvable reasons. Pancreatic resection specimens enter now the biopsy diagnostics the correct interpretation of which needs a perfect technology of processing. Biopsy under CT monitoring, fibroscopical techniques combined with contrast investigation, biochemical, cytological and bioptic analyses of samples brought new diagnostic aspects into pancreatic disorders. The authors present a classification analysis based on their group of 172 resection specimens from 165 patients: tumor lesions are represented by 52 specimens, inflammatory lesions by 112 specimens, 8 cases are of another nature or are lacking in a clear diagnostic classification. Bioptic investigation can settle the diagnosis of very rare nosological entities which were distinguished before only in necroptic material (adult nesidioblastosis, Schwachman-Diamond syndrome associated with ductal carcinoma of the head of pancreas, and others).
