Septic thrombophlebitis of the mesenteric and portal veins: CT imaging. Pylephlebitis or septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein and its tributaries is an acute ascending infection arising often from a primary gastrointestinal inflammatory lesion. Common primary sources of infection are diverticulitis, appendicitis, and infected pancreatic necrosis. CT imaging can diagnose this complication at an early stage and can significantly improve the previously reported high mortality and morbidity rates associated with this condition.
