Citrullinemia type II in a 64-year-old man with fluctuating serum citrulline levels. We describe a 64-year-old man with 'citrullinemia type II' whose serum citrulline levels fluctuated between normal and abnormally high during episodic manifesting periods. Elevations of the serum threonine/serine ratio and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor level are very useful diagnostic markers. Our patient's cerebrospinal fluid citrulline level was also elevated, and T1-weighted magnetic resonance images revealed high-intensity signals at the bilateral internal capsule and the cerebral peduncles. Single-photon emission computed tomography of his brain showed reduced bilateral temporal lobar blood flow. Even if the serum citrulline level is within the normal range, citrullinemia should be considered in adult patients without primary liver dysfunction who show episodic consciousness disturbance, psychotic symptoms or both.
