Penetration of the duodenum by an ingested needle with migration to the pancreas: report of a case. A case of a penetration of the duodenum by a needle with migration to the pancreas in a 50-year-old man is reported herein. The patient was referred to us with a chief complaint of diarrhea. An abdominal plain roentgenogram showed a needle in the upper abdominal area. An abdominal computed tomography scan and contrast X-ray revealed the foreign body to be located outside of the duodenum and in the head of the pancreas. An emergency operation was therefore performed on the first day and the needle in the head of the pancreas was thus extirpated safely. A perforation of the gastrointestinal tract by an ingested foreign body is difficult to accurately and quickly diagnose when no peritonitis or abscess formation is observed. Therefore, the use of contrast X-ray is considered to be useful in the diagnosis of such a perforation.
