Impact of new diagnostic imaging methods on pancreatic angiography. The results of 100 consecutive pancreatic arteriograms performed in concert with a combination of other diagnostic procedures (gray scale ultrasonography, computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography) were evaluated to determine the value of angiography in diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected pancreatic disease. Angiography was found to be valuable for diagnosis in 68% (68/100) of cases and was considered helpful for management in 81% (57/70) of patients with pancreatic neoplasm, pancreatitis, or a nonpancreatic abnormality.
