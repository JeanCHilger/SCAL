Complete remission of brain metastases from prostate cancer by gamma knife radiosurgery: a case report. A 59-year-old male visited us with a chief complaint of dysuria. The serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was within normal limits, and intravenous pyelography and urethrocystography showed no abnormal findings. Because of his urinary retention, transurethral resection of prostate was performed under a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Not only combination hormone therapy with goserelin acetate and flutamide, but also intermittent arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and pirarubicin (THP) using a reservoir system was administered. Additionally total pelvic irradiation was delivered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated that his prostate was reduced to less than 50% in size and he had no difficulty in voiding. He suddenly developed dysarthria and hemiplegia 3 months later. MRI and computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple brain metastases. After the gamma knife radiosurgery, neurological findings disappeared and MRI showed dramatic shrinkage of metastatic brain tumors. Metastasis to the pancreas was recognized on CT and he died of multiple organ failure 30 months after his first visit.
