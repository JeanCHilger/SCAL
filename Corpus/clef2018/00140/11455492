Solitary pancreatic tuberculosis mimicking advanced pancreatic carcinoma. A 40-year-old woman was referred for pancreatic head carcinoma invading the portal vein. The dichotomy between the radiological findings and the general condition of the patient, as well as the laboratory results (no evidence of cholestasis), cast doubt on the diagnosis. There was no history of tuberculosis. The chest radiograph revealed no pathological findings. The anatomic relationships of the lesion entailed a high risk of vascular injury if tissue biopsy were to be done therefore, diagnostic laparotomy was performed. Biopsy revealed granulomas with caseous necrosis, consistent with tuberculosis. After 6 months of antituberculosis treatment, the lesions had completely resolved. Tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses, particularly in regions where the disease is endemic. The condition usually resembles an advanced pancreatic tumor. Performing a biopsy of inoperable lesions and maintaining a reasonable skepticism in regard to the evaluation of operable lesions (attention to nonexclusive but helpful clues, such as young patient age, history of tuberculosis, absence of jaundice) will lead to the diagnosis in most patients. Diagnostic laparotomy may be required in a small subset of patients. The response to antituberculosis treatment is very favorable. The role of resection (e.g., pancreatoduodenectomy) is very limited.
