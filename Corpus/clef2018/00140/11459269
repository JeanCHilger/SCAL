Islet cell tumors of the pancreas: the medical oncologist's perspective. Islet cell tumors of the pancreas are rare, indolent, neuroendocrine tumors. Approximately 50% of the patients diagnosed with these tumors present with symptoms related to various biologically active hormones that are secreted by these neoplasms. Currently, the only curative treatment for islet cell tumors is complete surgical resection. Management of metastatic disease is conservative. Initial treatment of these tumors includes expectant observation and medical management of symptoms with clinical monitoring and serial CT scans to assess tumor growth. Patients with rapidly progressive disease, with local symptoms caused by tumor bulk, or with uncontrolled symptoms related to hormone secretion require more aggressive medical or surgical intervention. The somatostatin analogue octreotide may help control hormone secretion and stabilize tumor growth. Patients refractory to octreotide with tumor predominantly in the liver are potential candidates for mechanical ablative techniques, such as hepatic arterial embolization. Radiofrequency ablation and cryosurgical techniques may also be useful, although specific data are limited. Surgical resection of metastatic disease may offer palliative relief of symptoms related to hormone secretion in carefully selected patients. Chemotherapy may be used for palliation when ablative techniques have failed or when significant extrahepatic disease is present. Streptozicin-based combinations remain the first line standard, but major objective responses are less common than had been previously thought. Because of the overall modest success of current chemotherapeutic regimens, patients with advanced disease in need of treatment should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials testing newer antineoplastic agents or newer treatment strategies.
