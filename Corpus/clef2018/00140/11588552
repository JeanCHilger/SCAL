A solid cystic tumor of the pancreas with ossification and possible malignancy, coexisting nonfusion of the pancreatic ducts. We report the case of a 34-year-old woman with a solid cystic tumor (SCT) of the pancreas accompanied by ossification and possible malignancy, coexisting nonfusion of the pancreatic ducts. There was a 24 x 29 x 33-mm mass with a prominent calcified lesion in the tail of the pancreas detected by abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. There were no distal metastases detected. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed nonfusion of the pancreatic ducts. The resected tumor consisted of solid and cystic components. The tumor was not encapsulated and included a severely ossified lesion inside. On microscopy, the tumor cells were small, eosinophilic, and proliferated in a solid or pseudo-papillary pattern. The tumor cells infiltrated into the surrounding normal pancreas parenchyma and invaded part of the mesentery. The immunostaining was positive for alpha-1-antitrypsin, neuron-specific enolase, vimentin, and chromogranin A. In the literature, only a few cases of SCT of the pancreas described ossification. As far as we know, only three cases of SCT of the pancreas, which demonstrated nonfusion of the pancreatic ducts, have been reported. Thus, SCT of the pancreas with ossification, possible malignancy, and coexisting nonfusion of the pancreatic ducts is extremely rare.
