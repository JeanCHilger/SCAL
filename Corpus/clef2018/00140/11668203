Usefulness of supernatant of pancreatic juice for genetic analysis of K-ras in diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. To ascertain whether analysis of K-ras mutations at codon 12 (KRM) in the supernatant of pure pancreatic juice (PPJ) is more useful for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma (PCa) than that in sediment, the authors analyzed KRM in DNA extract from not only the sediment but also the supernatant of PPJ and compared the results.PPJ was collected endoscopically from 19 patients with PCa and 25 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). DNA was extracted from the supernatant and the sediment of PPJ. Mutant allele-specific amplification (MASA) was performed for KRM analysis with the DNA extracts from these samples.The incidence of KRM in the supernatant of PPJ was 89% (17 of 19) in patients with PCa and 28% (7 of 25) in patients with CP, whereas that in the sediment was 79% (15 of 19) in patients with PCa and 20% (5 of 25) in patients with CP. Although there was no significant difference in KRM incidence between supernatant and sediment, the positive rate of KRM was higher in the former. Additionally, with regard to the PCa cases, KRM were found in the supernatant alone in four cases and in the sediment alone in two cases. Consequently, by a combination assay, all of the patients with PCa showed KRM in either the supernatant or sediment of PPJ. Although there was no relation between the incidence of KRM in PPJ and the location and size of tumor, and clinical stage of carcinoma in the patients with PCa, two patients with clinical stage I disease showed KRM in the supernatant.These results suggest that the positive rate of KRM in the supernatant is not lower than that in the sediment, and simultaneous analysis of KRM in the supernatant and sediment of PPJ enhances the genetic diagnosis of PCa.
