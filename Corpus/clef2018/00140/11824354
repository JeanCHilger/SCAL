Diagnosis of pancreas tumors: MRI or multidetector spiral CT?. Recent technical advances in the field of abdominal MRI and multi-detector spiral-CT (MSCT) have resulted in improved diagnostic capabilities of pancreatic tumors. Preliminary data demonstrate slight advantages of MRI in the detection of liver metastases and papillary tumors as well as in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses while MSCT might be advantageous in the assessment of vascular infiltration, particular in uncooperative patients.
