Resectional therapy for cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Currently there is uncertainty in diagnosis between the serous (benign) and mucinous (premalignant) forms of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas without operation. Our objective is to evaluate resectional therapy as a treatment for these lesions. A retrospective review of cases from 1985 to 1999 were performed. There were 14 cases of serous cystadenoma (SCA), 11 cases of mucinous cystadenoma (MCA), and five cases of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (MCAC). A female predominance was seen in all lesions (100% in SCA, 64% in MCA, and 80% in MCAC) with a mean age at presentation of 59 years. Most patients presented with pain (SCA = 64%, MCA = 55%, and MCAC = 80%). Weight loss was seen in 35 per cent of all patients and was present in all cases of MCAC. Importantly 36 per cent of MCA patients were asymptomatic. Lesions were identified as multicystic on CT reports of 62 per cent of SCA patients, 50 per cent of MCA patients and 75 per cent of MCAC patients. Size was similar between groups. All patients were treated with surgical resection operative morbidity was 27 per cent and mortality was zero. Actuarial 5-year survival for SCA, MCA, and MCAC was 100, 100, and 33 per cent, respectively. Differentiating serous from mucinous is not possible based on presenting symptoms and radiologic findings. Surgical resection is justified on the basis of low morbidity and negligible mortality rates.
