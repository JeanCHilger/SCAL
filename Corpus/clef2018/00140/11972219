Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Three cases of insulinoma. Surgery for benign pancreatic disease has traditionally required a major laparotomy however the minimal-access approach is now being applied to a wide variety of procedures, and surgery of the pancreas need not be excluded.Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed on three patients presenting with insulinomas found on preoperative investigation to lie within the tail of the pancreas.All three patients had an excellent clinical outcome and returned to a state of normoglycemia. All of them made a rapid recovery with no major complications.Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a viable technique for removing insulinoma of the tail of the pancreas.
