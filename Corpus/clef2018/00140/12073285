Fibroma of the root of small intestine mesentery. Fibromas are rarely localized in the abdomen, but almost always in the mesentery or omentum. We present a 63-year old woman in whom the examination of the upper abdominal pain showed a well distinct abdominal mass at the level of the lower edge of the pancreas. During the operation a tumour, 100 x 87 x 70 mm in size, from the radix of small bowel mesentery, was excised. Seven months later the patient is symptom-free with normal ultrasonographic and CT findings.
