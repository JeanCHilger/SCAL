Very-high-flow injection rate for upper abdominal CT angiography. The purpose of this study was to compare a very-high-flow injection-rate method (group A) and a conventional injection-rate method (group B) for visualization of upper abdominal arteries by multidetector helical computed tomography (MDHCT).The subjects were 240 patients suspected to have abdominal lesions. They were randomly assigned to group A (120 patients) and group B (120 patients). In group A, the bilateral medial cubital veins were punctured, and contrast medium was infused at a rate of 8.6-9.6 ml/s. In group B, the unilateral medial cubital vein was punctured, and contrast medium was infused at a rate of 2.0-3.0 ml/s. The quality of vascular visualization was graded as poor, good, or excellent by three radiologists.All visualizations of the celiac trunk (CE) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) were graded as excellent in both group A and group B. Visualization grades of the subsegmental branches of the hepatic artery (HA), right gastric artery (RGA), cystic artery, dorsal pancreatic artery (DPA), and superior pancreaticoduodenal artery (SPDA) were good or excellent, in 75% (paging method)/53.3% (three-dimensional method), 85%/30%, 77.7%/18.3%, 76.7%/28.3%, and 88.3%/42.5%, respectively, in group A, and 33.3%/11.7%, 46.7%/3.4%, 41.6%/5%, 55%/4.2%, and 72.5%/14.2%, respectively, in group B. The appearance rate of intrahepatic portal branches was 28.3% in group A and 66.7% in group B in the arterial dominant phase.Group A showed better visualization results than Group B in upper abdominal arteries according to MDHCT.
