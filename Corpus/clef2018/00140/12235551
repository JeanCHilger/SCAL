Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas in a 9-year-old girl. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas constitutes a very rare benign or low-grade malignant lesion occurring most commonly in young women and girls. It was first described by Frantz. Local infiltration, distant metastasis and recurrence are very rare. Until today, the histogenetic origin of the tumor cell remains to be elucidated. In 1996, solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas was introduced in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the exocrine pancreas. Our case report--like a recently published work by Lange et al.--intends to underline the significance of solid-pseudopapillary tumor in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass.
