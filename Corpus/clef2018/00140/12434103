Clinical response of an atypical glucagonoma treated with a long-acting somatostatin analog. Glucagonomas are rare tumors originating in alpha-cells of the pancreas. The most common clinical presentation is the association of diabetes mellitus, necrolytic erythema, weight loss and anemia. The diagnosis of pancreatic tumor is usually made by abdominal computed tomography and/or endoscopic ultrasonography. Indium-labeled octreotide scanning is useful for the localization of most neuroendocrine tumors and their metastases. Glucagon release can be confirmed by a high concentration of plasma glucagon. We report the case of a 74-year-old patient who had a glucagonoma with particular presentation of neurological impairment and weight loss. The diagnosis was confirmed by usual imaging procedures and plasma glucagon level. Medical treatment was started with long-acting repeatable octreotide (Sandostatin(R) LAR). After a one-year follow-up, the patient remained well. The original presentation and benefit of a new, long-acting somatostatin analog for the treatment of inoperable glucagonoma are discussed.
