Cutaneous metastasis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a case report and a review of the literature. We treated a 77-year-old Japanese man with cutaneous metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Physical examinations revealed reddish, non-tender and firm nodules in left axilla. Laboratory examination showed a remarkable elevation in the tumor markers of CA 19-9, DUPAN-2 and SPAN-1. Abdominal computed tomography showed a low-density mass in the tail of the pancreas, and histological examination of nodule in the axilla revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma. The immunohistochemistry of CA 19-9 in the excised nodule was positive. Cutaneous metastasis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually rare, and the prognosis is poor, as the disease is usually advanced.
