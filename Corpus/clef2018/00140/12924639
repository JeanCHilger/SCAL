Secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance pancreaticogram to assess pancreatic duct outflow obstruction in evaluation of idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis: a pilot study. Magnetic resonance pancreatography is a new modality to visualize the pancreatic duct. Prolonged dilation of the pancreatic duct following secretin administration may suggest obstruction at the level of the pancreatic duct orifice. We describe 10 patients with idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis who underwent secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance pancreatography with subsequent endoscopic retrograde pancreatogram with or without manometry. All patients had complete visualization of the main pancreatic duct and no evidence of chronic duct disease. Two patients had pancreas divisum. Three had prolonged dilation of the pancreatic duct on secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance pancreatography and evidence of pancreatic duct outflow obstruction. Four additional patients with pancreatic duct outflow obstruction had normal secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance pancreatography. In conclusion, secretin stimulated magnetic resonance pancreatography provides high quality pancreatic duct images and has high specificity but low sensitivity for diagnosing pancreatic duct outflow obstruction using manometric/clinical criteria.
