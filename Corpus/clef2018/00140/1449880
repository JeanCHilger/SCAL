CT compared to angiography for staging of tumors of the pancreatic head. A retrospective study of 32 patients with malignant tumor of the pancreatic head and ampullary region is presented. The aim of the study was to compare the ability of CT and angiography to evaluate the peripancreatic vessels, and to correlate the results of tumor staging based upon CT criteria to angiographic and surgical findings. In 5 patients (16%) CT disclosed contiguous tumor growth around vessels not discernible at angiography and, in contradiction to previous reports, angiography added no valuable information regarding main vessel involvement. In terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value CT was more accurate in predicting unresectable than resectable tumors, the former with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%.
