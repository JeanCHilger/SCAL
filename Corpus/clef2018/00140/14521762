A case report of cystic fibrosis and review of 16 cases of cystic fibrosis in Chinese patients. To report a case of cystic fibrosis (CF) in a Chinese and to review the clinical features, gene mutations, diagnosis and outcome of CF in Chinese patients.A 14-year-old Chinese girl presenting with recurrent productive cough since birth with parasinusitis and otitis media was confirmed to have CF in Peking University First Hospital. Chest CT scan showed bronchiectasis, more severe in the right upper lobe. Sweat tests were taken three times, and the values of Na(+) and Cl(-) were (126.6 +/- 5.4) mmol/L and (108.9 +/- 3.3) mmol/L, respectively. The examination of the pancreas showed no remarkable cystic changes on CT scan and there was no pancreatic insufficiency. Sixteen patients with CF in Chinese reported from 1974 to 1999 were reviewed.Sixteen of the 17 patients (7 males and 9 females, aged from 6 months to 25 years) had clinical data available for analysis. Eleven of them had died, nine before the age of 13. They all suffered from frequent episodes of pneumonia, while 14 had malnutrition and 4 had jaundice. The diagnostic procedures included clinical features, sweat test and autopsy. Four of them had DNA screened and four kinds of novel mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene were found.Chinese patients with CF show similar clinical manifestations to patients in the European and North American populations, but the CFTR mutation was different.
