Primary mucinous cystadenoma arising from behind the posterior peritoneum of the descending colon in a child: a case report. This is the first report of a primary mucinous cystadenoma (MCA) arising from behind the posterior peritoneum of the descending colon in a paediatric patient. A large intra-abdominal cystic lesion was found incidentally during renal ultrasonography in a 14-year-old girl. Imaging studies showed a 13 x 9 x 15 cm homogeneous cystic lesion with mild contrast enhancement of the wall. The cyst appeared to originate from the retroperitoneum, but was separated from the left kidney, ovary, and pancreas. At laparotomy, there was a cyst behind the posterior peritoneum of the descending colon. The cyst was successfully excised, and histopathology showed MCA. Although primary MCA in the retroperitoneum is extremely rare in children, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an intra-abdominal cyst, since it needs to be excised to eliminate the risk of infection, recurrence, and malignancy.
