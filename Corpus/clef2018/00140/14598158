Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for Frantz's tumor in a child. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare pathologic entity. Although the role of laparoscopy in surgery of the pancreas is still controversial, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy has been reported with good results in adults. We report a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy in a 9-year-old boy who presented with a low-grade malignant tumor. Needle biopsy was impossible. A laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed. We used four trocars, and the operative time was 240 min. Conversion to open surgery was not necessary. The boy's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on the 6th day. CT-scan control at 6 months was normal. This case shows that even in advanced surgical cases, such as spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, laparoscopic procedures can be done safely, within a reasonable operative time, in children.
