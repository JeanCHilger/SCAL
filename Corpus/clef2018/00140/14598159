Hand-assisted laparoscopic resection of serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. It is difficult to exclude the possibility of malignancy of pancreatic cystic tumors because a biopsy of the pancreas is hard to obtain. The indication of open surgery for those cystic tumors without evidence of malignancy is controversial. Therefore, laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted procedure would be an adequate choice of treatment for cystic tumors of the pancreas. Hand-assisted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen and the splenic artery and vein was performed for two cases of pancreatic cystic tumors. Three ports and one hand port were used. After careful dissection and accurate hemostasis between the pancreas and splenic vessels, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was carried out using an endoscopic linear stapler. There were no perioperative complications. The pathological diagnoses were oligocystic serous cystadenoma and solitary cystic serous cystadenoma, respectively. Hand-assisted, spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the splenic artery and vein is a feasible procedure for the treatment of benign or borderline-malignant cystic lesions of the distal pancreas.
