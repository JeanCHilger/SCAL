Diabetes mellitus and pancreatic tumor. A 68 year old Ecuadorian man was investigated for polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss of 3 kg during the previous two months. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was diagnosed 10 year before admission and treated with appropriate diet and insulin (35 U/d). 18 months before was diagnosed in El Ecuador of "multiple liver nodes non-suggestive of malignancy". Physical examination showed a large multinodular petrous hepatomegaly. There was no evidence of skin lesions. Results of laboratory studies included a basal plasma glucose level that ranged between 275-367 mg/dl (N=60-100), glycosylated haemoglobin of 8.9% (N<5) and a serum albumin of 2.8 gr./dl (N=3.4-4.8). At admission non-other laboratory alterations were detected. Computed tomography showed a mass on the head of the pancreas with loco-regional lymph nodes and liver metastases. Tumor markers were normal. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the liver masses revealed the presence of liver metastases of a non-differentiated malignant tumor. A 111In-DTPAOC scintigraphy revealed the presence of somatostatin receptors in the liver metastases, also detecting the presence of multiple bone metastases in the axial and appendicular skeleton. Plasma glucagon level was 678 pg/ml (N<250). A diagnosis of metastatic glucagonoma was established and therapy with streptozocin, 5-FU, insulin and synthetic somatostatin analogs was initiated. Three months after the therapy initiation the patient was symptom free. Some weeks after the patient suffered from left hip pain, and a control 111In-DTPA scintigraphy showed progression of his bone metastases. In conclusion, glucagonoma must be suspected in all diabetic patients with metastatic liver, even in absence of necrotic migratory erythema. In these circumstances, plasmatic glucagon level and somatostatin receptors scintigraphy will be a useful tool for establishing the final diagnosis.
