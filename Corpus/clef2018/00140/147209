Radiological and sonographic investigation of pancreatic pseudocysts (author's transl). Based on a retrospective study of 14 patients with pancreatic pseudocysts, the ultrasonic evaluation of the pancreas is discussed and correlated to the conventional radiologic, endoscopic and angiographic examinations. The pancreatic sonography, as a non-invasive examination, is the method of choice for pancreatic screening and is recommended whenever a pancreatic pseudocyst is suspected.
