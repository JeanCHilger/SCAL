Calcifying obstructive pancreatitis: a study of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm associated with pancreatic calcification. We have observed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) associated with pancreatic calcification. The aim of this study is to describe the profile of IPMN associated with calcification and gain insights into the pathogenesis of calcification in IPMN.We identified 10 patients with IPMN with pancreatic calcification, of whom 7 underwent pancreatic resection. We reviewed demographic data, history of previous pancreatitis, and radiological and histological features of these patients.In patients with IPMN with calcification (mean age, 65 +/- 12 yr 50% men), a diagnosis of chronic calcifying pancreatitis was entertained in 5 of 10 patientsIPMN associated with pancreatic calcification can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment for chronic calcifying pancreatitis. In the absence of intratumoral calcification or a previous history of long-standing chronic pancreatitis, calcification in IPMN likely represents a unique and hitherto unrecognized form of calcifying obstructive pancreatitis caused by prolonged partial obstruction of the pancreatic duct.
