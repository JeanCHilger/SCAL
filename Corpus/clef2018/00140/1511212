Magnetic resonance tomography: value and limits in gastroenterologic diagnosis. At present, the value and limitations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic modality in gastroenterology cannot be conclusively determined. MRI has a high sensitivity in the detection of focal liver lesions. The signal intensity of focal liver lesions on plain and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and on plain T2-weighted scans narrows the differential diagnosis in many cases. Imaging of the gallbladder and pancreas presently is no indication for MRI. The high sensitivity of MRI in the detection of fistulae and abscesses in Crohn's disease and the differentiation from fibrosis represents an advantage over other modalities in imaging of inflammatory bowel disease. MRI is superior to CT in differentiating recurrent rectal cancer from fibrosis. Further development of MRI and the use of contrast media for both oral and intravenous administration may offer new perspectives of MRI in the diagnosis of diseases in gastroenterology.
