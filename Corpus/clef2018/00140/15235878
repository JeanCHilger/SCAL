Intraductal growth of a nonfunctioning endocrine tumor of the pancreas. Intraductal growth of nonfunctioning endocrine tumors of the pancreas may be very rare, and our survey of literature shows only two cases have been described. We report a case of a 43-year-old man with a nonfunctioning endocrine tumor of the pancreas that uniquely grew within the lumen of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) without ductal involvement and completely obstructed the MPD. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were very helpful to delineate the intraductal growth of the tumor and to determine the resection line of the pancreas. A nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor is important to consider on differential diagnoses when complete obstruction of the MPD is demonstrated on ERCP. It is speculated that the tumor originated from precursor cells of the pancreatic duct or islet cells adjacent to the MPD and slowly proliferated within the lumen of the MPD.
