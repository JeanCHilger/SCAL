Spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy after division of the splenic vessels. A 37-year-old woman with a history of syncope was hospitalized with a diagnosis of hypoglycemia due to insulinoma. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhanced solid mass, 1.5 cm in diameter, at the tail of the pancreas. Angiography via the splenic artery revealed a hypervascular mass. Because the tumor was located deep in the pancreatic parenchyma, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed. The pancreas was exposed by dissecting the greater omentum, and the tumor was located by intraoperative ultrasonography. After division of the splenic artery, the pancreas, main pancreatic duct, and splenic vein were transected with an endoscopic linear stapler. The pancreatic pedicle was divided at the splenic hilum to preserve the spleen. The postoperative course was uneventful except for the appearance of splenic infarction on a CT scan 2 weeks after surgery but without any overt symptoms. Spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy by division of splenic vessels is a feasible treatment option for benign pancreatic disease.
