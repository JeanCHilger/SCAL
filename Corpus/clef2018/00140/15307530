Late recognition of primary pancreatic carcinoid--case report. Primary pancreatic carcinoid is an extremely rare pancreatic neoplasm. The most frequently it metastasizes to regional lymph nodes and liver. Carcinoids of the pancreas display various nonspecific imaging features (USG, CT), which can cause diagnostic problems. Authors report a case of late recognition of pancreatic carcinoid, in a woman who complained of abdominal pain and dyspeptic symptoms. The patient underwent pancreatoduodenectomy and dissection of tumor conglomerate in retroperitoneal space. The diagnosis was established by histopathological examination of the specimen after operation. So far the patient has not presented any clinical or radiological evidence of relapse.
