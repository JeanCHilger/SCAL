An unusual case of gastric heterotopic pancreas. Submucosal lesions of the gastrointestinal tract represent a diagnostic challenge for the physician. Endoscopic ultrasonography may provide useful information before deciding on therapeutic strategy.We report on a case of a young female presenting with a large gastric submucosal mass, 32 mm in size. Endoscopic ultrasonography identified a non-homogeneous lesion, with three cystic spaces suggesting a degenerated gastrointestinal stromal tumor. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed. Surprisingly, the final diagnosis was gastric heterotopic pancreas.Heterotopic pancreas should always be kept in mind when facing extramucosal gastric masses, especially in young people. A perioperative biopsy is recommended to prevent unnecessary extensive surgery.
