Pancreatic cystosis in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis: sonographic, CT, and MRI findings. We sought to analyze the sonographic, CT, and MRI findings of pancreatic cystosis, an unusual form of pancreatic involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF) that is characterized by macrocysts of different sizes distributed throughout the gland.CT and MRI essentially confirmed the findings of sonography in all cases, providing no relevant additional information about the nature, internal structure, or content of the cysts. When pancreatic macrocysts are clearly shown on sonography in asymptomatic patients with CF, no additional imaging is warranted.
