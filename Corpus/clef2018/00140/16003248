Internal hernia after pancreas transplantation with enteric drainage: an unusual cause of small bowel obstruction. Although complications involving leaking at the enteric anastomosis site, graft thrombosis, and intraabdominal abscess formation have been well documented after pancreas transplantation, the occurrence of small bowel obstruction in this setting has received scant attention. Although uncommon, intestinal obstruction after pancreas transplantation may have atypical etiologies. In this article, we will review three unusual cases of intestinal obstruction in pancreas transplant recipients. The value of computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis in equivocal situations in the diagnosis of the obstruction is emphasized.In this study, we reviewed the posttransplant course of all pancreas transplants performed between July 1, 2002 and June 1, 2004. We specifically focused on all patients that required reexploration for suspected small bowel obstruction at any time after transplantation.A total of 65 pancreas transplants were performed between July 1, 2002 and June 1, 2004. Pancreas graft survival was 97%, and patient survival was 98.5%. Five (7.7%) patients presented with mechanical small bowel obstruction, three of which were secondary to internal herniation of small intestine through a defect posterior to the pancreas allograft. All patients recovered well postsurgically.Small bowel obstruction is an uncommon complication after pancreas transplantation. CT enteroclysis in the evaluation of small bowel obstruction may assist the patient care decision-making process by providing information on the location and severity of the obstruction in the clinical situation where conventional abdominal CT and radiography are equivocal. Prompt detection of small bowel obstruction with early surgical intervention can minimize complications and preserve allograft function.
