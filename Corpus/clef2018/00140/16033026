Pitfalls in the workup of common hepatobiliary problems. Hepatobiliary problems are not uncommon in general practice. Many cases can be solved on the basis of a thorough history, clinical examination, blood tests and abdominal ultrasound. The focus of this tutorial paper lies on a number of possible pitfalls in the workup of such problems, based on brief case histories. Atypical presentations of lithogenic biliary obstruction, with or without cholangitis, are discussed as a relatively frequent cause of management difficulties. Furthermore, certain caveats in the interpretation of tumor marker CA19-9, prothrombin time/INR, and ferritin are highlighted.
