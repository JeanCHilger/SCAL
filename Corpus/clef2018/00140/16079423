Is definitive abdominal evaluation required in blunt trauma victims undergoing urgent extra-abdominal surgery? To evaluate the utility of routine abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scanning for abdominal evaluation of blunt trauma patients before urgent extra-abdominal surgery.In this observational cohort study, we prospectively enrolled all blunt trauma patients at least 8 years of age presenting to the emergency department of a Level 1 trauma center who were initially considered to require urgent extra-abdominal surgery within 24 hours of presentation. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: 1) isolated extremity trauma, 2) signs or symptoms of intra-abdominal injury (including systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg abdominal, flank, or costal margin tendernessA total of 254 patients, with a mean (+/-SD) age of 32.3 (+/-16.1) years, were enrolled. A total of 201 patients ultimately underwent urgent extra-abdominal surgery for the following procedures: orthopedic, 182 (91%) facial, 17 (8%)Abdominal CT scanning has a low yield in trauma patients whose sole indication for diagnostic abdominal evaluation is the need for general anesthesia for urgent extra-abdominal surgery. A small percentage of these patients, however, will have important intra-abdominal injuries such that further refinement of the recommendations for diagnostic study in this select population is needed.
