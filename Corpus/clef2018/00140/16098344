MR imaging of the liver. MR imaging is establishing a role as a primary diagnostic technique, with increasing evidence showing MR imaging to have advantages over CT regarding diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for many pathologies of solid organs, bile and pancreatic ducts, bowel, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum. In addition, there are increasing concerns regarding the risks of radiation and iodinated contrast associated with CT imaging of the abdomen. The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy associated with iodinated contrast used for CT scanning is difficult to ascertain because reporting is spurious and variable in interpretation.
