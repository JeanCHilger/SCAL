Liver and spleen volumetry with quantitative MR imaging and dual-space clustering segmentation. The purpose of this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study was to assess the liver and spleen volumes calculated by using a semiautomated dual-space clustering segmentation technique, as compared with the volumes calculated by using the manual contour-tracing method. The quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data used as input were computed from images acquired by using a mixed fast spin-echo pulse sequence that was implemented with respiratory triggering. Linear regression analysis was used to assess agreement regarding the volumes calculated by using both segmentation techniques. There was strong agreement regarding the regression parameters for the liver (r = 0.98, P < .001) and the spleen (r = 0.99, P < .001) and the mean percentage volume differences for the liver (1.2%) and the spleen (0.9%). The mean segmentation time per patient was significantly shorter with use of the dual-space clustering method (P < .001).
