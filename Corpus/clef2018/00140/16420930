Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas. Mucin-producing pancreatic tumors account for 1% of all malignant tumors of the pancreas. Notable among these are intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas, due to their variable clinical behavior, increased frequency, and the controversy surrounding the most suitable treatment and diagnostic methods. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical presentation, epidemiological and pathological features, diagnostic methods, treatment and survival rates of these tumors.We performed a prospective review of patients with a diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas between 1996 and 2001. Demographic and clinical characteristics, diagnostic tests, surgical treatment, tumor characteristics and survival rates were studied.There were 8 patients. The mean age was 65 years. The most common clinical presentation was abdominal pain. The most frequent localization was the pancreatic head. The most common diagnostic methods used were abdominal computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and serum CA 19.9 levels. Seven patients underwent pancreatic resection and only one patient was not surgically treated. The mean follow-up period was 38 months with a survival rate of 75% and a recurrence rate of 25%.Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas generally appear in the sixth decade of life. The most common presenting symptom is abdominal pain. These neoplasms typically occur in the head of the pancreas. The most commonly used diagnostic test is computed tomography and the main treatment is early surgical resection. The prognosis is good after complete resection, with a 5-year survival rate of 60-70%.
