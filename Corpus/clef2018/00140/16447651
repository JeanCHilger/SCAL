Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic serous cystadenoma. To summarize our experience on the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic serous cystadenoma.Data from 20 patients with pancreatic serous cystadenoma in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1994 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively.Ultrasound test was a good choice for primary diagnosis, while computed tomography scan and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were better choice for the suspected cases. Most tumors (60%) were located in the body and tail of pancreas. The distal pancreatectomy was the commonest operation procedure. The main complications were pancreatic leakage (35%). The symptoms were resolved after surgical treatment.The treatment of pancreatic serous cystadenoma depends on the accurate diagnosis. Ultrasound and computed tomography are useful diagnostic methods. Surgical operation is the treatment of choice. Long-term follow-up has shown satisfactory outcomes if the tumors are resected completely.
