Pseudo Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in a patient with duodenal stenosis caused by tuberculosis. We report the case of a 32-year-old Indian man with symptoms suggesting Zollinger-Ellison syndrome including abdominal pain, esaphagitis, duodenal stenosis that did not improve with antisecretory medication, elevated fasting gastrin serum levels that increased after intravenous secretin injections, elevated chromogranin A serum levels and tumoral aspect of pancreatic uncus on CT scan examination. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histological examination of the resected specimen showed that there was no endocrine tumour of the pancreas or the duodenum, but identified marked lesions of follicular and caseous tuberculosis. The final diagnosis retained pseudo Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to gastric outlet obstruction caused by duodenal stenosis of a tuberculosis origin.
