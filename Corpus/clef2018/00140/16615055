Heterotopic pancreas presenting as gastric submucosal cyst on endoscopic sonography. A 50-year-old Chinese woman with vague epigastric discomfort underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that revealed a saddle-shaped submucosal tumor in the antrum along the greater curvature. Endoscopic sonography showed that the tumor consisted of two cystic lesions. Because of persisting symptoms, the tumor was resected 8 months later. Pathological examination revealed scattered heterotopic pancreatic acini and ducts in the submucosa and muscularis propria. We suggest that heterotopic pancreas, though rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of the gastric wall.
