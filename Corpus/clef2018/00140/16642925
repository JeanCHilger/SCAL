Resected invasive thymoma with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. We report a rare case of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 with thymoma. A 57-year-old woman with a chronic duodenal ulcer and hypoglycemia had been seen at a nearby clinic. Abdominal echogram revealed two nodules in the pancreas and she was referred to our hospital for evaluation. Her diagnosis was MEN type 1, gastrinoma and hyperparathyroidism with anterior mediastinal tumor. There were high calcium levels in the blood and urine. Gastrin was quite high. A chest X-ray revealed a retrosternal tumor. Computed tomography revealed an anterior mediastinal tumor without sign of invasion to the surrounding organs, and two small masses in the pancreas. Cervical echogram revealed a few masses in both sides behind the thyroid. From these findings, her preoperative diagnosis was MEN type 1 with thymic carcinoid or thymoma. We performed thymectomy and parathyroidectomy concomitantly. The mediastinal tumor was diagnosed as invasive thymoma.
