A ninety-eight-year-old woman with ruptured pancreatic anaplastic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. A 98-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of anorexia, epigastralgia, and vomiting. An elastic hard tumor was palpable in her epigastric region. CT and US examination revealed a huge cystic lesion adjacent to the left lobe of the liver and the stomach. Her serum levels of CEA (13.6 ng/ml), CA19-9 (95 U/ml) and CA125 (99 U/ml) were high. She suffered from aspiration pneumonia on the 10th day of admission, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the 20th day of admission, the epigastric tumor suddenly disappeared. She passed away on the 31st day due to respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed that she had a ruptured pancreatic anaplastic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the oldest reported case of ruptured pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma in the world.
