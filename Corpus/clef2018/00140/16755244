Unilateral fasciitis of the lower leg: a paraneoplastic manifestation of an occult pancreatic tumor. We report an elderly woman with a 3-month history of abdominal pain and painful swelling of her right lower leg. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive fasciitis of the right superficial and deep crural fasciae. Endoscopic ultrasonography identified a tumor in the tail region of the pancreas with regional lymphatic nodal disease and suspicion of liver metastasis. The temporal relationship between the fasciitis and the pancreatic tumor suggests cancer-associated fasciitis-panniculitis syndrome. We report for the first time the incidence of the fasciitis-panniculitis syndrome in a patient with a previously undiagnosed solid pancreatic tumor.
