Value of dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance in diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma and endocrine tumors. To explore the value of dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) in diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma and endocrine tumors.Twenty-two patients with pancreatic carcinoma and 9 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors underwent routine MR scanning and dynamic contrast enhanced MR examination before they underwent operation.No tumor image was seen in 4 of the 22 patients with pancreatic carcinoma by routine MR scanning. Fat-saturated T(1)-weighted imaging (FS-T(1) WI) showed that 11 of them were hyposignal, 6 slightly hyposignal, and 1 isosignal and fat-saturated T(2)-weighted imaging (FS-T(2) WI) showed that 5 were hypersignal, 7 slightly hypersignal, 5 isosignal, 1 slightly hyposignal, and 13 with heterogeneous signals. After dynamic MR imaging no tumor was enhanced in the arterial phase (AP)Dynamic enhanced MR has a certain value in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma and endocrine tumors. Pancreatic carcinoma shows various enhanced forms by dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance, the degree of the greatest enhanced form not surpassing that of normal pancreatic tissue. Pancreatic endocrine carcinoma shows obvious enhanced forms by dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance, the degree of the greatest enhanced form surpassing that of normal pancreatic tissue. Peritumor thin-walled enhancement is a characteristic feature of pancreatic endocrine carcinoma.
