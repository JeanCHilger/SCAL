Radiologic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Modern radiology makes possible an accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in about 95 percent of cases. Conventional upper gastrointestinal study, isotopic scanning, hypotonic duodenography, and ultrasonography are suitable as screening procedures. Special methods of high accuracy - pancreatic arteriography, endoscopic pancreatography, and transhepatic cholangiography are used as needed for definitive diagnosis.
