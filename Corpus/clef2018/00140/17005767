Prospective comparison of secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with manometry in the diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction types II and III. In sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) predicts the response to sphincterotomy, but is invasive and associated with complications.To evaluate the role of secretin-stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (ss-MRCP) in predicting the results of SOM in patients with suspected type II or III SOD.MRCP was performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 min after intravenous secretin. SOD was diagnosed when the mean basal sphincter pressure at SOM was >40 mm Hg. Long-term outcome after SOM, with or without endoscopic sphincterotomy, was assessed using an 11-point (0-10) Likert scale.Of 47 patients (male/female 9/38 mean age 46 yearsss-MRCP is insensitive in predicting abnormal manometry in patients with suspected type III SOD, but is useful in selecting patients with suspected SOD II who are most likely to benefit from endotherapy.
