A ruptured pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm repaired by combined endovascular and open techniques. Aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries (PDA) are rare, accounting for <2% of all visceral aneurysms. An association with celiac artery stenosis has been reported. Many present with rupture, and a high mortality can be expected. Treatment is therefore challenging. Arterial ligation, anuerysmectomy, or bypass has been the mainstay of treatment. We recently treated a patient (who had no celiac axis) with a ruptured PDA aneurysm with combined open and endovascular techniques. A 46-year-old man was transferred to our hospital with a 1-day history of abdominal pain and syncope. On admission, an abdominal and pelvis computerized tomographic (CT) scan identified a large mesenteric hematoma, a 1.9 cm PDA aneurysm, and an occluded celiac axis. Mesenteric angiography revealed no active aneurysm leak and a stenotic superior mesenteric artery (SMA) origin. All hepatic blood flow originated from the stenotic SMA via markedly enlarged PDA collaterals. The patient was brought to the operating room, where absence of the celiac axis was confirmed. An aorto-to-proper hepatic and SMA bypass was performed using a bifurcated polyester graft. The next day, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, where the PDA aneurysm was coiled. Postprocedure CT scans confirmed thrombosis of the aneurysm. Ruptured mesenteric artery aneurysms are a challenging problem for the vascular surgeon. PDA aneurysms are rare and often occur in an unfavorable location. There appears to be an association with anatomic anomalies of the mesenteric circulation. Prompt invasive and noninvasive diagnostic studies aid in the definitive management of this often fatal problem. Combined endovascular and open techniques can be used for successful treatment.
