Infected pseudocyst in tropical pancreatitis presenting as psoas abscess. Infected pseudocyst as a consequence of tropical pancreatitis presenting as psoas abscess is unusual. We report a 40-year-old man who presented with pain in the right lumbar region. CT and MRI of the abdomen revealed pancreatic pseudocysts with abscess formation in the psoas muscle and evidence of chronic calcific pancreatitis. He was managed by percutaneous drainage of the abscess along with antibiotics and other supportive measures.
