Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: a case report. A 29-year-old woman presented with an abdominal mass existing for 10 years and abdominal pain for one year. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass about 10 cm in diameter between the epigastrium and right upper quadrant. Abdominal ultrasonography and multi-slice computerized tomography showed a well-demarcated solid mass containing cystic and calcified areas (97-80 mm in diameter) located on the head and uncinate process of the pancreas. Percutaneous ultrasonographyguided tru-cut biopsy was performed and the pathologic diagnosis of biopsy material was solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. The patient then underwent surgery and exploration revealed an encapsulated mass of 10 cm in diameter that was retracting the portal vein and was adherent to mesentery of the transverse colon. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed preserving the pylorus. Histopathologic diagnosis of the mass supported the tru-cut biopsy findings. At 12th months of follow-up, physical, laboratory and radiological examinations were all normal. Although solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rarely seen low-grade malignant tumor, it is important to differentiate it from other pancreatic tumors because of its benign course.
