Usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition that destroys the endocrine and exocrine functions of the gland to varying degrees and causes fibrosis of the pancreas. When examining the pancreas, one can assess the gland for parenchymal and ductular features. Endoscopic ultrasonography may detect early stages of change in tissue occurring as a result of fibrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma.
