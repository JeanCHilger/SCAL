EUS features of annular pancreas (with video). An annular pancreas is a rare congenital anomaly that results in a band of pancreatic tissue, either partially or completely encircling the duodenum.In patients referred for an upper-GI (UGI) EUS (1) to determine the prevalence of an annular pancreas identified by EUS versus CT and (2) to describe the EUS features of an annular pancreas.After review of UGI EUS procedures from January 1, 2000, through June 1, 2006, we conducted a retrospective review of EUS annular pancreas images to identify characteristic EUS features.This is the largest report describing the EUS findings in 5 patients.Of 9776 patients undergoing UGI EUS, 5 patients (0.05%) (2 men median age, 64 yearsWhereas, firm EUS criteria of an annular pancreas cannot be established based on 5 patients, certain features may prove useful for diagnosis.Although a diagnosis of an annular pancreas is rare, it should be considered in situations when a patient with possible associated symptoms has a normal CT.
