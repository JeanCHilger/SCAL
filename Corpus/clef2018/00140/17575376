Hepatocellular carcinoma with direct invasion to the stomach. A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had been diagnosed 2 years earlier and he had undergone 7 courses of intra-hepato-arterial chemotherapy (IHAC). We performed gastrointestinal fiberscopy and identified a massive protrusion on the lesser curvature. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed multiple hepatic masses and an extrahepatic enlarged mass with invasion to the pancreas and stomach. A specimen for endoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma that stained positive for alpha-fetoprotein. Gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from direct invasion of HCC is unusual.
