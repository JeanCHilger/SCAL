Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma with excessive alpha-fetoprotein expression. We report a case of acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas associated with excessively elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein (>32,000 ng/ml). Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a large pancreatic mass with infiltration of the splenic artery. Because of inoperability, palliative combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and mitomycin C was administered. This regimen was associated with clinical improvement and dramatic decreases in both tumor size and serum alpha-fetoprotein. However, the patient died 7 months later from acute severe cardiac failure.
