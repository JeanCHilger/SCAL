Intraductal papillary-mucinous carcinoma of the pancreas with tumor thrombus in the portal vein: a report of two cases. Intraductal papillary-mucinous carcinoma (IPMC) is a recently recognized pancreatic tumor and this is the first report to present two patients with IPMC complicating tumor thrombi in the portal vein. Two women, a 74- and a 55-year-old, each revealed a round, cystic and well-demarcated tumor of the pancreas in an abdominal computed tomography (CT). However, the inner lumen of the splenic and portal veins was insufficiently stained during iv-infusion of the contrast medium, suggesting the presence of tumor thrombi. Owing to this information, the presence of tumor thrombus was investigated and correctly identified during laparotomy, and it was completely removable together with the primary pancreatic tumor. The resected tumors showed expansive growth because mucin and tumor tissues rose up when they were cut. Microscopically, the tumor was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma without ovarian-like stroma, and the final diagnosis of branch type of IPMC was made for the two patients. However, within one postoperative year, both patients developed liver metastasis. Although IPMC is known as having a lower potential for metastasis or invasion, the tumor thrombi can form when it reveals an expansive growth suggesting a high inner pressure. In addition, a higher possibility for subsequent liver metastasis should be anticipated after the tumor forms a thrombus in the portal vein.
