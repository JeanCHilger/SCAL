Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and cyst fluid analysis for pancreatic cysts. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been increasingly utilized to differentiate malignant/pre-malignant pancreatic cysts from those that are benign or have low malignant potential.To determine the utility of EUS morphology, EUS-FNA cytology and cyst fluid analysis to distinguish mucinous cystic neoplasms from non-mucinous cystic neoplasms based on histopathology following surgical resection.A retrospective, single center case series.Patients who underwent EUS and EUS-FNA of known or suspected pancreatic cysts followed by surgical resection. The final diagnosis was based on histopathology.Patients were divided in two groups: mucinous cystic neoplasms and non-mucinous cystic neoplasms. Patients with intraductal papillary mucinous tumors were excluded.Clinical profiles and EUS findings.Forty-eight patients (mean age: 52 years 29 females, 19 males) were identified: 16 mucinous cystic neoplasms and 32 non-mucinous cystic neoplasms. There were more women in the mucinous cystic neoplasm group compared to the non-mucinous cystic neoplasm group (88% vs. 47%EUS-FNA cytology and cyst fluid CEA greater than 800 ng/mL are insensitive but highly specific for differentiating mucinous cystic neoplasms from non-mucinous cystic neoplasms. EUS morphology alone cannot distinguish between the two groups.
