Endoscopic ultasound: history and techniques. Endosonography is an imaging technique based on the unification of ultrasonography and edoscopy. EUS became part of clinical practice at the beginning of the 80s due to its superior capacity to study the pancreas with respect to abdominal ultrasound. In recent years, there is a growing interest in EUS as shown by the number of scientific articles and changing clinical practice regarding diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms (bile duct stones, cancer staging) and palliation.
