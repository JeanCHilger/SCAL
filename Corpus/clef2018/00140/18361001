Solitary metachronous metastasis of the sternum from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Sternal metastases from adenocarcinoma of the pancreas are extremely rare, and even more so when solitary. Two years earlier, the patient reported on here, a 67-year-old man with a solitary osteolytic lesion of the sternal manubrium, had undergone a duodeno-cephalopancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (G2, pY3, pN1) followed by adjuvant radio-chemotherapy. PET/CT scans, in response to the onset of burning pain in the sternal region, revealed a hypermetabolic area only at the level of the manubrium, while MRI showed a bulging manubrium due to the presence of extensive solid pathological tissue towards the right articulations of the ribs. Abnormal tumour markers were: CEA = 12, n.v. 0-4 Ca 15-3 = 512, n.v. 0-51, Ca 19-9 = 8777, n.v. 0-18. A partial sternectomy was performed with en-bloc resection of the hemiclavicles and the anterior tract of the 1st and 2nd ribs bilaterally with a mediastinic lymphadenectomy and repair with a sandwich prosthesis of prolene mesh and methacrylate, protecting the supra-aortic trunks and the anonymous vein with a polytetrafluoroethylene patch. The histological examination revealed secondary adenocarcinoma with 3 mediastinal metastatic lymph nodes. In view of the severe prognosis, a resection with palliative intent was also performed, which, when carried out in specialised centres, presents no contraindications in terms of cost-benefits.
