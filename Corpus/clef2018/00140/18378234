Disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome in severe acute pancreatitis: clinical and imaging characteristics and outcomes in a cohort of 31 cases. Information regarding the natural history, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) is limited.To describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of DPDS.A retrospective review of the Mayo Clinic endoscopy and hospital service database.Tertiary-referral center.We identified 31 DPDS cases from 1999 to 2006.Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic-fluid collections.The relationship between demographic and clinical data with endoscopic treatment and clinical outcomes in DPDS cases.The median patient age was 53 years (range 20-83 years) 48% were men. The most common etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) was biliary (55%) followed by idiopathic (27%). The median interval between the diagnoses of AP and DPDS was 56 days (range 3-251 days)Endoscopic treatment temporarily improved DPDS, with a failure rate of 23%. Immediate surgery was not required in all cases. CP and/or pancreatic atrophy occurred relatively shortly after the DPDS diagnosis in 26% and DM in 16% of cases. DPDS did not lead to mortality. Early surgery may be considered after initially stabilizing the fluid collection with endoscopic therapy.
