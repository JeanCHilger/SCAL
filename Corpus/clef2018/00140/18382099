Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: clinical and pathological features in 33 patients. To report the clinicopathological features of patients with serous cystadenomas of the pancreas.Thirty-three cases of serous cystadenoma diagnosed between 1977 and 2006 were retrieved from the files of the Ohio State University Medical Center. Clinical data and microscopic slides were reviewed.The patients included 27 women and 6 men with an age range of 38-83 (mean 64.3) years. The clinical presentation included 13 patients with abdominal pain and 8 patients with abdominal mass 9 tumors were found incidentally. Abdominal CT scans in 25 patients were interpreted as suspicious for carcinoma in 8 (32%), suspicious for serous cystadenoma in 8, neoplasm not otherwise specified in 8, and suspicious for a pseudocyst in 1. Only 7 patients underwent a preoperative biopsy, and 5 of these were diagnosed as having a serous cystadenoma. All but 2 of the patients underwent surgical resection of the tumor. The serous cystadenomas varied in size from 1.0 to up to 13 cm in maximum dimension, and all but one had a multicystic appearance. Of the 33 serous cystadenomas, 20 (61%) were located in the pancreatic tail, 4 (12%) in the pancreatic body, 4 in the pancreatic body and tail, and 5 (15%) in the head of the pancreas. Follow-up in 17 patients (median 3 years, range from 1 month to 11 years) showed no recurrence of serous cystadenomas. One patient had von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, 3 patients had metastatic cancer, and 2 patients had ovarian tumors.Serous cystadenoma is an uncommon neoplasm that can be confused with malignancy both clinically and radiologically a correct diagnosis is important in order to provide an accurate prognosis.
