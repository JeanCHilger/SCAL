A rare cause of hemosuccus pancreaticus: primary splenic artery aneurysm ruptured into pancreatic serous cystadenoma. Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare clinical condition defined as bleeding into the pancreatic duct from a peripancreatic artery. We present here a 57-year-old woman admitted to our clinic with abdominal pain, tar-colored stool and confusion. Further investigations were done because of severe anemia. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed intraabdominal hematoma. Laparotomy was performed, which confirmed that intraabdominal haemorrhagia had occurred with the rupture of a splenic artery aneurysm into a pancreatic serous cystadenoma, which ruptured into the abdomen because of high pressure. This is an interesting case diagnosed with multidisciplinary approaches.
