Resected xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis. Xanthogranulomatous changes in the pancreas are extremely rare. A 66-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of epigastralgia. Computed tomography scan revealed a 4-cm low-density area around the body of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the mass appeared hyperintense on a T2-weighted image and isointense on a T1-weighted image. Based on a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Sections examined from the mass showed an aggregation of many foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The surrounding pancreatic tissue showed fibrosis and chronic inflammation. These findings suggested a xanthogranulomatous inflammation, and resulted in a diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis.
