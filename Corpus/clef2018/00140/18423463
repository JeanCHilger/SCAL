The concept of bedside EUS. Although the role of bedside endoscopy for the provision of emergent diagnosis and therapy is well known, the concept of bedside EUS requires further validation.To evaluate the concept of bedside EUS and assess its impact on patient management.A prospective study.A tertiary-referral center.Patients included those with pancreaticobiliary and thoracic disorders who required EUS but who were clinically unstable to be evaluated in the endoscopy suite.All procedures were performed by one endosonographer at the patient's bedside by using an EUS cart that was equipped with a therapeutic curvilinear echoendoscope.To evaluate the technical feasibility, safety, and impact of bedside EUS in the clinical management of patients. EUS was considered to have a significant impact if a new diagnosis was established and/or if the findings altered subsequent management.Within a 3-month period, 6 patients (4 men median age 56 yearsSmall number of patients a single endosonographer.Bedside EUS is technically feasible, safe, facilitates both diagnosis and therapy, and enables the clinical management of patients who are critically ill.
