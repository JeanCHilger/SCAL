The clinical value of endoscopic ultrasonography in early diagnosis of pancreatic tumor. To investigate the clinical value of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) compared with the other imaging examination in the early diagnosis of pancreatic tumor.Retrospect studied of 188 cases of small pancreatic lesions (less than 3 cm in diameter) detected by EUS, IDUS and the other imaging examination at Changhai hospital from October 1992 to September 2006.(1) The accurate rate of small pancreatic cancer diagnosed by EUS was 95.6%, and it is better compared with US (58.6%), CT (77.4%), MRI (76.2%) and ERCP (85.3%). The most common endosonographic features of small pancreatic cancer were alike round, irregular edge, hypoechoic mass with uniformity internal echo. (2) IDUS was performed in 25 cases of small pancreatic lesions, the accurate rate of diagnosis was 100% (25/25), and it is better compared with US 32.0% (8/25), CT 52.9% (9/17) and MRI 57.9% (11/19). (3) EUS guided FNA (EUS-FNA) was performed in 18 cases of small pancreatic lesions, the accurate rate of diagnosis was 66.7% (12/18). (4) The accurate rate of pseudocyst diagnosis by EUS was 100.0% (27/27), it is better compared with US 52.0% (13/25), CT 66.7% (12/18), MRI 82.4% (14/17) and ERCP 78.9% (15/19) and the overall accurate rate of diagnosis of cystic pancreatic tumors by EUS was 57.7% (15/26), it is better compared with US 19.2% (5/26), CT 36.4% (8/22), MRI 37.5% (6/16) and ERCP 50.0% (7/14).EUS and IDUS were better than the other imaging examinations in the detection of small pancreatic tumors.
