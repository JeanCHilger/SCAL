A rare case of pancreatic mediastinal pseudocyst. Pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesions of the pancreas, accounting for 75-80% of such masses. Pancreatic pseudocyst with mediastinal extension is a rare clinical entity and only a handful cases report on dysphagia associated with mediastinal pseudocyst formation.1 We present a case of pancreatic mediastinal pseudocyst that presented with palpitations and dysphagia. Demonstration of cystic lesion in relation to the pancreas on ultrasound and mediastinal extension of the cyst on CT suggested the diagnosis.
