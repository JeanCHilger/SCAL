2 cases of duodenal duplication. Two cases of duodenal duplication are reported. It is a rare disease and is found commonly during infancy. Symptoms of partial duodenal obstruction are dominating the clinical picture. Upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography seems to be the best paraclinical examination. The surgical treatment is governed by the relationship of the cyst to the biliary and pancreatic ducts and the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa. If total resection of the cyst implicates a danger of injury to the common bile duct and the head of the pancreas and when one is tempted to perform a cystoenterostomy, the authors insist on the necessity to detect the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa by fluid pH determination and frozen section biopsy of the cyst wall. The presence of ectopic gastric mucosa requires a total resection of the cyst.
