Role of endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer remains a difficult task, and multiple imaging tests have been proposed over the years. The aim of this review is to describe the current role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for the diagnosis and staging of patients with pancreatic cancer. A detailed search of MEDLINE between 1980 and 2007 was performed using the following keywords: pancreatic cancer, endoscopic ultrasound, diagnosis, and staging. References of the selected articles were also browsed and consulted. Despite progress made with other imaging methods, EUS is still considered to be superior for the detection of clinically suspected lesions, especially if the results of other cross-sectional imaging modalities are equivocal. The major advantage of EUS is the high negative predictive value that approaches 100%, indicating that the absence of a focal mass reliably excludes pancreatic cancer. The introduction of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration allows a preoperative diagnosis in patients with resectable cancer, as well as a confirmation of diagnosis before chemoradiotherapy for those that are not. This comprehensive review highlighted the diagnostic capabilities of EUS including the newest refinements such as contrast-enhanced EUS, EUS elastography, and 3-dimensional EUS. The place of EUS-guided biopsy is also emphasized, including the addition of molecular marker techniques.
