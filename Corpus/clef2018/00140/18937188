Two cases of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas: first - a cyst coexisting with a primary gastric lymphoma, second - incidentally found pancreatic cyst. The aim of this report is to describe two cases of lymphoepithelial cysts (LEC) of the pancreas: 1. LEC coexisting with primary gastric lymphoma, 2. an incidental finding of LEC during imaging examination.1. A 47-year old man complaining of epigastric pain showed a 2 x 1.5 cm cyst of the pancreatic head on computed tomography (CT) scan. Endoscopic biopsy revealed infiltration by a poorly differentiated neoplasm, probably carcinoma. The patient underwent gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy D 2. The pancreatic lesion was excised. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (pT4N1 M0BX) and LEC were diagnosed. Patient refused adjuvant therapy. No symptoms of recurrence were observed during 24-months follow-up period. 2. 50-year-old male with non-specific urinary complaints revealed a 4.2 x 3.5 cm cyst in the body of pancreas on CT scan. The cyst was excised and LEC was diagnosed. Patient had not reported any complaints during 42 months follow-up period.To the best of the authors' knowledge, the first of two presented cases is the first described case of coexistence of LEC of the pancreas and gastrointestinal lymphoma. It is difficult to ascertain if there is any causative relationship or if this coexistence is purely incidental. Incidental pancreatic cysts are more and more common finding in surgical practice.
