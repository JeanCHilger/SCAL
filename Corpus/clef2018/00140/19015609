Pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma with intraportal tumor thrombus. A 68-year-old woman with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) resected curatively 12 years previously was admitted to our department for scrutiny of pancreatic tumors. Various imaging studies demonstrated heterogeneously well-enhanced masses in the head and tail of the pancreas. The well-enhanced mass in the head of the pancreas was connected with the tumor thrombus in the portal vein. To differentially diagnose the multiple pancreatic lesions, we performed endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB). Histopathologic findings of the EUS-FNAB specimens were similar to those of the renal clear cell carcinoma previously resected. The patient underwent a surgical operation with segmental resection of the portal vein with the preoperative diagnosis of RCC metastasis to the pancreas with intraportal growth. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed that the masses in the pancreas were multiple pancreatic metastases with intraportal tumor thrombus of RCC. The pancreas is a rare target for metastasis. This is a rare case of pancreatic metastasis from RCC with intraportal extension, and is the first preoperatively definitely diagnosed case using EUS-FNAB.
