Listeriosis in malignant diseases. Listeriosis occurred in two patients, a 46-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man, in the course of an underlying malignant disease. The woman had a metastasizing pancreatic apudoma, requiring partial pancreas resection with splenectomy. After the end of cytostatic treatment she developed headaches and fever up to 40 degrees C. Listeria monocytogenes was demonstrated in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. She went into coma on the day after hospital admission and, despite antibiotic administration, she died on the fourth day of treatment. The 41-year-old man was suspected of having an angioimmunoblastic lymphoma. Severe haemolytic anaemia (haemoglobin 4.4 g/dl) was treated with glucocorticoids, massive blood transfusions and splenectomy, at first without success. During immunosuppressive treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide the haemoglobin rose. But he was still feverish with nocturnal sweating. Neurological symptoms of motor aphasia, cranial nerve deficits and incomplete hemiparesis rapidly developed. Computed tomography revealed a focus in the internal capsule. Blood culture grew Listeria. The focal encephalitis healed with minor sequelae after antibiotic treatment. Both patients had hypogammaglobulinaemia, but no granulocytopenia. It is stressed that listeriosis should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases of septicaemia or cerebral infection occurring in the course of malignant disease.
