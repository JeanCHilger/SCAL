Resection of the intrapancreatic bile duct preserving the pancreas. Benign neoplasms of the distal bile duct are rare, but pose a therapeutic challenge. Usually, these lesions are resected by means of ampullectomy if located in close proximity to the ampulla of Vateri or by partial pancreaticoduodenectomy if located intrapancreatic and distant from the ampulla. Here, we present a case of an intrapancreatic benign neuroendocrine tumor that was resected by performing a pancreas-preserving distal bile duct resection. First, a duodenotomy was carried out and a probe was inserted into the pancreatic duct to avoid inadvertent injury. Subsequently, the bile duct was divided proximal the lesion and dissected towards the ampulla. Pancreatic parenchyma was dissected dorsally and closed using absorbable interrupted sutures. The duodenal incision was closed, and reconstruction was performed by an end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy and a Roux-Y jejunojejunostomy. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. In conclusion, pancreas-preserving distal bile duct resection might be an option for intrapancreatic benign lesions of the distal bile duct that would otherwise require a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy.
