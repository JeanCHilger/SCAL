Staging of T3 and T4 gastric carcinoma with multidetector CT: added value of multiplanar reformations for prediction of adjacent organ invasion. To determine the added value of multiplanar reformation (MPR) images combined with computed tomographic (CT) images in staging of T4 gastric cancers.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed consent. One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients (99 men [age range, 33-85 years mean age, 63.1 years] and 50 women [age range, 30-85 yearsWith addition of MPR images, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) led to a significant increase in the prediction of adjacent organ invasion in per-organ analyses (0.88 vs 0.95 for reader 1 [P = .01], 0.88 vs 0.98 for reader 2 [P < .001]) and identification of T4 tumors in per-patient analyses (0.79 vs 0.91 for reader 1 [P = .006], 0.78 vs 0.96 for reader 2 [P < .001]). In the five analyzed organs, AUC was significantly increased in regard to invasion of the transverse colon or mesocolon and pancreas separate analysis was not performed for the diaphragm, liver, and spleen because of the small number of true invasions. Interobserver agreement increased in per-organ (kappa = 0.43 vs 0.67) and per-patient (kappa = 0.42 vs 0.62) analyses.Adding MPR images to transverse CT images improves the capability for distinguishing T3 from T4 gastric cancer and prediction of adjacent organ invasion.http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/2502071872/DC1.
