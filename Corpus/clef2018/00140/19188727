Interventional endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), since its development in the 1980s, has undergone a great deal of technological advancement in imaging, scopes with larger channels and accessories. This has given the endosonographer an immense reach in terms of accessing difficult areas with fewer complications. Currently, it is possible not only to obtain tissue for histological diagnosis but also to perform therapeutic procedures that hitherto would have needed surgery with its attendant morbidity. EUS has evolved over the years and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration for histological diagnosis has become standard practice. A wide array of interventional procedures are performed under EUS guidance including, celiac plexus neurolysis, drainage of pancreatic and pelvic fluid collections, drainage of obstructive biliary/pancreatic ducts, and implantation of fiducial markers/radioactive seeds into gastrointestinal tumors. Also, various experimental procedures are underway evaluating the role of EUS in radiofrequency ablation, vascular therapy, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. In this review, we examine the various EUS-guided interventions currently undertaken and explore the potential of other emerging experimental techniques.
