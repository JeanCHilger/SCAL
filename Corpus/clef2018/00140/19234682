Heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the bifurcation of the bile duct : Rare diagnosis mimicking a Klatskin tumour. Heterotopic tissue of the pancreas can be found in 1-2% of autopsies. The main locations are stomach, duodenum, jejunum, Meckel's diverticulum, and ileum. Less frequently it is observed in the liver, gallbladder, common bile duct, and papilla of Vateri. We report the first case of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the bifurcation of the bile duct mimicking a Klatskin's tumour. The case is discussed based on the current literature.
