Lymphoproliferative disorders after immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia: a case report and literature review. A 61-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital in 2002 due to severe pancytopenia. Bone marrow and peripheral blood findings indicated he had severe aplastic anemia (AA). A whole-body CT scan and Ga scintigraphy revealed no abnormal findings. Antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A (CyA) were administered and he got transfusion independently. In September 2004, he complained of abdominal fullness and a skin eruption in the lower abdomen. An abdominal CT revealed a spleen mass and lymphoadenopathy of the pancreas head. Splenectomy was done, and he was diagnosed with a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the spleen and skin. His karyotype was associated with t(14 18). CyA was stopped, all lesions disappeared, and then his AA relapsed. In January 2007, antithymocyte globulin/CyA was readministered. In May 2007, he complained of acute swelling in his right thigh. A biopsy from the tumor revealed DLBCL. CyA was stopped again, yet the lymphoma did not regress. He was given R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisolone), followed by 5 cycles of R-VP (rituximab, vincristine, prednisolone) and radiation therapy, resulting in a partial remission. We report DLBCL after immunosuppressive therapy for AA. Although this is a rare complication, it should be considered before beginning immunosuppressive therapy.
