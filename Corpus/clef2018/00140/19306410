Combining fine needle aspiration with brushing cytology has improved yields in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the diagnostic yields of combining fine needle aspiration (FNA) with brushing cytology (BC) in clinical work-up of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The study included a total of 97 patients who underwent both FNA and BC along with histologic/clinical follow-up (F/U). Cytologic diagnoses were categorized as negative for neoplasm (NEG), atypical/favor neoplasm (AN), and suspicious or positive for neoplasm (POS). Based on the cytologic diagnoses, the cohort was divided as follows: 23 had concordant FNA and BC diagnoses of POS/AN, all were neoplasms on F/U 34 had disconcordant (POS/AN vs. NEG) FNA and BC diagnoses, all but 2 were neoplasms on F/U
