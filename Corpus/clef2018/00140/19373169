Primary hydatid disease of pancreas mimicking cystic neoplasm. Primary hydatid disease of the pancreas is very rare. We report a 33-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with abdominal discomfort due to the pancreatic mass. A diagnosis of a pancreatic cystic mass was established through abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scan. Hydatid disease as well as a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas were both thought in the differential diagnosis. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The histopathologic evaluation of the specimen revealed a hydatid cyst affecting the tail of the pancreas. Hydatid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all cystic masses of the pancreas, especially in endemic regions.
