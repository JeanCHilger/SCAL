Clinical and imaging follow-up after exhaustive liver resection of endocrine metastases: a 15-year monocentric experience. Liver metastases are common in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and significantly impair survival. Hepatic resection is the only potential curative treatment. The records of 41 consecutive patients undergoing exhaustive resection of liver-only endocrine metastases and followed between 1992 and 2006 were reviewed. Patient's outcome and diagnostic accuracy of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and morphological imaging (MI) for detection of recurrences during post-operative follow-up were assessed. All identified primary had been resected. MI studies including abdominal computed tomography (CT) and/or liver magnetic resonance imaging and thoracic CT if indicated were performed every 6 months SRS timing was decided by referring clinician. Tumor recurrences were confirmed by pathology or subsequent imaging studies. The results of 136 MI and SRS examinations performed within a 30-day interval from each other were retrospectively compared. Median post-operative follow-up was 51 months (7-165). Recurrences developed in 32 patients (78%), mainly in the liver (n=24) after a median of 19 months (2-79). Five-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 79 and 3% respectively. For recurrence detection, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 89, 94, and 91% for SRS, 68, 91, and 74% for MI respectively. In 11 out of 32 patients (34%), abdominal or extra-abdominal metastases were detected 15.5 months earlier by SRS than MI. In conclusion, despite exhaustive liver surgery for endocrine metastases, hepatic or extra-hepatic recurrences are frequent and develop early. SRS is highly accurate for the detection of recurrences during post-operative follow-up and permitted early diagnosis in one third of patients
