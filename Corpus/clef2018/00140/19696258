Pseudopancreatitis in trauma patients. The purpose of our study was to review the significance of intra- and peripancreatic fluid in trauma patients who have no other signs of pancreatic injury.We propose that intra- and peripancreatic fluid may be the consequence of hypovolemic shock treated with hyperhydration when there is significant delay between injury and imaging.
