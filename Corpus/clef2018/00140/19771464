Pancreatic adenocarcinoma versus chronic pancreatitis: differentiation with triple-phase helical CT. Chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma often show similar clinical and imaging appearances. This study aims to differentiate chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma by defining enhancement patterns in both pathologic conditions during triple-phase helical CT.The study included 42 patients with chronic pancreatitis and 85 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CT images obtained according to protocol A (scan delays, 30, 60, and 150 s 300 mg I/mL contrast material) or protocol B (scan delays, 40, 70, and 150 sMean contrast enhancement value of normal pancreas peaked in the first phase (early-washout pattern) while that of chronic pancreatitis peaked in the second phase (delayed-washout pattern), and that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma gradually rose (increasing pattern) in both protocols. Diagnostic indices for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 82.4% and 94.1% for sensitivity, 83% and 83% for specificity, 82.7% and 90.4% for accuracy in protocols A and B, respectively, when differentiation between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma was performed based on time-attenuation curve patterns.Our results indicate that time attenuation curves obtained from triple-phase helical CT in protocol B provide useful information in differentiating chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
