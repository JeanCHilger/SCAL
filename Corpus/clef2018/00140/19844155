Two cases of colonic obstruction after acute pancreatitis. Several forms of colonic complications are rarely observed during the clinical course of acute pancreatitis, and potentially fatal in some cases. Colonic lesions associated with acute pancreatitis can be divided into several groups from a pathogenic point of view. Possible pathogenesis includes: 1) spread of pancreatic enzymes through the retroperitoneum to mesocolon, causing pericolitis, 2) external inflammatory compression by mesocolic mass secondary to necrosis of fatty tissue, and 3) hypotension due to shock, and thrombosis of mesenteric arteries. These might lead to colonic infarction, fistula formation, perforation, and obstruction during follow-up. We report two cases of colonic obstruction following acute pancreatitis with possible different mechanisms and review Korean cases. One patient developed colonic obstruction due to severe necrotizing pancreatitis, possibly as a result of pericolitis, and the other developed stenosis as a result of ischemic colitis induced by acute pancreatitis.
