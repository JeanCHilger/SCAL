Biloma: an unusual complication in a patient with pancreatic cancer. The term biloma describes an encapsulated collection of bile within the abdomen, usually secondary to bile duct disruption. The commonest causes reported in the literature are iatrogenic (secondary to hepatobiliary surgery), trauma or complications due to choledocholithiasis. A few cases have been reported as complications of cholangiocarcinoma or acute cholecystitis. We report the case of a 64-year-old man initially diagnosed with a non-obstructive malignancy of the pancreas, who developed a spontaneous intrahepatic biloma 8 mo later. This was identified following a 1-wk history of fever, rigors and icterus. The biloma was identified on computed tomography and subsequently drained under ultrasound guidance. Forty-eight hours later, a stent was inserted endoscopically into his common bile duct and he made an uneventful in-hospital recovery. We believe this is the first documented case of spontaneous intrahepatic biloma to occur secondary to pancreatic malignancy.
