Hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis with a huge pseudocyst in a child with Crohn's disease. Pancreatitis has been described occasionally in association with Crohn's disease in adults before, but it is uncommon in children. It may be caused by multiple etiologies, and there exist a few reports of pancreatitis in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease because of biliary obstruction or drug induced. We report a rare case of a 14-year-old girl with Crohn's disease and hypoparathyroidism who suffered from hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis with development of huge psyeudocysts, a life-threatening complication that required surgical treatment.
