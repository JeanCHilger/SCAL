Indications for and clinical impact of repeat endoscopic ultrasound. The value of repeating endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is seldom described. This study evaluates a patient population in which EUS was repeated.This was a retrospective study of patients who between January 2002 and December 2006 had an EUS scan performed this EUS scan (re-EUS) was the second or more EUS scan performed.Over the study period, the department performed 3024 EUS procedures, of which 561 investigations were defined as re-EUS. According to defined exclusion criteria, 244 procedures were not analyzed further. The study group thus consisted of 317 procedures (242 patients). In 163 cases (126 patients), re-EUS was planned by the endosonographer for control of an undetermined lesion. The first re-EUS scan performed changed the further management in 91 of 126 patients (72%). Sensitivity and specificity of re-EUS regarding pancreatic cancer were 0.65 and 1.00, respectively. Re-EUS was performed in 82 cases (77 patients) where no re-investigation had been planned at the initial EUS scan but worsening of symptoms or new findings of other imaging procedures had led to an additional EUS scan. Thirteen of these patients (17%) proved to have pancreatic cancer. In 62 cases (57 patients) re-EUS and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) had been planed in order to confirm the suspicion of malignant disease. Following re-EUS and EUS-FNA, 40 of these patients could be referred for either oncology or surgery. In the remaining 10 cases, re-EUS was performed for miscellaneous indications.Re-EUS has a substantial clinical impact on the further management of the patient.
