T2-weighted MRI of the upper abdomen: comparison of four fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences including PROPELLER (BLADE) technique. The aim of this study was to compare four different fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences with different techniques with regard to image quality and lesion detection in upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.Thirty-two consecutive patients referred for upper abdominal MRI for the evaluation of various suspected pathologies were included in this study. Different T2-weighted sequences (free-breathing navigator-triggered turbo spin-echo [TSE], free-breathing navigator-triggered TSE with restore pulse (RP), breath-hold TSE with RP, and free-breathing navigator-triggered TSE with RP using the periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction technique [using BLADE, a Siemens implementation of this technique]) were used on all patients. All images were assessed independently by two radiologists. Assessments of motion artifacts the edge sharpness of the liver, pancreas, and intrahepatic vesselsLiver and gallbladder signal-to-noise ratios as well as liver to spleen contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher (P < .05) for the BLADE technique compared to all other sequences. In qualitative analysis, the severity of motion artifacts was significantly lower with T2-weighted free-breathing navigator-triggered BLADE sequences compared to other sequences (P < .01).
