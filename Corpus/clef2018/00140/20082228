Pancreatic and extrapancreatic lesions in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a single-centre experience. This study was performed to describe the possible presence of extrapancreatic neoplasms in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and to evaluate whether the extrapancreatic tumours were synchronous or metachronous to IPMNs.One hundred and forty-two patients (56 men and 86 women mean age 69.5 years, range 37-98) with IPMN diagnosed using the Sendai criteria were enrolled. Six patients (4.2%) had type I, 103 (72.5%) type II and 33 (23.2%) type III IPMN. All patients were studied using the following imaging techniques: ultrasonography (US), multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).Pancreatic IPMN was localised in the head in 43 patients (30.3%), in the body in 13 (9.2%), in the tail in ten (7.0%), in the head-body in 17 (12.0%), in the body-tail in 15 (10.6%) diffuse throughout the gland in 44 (31.0%). The mean size of the cystic lesions was [(mean+/-standard deviation (SD)] 1.9+/-1.9 cm (range 0.5-8.0 cm). Twenty patients (14.1%) had associated pancreatic or extrapancreatic diseases. In evaluating the distribution of pancreatic or extrapancreatic diseases according to IPMN type, we found that this was not significantly different among types I, II and III (p=0.776).The majority of pancreatic and extrapancreatic cancers occur before the diagnosis of IPMNs is made and is not related to the type of IPMN.
