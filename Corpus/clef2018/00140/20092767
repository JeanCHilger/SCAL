Noninvasive examinations for localization of insulinoma. To investigate the value of the noninvasive examinations for localization of insulinoma.The clinical materials of 88 cases of insulinoma treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2005 and November 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 40 males and 48 females aged from 15 to 74 years old (averaged, 46.5 years old).The positive rates for localization were 19.3% (17/88), 52.4% (11/21), 95.5% (64/67), 1/6, 30.0% (6/20), 83.9% (26/31), 8/8 and 5/5 respectively in transabdominal ultrasound, enhanced CT, multislice spiral CT pancreatic perfusion, MRI, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, endoscopic ultrasound, laparoscopic ultrasound and intraoperative ultrasound. Thirty-one multiple tumors in 8 patients were resected. The positive rates of locating the multiple insulinomas of multislice spiral CT pancreatic perfusion and Intraoperative Ultrasound were 48.4% (15/31) and 100% (14/14) respectively.The locating diagnosis of insulinoma has came to noninvasive examination era. Multislice spiral CT pancreatic perfusion is the first choice for localization. Intraoperative ultrasound might play an important role in locating tumors for patients with multiple insulinomas.
