Torsion of wandering spleen. Wandering spleen is characterized by ectopic localization of spleen owing to the lack or weakening of the major splenic ligaments. In present study, two cases with torsion of wandering spleen were reported. The first case was a 30-year-old female who was admitted to emergency department with acute abdominal pain and vomiting. Abdominal Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a round solid hypodense mass that was located in the left hypochondriac region of abdomen. At laparotomy, the patient was found to have torsion of a wandering spleen with complete infarction and pancreatic tail infarction. Splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were performed. The second patient was a 19-year-old female. She was admitted to emergency department with abdominal pain. Axial computed tomography (CT) showed pelvic mass that indicated a possibility of a wandering spleen. The wandering spleen was removed with its long pedicle because of infarction. Torsion of wandering spleen must be considered in differential diagnosis of acute abdomen when a palpable painful abdominal mass is present on physical examination, and the spleen is absent in its normal anatomical location on radiological examination (Fig. 4, Ref. 8).
