A case of occult insulinoma localized by pancreatic dynamic enhanced spiral CT. Insulinomas are the most common category of pancreatic endocrine tumors, with an annual incidence of 1-4 cases per million people. Most are intrapancreatic, benign and solitary. Therefore, they have an excellent prognosis after surgical resection. However, the localization diagnosis of insulinomas still poses a challenge to surgeons and radiologists. In this case, the tumor was occult and could not be found by either abdominal enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography. Therefore, we tried a new method of CT scanning and localized the tumor.
