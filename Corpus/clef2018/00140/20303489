Therapeutic EUS-assisted endoscopic retrograde pancreatography after failed pancreatic duct cannulation at ERCP. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct (PD) during endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) can fail even in experienced hands. A technique for therapeutic EUS-assisted rendezvous ERP has been described in a few case reports.To investigate the efficacy and safety of therapeutic EUS-assisted ERP.Retrospective study.Tertiary-care medical center.This study involved 21 patients after failed ERP.EUS-guided transgastric pancreatography by using a mixture of contrast media and methylene blue was attempted. If that was successful, ERP was attempted by using methylene blue flow as an indicator of the PD orifice or by a rendezvous technique using a wire passed into the PD and the small bowel through the EUS needle.Technical success rate and complications.The PD was of a normal diameter in 7 patients and was dilated in 14 patients. EUS-guided pancreatography was successfully done in all patients with a dilated PD but only in 4 of 7 patients (57%) with normal-diameter PDs. In 6 patients, ERP was successfully performed by using methylene blue flow as an indicator of the PD orifice. The rendezvous technique was successful in 4 of 12 cases (33%), and reasons for failure were either a tight stricture (n = 5) or a suboptimal angle of EUS needle insertion (n = 3). Overall, EUS-assisted ERP was successful in 10 of 21 patients (48%). Complications included peripancreatic abscess in 1 patient and mild pancreatitis in 1 patient.Retrospective study, small sample size.EUS-assisted ERP is a complex procedure that can provide access to the PD in selected cases after failed standard ERP.
