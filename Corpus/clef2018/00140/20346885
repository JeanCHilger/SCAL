Symptomatic filter penetration presenting as pancreatitis. Herein, the authors describe a case of symptomatic, enzymatically positive pancreatitis secondary to inferior vena cava (IVC) penetration by an IVC filter. Computed tomography revealed evidence of a filter strut in the head of the pancreas. Although caval penetration has been shown to be a complication associated with the use of IVC filters, to the authors' knowledge symptomatic pancreatitis is a rare manifestation of filter penetration.
