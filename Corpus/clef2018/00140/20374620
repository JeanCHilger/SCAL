Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): clinico-pathological correlations and surgical indications. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are increasingly recognized entities, whose management remains sometimes controversial, due to the high rate of benign lesions and on the other side to the good survival after resection of malignant ones.Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected Western series of IPMN.Forty cases of IPMN were analysed (1992-2007). Most patients were symptomatic (72.5%) cholangio-MRI had the best diagnostic accuracy both for the tumour nature (83.3%) and for the presence of malignancy (57.1%). ERCP was done in 8 cases (20%), and the results were poor. Thirteen patients were treated by pancreatic resection and 27 were maintained in follow-up. Total pancreatectomy was performed in 46% of the casesTherapeutic indication for IPMNs is mainly based upon radiological evaluation of the risk of malignancy. While the main duct tumours should be resected, preserving whenever possible a portion of the gland, the secondary ducts tumours may be maintained under observation, in absence of radiological elements of suspicion such as size larger than 3 cm, or a wall greater than 3 mm or nodules or papillae in the context of the cyst.
