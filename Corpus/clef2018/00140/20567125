A case of Complete Response(CR)to combination therapy of S-1 and Gemcitabine(GEM)for unresectable pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal of all digestive cancers, and it is very difficult to obtain long-term survival of unresectable cases. This case report reveals that combination chemotherapy with S-1/gemcitabine(GEM)was very effective for a patient with unresectable pancreatic body cancer. The patient was a 72-year-old female(Stage IVb). They were administered S-1 80mg/day for 2 weeks and GEM 1, 000mg/m2 on day 8 and 15 followed by a 2-week recovery period. After finishing the 2 courses, there was a notable reduction in tumor size. After finishing 9 courses, the tumor could not be observed and it was judged it to be CR. Currently, at 1 year and 4 months from the initial diagnosis, there is no recurrence of tumor, and the general condition of the patient is very good. Combination chemotherapy with S-1/GEM may be useful to improve the prognosis for unresectable pancreatic cancer.
