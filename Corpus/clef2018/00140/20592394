CA19-9 serum concentrations--analysis of the serum kinetics during first-line therapy of pancreatic cancer in relation to overall survival. In order to investigate the use of CA19-9 serum concentration kinetics during first-line chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer as a potential predictive prognostic factor for overall survival, we retrospectively analysed the data of 47 patients suffering from proven exocrine pancreatic cancer. The patients were treated following our concept of efficacy-orientated sequential palliative chemotherapy (EOSPC), on the basis of a short-term follow-up including CA19-9 determinations at least monthly and imaging methods CT and/or MR every 2 months. The results are in agreement with our previous reports suggesting an increase of survival of pancreatic cancer patients in relation to the number of effective treatment regimens applied. However, apart from a weak correlation between the lowest CA19-9 levels induced by the first-line therapy (as a % of the initial pretherapeutical CA19-9 levels) and progression-free survival there was no correlation between the various parameters of serum kinetics of CA19-9 in the course of the first-line therapy and overall survival of the patients. A potential correlation as reported by others seems to be confirmed in our patient group by the potential antitumoral and life-prolonging effects of the second- and third-line therapies.
