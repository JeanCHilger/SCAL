Pancreatic metastasis from colon carcinoma nine years after a hemicolectomy managed by distal pancreatectomy. A review of the literature regarding the role and outcome of pancreatic resection for colorectal metastasis. Pancreatic metastasis from colorectal malignancy is rare and accounts for less than 2% of all pancreatic metastases. A case of colonic metastasis to the pancreas is reported and the literature is reviewed to assess the role and outcome of pancreatic resection for metastatic tumors from colorectal malignancy.A 58-year-old female underwent an emergency left hemicolectomy for an obstructing descending colon growth. The lesion was reported to be adenocarcinoma, Dukes C, with involvement of the serosa and 3 lymph nodes. A postoperative staging CT scan showed no other metastases and she received 6 cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-flurouracil and oxaliplatin). Nine years after the colectomy during a routine follow-up, there was a sudden rise in her CEA levels. A CT scan revealed a 6.8x4.8 cm mixed consistency lesion in the tail of the pancreas which, on fine needle aspiration cytology, was confirmed to be adenocarcinoma. She underwent a distal pancreatectomy, and histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed a metastatic tumor from colon cancer. She then received 5 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. She was symptom free for nine months and subsequently succumbed to recurrent disease.Pancreatic metastasis from colorectal malignancy is rare. These patients could be asymptomatic in 17% of cases. The time-interval between the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the detection of pancreatic metastasis varies widely but is approximately 24 months. The median survival time for post-pancreatic resection is 16 months. Pancreatic resection appears to offer good palliation until recurrence of the disease occurs and the possibility of long term cure is rare.
