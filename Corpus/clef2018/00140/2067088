A case of the primary pancreatic lymphoma. Primary pancreatic lymphoma is extremely rare. A case of the primary pancreatic lymphoma was described. A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on May 26, 1990, because of epigastralgia and 5-kg weight loss. On admission, physical examination revealed mild epigastric tenderness without hepatosplenomegaly and superficial lymphadenopathy. The serum amylase level and trypsin level were normal but serum CA19-9 was slightly elevated. The diagnosis of the pancreatic cancer (body and tail) was strongly suspected on subsequent examination by US, CT, ERP and angiography. Partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Pathological examination of the tumor in the pancreas showed diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and B-cell origin. Peripancreatic fat was involved but peripancreatic lymph nodes and spleen were intact, which strongly suggested that the isolated lymphoma was pancreatic origin.
