The usefulness of super-selective computed tomography angiography (CTA) for diagnosing and localizing a small insulinoma. Localization of insulinomas by preoperative imaging is critical for successful surgical resection. However, the visualization and localization of small insulinomas by recent imaging modalities still remains a challenge. Here, we report a 77-year-old woman with a small insulinoma successfully localized by performing arterial stimulation and venous sampling (ASVS), and subsequent super-selective CTA (SSCTA). It was not visualized by routine non-invasive imaging tests such as digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The small size (1.0 cm) of the surgically removed tumor supports the usefulness of SSCTA for localizing very small insulinomas.
