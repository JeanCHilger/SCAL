74-year-old patient with cystic pancreatic lesions. An endoscopy-based algorithm. Often, equivocal pancreatic cystic masses in a patient cannot be clearly identified. We report on a 74-year-old patient who consulted us with size-gaining multi-cystic lesions located at the pancreatic head and tail as well as with an increased CA 19-9 level. By using diagnostic methods as ultrasound, radiological images and innovative endoscopic techniques an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was diagnosed. Evaluation of equivocal cystic lesions requires developing of further strategies as well as integration of new concepts: We present a diagnostic algorithm based on endoscopy that enables us to perform an adapted therapy by having a more accurate evaluation and the opportunity to gain samples where unclear lesions are given.
