Idiopathic duct-centric pancreatitis (IDCP) with immunological studies. A 65-year-old woman with elevated serum levels of pancreatic enzymes was referred to our hospital for further examinations. Abdominal US and contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated swelling of the pancreas body and tail. MRCP and ERCP revealed abrupt ending of the MPD in the pancreas body. Under the suspicion of malignancy, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. The histopathological findings showed idiopathic duct-centric pancreatitis (IDCP) with granulocytic epithelial lesions (GEL). As most cases of Japanese autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) are lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP), the present case seems to be helpful to clarify the clinical findings of IDCP in Japan.
