Management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors originating from neuroendocrine cells with secretory characteristics, and are primarily located in gastric, duodenal, pancreatic, and small and large bowel mucosa. Due to their extremely variable biologic and clinical behaviour, diagnosis is often delayed after a prolonged workup. Many advances have been made in recent years in the diagnosis, characterization, and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. This review focuses on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, discussing the relatively new, multidisciplinary approach to their management. A Pubmed search was performed, limited to papers published within the last five years, using the key words NETs, pancreatic NETs, pancreatic tumors, diagnosis, imaging, nuclear imaging, endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and biochemical markers.
