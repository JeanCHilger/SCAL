Application of second generation dual-source computed tomography dual-energy scan mode in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To analyze the clinical value of multiple sequences derived from dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) dual-energy scan mode in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Totally 23 patients with clinically or pathologically diagnosed pancreatic cancer were enrolled in this retrospective study. DSCT (Definition Flash) was used and dual-energy scan mode was used in their pancreatic parenchyma phase scan (100kVp/230mAs and Sn140kVp/178mAs) . Mono-energetic 60kev, mono-energetic 80kev, mono-energetic 100kev, mono-energetic 120kev, linear blend image, non-linear blend image, and iodine map were acquired. pancreatic parenchyma-tumor CT value difference, ratio of tumor to pancreatic parenchyma, and pancreatic parenchyma-tumor contrast to noise ratio were calculated. One-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of diagnostic values of the above eight different dual-energy derived sequences for pancreatic cancer.The pancreatic parenchyma-tumor CT value difference, ratio of tumor to pancreatic parenchyma, and pancreatic parenchyma-tumor contrast to noise ratio were significantly different among eight sequences (P<0.05) . Mono-energetic 60kev image showed the largest parenchyma-tumor CT value [ (77.53 ± 23.42) HU] , and iodine map showed the lowest tumor/parenchyma enhancement ratio (0.39?0.12) and the largest contrast to noise ratio (4.08 ± 1.46) .Multiple sequences can be derived from dual-energy scan mode with DSCT via multiple post-processing methods. Integration of these sequences may further improve the sensitivity of the multislice spiral CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
