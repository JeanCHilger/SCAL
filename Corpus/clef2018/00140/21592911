Ectopic pancreas in the stomach of infrequent localization in the muscularis mucosae. Heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the stomach is an uncommon gastric subepithelial lesion. Is usually an asymptomatic condition which is found incidentally. As with other gastric subepithelial lesions, diagnosis can be challenging. Endoscopic forceps biopsy specimens are of little value. Endoscopic ultrasound findings are helpful in characterize this lesions, but they cannot absolutely determine the type of lesion or whether a lesion is benign or malignant. The sequence endosonography- cap assisted endoscopic mucosal resection allows en bloc resection of small gastric subepithelial lesions with low complication rates. We report a case of an ectopic pancreas of the antrum in the stomach that arises from the second layer of the gastric wall (muscularis mucosa) at endoscopic ultrasound that was removed en bloc with cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection technique in one endoscopic session without complications.
