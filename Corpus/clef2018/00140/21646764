A case of serous cystadenoma of the pancreas associated with obstructive jaundice during long-term follow up. A 68-year-old man had been followed up since March, 1997 because of a cystic tumor of the pancreas head. The patient developed obstructive jaundice and was admitted to our hospital in June, 2007. The tumor size on CT scan had increased from 3.6 cm to 5.9 cm during the 10-year period. After endoscopic biliary drainage, pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen was serous cystadenoma. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is known as a benign tumor with indolent progression and is likely to be symptomatic if the tumor size exceeds 4 cm. However, biliary obstruction is a rare complication of serous cystadenoma. We report this rare case here with references to the literature.
