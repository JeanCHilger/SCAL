Spontaneous fistulization of a pancreatic abscess to colon and duodenum treated with percutaneous drainage. Pancreatic fistulas are rare clinical entities associated with severe pancreatitis. A 39-year-old man who had been diagnosed and treated for severe pancreatitis 2 months ago presented with abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. The abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a peripancreatic abscess and a duodenal fistula communicating the first part of duodenum, which was also verified with fluoroscopy. A size 14-French catheter with pig-tail tip was inserted primarily with a Seldinger 2-step technique through percutaneous route under CT-guidance to avoid intervening bowels or solid organs. The patient's clinic improved and treatment was stopped on the 18th day. On the 26th day of the first intervention, the patient had fever and abdominal pain and his clinic was deteriorated. A second fluoroscopic examination revealed that the duodeno pancreatic fistula was closed while a new 1 has developed into the ascending colon. With aggressive nutrition support, antibiotics and repeated drainage of the abscess pouch a dramatic clinical improvement was observed. Control abdominal CT demonstrated the resolution of pancreatic abscess on the 62nd day.
