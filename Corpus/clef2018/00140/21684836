Strategies for screening for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in high-risk patients. Screening high-risk individuals with imaging tests, such as endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography, can lead to the detection and treatment of predominantly asymptomatic premalignant lesions. These pancreatic lesions consist of resectable, mostly branch-type non-invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Endoscopic ultrasound features of chronic pancreatitis are highly prevalent in high-risk individuals and these directly correlate with multifocal lobulocentric parenchymal atrophy due to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Long-term, multi-prospective studies are needed to determine if screening for early pancreatic adenocarcinoma and timely intervention will result in decreased pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality in high-risk individuals.
