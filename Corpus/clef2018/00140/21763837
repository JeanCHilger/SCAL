Diagnostic impact of computed tomography cholangiography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography on pancreaticobiliary maljunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic potential of computed tomography cholangiography (CTC) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in children with pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM).Fifty-three children with PBM were consecutively treated between 1997 and 2009. Among them, the patients who underwent CTC and/or MRCP preoperatively were enrolled in this study. Computed tomography cholangiography was examined after infusion of meglumine iodoxamate with subsequent 3-dimensional rendering. The visualization of the biliary and pancreatic duct systems was evaluated and compared with that visualized with MRCP. The findings of direct cholangiography were used as the standard of reference.Of the 53 cases with PBM, 17 cases were examined by CTC, 10 cases by MRCP, and 17 with both. The extrahepatic bile tract was visualized in 32 (94.1%) of 34 patients in CTC and in all 27 patients in MRCP. The intrahepatic bile duct was more frequently demonstrated by MRCP than by CTC (96.3% vs 70.6%, P = .02). Pancreaticobiliary maljunction was noted in 13 (38.2%) of 34 with CTC and in 12 (44.4%) of 27 with MRCP. The minimum age for visualization of PBM was at 10 months in CTC and at 1 year and 11 months in MRCP, respectively. The main pancreatic duct was more frequently visualized by MRCP than by CTC (81.5% vs 8.8%, P < .001).Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography provides superior visualization of the intrahepatic duct and the pancreatic system when compared with CTC. However, it is still challenging to perform a good-quality examination in young infant. The great advantage of CTC is its ability to produce high-quality images without respiratory artifacts and that it allows accurate assessment of the presence of PBM equivalent to MRCP.
