Sjögren's syndrome and pancreatic affection. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting primarily the exocrine glands, leading to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and xerostomia, but that can also include extraglandular features(1). Due the anatomical, physiological and pathological similarity between the pancreas and the salivary glands, it has been described that the pancreas it is not exempt from the damage produced by this syndrome. Some authors have assessed pancreatic involvement of SS by analyzing the histopathological changes, evaluating the pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function (serum pancreatic enzymes, elastase, lipase or trypsin determinations, N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-para-aminobenzoic acid excretion test, etc), searching specific pancreatic antibodies (antiductal) or performing endoscopic retrograde colangiopancreatography or noninvasive imaging studies such as computed tomography or ultrasound. Herein we review the literature regarding the prevalence and type of pancreatic involvement in the SS and we discuss the differential diagnosis with multiorganic Lymphoproliferative Syndrome.
