Ectopic secretion of GHRH by a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor associated with an empty sella. Acromegaly is usually the result of a pituitary growth hormone cell-adenoma or is more rarely due to ectopic secretion of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH).We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with acromegaly due to a GH-RH-secreting pancreatic tumor. Laboratory evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of acromegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a partial empty sella with no signs of adenoma. Ultrasound sonography performed for abdominal pains showed a calcified large heterogeneous infrahepatic mass. Computed tomography scan discovered a heterogeneous pancreatic head mass with a diameter of 10cm. Measurement of fasting plasma GHRH was performed showing a high concentration of 604ng/L (normal 10-60). We therefore concluded that the acromegaly was caused by ectopic overproduction of GHRH likely due to the pancreatic tumor. The patient underwent a cephalic duodenopancreatectomy. Histology revealed a well-circumscribed tumor with organoid architecture. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated diffuse positivity for chromogranin A, neuronal specific enolase and synaptophysin and negative immunoreactivity for prolactin, GH and serotonin. These features were concordant with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. Surgical resection of this pancreatic tumor was followed by significant amelioration of acromegalic signs and normalization of GHRH and GH levels.
