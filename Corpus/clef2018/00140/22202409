Re-resection for local recurrence in the remnant pancreas after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer- a case report. A 70-year-old female suffered from jaundice was admitted to our hospital for a tumor in the pancreas head. CA19-9 and DUPAN-2 levels were increased in laboratory test. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a low density area of pancreas head. Cytology of pancreatic juice was performed by ERCP, and malignant cells were detected. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed under a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (T3N1M0, stage III). Despite of adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine) after surgery, CT scan revealed a low density area in the cut end of remnant pancreas at 3 months, which was accompanied with elevation of and CA19-9 and DUPAN-2 levels. We diagnosed as a recurrent pancreatic cancer of remnant pancreas without any other side of recurrence and re-resection was performed. Because of chylous ascites and depression following a second surgery, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could not be started. Re-recurrence was detected at 3 months after the second surgery, and she died 6 months after the surgery. Remnant or repeated pancreatectomy for local recurrent pancreatic carcinomas is extremely rare with limited number of cases reported in the literature. We report our experience, and discuss the significance of re-resection for recurrence of remnant pancreas.
