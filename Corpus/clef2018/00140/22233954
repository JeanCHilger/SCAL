Pitfalls in diagnostic imaging of cystic pancreatic masses: a case of true cystic lesion mimicking a mucinous cystadenoma. Imaging characterization is a frequent topic in diagnostic evaluation of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.We present a patient with a true pancreatic cyst with internal septation in an adult female. The presence of the internal septum should be considered in the differential diagnosis, in fact in our case CT and MR imaging findings were incorrectly suggestive of mucinous cystadenoma.True pancreatic cyst may show septate architecture and thus for imaging characterization this feature should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic masses.
