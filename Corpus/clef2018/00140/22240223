Schwannoma of the vagus nerve: diagnostic strategy and therapeutic approach. Scwhannomas are uncommon neurogenic tumors of the mediastinum. Most of them are located in the posterior mediastinum usually in the paralateral gutters. We report the case of an uncommon localisation of such a tumour appended to the right vagus nerve in the middle mediastinum.The patient was 50Â years old and complained of thoracic pain, shortness of breath and dysphagia. CT scanning of thorax and abdomen revealed a heterogeneous mass in the middle mediastinum, which was not visible on plain radiography. Further investigation included transoesophageal ultrasound and PET scan. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology after mini video-assisted thoracotomy. The schwannoma was entirely removed without any post-surgical complications.We report a novel case of schwannoma arising from the vagus nerve and review the diagnostic strategies. PET scanning has poor sensitivity and specificity and does not therefore contribute to confirm the diagnosis which depends on exploring the mediastimun surgically.
