Radiological evaluation of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. The intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the most frequent cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Due to the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging IPMN is being incidentally recognized with increasing frequency. The most common type is branch- duct IPMN which occurs multifocally in about 20-30%. Patients with IPMN may present with symptoms resembling chronic pancreatitis and episodes of acute pancreatitis are increasingly being reported which usually have a mild course. The most important diagnostic technique is contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), which most frequently allows the differentiation from other cystic lesions and enables the attribution to branch duct or main duct IPMN. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound are superior in depicting the fine architecture of cystic tumors. Particularly for evaluation of malignant transformation and extent of malignant disease, high resolution imaging is essential. Whereas main duct IPMN is an indication for resection therapy for small and asymptomatic branch duct IPMN periodic surveillance at 6-12 month intervals is recommended.
