Complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and how to minimize them. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the recent past was one ofthe basic diagnostic and therapeutic methods of several biliary and pancreatic diseases. It was and is still associated with several complications that can lead to exit the patient and is therefore considered invasive methods. The most serious complications include acute pancreatitis and acute cholangitis. Bleeding and perforation may complicate papillosphincterotomy that precedes another performance (extraction of stones, drainage of biliary and pancreatic duct. The incidence of serious complications have led to efforts to reduce the number of ERCP. This allowed in particular the introduction of new diagnostic methods, especially MRCP and EUS, which led to the practical exclusion of diagnostic ERCP. At present, ERCP is considered to be purely therapeutic method. In addition, considerable experience has been published to reduce the incidence of complications in ERCP. Many of them can be applied to our clinic, which has experience of more than 10 000 ERCP performed.
