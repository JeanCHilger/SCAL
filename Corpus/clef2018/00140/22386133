Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor: added value of fusion of T2-weighted imaging and high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging for tumor detection. To investigate the added value of fusion of high b-value diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and T2-weighted (T2) MR images for the detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNT).18 patients with 18 histologically proven PNT were included. Two radiologists independently and retrospectively reviewed four randomized images sets (T2+T1, DWI, T2+DWI, and DWI+T2 fusion). Lesion detection confidence level was assessed using a three grade score (no lesion uncertain lesion and certain lesion)Readers 1 and 2 respectively detected 14/18 and 16/18 lesions on T2+T1, 13/18 and 12/18 on DWI, 16/18 and 15/18 on T2+DWI and 17/18 and 16/18 on DWI+T2 fusion. Lesion median size was 16 mm (range: 7 mm-40 mm), 22% were hyperfunctioning (all insulinomas) and 72% were low-grade (Rindi 1). All tumors except one (with cystic component) showed lower ADC than adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. Fusion imaging had significantly better detection score by both authors (p<0.005) and provided the higher inter-reader agreement (kappa 0.7). DWI alone had the worst score for both readers.Fusion images improve the detection of PNT, especially in patients with small isointense lesions on conventional MR sequences.
