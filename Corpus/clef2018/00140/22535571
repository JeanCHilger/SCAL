Management of complications following pancreatic resection: an evidence-based approach. Despite significant improvements in operative mortality, morbidity remains a significant problem following pancreatectomy. Management of postpancreatectomy complications, namely pancreatic fistula, begins with a clear understanding of how these events are defined. There are now several unifying definitions for complications following pancreatectomy which have led to improved reporting of operative outcomes across institutions. Several randomized controlled trials have been performed in recent years that may lead to continued improvement in operative outcomes.
