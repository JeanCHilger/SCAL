Foreign body-induced abscess resembling pancreatic neoplasia. We report the case of a 44-year-old man presenting with abdominal pain and leukocytosis. His initial computed tomography demonstrated a pancreatic head mass concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, on further review of the patient's imaging, the mass was determined to be an abscess caused by foreign body ingestion and gastric perforation rather than cancer. This report describes the clinical and radiographic distinctions between pancreatic neoplasia and abscess. It also reviews the pertinent medical literature on how such viscus perforations affect subsequent prognostication and clinical management.
