Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas in children: clinical and computed tomography manifestation. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively assess imaging features of computed tomography (CT) and clinical characteristics of children with solid pseudopapillary tumours (SPTs) of the pancreas in comparison with those of SPTs in adults.CT images and clinical data of 86 patients with histopathologically proven SPTs were reviewed. Eighteen patients were classified as children (≤18 years old), and 68 were classified as adults (>18 years old) according to age at diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ                   (2) test and the Student's t test.Eighteen patients (15 girls and three boys) were children, with an average age of 15.1 years at operation. Abdominal pain or discomfort was the most common manifestation in children (66.7%). Mean tumour size in children was significantly larger than in adults (9.1 vs. 5.7 cm p=0.001). Except for tumour size, no significant statistical difference was observed in clinical factors or imaging features between SPTs in children and adults.Ours is the largest single-centre study to demonstrate the features of pancreatic SPT in children. SPT diagnosis should always be considered when a large pancreatic mass with typical imaging is found in a child, especially in adolescent girls.
