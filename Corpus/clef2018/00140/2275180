Ultrasonography of the abdominal cavity organs in peptic ulcer patients following gastric resection. A study of 205 patients in the follow-up period after gastric resection for ulcer disease indicates that ultrasonography is a valuable method of diagnosis of involvement of the abdominal cavity organs but requires perfection of methods directed at improvement of visualization of the scanned organs. For diagnosis of diffuse lesions of the liver it is rational to combine ultra-sonography with radionuclide, endoscopic and roentgenological methods. It was found that patients with gastric resection syndromes, calculosis of the gallbladder was present in 17.1% while lesions of the pancreas were 4 times more frequent than in the common population.
