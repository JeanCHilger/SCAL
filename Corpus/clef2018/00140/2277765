Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas. Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas is a very rare malignant tumor, with only 12 cases reported. A case of primary pancreatic leiomyosarcoma in a 55 year-old female with diabetes mellitus is described. US and CT demonstrated tumor masses in the head and tail of the pancreas. By angiography, abundant tumor vessels corresponding to the pancreatic tumor masses were revealed in the pancreas. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor in the tail of the pancreas, and then, microscopically it was diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma. The tumor in the head of the pancreas was not resected on account of the presence of diabetes mellitus and the possibility of poor prognosis. Macroscopically, it seemed to be the same as the tumor in the pancreatic tail. By operative findings, there was invasion from the pancreatic head to the duodenum and there was nothing to justify suspicion of the extra-ductal growing type of primary leiomyosarcoma of the duodenum. There were no metastases noted at the time.
