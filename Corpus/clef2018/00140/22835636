Diffusion-weighted MR imaging the significance of ADC and perfusion values in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mass forming pancreatitis. Despite the increasing diagnostic accuracy of cross sectional imaging modalities, the correct differentiation between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mass forming pancreatitis has remained a challenge.Based on their 2 and Â½ -year experience, the aim of the authors was to assess the clinical utility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and discernment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mass forming pancreatitis.3 b-values diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance examinations were performed in 19 patients suffering from adenocarcinoma and in 8 patients with pancreatitis. 12 healthy patients were examined as reference. Apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion values were calculated. Malignancy was verified by pathology in all cases. An inflammatory disease was diagnosed on the basis of previous medical history, changes in laboratory values, follow-up computer tomographic examinations and improvement in the patients' condition.Comparison of the apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion values revealed significant differences between healthy pancreatic tissues and those affected by inflammation or tumor. The highest apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion values were detected in the normal pancreas. Mass forming pancreatitis had diminished the apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion values, whereas these values were the lowest in tumorous tissues.In agreement with literature data, the authors conclude that diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a promising differential-diagnostic imaging tool in the distinction of circumscribed pancreatic lesions.
