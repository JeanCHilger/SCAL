Endoscopic ultrasonography. Endoscopic ultrasonography is a new and interesting technique. It is the only imaging technique that provides images of the gastrointestinal wall. Because of the high frequency used in EUS, it may provide high resolution images of gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas. Although the equipment used for EUS is similar to that used for more familiar diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures, there are substantial differences as well. The EUS procedure is more complex and difficult than many standard endoscopic procedures, and it requires close cooperation between the endoscopist, nurse and the patient. Despite the cost and difficulties of establishing this procedure in an endoscopy unit, EUS offers considerable promise as a new method of investigation.
