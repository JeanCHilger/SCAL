A new approach for evaluating the resectability of pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms. To establish a new standard for assessing the resectability of pancreatic and periampullary tumors by the Medical Image Three-Dimensional Visualization System (MI-3DVS).Eighty cases of pancreatic and periampullary tumors were examined. The 64-slice multidetector CT (64-MDCT) images and patient data were processed by MI-3DVS. The main elements examined by MI-3DVS included tumor shape, size, and location distribution of related vesselsAmong the 80 cases, MI-3DVS indicated that 60 were resectable and the remaining 20 were not. In contrast, CTA indicated 50 resectable cases and 30 unresectable cases. For 57 cases of pancreatic ductal carcinomas and all 80 cases periampullary tumors, MI-3DVS assessment yielded a positive predictive value of 100%, negative predictive value of 100%, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 100%. While CTA generated corresponding values of 96%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 82.5%. The overall differences between the two methods were significant (P < 0.05).The new classification system is able to reliably assess the resectability of pancreatic and periampullary tumors.
