Clinical analysis of 36 cases of autoimmune pancreatitis in China. To improve the early identification of autoimmune pancreatitis in China by a retrospective analysis of clinical data from AIP patients.The analysis included 36 patients admitted by the surgery department of our hospital from January 2003 to October 2011 whose postoperative pathological confirmations were consistent with the histological criteria of Honolulu Consensus Document. The clinical phenotypes associated with the histopathologic patterns of LPSP and IDCP were referred to as type 1 and type 2 of AIP, respectively. A retrospective analysis of clinical features, serological data, pathological findings and imageological records was performed in line with the subtypes of AIP. Type 1 showing a sex predilection (males) was commonly more dominant than type 2 in all AIP. Type 2 without a gender predilection was, on average, a decade younger than type 1. Type 1 was inferior to type 2 in ALT, ALP and γ-GT with statistical significance (P = 0.044, 0.025 and 0.013). Type 1 was inferior to type 2 in AST with difference close to statistical significance (P = 0.072). Histopathology revealed frequent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with less frequent infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils and fibroblasts. Diffuse and intensive interstitial fibrosis could be seen. The changes of pancreatic head were more frequently seen in type 2 than in type 1 (P = 0.05). Plasma cells staining of IgG4 at a density of over 30 or more cells per high-power field appeared to be a specific finding in China with type 1. Imageology found a diffusely or focally enlarged pancreas, most frequently a mass or enlargement in the pancreatic head, characteristic capsule-like rim, calcification or pancreatic calculus and cystic degeneration.AIP is a unique type of chronic pancreatitis and has distinctive serological, pathological and imageological characteristics, which should be used for differentiation from pancreatic cancer.
