PET/CT of cancer patients: part 1, pancreatic neoplasms. Pancreatic cancer continues to have a poor prognosis despite impressive improvements in the outcomes of many other types of cancer, often because most pancreatic neoplasms are found to be unresectable at diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of pancreatic cancer and the role of modern imaging in its diagnosis and management with an emphasis on (18)F-FDG PET/CT fusion imaging.Multimodality imaging is critical in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. PET/CT is increasingly viewed as a useful, accurate, and cost-effective modality in diagnosing and managing pancreatic cancer, but further studies are warranted. Early data suggest that contrast-enhanced PET/CT performed with modern PET/CT scanners yields high-resolution anatomic information for surgical and radiotherapeutic planning and functional information for whole-body staging in the care of patients with this disease.
