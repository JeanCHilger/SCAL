Pancreatic stent migration into the portal vein causing portal vein thrombosis: a rare complication of a prophylactic pancreatic stent. This report describes the first case of a novel complication of prophylactic pancreatic stents used to reduce the risk of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis, whereby the stent migrated into the portal vein resulting in portal vein thrombosis. We review the literature and discuss the potential mechanisms that caused this complication. The approach and prompt treatment that resulted in a favorable clinical outcome are described.
