A case of obstructive jaundice caused by incarceration of pancreatic stones in the ampulla of papilla Vater. A very rare case of obstructive jaundice caused by the incarceration of pancreatic stones in the ampulla of papilla Vater is reported. A forty-eight-year-old man, who had been taking alcohol daily for 10 years, was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent attacks of upper abdominal pain. Biochemical analysis demonstrated typical pattern of chronic pancreatitis. US, CT and ERCP showed a markedly dilated pancreatic duct and pancreatic calcifications. Cholecystolithiasis, or dilatation of the choledochus was not noted. Conservative treatment was performed under the diagnosis of chronic calcifying pancreatitis for one month. Then, obstructive jaundice, severe epigastralgia, and high fever occurred. Obstructive jaundice with sudden onset and existence of pancreatic stones suggested incarceration of pancreatic stones in the bile duct, and cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The largest pancreatic stone was incarcerated into the ampulla of papilla Vater. Histopathological analysis of the pancreas showed severe chronic pancreatitis. No report of the similar case can be found in the literature. Incarceration of pancreatic stones into biliary system might be very rare, however, should not be forgotten in differential diagnoses of obstructive jaundice in chronic pancreatitis patients.
