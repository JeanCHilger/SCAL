Gastric outlet obstruction by a donor aortic tube after en bloc liver pancreas transplantation: a case report. We present the case of a 30-year-old female suffering from a type five maturity onset diabetes of the young deficiency, resulting in type 1 diabetes and terminal renal insufficiency. She also had chronic and refractory pruritis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis-like fibrosis. She underwent combined en bloc liver and pancreas transplantation and kidney transplantation. The postoperative course was complicated by a gastric outlet obstruction due to compression of the native gastroduodenal junction by the donor aortic tube. This was treated by construction of a roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy at posttransplant day 24. To our knowledge, compression of the gastroduodenal junction by a donor aortic tube after combined liver and pancreas (or multivisceral) transplantation has not been reported previously.
