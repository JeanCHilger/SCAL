Clinical characteristics of acute pancreatitis in Mexico. Acute pancreatitis (AP) etiology and frequency vary in relation to geographic region.To determine the etiology, frequency, and mortality of AP in a Mexican population.We carried out a prospective study of first episode AP patients over a period of 6 years.A total of 605 patients with a mean age of 40 years were included in the study. Sixty-four percent of them presented with overweight and/or obesity determined through BMI. Etiology was biliary in 66.60%, it was due to alcohol consumption in 15.90%, hypertriglyceridemia in 7.80%, it was post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 2.10%, and was undetermined in 7.20%. Pancreatic infection was suspected in 70 patients and they underwent CT-guided fine needle aspiration. Thirty-two of those patients were diagnosed with pancreatic infection in which Staphylococcus spp was the most common microorganism. Overall mortality was 5.00% (2.60% < 30 years and 10.00% > 70 years). Necrosis, pancreatic infection, and mortality were more frequent in the cases in which etiology was due to alcohol ingestion.The most frequent AP etiology was biliary, but that caused by alcohol presented with more complications. Overall mortality was 5.00% and was higher in the elderly patients.
