Laparoscopic resection of synchronous intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a case report. We describe herein a 68-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a quite rare entity of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) occurring simultaneously in the left lateral lobe of liver and the tail of pancreas. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed a cystic dilatation of the pancreatic duct in the pancreatic tail, which suggested an IPMN, and multiple intrahepatic duct stones in the left lateral lobe. The patient underwent a laparoscopic left lateral hepatolobectomy and spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Intra-operative finding of massive mucin in the dilated bile duct implied an intraductal mucinous tumor in the liver. The diagnosis of synchronous IPMNs in the liver and pancreas was confirmed by pathological examination. The patient was followed up for 6 mo without signs of recurrence. Although several cases of IPMN of liver without any pancreatic association have been reported, the simultaneous occurrence of IPMNs in the liver and pancreas is very rare. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first reported case treated by laparoscopic resection.
