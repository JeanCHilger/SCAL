An interesting case of isolated pancreatic teratoma: lessons to learn. Mature cystic teratomas of the pancreas are extremely rare tumours encountered in day-to-day clinical practice. Only few cases have been reported to date involving all age groups. The management, diagnosis and evaluation of this tumor are questionable, with definitive diagnosis taking place intra-operatively. We hereby report the case in a 30 year-old-male who presented with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and during the follow up he was noted to have elevated liver enzymes clinically, he was asymptomatic. The computerized tomography revealed a retropancreatic mass and pushing the mesenteric veins anteriorly. The mass was hypodense in nature and there was presence of calcification. Although the patient was asymptomatic, the decision for resecting the mass was made in view of the size and possibility of malignancy. In conclusion, considering the size and approximity of the mass to the pancreas, Whipple procedure's is the most appropriate approach although the histological diagnosis has not been established preoperatively.
