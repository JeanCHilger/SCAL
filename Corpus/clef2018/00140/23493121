Simultaneous 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/MRI in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: initial results. The aim of this pilot study was to demonstrate the potential of simultaneously acquired 68-Gallium-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in comparison with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with known gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).Eight patients (4 women and 4 men mean [SD] age, 54 [17] yearsAccording to the reference standard, 5 of the 8 patients had malignant NET lesions at the time of the examination. A total of 4 patients were correctly identified by PET/CT, with the PET and CT component correctly identifying 3 patients each. All 5 patients positive for NET disease were correctly identified by PET/MRI, with the MRI subscan identifying all 5 patients and the PET subscan identifying 3 patients. All lesions considered as malignant in PET/CT were equally depicted in and considered using PET/MRI. One liver lesion rated as "indetermined" in PET/CT was identified as metastasis in PET/MRI because of a diffusion restriction in diffusion-weighted imaging. Of the 4 lung lesions characterized in PET/CT, only 1 was depicted in PET/MRI. Of the 3 lymph nodes depicted in PET/CT, only 1 was characterized in PET/MRI. Interobserver reliability was equally very good in PET/CT (κ = 0.916) and PET/MRI (κ = 1.0). The SUV max measured in PET/CT and in PET/MRI showed a strong correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.996).This pilot study demonstrates the potential of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/MRI in patients with gastroenteropancreatic NET, with special advantages in the characterization of abdominal lesions yet certain weaknesses inherent to MRI, such as lung metastases and hypersclerotic bone lesions.
