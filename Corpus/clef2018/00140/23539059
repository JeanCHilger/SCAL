Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and recurrent pancreatitis. Ohashi described for the first time the IPMN on 1982 as a pancreatic neoplasia with mucine cells forming papillae and producing dilatation of the main pancreatic duct or its branches. The IPMN represent the 1% of the pancreatic tumors and 5% of the cystic neoplasias. It is potentially malignant in a period of five years being more frequent in males between 60-70 and clinically these patients' presents as acute, recurrent or chronic pancreatitis, with an incidence of malignancy from 25% to 70%. CT scan and cholangio MRI allows the diagnosis, the variety, localization and possibility of determine malignancy. The treatment is the Whipple resection. We are reporting the case of an obese middle age male, being observed along the last 10 years because of recurrent pancreatitis with a cystic lesion of the head of the pancreas. The CT scan, endoscopic-ultrasound and the analysis of the liquid content suggested a mucinous lesion, reason why the patient underwent a pancreatic-duodenal resection. The histology study confirms the diagnosis of IPMN.
