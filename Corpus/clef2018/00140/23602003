Laparoscopic resection for splenic artery aneurysm using the lateral approach: report of two cases. We report two cases of successful laparoscopic surgery for splenic artery aneurysm. In case 1, a 59-year-old man who had hypertension was admitted to the hospital with complaints of slight back pain. CT scan showed a winding splenic artery and an aneurysm behind the pancreas body. In case 2, a 71-year-old woman with hypertension consulted us and was diagnosed with splenic artery aneurysm. Her aneurysm increased from 1.2 mm to 20 mm at the 1-year follow-up. In both cases, we performed laparoscopic splenectomy, using the left lateral approach, to resect the aneurysm. Splenectomy was performed after the spleen had changed color. The operating times were 210 and 259 min, respectively and the bleeding was 60 and 100 mL, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful. By using the lateral approach from the left side, we were able to precisely resect the splenic artery aneurysm under a stable laparoscopic view.
