Compression of the main pancreatic duct by the intrapancreatic-replaced common hepatic artery. We describe a unique case of a patient who presented with a linear, transverse, and incidentally-detected main pancreatic duct dilatation that was caused by the intrapancreatic-replaced common hepatic artery, detected on the MDCT, MRCP and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. We believe this case to be the first of its kind reported in the literature.
