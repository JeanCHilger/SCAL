Pancreatic glucagonoma with pancreatic calcification. Glucagonoma is an uncommon type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor [NET] which is characterized by diabetes mellitus, necrolytic migratory erythema, depression and deep vein thrombosis. The typical rash is often misdiagnosed and the diagnosis is delayed by 7-8 years. Pancreatic NETs and other pancreatic tumors are known to show calcifications within the tumor but calcification of the remaining normal pancreas is very uncommon. It occurs when there is ductal obstruction leading to acute or chronic pancreatitis.We present a case of glucagonoma with coexistent pancreatic calcification.Glucagonoma should be suspected in a diabetic patient with migratory rash. Pancreatic tumor should be suspected in patient with idiopathic focal pancreatitis.
