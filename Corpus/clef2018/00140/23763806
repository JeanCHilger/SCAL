Serous cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas. Serous cystic neoplasms of pancreas are relatively rare tumours. Malignancy in these tumours is even more rare which is confirmed by metastasis to other organs or by perineural, vascular or surrounding soft tissue invasion. A 60 years old lady presented with vague upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography scan showed multiloculated cystic mass in the body of pancreas measuring 9 x 6 x 5 cm and not involving spleen. Pancreatectomy specimen showed a multicystic tumour having sponge-like appearance which showed vascular and soft tissue invasion of surrounding stroma on microscopic examination and was diagnosed as serous cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas.
