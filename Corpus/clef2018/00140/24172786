Bifid tail of the pancreas with localized acute pancreatitis. Bifid tail of the pancreas is an extremely rare developmental anomaly, and its clinical importance is not well known. We report the case of a 28-year-old man with acute pancreatitis limited to one side of a bifid tail with no otherwise detectable parenchymal edema on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Neither was there evidence of other anatomical ductal abnormalities that could have contributed to the patient's pancreatitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest that bifid tail of the pancreas might cause acute pancreatitis.
