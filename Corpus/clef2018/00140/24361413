Induction of acute ectopic pancreatitis by endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration. Ectopic pancreas rarely causes symptoms or complications. We analyzed 2 atypical cases of ectopic pancreas associated with acute ectopic pancreatitis, 1 of which was induced by endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The patients were seen at a tertiary medical center where they had undergone computed tomography, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and EUS-FNA analyses. They initially received conservative medical treatment and were later treated by surgery. Both patients were diagnosed with ectopic pancreas of the stomach on the basis of computed tomography, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EUS-FNA. Surgical resection cured both patients and confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic pancreas. Acute ectopic pancreatitis is an unusual complication of ectopic pancreas that can be induced by EUS-FNA and diagnosed and cured with surgery.
