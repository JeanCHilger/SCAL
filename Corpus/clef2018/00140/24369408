Primary coloduodenal fistula. Coloduodenal fistula (CDF) is uncommon, and it is often secondary to other colon and duodenal diseases that are benign or malignant. The clinical manifestations of CDF are variable, and upper abdominal pain, feculent vomiting and diarrhea are the common symptoms. Digestive tract contrast radiography and enhanced CT imaging are very helpful for diagnosing CDF, and gastrointestinal endoscopy can give more information about the fistula. Procedure selection should depend on whether the primary disease is malignant and the extent of the lesion. Because the duodenum has complicated anatomic relationship with its adjacent organs including bile duct system and pancreas, procedure for this clinical entity is a challenging task. Decision-making and experienced surgical skills are critical.
