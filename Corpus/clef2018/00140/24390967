Eosinophilic cholangiopathy: the diagnostic dilemma of a recurrent biliary stricture. Should surgery be offered for all? A 63-year-old man presented with the initial diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice. CT of the abdomen revealed an oedematous pancreas and dilated common bile duct (CBD), without gallstones. After failure of initial retrograde cholangiopancreatography, a percutaneous biliary catheter was inserted with good drainage. Subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed a 2 cm distal CBD stricture. A biliary stent was inserted past the stricture. Biopsy of the stricture, brush cytology of the bile duct and fine needle aspiration of pancreatic head under endoscopic ultrasound guidance were negative for malignancy. Autoimmune screen was negative as well. However, the patient represented with cholangitis requiring repeat ERCP and insertion of a second biliary stent. He finally underwent cholecystectomy with excision of the distal CBD and Roux-En-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Histology revealed diffuse eosinophilic cholecystitis and cholangitis. A retrospective review of the blood results showed persistent eosinophilia in full blood count measurements from presentation and persisting throughout the treatment period.
