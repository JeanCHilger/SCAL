A case of remnant gastric cancer with afferent loop syndrome treated by left upper exenteration. A 64-year-old man with sudden upper abdominal pain and emesis was admitted to our hospital. Forty years ago, he had undergone distal gastrectomy and reconstruction by Billroth II anastomosis for gastric cancer. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a dilated afferent loop and anastomotic tumor. Gastrofiberscopy showed crookedness and edematization of the afferent loop anastomosis. A biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. He was operated on under the diagnosis of remnant gastric cancer. Left upper exenteration was performed because the transverse colon, lateral segment of the liver, pancreas, and left renal hilus were involved. Liver metastasis and abdominal dissemination were not observed. Histopathological findings revealed severe invasion of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma to other organs, and intraoperative peritoneal lavage cytology was positive. He was discharged from our hospital however, adjuvant chemotherapy was impossible because of his poor condition. Four months after the operation, he died from peritoneal carcinomatosis. Remnant gastric cancer with afferent loop syndrome has a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary to select surgical resection or palliative care after immediate chemotherapy, considering each patient's condition and cancer stage.
