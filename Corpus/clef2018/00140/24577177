Insulinoma: rare yet important. We report our experience with six cases of insulinoma that were managed at our hospital between 2009 and 2013. Four patients were women and two men, with mean age of 43 years and mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis of 5.7 years. Biochemical confirmation was made in all cases and preoperative localisation was successful in two cases only. In the other four, intraoperative localisation was made. Enucleation was performed in four patients and distal pancreatectomy in the other two. The tumour was proved benign in all patients by histopathology. Postoperatively, all patients were asymptomatic during a follow-up period ranging from 9 months to 4 years and both serum glucose and insulin were normal during that period. We think that careful preoperative workup and skilful surgical techniques can end the prolonged suffering of patients with insulinomas with excellent results.
