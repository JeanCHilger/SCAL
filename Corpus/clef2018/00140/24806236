An adult case of intussusception due to inverted Meckel's diverticulum observed by colonoscopy. A man in his twenties had intermittent abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant for more than 4 years. The abdominal pain persisted after a meal, and he visited our hospital emergency department. We performed an emergency colonoscopy and found a 3-cm mobile polypoid lesion located on the antimesenteric side of the ileum 40 cm from the ileocecal valve and was 85×26×23 mm in size. On the basis of characteristic ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT findings, our preoperative diagnosis was intussusception due to Meckel's diverticulum translation and performed a laparoscopic ileocecal resection. The pathological diagnosis was Meckel's diverticulum translation with ectopic pancreatic and gastric tissue. Furthermore, we aggregated the cases of adult intussusception due to Meckel's diverticulum translation reported in Japan, and investigated preoperative diagnoses and treatment plans.
