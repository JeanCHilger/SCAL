Endoscopic drainage treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. This study presents the experience of its authors with endoscopic drainage treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. The first part of the study offers a literature overview of the basic knowledge of pancreatic pseudocysts. The authors gradually deal with the individual types of pancreatic pseudocysts, the clinical picture, complications and diagnostics. Within the bounds of differential diagnostics the authors stress mainly the necessity of differentiating pancreatic pseudocysts from cystic tumors and benign cysts. Special attention is dedicated to various modalities of pancreatic pseudocyst treatment. The second part of the study presents the authors' own results of the endoscopic drainage treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.Results of endoscopic drainage treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts, which is one of significant possibilities of treatment of these conditions, are presented.This method was used to treat 33 patients (24 men and 9 women) from September 2007 to March 2009. Endoscopic drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts was performed 4 times transduodenally a 29 times transgastrically, namely in 6 cases under endosonographic guidance and in 27 cases by a duodenoscope after endosonographic targeting.The authors conclude that endoscopic drainage is an effective method of pancreatic pseudocyst treatment.
