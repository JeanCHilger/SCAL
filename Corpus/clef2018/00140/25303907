Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy of small solid pancreatic lesions using a 22-gauge needle with side fenestration. Early detection of small pancreatic cancer is important because expected survival is markedly better for tumors ≤ 2 cm. A new endoscopic ultrasound-(EUS) guided biopsy needle with side fenestration has been recently developed to enable fine-needle biopsy (FNB) under EUS guidance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of EUS-FNB using a 22-gauge ProCore needle in solid pancreatic lesions ≤ 2 cm, in terms of diagnostic accuracy and yield.From January 2011 to December 2012, all consecutive EUS-guided tissue sampling of small pancreatic lesions (≤ 2 cm) were performed using 22-gauge ProCore needles the data of these patients were analyzed retrospectively.Sixty-eight patients with a mean age of 65.7 years were included. The mean lesion size was 16.5 mm (range 5-20). None of the patients developed complications. On pathological examination, the tissue retrieved was judged adequate in 58 out of 68 cases (85.3 %) and the presence of a tissue core was recorded in 36 out of 68 cases (52.9 %). The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 80, 100, 100, 40, and 82 %, respectively.Our results suggested that EUS-FNB of small pancreatic lesions using a 22-gauge ProCore needle is effective and safe, and supports our hypothesis that EUS-FNB is highly useful in establishing the nature of small pancreatic lesions.
