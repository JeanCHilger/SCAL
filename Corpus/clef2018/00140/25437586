Clinical impact of intraoperative navigation using a Doppler ultrasonographic guided vessel tracking technique for pancreaticoduodenectomy. During pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), early ligation of critical vessels such as the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (IPDA) has been reported to reduce blood loss. Color Doppler flow imaging has become the useful diagnostic methods for the delineation of the anatomy. In this study, we assessed the utility of the intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography (Dop-US) guided vessel detection and tracking technique (Dop-Navi) for identifying critical arteries in order to reduce operative bleeding. Ninety patients who received PD for periampullary or pancreatic disease were enrolled. After 14 patients were excluded because of combined resection of portal vein or other organs, the remaining were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: patients for whom Dop-Navi was used (n = 37) and those for whom Dop-Navi was not used (n = 39 controls). We compared the ability of Dop-Navi to identify critical vessels to that of preoperative multi-detector computed tomography (MD-CT), using MD-CT data, as well as compared the perioperative status and postoperative outcome between the 2 patient groups. Intraoperative Dop-US was significantly superior to MD-CT in terms of identifying number of vessels and the ability to discriminate the IPDA from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) based on blood flow velocity. The Dop-Navi patients had shorter operation times (531 min versus 577 min
