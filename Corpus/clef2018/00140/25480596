Meta-analysis of quantitative diffusion-weighted MR imaging in differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic masses. There have been numerous studies done to explore the diagnostic performance of quantitative diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging to differentiate between benign and malignant pancreatic masses. However, the results have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate whether DW-MR imaging can differentiate between these two diseases. Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were utilized to find relevant articles published between January 2001 and January 2014. A Stata version 12.0 and a Meta-Disc version 1.4 were used to describe primary results. Twelve studies with 594 patients, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were enrolled for the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of DW imaging was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.95) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.93) respectively. The area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96). The results indicated that DW imaging might be a valuable tool for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic masses.
