Potential application of interventional endoscopic ultrasonography for the treatment of esophageal and gastric varices. Interventional endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been developed mainly for the treatment of pancreaticobiliary disorders (e.g. cyst drainage for pancreatic pseudocysts, biliary drainage for malignant biliary obstruction, and celiac plexus neurolysis). Recently, the application of interventional EUS has been expanded to a new field, the treatment of gastrointestinal varices. There have been several studies examining this new technique for the treatment of esophageal and gastric varices. In the present review, we have summarized the current status of interventional EUS for the treatment of esophageal and gastric varices (e.g. EUS-guided coil deployment for gastric varices) and clarified the clinical feasibility of this procedure.
