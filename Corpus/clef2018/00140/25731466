Long-term survival following postoperative combined modality therapy for pancreatic cancer. A 69-year-old woman with back pain underwent distal pancreatectomy with left adrenectomy for advanced pancreatic cancer pathologically diagnosed as poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with retroperitoneal and perineural invasion, pT3N0M0, Stage III. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 6 months. However, 3 years after surgery, computed tomography (CT) revealed para-aorticlymph node (LN) recurrence. Treatment with gemcitabine (GEM) was begun and continued for 3 years. Following progression of the LN recurrence 5 and half years after surgery, administration of radiotherapy reduced diarrhea and back pain. Supportive care combined with radio-frequency ablation(RFA)was provided for multiple liver metastasis 5 years 7 months after surgery. The patient died due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage 6 years after surgery. We report long-term postoperative survival of a patient with recurrent pancreatic cancer following combined modality therapy.
