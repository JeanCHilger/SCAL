A case of main-duct IPMN with multicentric invasive carcinoma. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas often contains multifocal lesions, and total pancreatectomy is sometimes needed for curative resection. We report here our experience with a case of IPMN with multiple invasive carcinoma foci that was successfully treated with total pancreatectomy. A 66-year-old man had jaundice, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a hypovascular mass in the pancreas head in conjunction with calcification and dilation of the entire main pancreatic duct. He was diagnosed with pancreas head cancer and chronic pancreatitis, and a pancreaticoduodenectomy was planned. Intraoperative pathological examination revealed papillary growth of high grade dysplasia in the main and branch duct epithelium and perineural invasion of the atypical glands. After 2 additional resections, we performed a total pancreatectomy. Pathological findings showed that the pancreas head tumor was an invasive carcinoma derived from main-duct IPMN of the pancreas. It was a mucinous carcinoma with calcification. Moreover, we found other multiple, discontinuous invasive foci in the body and tail of the pancreas which were undetectable by preoperative imaging. This case was highly suggestive for preoperative diagnosis for pancreas tumor and developmental pattern of main-duct IPMN.
