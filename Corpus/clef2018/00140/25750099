Clinical application of sonoelastography in thyroid, prostate, kidney, pancreas, and deep venous thrombosis. This article reviews the clinical applications of current ultrasound elastography methods in non-hepatic conditions including thyroid nodules, prostate cancer, chronic kidney disease, solid renal lesions, pancreatic lesions, and deep vein thrombosis. Pathophysiology alters tissue mechanical properties via ultrastructural changes including fibrosis, increased cellularity, bleeding, and necrosis, creating a target biomarker, which can be imaged qualitatively or quantitatively with US elastography. US elastography methods can add information to conventional US methods and improve the diagnostic performance of conventional US in a range of disease processes.
