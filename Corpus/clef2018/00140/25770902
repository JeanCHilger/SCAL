The breadth of imaging findings of groove pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of groove pancreatitis involves progressive cystic degeneration of hamartomatous pancreas rests which lie within the duodenal wall. Hamartomatous pancreatic rests can occur in other locations, but when located within the pancreaticoduodenal groove can lead to a particular clinical presentation following the development of fibrotic and inflammatory tissue. Although this is not a disease of the pancreas itself, the pancreatic duct and biliary system is frequently secondarily involved in this regional process. Identification of this entity and its varied appearances as a distinct pathology is essential given the unique management issues of groove pancreatitis.
