Clinical Significance of Adjuvant Surgical Resection for Initially Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer Responsive to Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy. We have reported a clinically meaningful local-control effect and a hepatic metastatic tumor-regression effect of transcatheter peripancreatic arterial embolization-hepatic and splenic arterial infusion chemotherapy (TPPAE-HSAIC) for unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance, of adjuvant surgical resection after TPPAE-HSAIC.We assessed histopathological findings and outcomes of 6 patients who underwent surgical resection of tumors judged to be radically resectable after attaining tumor down-staging or long-term tumor control following TPPAE-HSAIC for pancreatic cancer initially diagnosed as unresectable.Clinical stage at the initial diagnosis was T4N0M0 Stage III in 4 patients and T4N0M1 Stage IV in 2 patients. The durations of TPPAE-HSAIC ranged from 5 to 46 months with a median of 19 months. An R0 resection was performed in 5 of the 6 patients (83%) and pathological down-staging, from the viewpoint of clinical stage, was observed in 4 patients. Of the 5 patients with R0 resection, one died from a postoperative complication at 7 months and another from pulmonary metastasis at 30 months post-operatively, while the other 3 patients have survived for 45 to 83 months to date.If surgical resection of pancreatic cancer initially diagnosed as unresectable can be carried out in patients responding favorably to TPPAE-HSAIC, the likelihood of long-term survival might be increased.
