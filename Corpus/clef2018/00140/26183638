A case of primary pancreatic lymphoblastic lymphoma diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Pancreatic involvement is an extremely rare manifestation of lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), and only a few cases have been reported. We report a case of LBL arising from the pancreas that was diagnosed using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The patient was a 57-year-old female who had suffered from abdominal pain for 2 weeks. A physical examination revealed an upper abdominal mass, but did not detect peripheral lymphadenopathy. Imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) and (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography-CT revealed an enlarged pancreatic body, which was positive for FDG uptake. EUS-FNA detected medium-sized proliferating atypical lymphocytes, and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that these cells were positive for CD20, CD10, PAX5, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A bone marrow examination was negative for lymphoma infiltration, and a diagnosis of LBL arising from the pancreas was made. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of chemotherapy and pancreatic irradiation.
