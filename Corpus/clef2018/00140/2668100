Endoscopic ultrasonography in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic disease. Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed in 25 patients with suspected pancreatic disease. Cancer of the pancreas was recognized in 9 of 10 cases with 1 false negative and 2 false positive diagnoses. Chronic pancreatitis was recognized in 89% of cases. Technical difficulties limited the success of the examination in 24% of cases. The presence or absence of pancreatic disease can be determined in most cases by endoscopic ultrasonography. Differential diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is correct in the majority of cases. We have not discovered any specific EUS finding(s) that are pathognomonic for pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis.
