Surgical Resection after Chemotherapy for Ampullary Carcinoma with Synchronous Liver Metastasis--Report of a Case. A 63-year-old woman presented with abnormalities in liver enzyme levels on laboratory studies, which were detected during a routine medical check-up. She was diagnosed with carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater with a synchronous solitary liver metastasis (S7). She was treated with gemcitabine plus S-1. After 2 courses of the chemotherapy, computed tomography revealed that the primary and metastatic tumors had not changed in size, but new lesions had not appeared. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and partial resection of the liver (S7) were performed. She received gemcitabine monotherapy for 1 year and she remains alive and well with no evidence of disease 2 year 10 months after resection.
