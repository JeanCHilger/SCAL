A Case of Pancreatic Head Cancer Treated with Pancreaticoduodenectomy Combined with Hepatic Artery Resection Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. A 70-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer with hepatic artery invasion by multi-detector computed tomography (MD-CT). After 3 courses of gemcitabine plus S-1 neoadjuvant therapy, the tumor size was not diminished however, the tumor marker CA19-9 level was decreased to less than 90% of its initial level. Pancreaticoduodenectomy combined with hepatic artery resection was performed, and an end-to-end anastomosis was made between the common and proper hepatic artery to reconstruct the hepatic artery. The pathological examination indicated adenosquamous carcinoma, no vascular invasion, and negative margin status, and the efficacy of chemotherapy was classified as Gradeâ…¡b using Evans' classification. Usually, pancreatic head cancer with hepatic artery invasion is considered unresectable due to its high morbidity/mortality and poor prognosis. However, with the recently developed surgical strategy and appropriate therapeutic interventions, such as a combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and resection/reconstruction of the hepatic artery, a curative operation can be feasible for locally advanced pancreatic head cancer.
