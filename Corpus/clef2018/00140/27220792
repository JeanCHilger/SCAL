A Case of Recurred Gastric Cancer of the Anastomosis Completely Responding to Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and S-1 Triplet Therapy. A 51-year-old man who had undergone distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer was admitted in Kagoshima University Hospital under the diagnosis of anastomotic recurrence of gastric cancer. From abdominal CT results, the recurred tumor was suspected to invade into the pancreas with regional node metastases. Because of the intense radicality of surgical intervention, we planned 3 courses of docetaxel, cisplatin, and S-1 triplet therapy(DCS therapy). After the chemotherapy, the recurred tumor and lymph node metastases shrunk drastically. Segmental gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was performed with curative intent. Final pathology revealed complete regression of both the recurred tumor and lymph node metastases. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful without tumor relapse. DCS therapy seems to be suitable to obtain drastic tumor regression before surgical intervention as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer.
