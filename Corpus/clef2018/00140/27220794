A Case of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Showing R0 Resection after Resection of the Portal Vein Following Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy. We report a case of pancreatic cancer showing R0 resection after resection of the portal vein(PV)following preoperative chemoradiotherapy. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with back pain. We diagnosed the patient with pancreatic cancer using computed tomography scan and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Because the tumor directly invaded the PV, we diagnosed it as a borderline resectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Radiation therapy(40 Gy/20 Fr)was administered with S-1 monotherapy(120 mg/body/day on days 1-5 and days 8-12). After the treatment, the main tumor was stable without distant metastasis. Therefore, we performed pancreaticoduodenectomy with resection of the PV. Pathological examination confirmed negative margin status. The patient was healthy and showed no sign of recurrence eight months after surgery.
