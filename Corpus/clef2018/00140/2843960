Bone lesions in chronic pancreatitis. Case reports of 4 patients with combined pancreatic and bone marrow disease are presented. 3 of them were alcoholics and suffered from chronic pancreatitis and bacterial osteomyelitis, one showed lipolytic lesions of the bone marrow following an acute exacerbation of a chronic lithogenic pancreatitis. X-ray examination of the left hand, both feet and tibiae showed evidence of multifocal small osteolytic defects accompanied by periosteal reaction in the case of lipolytic bone lesions. The appearance resembles that of an osteomyelitis, however, lacking the extensive destruction and sclerotic reaction. These bone lesions were associated with neurological symptoms and subcutaneous nodules. In one patient histological investigation of the bone lesions showed osteomyelitic and lipolytic changes so that there might be an association between both diseases.
