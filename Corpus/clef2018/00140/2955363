Intrahepatic collections of fluid of pancreatic origin. A case. A case of intrahepatic liquid collections of pancreatic origin is reported. A search in the literature yielded 8 cases of pancreatic pseudocysts which developed in the liver left lobe. The present case was original owing to its localization in the right hepatic lobe, to the large volume of the intrahepatic effusions and to the scarcity of underlying pancreatic symptoms. Ultrasonography and computerized axial tomography were useful aids to the diagnosis as well as to the therapeutic procedures. Surgery, which usually is a matter of discussion in chronic pancreatitis, was necessary to obtain the favourable outcome expected in such diseases.
