Magnetic resonance imaging, chest radiography, computed tomography and ultrasonography in malignant lymphoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared with chest radiography, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) for demonstration of spleen and liver engagement and enlarged lymph nodes in patients with malignant lymphoma. The investigation comprised 24 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 39 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). MRI demonstrated enlarged lymph nodes, distinctly separated from vessels, fat, muscle, liver and occasionally also pancreas without any contrast medium. The distinction between lymph nodes and spleen was, however, poor in the images. In the mediastinum, MRI was superior to chest radiography and had an accuracy similar to that of CT. In the abdomen and the pelvis MRI had slight advantages over CT in detection of enlarged lymph nodes. Compared with US the MRI results were similar in the abdomen and somewhat better in the pelvis. MRI and US were better than CT in revealing HD infiltrates in the spleen. Infiltration of NHL in the spleen was slightly better disclosed at US than at CT and MRI most of the NHL infiltration, confirmed at histopathology, could, however, not be revealed with any of the modalities, except when the size of the spleen was considered. Regions in the spleen, displayed with low image intensity in the T2 weighted image, were most likely due to increased amount of fibrotic tissue in the lymphomatous lesions. Good demonstration of lymph nodes and lymphomatous lesions in the spleen with MRI required two sequences
