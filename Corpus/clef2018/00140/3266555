Inactivation of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) in human plasma by reactive oxidants. Activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages generate oxidizing agents similar to or identical with N-chloroamines. Mimicking this oxidation in normal human plasma by usage of chloramine T (CT), we observed an oxidant concentration-dependent inactivating effect on plasma alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (alpha 2-PI), antithrombin III (AT III), and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI). 20-50 mumol CT/ml plasma are necessary for almost complete inactivation of alpha 2-PI and AT III-activity, i.e. about 2-5 times the dose necessary for inactivation of alpha 1-PI which has already been classified as "oxidant sensitive". The inactivation of alpha 1-PI, alpha 2-PI and AT III in plasma by oxidants is the result of a specific oxidative damage since C1-inhibitor, serine proteinases and complexes of plasmin and alpha 2-PI were chloramine resistant under the conditions used. According to our results, the amount of chloramines released by 1 x 10(6) activated PMN, namely ca. 10 nmol (see Weiss et al. Science 222 625-628, 1983) would be sufficient to destroy alpha 1-PI and alpha 2-PI activity of 1.5 and 0.4 microliter of human plasma, respectively. Consequently, activated leukocytes may be able to create a microenvironment in which elastase as well as plasmin and thrombin can display their proteolytic activity unchecked by their regulator proteins. Oxidation may provide a general basis for altering enzyme/inhibitor balances.
