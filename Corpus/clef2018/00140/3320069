Hydatid cyst of the pancreas. Apropos of 3 cases. Hydatid cyst of the pancreas is rare since it accounts for less than 1% of the various sites of hydatid disease even in those countries where the latter is endemic. The diagnosis is rarely made before surgery but is currently facilitated by ultrasonography and CAT scan. The authors report 3 cases, including one with a cyst ruptured into the peritoneal cavity.
