Value of contrast-enhanced computerized tomography in the early diagnosis and prognosis of acute pancreatitis. A prospective study of 202 patients. Two hundred two patients admitted with the clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis underwent computerized tomography scanning within 36 hours of admission. The diagnostic value of the computerized tomography findings was excellent, with a sensitivity of 92 percent and a specificity of 100 percent. One hundred seventy-six patients with acute pancreatitis defined according to the overall clinical course were included in the prognostic study. The pancreatitis was fatal in 21 patients, severe in 47 patients, and mild in 108 patients. The computerized tomography findings were classified into the following three groups on the basis of the extent of phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread: Group I, no phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread (100 patients, none died) Group II, phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread in one or two areas (28 patients, mortality rate 4 percent)
