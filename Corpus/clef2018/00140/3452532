Cystadenoma of the pancreas. Cystadenoma of the pancreas is a rare tumor, which usually occurs in young women. In this paper, 8 patients are reported. The common clinical symptom was upper abdominal mass or discomfort. The tumor was located by ultrasonography and CT scan. Impression and displacement of the duodenum and stomach were showed by barium meal examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Macroscopically, the tumor was encapsulated. Its section showed cystic and multilocular structures. Microscopically, the tumor cells were in papillary arrangement. Six of these 8 patients were misdiagnosed as pseudocyst of the pancreas and cystojejunostomy was performed. Three of 6 underwent malignant change, which was finally diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. This tumor, even after malignant change, is prone to local invasion and less likely towards distant metastasis. Resection, including pancreatoduodenectomy, is the best treatment.
