Extrapancreatic spread of acute pancreatitis: new observations with real-time US. Real-time ultrasonography (US) was compared with abdominal computed tomography (CT) in 40 patients with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis. Emphasis was placed on the ability of US to disclose peripancreatic involvement of the anterior pararenal spaces, lesser sac, and transverse mesocolon. When a realtime US scanning technique emphasizing semierect patient positioning and coronal views was used, 20 of 26 lesions in the anterior pararenal space (77%) and 14 of 14 abnormalities in the lesser sac (100%) were visualized. Abnormalities in the transverse mesocolon, however, were poorly detected on US scans. Ten patients (25%) in the study had extrapancreatic abnormalities missed by US. CT remains the imaging method of choice in patients with clinically moderate to severe pancreatitis. In patients with mild pancreatitis, the real-time US technique we describe improved extra-pancreatic visualization compared with previous studies using static scanners. A new US observation of perivascular spread of acute pancreatitis around the splenic and portal veins is described.
