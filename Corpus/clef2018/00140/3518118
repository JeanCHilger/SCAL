Spot percutaneous biopsy of the pancreas monitored by computer tomography and ultrasonic examination. The authors analyse the results of the use of modern methods of morphological verification of a diagnosis in 23 patients with different diseases of the pancreas. The patients were subjected to 26 spot transcutaneous biopsies verified by computer-aided tomography or ultrasonic exploration. The morphological diagnosis was verified in 20 out of the 23 examinees (87%). Three patients with pseudocysts received curative manipulations under the control of computer-aided tomography and ultrasonic exploration, sanitation and sclerosing of the pathological cavities.
