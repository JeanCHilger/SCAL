Diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. The diagnosis of small pancreatic carcinoma is difficult since specific tumor marker is not currently available. Diagnostic modalities are used to evaluate patients in whom pancreatic carcinoma is clinically suspected. US is frequently used as a screening procedure. Should this be abnormal, a lesion is confirmed by CT. If not ERCP is indicated. If ERCP reveals an abnormality, angiography is performed to determine whether the lesion is benign or malignant. Between 1972 and 1984, 150 pancreatic carcinomas have been diagnosed. Thirty-nine tumors were less than 3 cm, and the smallest lesion measured 9 mm. Four-year survival rate of small resectable tumors is 40%.
