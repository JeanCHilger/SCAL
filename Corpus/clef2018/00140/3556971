Pancreatic lesions and transfascial perirenal spread: computed tomographic demonstration. Computed tomographic (CT) findings in 105 cases of pancreatitis and 107 cases of pancreatic carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively to determine the occurrence and roentgenologic signs of penetration of the anterior renal fascial planes in relation to clinical symptoms. In pancreatitis, the perirenal fat was infiltrated in 7% to variable extents by extrapancreatic fluid collections, either as asymptomatic fluid lying alongside renal fascial planes and perirenal septa (5 cases) or as well-circumscribed fluid collections causing clinical symptoms (2 cases). In pancreatic carcinoma the occurrence of retropancreatic extension to a perirenal space was rarer (3%). Distinction on CT between perirenal involvement from the pancreas and primary adrenal or renal lesions with anterior spread can prevent unnecessary surgery.
