X-ray computed tomographic diagnosis of connective tissue tumors of the stomach of extrinsic development. Apropos of 6 cases. Computed tomography findings appear to be very useful for the diagnosis of exogastric tumors on the basis of six cases: 4 leiomyosarcomas, 1 leiomyoblastoma and 1 schwannoma. The diagnosis of these usually large tumors arising within the gastric wall is often difficult through baryum opacification of the stomach (U.G.I.) owing to their exogastric growth. In the same way, endoscopy usually fails to evidence these tumors. Computed tomography permits to rule out an extrinsic tumor such as a hepatic or pancreatic one for instance and then to demonstrate the tumor originates within the gastric wall. The hypervascular pattern associated in most cases with central necrosis is demonstrated through contrast medium injection, what is a very typical and relatively constant-finding in these tumors.
