Surgical significance of vascular changes in chronic pancreatitis. To establish a rational approach to the diagnosis and management of pancreatitis complicated by vascular abnormalities, the records of 50 patients who underwent angiography because of pancreatitis were reviewed. The findings included splenic vein thrombosis in 11 patients, splanchnic arterial anomaly or occlusion in ten patients and arterial pseudoaneurysm in six patients. Disease duration and presence of associated splenic vein thrombosis were the only two significant predictors of pseudoaneurysm. The presence of a pseudocyst was not predictive. Gastroesophageal varices, splenomegaly, associated arterial pseudoaneurysm and chronic pancreatic disease were significant predictors of splenic vein thrombosis. Dynamic bolus computed tomography was 100 per cent sensitive in detecting arterial pseudoaneurysm and 71 per cent in detecting splenic vein thrombosis. Eight patients with splenic vein thrombosis underwent splenectomy and the remaining three patients have been observed without splenectomy. Variceal bleeding has not occurred in either group. Five of the six patients with arterial pseudoaneurysm underwent aneurysmectomy without operative mortality. We conclude that arterial and venous complications of pancreatitis are associated with long duration of disease, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, varices and splenomegaly. Dynamic bolus computed tomography will detect vascular complications in these high risk patients. In patients with chronic pancreatitis in whom an operation is indicated, preoperative knowledge of vascular abnormalities may change the planned operative approach.
