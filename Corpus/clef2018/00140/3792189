Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas: a study of 61 cases. Eighty-six fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of pancreas from 74 patients were reviewed. Histological confirmation or clinical follow-up of the final diagnosis was available in 61 aspirates from 49 patients. Of 42 proven malignant cases, FNAs were diagnosed as positive in 21 (50%), suspicious in 4 (9.5%), negative in 12 (28.6%), and unsatisfactory in 5 (11.9%). Of 19 proven benign cases, FNAs were diagnosed as negative in 15 (78.9%) and unsatisfactory in 4 (21%). This resulted in a 50% sensitivity, a 100% specificity, a diagnostic efficiency of 59%, a predictive value of a positive test of 100%, and a predictive value of a negative test of 55.6%. Thirty-six primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas and six metastatic tumors to the pancreas were encountered. Benign cases were attributed to anatomical pancreatic variants, acute pancreatitis, abscess, chronic pancreatitis, and pseudocysts. Pancreatic FNA was safe, accurate, and relatively inexpensive, but it was relatively insensitive in the diagnosis of malignancy.
