Pancreatic abscess: predictive value of early abdominal CT. The value of a recently reported grading system of early abdominal computed tomography (CT) for predicting development of pancreatic abscess in patients with acute pancreatitis was reassessed. When the previously described CT grading system was used in another patient population, it did not demonstrate the same degree of prognostic value of baseline CT. In this series pancreatic abscess occurred in only eight of 29 patients (28%) with grade E CT scans (with grade E representing the most severe involvement), compared with 60% in the previous series. Of 44 patients with either grade D or E baseline CT scans, abscesses developed in only 30%, with a minimum clinical follow-up of 3 months. A second grading system, which used a semiquantitative analysis of the degree of peripancreatic inflammation (a "CT severity score"), also did not strongly correlate with the future risk of abscess, The authors conclude that early abdominal CT should be performed selectively in patients with acute pancreatitis and reserved for patients who are either diagnostic dilemmas or who fail to respond to supportive treatment and have clinically suspected surgical complications such as pancreatic abscess.
