Groove pancreatitis--its pathological anatomy and sonographic findings. Groove pancreatitis is a special type of segmental pancreatitis. Its morphological aspects with participation of the peripheral dorsal and cranial parts of the pancreatic head, the pancreatic soft tissue, and the duodenal wall with frequent narrowing of the distal common bile duct and suprapapillar stenosis of the duodenum can be detected by means of sonography. If this type of seqmental pancreatitis is known, the suspicion of a carcinoma of the pancreatic head can be removed.
