Comparison of ultrasound pancreatic scanning and encoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms: a retrospective study. In a retrospective study comparing ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms (ERCP) of the pancreas we found ultrasound 93.8% accurate and ERCP 62.5% accurate in detecting pancreatic pathology. Thus, sonography provides a safe screening procedure and ERCP provides a complementary approach.
