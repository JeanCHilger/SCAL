Surface coil MR imaging of abdominal viscera. Part III. The pancreas. Eight healthy volunteers and 11 patients with pancreatic abnormalities were studied using a conventional body coil and a prototype magnetic resonance (MR) surface coil. Final pathologic diagnoses included carcinoma of the head (six), body (one), and tail of the pancreas (two) and chronic pancreatitis (two). In surface coil images of the volunteers, the body and tail of the pancreas was visualized in all cases but one, and the pancreatic duct was seen in five of eight cases. In-plane spatial resolution of 0.9 X 0.9 mm and 5-mm section thickness was obtained. At the same time, pancreatic surface coil images had a twofold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with body coil images. T1-weighted spin-echo images gave greater SNR, reduced motion artifacts, provided superior anatomic detail, and offered more diagnostic information than comparable T2-weighted images. Significant abnormalities detected only by surface coil imaging included a small tumor surrounded by reactive edema and periglandular tumor invasion. This study demonstrates that surface coil imaging of the pancreas not only is feasible but provides an improved method for examining the pancreas by MR.
