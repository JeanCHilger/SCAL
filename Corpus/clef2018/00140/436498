Spontaneous resolution of mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. We report the findings in a 39-year-old man with alcoholic pancreatitis and a lower posterior mediastinal mass. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatographic and ultrasonographic studies permitted an unequivocal diagnosis of mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. The pseudocyst resolved spontaneously five weeks after diagnosis, without specific therapy.
