Retroperitoneal tumors. Tactics, technics and surgical results. Out of 33 cases of retroperitoneal tumours (TRP), collected throughout 11 years (1970-1981), 8 (24%) resulted benign, 25 (76%) malignant. Liposarcoma resulted the most frequent tumour. In 11 of the 25 cases of malignant TRP (44%), a radical removal of the tumour was performed in 8 (32%), a palliative demolition, and in the remaining 6 (24%) a simple diagnostic laparotomy. In 10 of the 19 demolitive operations (53%) the removal was extended to contiguous organs: kidney, adrenal glands, colon, pancreas, spleen, bladder, stomach. The postoperative mortality was 6%. The cases of recurrence after operations considered radical were 5 (45%). Out of the 8 patients suffering from benign neoformations, 7 underwent simple removal, and result recovered. The global survival for malignant TRP was 20% after 5 years and 8% after 10 years
