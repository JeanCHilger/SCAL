Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. We studied 47 operated cases of the pancreatic cancers as for initial symptom, chief complaint, biochemical and immunological tests, and various imaging modalities. Especially analysing the diagnostic ability and limitation of the imaging techniques for the early detection of the pancreatic cancer, we needed the selection of the high risk patients- elevated hepatobiliary enzyme, abnormal serum and urinary amylase, D.M. & abnormal G.T.T., compression effect of the G.I.S., and dilatation of the main pancreatic and bile duct by U.S.. Then ERCP should be done for these selected patients, because ERCP is now the most reliable aid for detection. Angiography and C.T. (especially dynamic CT) were significant for the decision of the resectability.
