Diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma using dynamic computed tomography (serial CT). Dynamic (serial) computed tomography was carried out in 16 patients with pancreatic tumours. In 11 patients, dynamic CT showed decreased enhancement of the tumour compared with normal pancreatic parenchyma, so that the hypodense tumour could be delineated from the surrounding parenchyma. The increased density gradient lead to visualisation of the tumour.
