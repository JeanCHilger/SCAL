Multiple pancreatic pseudocyst disease. In an effort to determine the incidence of multiple pseudocyst disease and establish the optimal approach to this problem, the records of 91 consecutive patients diagnosed during a 36-month period as having pancreatic pseudocyst disease by sonography or computerized tomographic scanning were reviewed. Thirteen patients (14.3%) had multiple cysts all received sonograms and six had CT scans. The combined false negative and false positive rate with sonography was 9%. Spontaneous resolution occurred involving five cysts (18%) up to 6.5 cm in size. The diagnosis of cyst multiplicity was confirmed at operation in seven cases
