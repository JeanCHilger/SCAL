Instrumental diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. The purpose of this review is to examine the diagnostic value of traditional and modern morphological examinations in various pancreatopathies, on the basis of a critical evaluation of the features, indications and limitations of each system. The multiplicity of techniques available today often creates a problem of choice. For this reason an attempt has been made to establish valid criteria for a more rational allocation of each system in the diagnosis of individual pancreatic diseases. Finally some blueprints for diagnostic methodology are proposed in respect of each pancreopathy, though it is emphasised that the sequence of tests laid down should always be guided by the dominant factors in the clinical picture.
