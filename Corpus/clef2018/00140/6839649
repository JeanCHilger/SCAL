The diagnostic impact of computed tomography in blunt abdominal trauma. Sixty patients with blunt abdominal trauma were investigated by computed tomography, 21 within 48 h of injury, 39 within days and weeks. Organ laceration of the spleen, liver, pancreas and kidney and haematoma formation were comprehensively demonstrated and post-operative complications readily identified. Computed tomography is currently the radiological method of choice to evaluate injuries to abdominal organs.
