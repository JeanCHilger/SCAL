CT demonstration of an ectopic pancreatic tail causing a renal pseudotumor. Renal pseudotumors may be intrinsic or extrinsic to the renal parenchyma. A case in which an ectopic position of the pancreatic tail simulated a solid left renal mass on nephrotomography and ultrasonography is presented. Computed tomography was important in confirming the etiology of the mass.
