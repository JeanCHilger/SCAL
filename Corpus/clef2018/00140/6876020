Intrahepatic localization of a pancreatic pseudocyst. Intrahepatic false cysts of the pancreas are rarely observed, and only 5 cases have been reported in the published literature since 1965. Recent publications concerning false cysts located adjacent to or within abdominal parenchymas are reviewed. The most common sites are renal and splenic. Radiologic images usually simulate an intravisceral tumoral lesion, even when the false cyst is in contact only with the parenchyma, because of inflammatory changes. Diagnosis depends on complete radiographic exploration of the pancreas, including ultrasonography, a CT scan, and coeliomesenteric arteriography if possible, to detect possible signs of pancreatitis. Ultrasound guided cyst puncture is of marked diagnostic and possible therapeutic value.
