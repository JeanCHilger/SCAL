Computed tomography of the normal and abnormal pancreatic duct: correlation with pancreatic ductography. Eighty-seven patients underwent both pancreatic computed tomography (CT) and pancreatic ductography. Measurements of pancreatic ducts identified by CT correlated well with measurements from pancreatic ductograms. The anatomic relationships of the pancreatic duct to the margins of the pancreas, and the pancreatic and common bile ducts at their junction were clarified. In 86% of both normal and abnormal ducts at least a part of the duct was identified when optimal CT technique was used. Pancreatic CT is particularly helpful in identifying abnormalities proximal to duct obstruction. CT identification of an abnormal pancreatic duct is a sensitive indicator of pancreatic disease.
