Liquefactive necrosis of the pancreas: the pancreatic sac. The authors describe an unusual form of pancreatic necrosis in which the excavated necrotic core is surrounded by a shell of tissue and forms a sac which generally conforms to the axis and contour of the pancreas. This debris-containing sac could be misinterpreted on ultrasound and CT and is best defined by direct injection into the pancreatic duct.
