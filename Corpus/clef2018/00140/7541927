Laparoscopic staging of gastrointestinal tumors. Laparoscopic staging was carried out in 28 cases with carcinomas of the distal esophagus, cardia, stomach or pancreas. The intention was first to rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and secondly to see, whether RO-resection would be possible, mainly for the reason of therapeutic splitting. The diagnostic accuracy can be raised to 95% using laparoscopic ultrasound, exploration of the lesser sac of the peritoneum and tissue sampling in combination with preoperative endoscopy and radiography. In 39.3% of the investigated patients the staging must be corrected after laparoscopic staging compared with the preoperative findings. 35.7% of the patients did not need explorative laparotomy.
