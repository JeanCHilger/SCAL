Clinical importance of liver and pancreas scintigraphy. The value of liver scanning is evaluated by comparison with computerised tomography and sonographic examination. For differential diagnosis of hepatic and posthepatic ikterus in patients with elevated serum bilirubin levels hepatobiliary scanning with 131 J-Rose Bengal or 131 J-Bromsulphan, is recommended. Pancreatic 75-Se-Methionin scanning, is of limited diagnostic value.
