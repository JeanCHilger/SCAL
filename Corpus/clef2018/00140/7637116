Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm: a case report and review of the literature. A case of true pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysm is reported. A calcified lesion was initially detected by plain x-ray films, and an essential diagnosis was made before operation by intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA). Surgical resection of the aneurysm was performed successfully. Additionally, we reviewed a total of 82 cases with PDA aneurysm out of the 88 cases that had been reported in the English-language literature up to 1993. Fifty-three cases were accompanied by aneurysmal rupture (rupture group), and 29, including our case, were without rupture (nonrupture group). Because of the high mortality rate (49.1%) in the rupture group, a precise diagnosis and adequate treatment of PDA aneurysm before rupture is important. In the nonrupture group, a calcification on radiography appeared in 61.6% of the cases in which aneurysms were not found incidentally this seems to be a significant indication for angiography. Moreover, intravenous digital subtraction angiography is quite useful for the screening of PDA aneurysm because it is an easy and noninvasive examination.
