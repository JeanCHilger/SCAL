The efficacy of early ERCP in pediatric pancreatic trauma. Recognition of pancreatic injuries is frequently delayed, and optimal treatment is often controversial. The use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has allowed accurate delineation of pancreatic ductal injuries however, the small size of children and the concern with inducing pancreatitis and/or lesser sac contamination have limited its use in children. In 1988, the authors began using ERCP for selected pancreatic injuries. This report describes their experience with this technique and examines the role of ERCP in pediatric pancreatic injuries. Six children with pancreatic transections resulting from blunt trauma were treated between 1988 and 1993. The age range was 2 1/2 to 8 years, and the weight range was 13.6 to 27.9 kg. The average period from injury to referral to the hospital was 14 days (range, 2 to 30 days). All six children presented with chemical evidence of pancreatitis and had an initial computed tomography (CT) scan
