Hydatid cyst in the head of the pancreas with obstructive jaundice. We report a rare case of obstructive jaundice caused by an intrapancreatic hydatid cyst in a 17-year-old black girl. Ultrasonography and computed tomography demonstrated the obstructing cyst in the head of the pancreas. Cyst aspiration produced clear fluid with a low amylase content and no hydatid hooklets or protoscolices. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed for a presumed cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, but histology showed the true diagnosis. Pancreatic hydatidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of obstructing pancreatic cysts in the appropriate epidemiological setting.
