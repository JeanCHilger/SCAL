Static and dynamic MR tomography of the pancreas: contrast media kinetics of the normal pancreatic parenchyma in pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis. We aimed both at improving image quality and diagnostic value of pancreatic MRI by using fast multislice imaging techniques and at demonstrating normal and pathologic signal enhancement in the pancreas after i.v. gadopentate-dimeglumine.MR imaging at was performed in 30 patients with suspicion of pancreatic neoplasm or chronic disease and in 15 patients without pancreatic abnormalities.SNR, CNR, mean signal enhancement, and time/signal-intensity curves were calculated. Signal enhancement after i.v. Gd-DTPA averaged 34.4% in neoplasms (n = 14) vs 58.8% in pancreatic tissue not involved by tumour (p < 0.05) in T1-w SE and was also significant in the T1-w GE sequence (p < 0.005). CNR (pancreas vs lesion) and SNR improved significantly (p < 0.005 pancreas: p < 0.001MR imaging with fast T2-w SE and T1-w SE sequences provides excellent visualisation of the pancreas and adequate conspicuity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Following i.v. Gd-DTPA significant enhancement of tumour/parenchyma contrast is found.
