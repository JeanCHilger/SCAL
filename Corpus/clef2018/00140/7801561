Ultrasonic and computerized tomographic examinations in the diagnosis of suppurative-inflammatory diseases of organs of the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space. Comprehensive ultrasonic and x-ray computer-aided tomographic (RCAT) examinations were carried out in 97 patients with 120 pyo-inflammatory foci in the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space. On the whole the sensitivity of ultrasonic examinations was 68%, that of RCAT 88%. RCAT was superior to ultrasonic examinations in the diagnosis of extra-organic (inter-intestinal, subdiaphragm, etc.) involvement, pancreonecrosis, and splenic abscesses. The advantages of this method were not so evident in the detection of liver and kidney abscesses and of gauze postoperative foreign bodies. Potentialities of an ultrasonic method were somewhat superior in localization of a pathologic focus in the pancreas in differentiation from a common cyst. Ultrasonic examinations should be widely used as a primary method and should to a certain measure determine the necessity of RCAT use in the diagnosis of pyo-inflammatory diseases of the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal space organs.
