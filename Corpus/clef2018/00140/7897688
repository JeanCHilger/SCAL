Ruptured pancreaticoduodenal arterial aneurysms: diagnosis and treatment by angiographic intervention. This article describes a 54-year-old patient who presented with a long history of epigastric pain. Laboratory values revealed a decreased red blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and positive stool hemoccult test. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal hematomas. Emergency laparotomy was performed, but a bleeding source was not evident. Superselective angiography demonstrated bleeding aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal artery. Coil embolization with angiography guidance was successful in arresting the bleeding sites.
