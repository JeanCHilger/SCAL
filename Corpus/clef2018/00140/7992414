Preoperative laparoscopic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer. Nineteen consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or pancreas, in whom preoperative ultrasonography and computed tomography were unable to assess the possibility of surgical resection, had a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. In 16 cases the operability could be established from the findings at laparoscopy. All laparoscopies were carried out without major morbidity and with a short postoperative hospital stay. It is concluded that patients belonging to this category should have a diagnostic laparoscopy performed in order to avoid futile laparotomies, which in cases that are unsuitable for surgical treatment are associated with emotional stress, physical morbidity and a prolonged hospital stay.
