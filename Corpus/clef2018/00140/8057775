Asymptomatic annular pancreas: detection by magnetic resonance imaging. We report the features of annular pancreas on magnetic resonance imaging in an asymptomatic adult. Fat suppressed T1-weighted imaging sequence demonstrated normal appearing pancreatic tissue encircling the duodenum, and depicted an aberrant ventral pancreatic duct.
