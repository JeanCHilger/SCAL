Ectopic pancreas with gastric localization: a clinical case and review of the literature. Heterotopic pancreatic tissue localized in the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract rarely presents with symptoms unless it is complicated by bleeding or mucosal ulceration. The case of a 26 year old man who presented with a one year history of epigastric pain, dyspepsia and several episodes of vomiting, without signs of bleeding or ulceration is reported. Work-up, which included upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound and UGI series, revealed an intramural mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach, with normal overlying mucosa. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion and histologic examination showed normal pancreatic tissue. Postoperatively the patient did well with marked clinical improvement. In reviewing the literature on aberrant pancreatic lesions of the stomach the Authors discuss the varying clinical presentation and differential diagnosis as well as treatment options: when the lesions present with disabling symptoms, surgical excision should always be performed.
