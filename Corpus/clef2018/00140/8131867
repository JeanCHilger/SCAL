Aspirative cytology with fine-needle in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and pelvic cavity: a seven year experience of the Portuguese Institute of Oncology, Center of Porto. A review was made of 236 fine-needle aspiration cytologies (FNAC), guided by ultrasound, computerized tomography or fluoroscopy, performed in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and pelvic cavity. Seventy-three FNAC were from the liver, 41 from the kidneys, 30 from the pelvic cavity, 26 from the retroperitoneum, 24 from the peritoneal cavity, 13 from the pancreas, 11 from the adrenal glands, nine from the abdominal wall, seven from the spleen and two from the digestive tract. The total accuracy rate was 90%, ranging from 77% in the abdominal wall lesions to 100% in the splenic lesions. Indications for FNAC and results are discussed as well as the accuracy rate obtained with different guiding modalities. We conclude considering FNAC a safe, unexpensive and reliable method to confirm the diagnosis of malignant lesions in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and pelvic cavity.
