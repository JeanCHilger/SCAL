Long-term results of the surgical management of chronic pancreatitis. To investigate the long-term results of surgical management of chronic pancreatitis, we reviewed the hospital records of 50 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for chronic pancreatitis between 1975 and 1985. The principal indications for surgery were abdominal pain (100%), pseudocyst (24%), and biliary obstruction (42%). Surgeries included pancreatic duct drainage (56%), distal pancreatic resection (20%), and drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst (24%). Follow-up averaged 5.2 years (range 5 to 11 years). Reoperation was required in 31 patients during the extended follow-up period. Principal indications for reoperation were abdominal pain (93%), recurrent pancreatic pseudocyst (32%), and uncertainty of the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (26%). Subsequent operations included cholecystectomy (35%), pseudocyst drainage (32%), splanchnicectomy (16%), and pancreatic biopsy (16%) and eliminated abdominal pain in 24 patients (83%). The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis was not revised in any case. At most recent follow-up, 30 patients (60%) were well and without abdominal pain, 12 (24%) experienced intermittent abdominal pain, and one (2%) had continued abdominal pain that required narcotics. Five patients (10%) died of other causes, and two (4%) were lost to follow-up. We conclude that pain, the principal symptom of chronic pancreatitis, can be eliminated or reduced in the majority of patients by appropriate surgical therapy.
