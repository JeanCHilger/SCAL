Dilatation of the common bile duct: what does endoscopic sonography contribute?. In a prospective study 20 patients (14 women, 6 men mean age 62 [31-81] years) with extrahepatic obstructive jaundice (n = 15) or common bile duct dilatation (CBD) without cholestasis (n = 5) were investigated by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). All these patients underwent negative transabdominal ultrasonography (US) (n = 20) and computed tomography (CT) (n = 16). Inclusion criterion was a dilatation of the CBD of > 7 mm or > 10 mm in patients with previous cholecystectomy. The definitive diagnosis of a tumor (n = 8), choledocholithiasis (n = 7), stone migration (n = 1), choledochocele (n = 2) or slight dilatation of the CBD without obstruction (n = 2) was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (n = 13), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) (n = 2), intraoperative cholangiography (n = 1) and follow up (n = 4
