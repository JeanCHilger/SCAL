Juxtapapillary intraduodenal lipoma as a rare cause of jaundice and acute pancreatitis. A 52-year-old man was admitted to hospital with acute pancreatitis and jaundice. The patient's medical history showed a case of hospitalization due to acute pancreatitis about three years before. Diagnostic examinations (abdomen sonography, CT, contrast medium radiography of the small intestine, ERCP) revealed a juxtapapillary lipoma, approximately 1 by 6 cm, obstructing the papilla Vateri. After the examinations had been completed and the pancreatitis had largely eased off, the lipoma was removed by transduodenal surgery. There were no postoperative complications.
