Clinical and etiologic study of 90 cases of chronic diarrhea. 90 patients with chronic diarrhoea underwent this prospective study. They were seen in a private hospital of Lima during 1990 and 1991. According to a methodologic plan for determining sources and the diseases that originate chronic diarrhoea. In all patients hematologic, bioquimic, coprocultures, coproparasitologic exams were done, chest and intestinal transit X-rays. All underwent duodenal content culture. Colon X-ray in 25 cases proctosigmoidoscopy in 14 and upper digestive endoscopy in 19 patients. Abdominal echography in 12 and TAC in 2 cases. The final results showed as determinant diseases for chronic diarrhoea, according to their frequency: enteroparasitosis (23.3%), functional digestive disorders (20.0%), intestinal bacterial overpopulation (15.5%) of unknown origin (8.8%), colon diverticulus (7.7%) proven and probably (5.5%), lactose intolerance (3.3%), diabetes mellitus (2.2%), and in one case (1.1%) the following: intestinal linfoma, pancreas malignancy, AIDS, colonic and deformation and megaloblastic anemia. The causes of chronic diarrhoea are several and multifactorals and in this study we prove the preeminence of the intestinal parasitosis, functional disorders and intestinal bacterial overpopulation and with less frequency other pathologies.
