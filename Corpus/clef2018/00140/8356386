Laparoscopy/thoracoscopy for staging: I. Staging endoscopy in surgical oncology. The application of laparoscopy to the staging of solid abdominal tumors is reviewed. The current evidence support the use of laparoscopy particularly in hepatic tumors. There is evidence that the hospital length of stay for a patient with a nonresectable hepatic tumor can be reduced from 5.6 +/- 0.4 days with a laparotomy to 1.5 +/- 0.3 days with a laparoscopy. Where the palliative and bypass issues are not limiting, cases of pancreatic and gastric carcinoma also appear to benefit in having a staging laparoscopy before a formal laparotomy for resection. Current instrumentation does produce limits, but with future prospects of laparoscopic ultrasound, and tumor staining, staging laparoscopy will become an important diagnostic tool in surgical oncology.
