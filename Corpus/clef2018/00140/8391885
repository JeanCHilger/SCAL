Multifocal intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: report of a case. This paper describes a case of a mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas, histologically diagnosed as multifocal intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma. The patient had a markedly dilated main pancreatic duct, detected by ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT), and endoscopy showed a papillary tumor projecting from the patulous orifice of the enlarged papilla of Vater. Several biopsies taken from the tumor indicated a diagnosis of papillary adenocarcinoma. Total pancreatectomy was thus performed, revealing a multifocal papillary tumor growing along the main duct in the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Microscopically, these multiple tumors were found to be mucin-producing papillary adenocarcinoma of the main and subsidiary pancreatic ducts with nodular and microfocal periductal invasion. The surgical treatment of multifocal tumors, may therefore necessitate total pancreatectomy to achieve curative resection, in some cases.
