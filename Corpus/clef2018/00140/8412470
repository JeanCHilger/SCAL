Duodenal duplication cyst--a rare cause of acute recurrent pancreatitis. We report on a 42-year-old male patient who has been treated over a period of five years because of acute relapsing pancreatitis. The diagnoses of viral pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, and choledochal cyst type III (choledochocele) have been erroneously made. The clinical and laboratory findings over this period are presented, compared with one another, and analyzed. The correct diagnosis of a duodenal duplication cyst filled with multiple calculi and lying within the lumen of the duodenum could not be established until intraoperative findings and histological examinations were completed. The pathogenesis of relapsing acute pancreatitis associated with duodenal duplication cyst filled with multiple calculi is proposed, based on the analysis of these findings and the literature review.
