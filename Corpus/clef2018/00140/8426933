Image quality in dynamic CT: a clinical discussion. Modern state-of-the-art computed tomographic (CT) scanners emphasize three capabilities: image quality, dynamic scan capability, and a high-resolution thin-section technique. Image quality is fundamental and dependent on optimum performance and the interrelationship of all system components. Variables that affect the performance of the scanner include x-ray tube output and rate of heat dissipation quantum detection efficiency
