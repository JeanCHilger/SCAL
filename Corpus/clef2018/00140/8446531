Extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction can often be diagnosed by means of thorough history taking, physical examination, and basic laboratory data. The cause of obstruction can be best defined and is often best treated by biliary endoscopy and/or percutaneous radiologic techniques, which appear to be safer than surgical decompression.
