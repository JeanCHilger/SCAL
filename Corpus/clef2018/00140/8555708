Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 presenting as insulinoma, gastrinoma, and postbulbar duodenal ulcers: report of a case. We report herein the unusual case of a 55-year-old man with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 presenting as hyperparathyroidism, hyperpituitarism, insulinoma, and gastrinoma with postbulbar duodenal ulcers. The patient was referred to our hospital for further investigations of nephrolithiasis, acromegaly, and hematemesis. Laboratory studies showed high serum levels of calcium, parathyroid hormone, growth hormone, insulin, gastrin, and prolactin. Computed tomography of the cranial cavity demonstrated an enlargement of the serra turcica and swelling of two parathyroid glands in the neck. Computed tomography and angiography of the abdomen also showed a mass in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopy demonstrated reflux esophagitis, erosive gastritis, and multiple postbulbar duodenal ulcers. We diagnosed this patient as having multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, with concomitant lesions of the pituitary gland, parathyroid glands, and islet cells of the pancreas. Following excision of the two enlarged parathyroid glands, his serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels fell to within the normal range. Thereafter, a total gastrectomy was performed to alleviate the frequent bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, resection of the pancreatic mass could not be performed owing to severe inflammation around the duodenum, probably induced by the postbulbar duodenal ulcers.
