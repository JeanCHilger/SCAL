3DFT-flash MR imaging of pancreatic cancer with gadopentetate dimeglumine. We evaluated the usefulness of dynamic 3-dimensional Fourier transformation (3DFT) fast low angle shot (FLASH) MR imaging using gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) to assess the extent of pancreatic cancer.Breath-hold 3DFT-FLASH MR images (20/4 25 degrees flip angleDynamic MR images could delineate the pancreatic tumors more clearly than the conventional SE images, and were useful for diagnosing vessel invasion. The contrast-to-noise ratio between the pancreatic cancer and the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma was significantly higher with the dynamic 3DFT-FLASH image than with the conventional SE images (p<0.01).Dynamic 3DFT-FLASH MR imaging with Gd-DTPA is useful in delineating and evaluating the extent of pancreatic cancer.
