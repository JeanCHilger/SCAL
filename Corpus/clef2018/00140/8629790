Evaluation of pancreatic injury after blunt abdominal trauma. Pancreatic injury after blunt abdominal trauma can be subtle and delayed in its onset. We present a 24-year-old man who became jaundiced 16 days after he experienced blunt trauma. He was found to have an isolated pancreatic contusion. We discuss the initial evaluation for blunt pancreatic injury, the differential diagnosis of jaundice resulting from the trauma, and, finally, three methods of treating pancreatic contusions that cause jaundice.
