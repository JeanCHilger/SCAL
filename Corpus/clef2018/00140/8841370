Surgical management and treatment of pancreatic fistulas. Pancreatic fistulas most commonly derive as complications of elective surgical procedures on the pancreas and as sequelae of pancreatitis or pancreatic trauma. The majority of external pancreatic fistulas can be managed nonoperatively, with an expected rate of closure exceeding 80%. Internal fistulas are somewhat less likely to close with conservative measures alone. Octreotide has been shown to significantly reduce fistula output and to hasten the closure of both internal and external pancreatic fistulas without affecting the overall rates of closure. Operative therapy is reserved for the treatment of fistulas that do not respond to conservative medical management. In randomized prospective trials, prophylactic octreotide has been shown to reduce the morbidity of elective pancreatic resections with respect to overall complication and fistula formation rates. Surgical experience and technique appear to be the most important factors in determining the overall complication rates following elective pancreatic surgery.
