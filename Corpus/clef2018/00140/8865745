A case of Lemmel's syndrome caused by a large diverticular enterolith at the peripapillary portion of the duodenum. A 93-year-old woman admitted because of epigastralgia. Cholelithiasis, obstructive jaundice, acute suppurative cholangitis and acute pancreatitis were diagnosed on blood chemistry and ultrasonography on admission. We performed emergency PTCD. A calculus 4 cm in diameter was detected at the papilla of Vater and marked dilatation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. ESWL was performed because of her age and because endoscopical operation seemed to be difficult. After lithotripsy, PTC and endoscopy demonstrated a diverticulum at the peripapillary portion of the duodenum. Based on analysis of PTC result before and after ESWL, we diagnosed this case as Lemmel's syndrome (obstructive jaundice, acute suppurative cholangitis and acute pancreatitis) caused by a large diverticular enterolith at the peripapillary portion of the duodenum. ESWL treatment of aged patient with an enterolith is safe.
