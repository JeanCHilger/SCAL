Preoperative assessment of blood vessel involvement in patients with pancreatic cancer. The major prerequisite for resection of a pancreatic tumor is non-involvement of large blood vessels. Preoperative assessment of blood vessel infiltration may prevent unnecessary surgery. The aim of our study was to investigate the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and in preoperative staging. Thirteen patients (7 females, 6 males mean age 64 years) with a pancreatic tumor, but no evidence of distant metastases, underwent EUS and computerized tomography (CT) in order to assess blood vessel involvement by the tumor. The results were compared with intraoperative findings in 12 patients and with postmortem findings in 1 patient. A tumor was demonstrated by EUS in 12 patients and was confirmed at surgery in all 12 patients. In one patient no tumor was demonstrated by EUS, although a tumor was visible by CT
