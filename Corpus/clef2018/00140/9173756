Monstrous recurrence of serous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a rare benign tumor. The diagnostical management is easy, preoperative histological finding is difficult. The surgical relevance is revealed by the fact, that this tumor shows a high recurrence rate, especially if a complete resection is not feasible because of a difficult tumor localisation. The whole problematic nature of this disease is underlined by the following case report, which illustrates that in 5 years 4 surgical interventions because of recurrent symptoms were necessary. Each single operation improved quality of life for a different time period. First aim must be the radical resection of the tumor during primary operation, but this is not always possible because of unfavorable tumor localisation.
