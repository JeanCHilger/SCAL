Early computed tomography is rarely necessary in gallstone pancreatitis. The role of early CT scanning in acute gallstone pancreatitis remains ill defined. The purpose of our study was to: 1) determine whether our previously identified admission prognostic factors for gallstone pancreatitis [white blood cell (WBC) count > or = 14.5 x 10(9)/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > or = 12 mmol/L, Acute and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > or = 5, glucose > or = 150 mg/dL, and heart rate > or = 100 beats/min)] correlate with the severity of pancreatic inflammation on CT scan, and 2) to determine the utility of early CT scanning in the management of gallstone pancreatitis. Admission clinical and laboratory variables were collected prospectively. Early CT scan findings were graded using the Balthazar scoring system and subgrouped into mild-moderate (Balthazar grades A-C) or severe (grades D and E) by a radiologist blinded to the patients' clinical status. Ninety-seven patients underwent surgery during their initial hospitalization without preoperative CT scanning. Four had operative complications (4%). Forty-two patients underwent early CT scan (grade A, 19% B, 5%
