Management decisions for unusual periampullary tumors. The pessimism associated with the treatment of pancreatic cancer may result in inappropriate management in certain patients thought to have that disease. We analyzed the recent UCLA experience with a variety of periampullary tumors in which various issues concerning management were unusual. The records of nine patients (age 15-75 years) with pancreatic or periampullary tumors were reviewed retrospectively. The tumor was evident on CT scan in all patients. The diameter of the mass was greater than 5 cm in five cases. Eight of the tumors appeared to arise from the pancreas, but at exploration, two were found to originate from other structures (duodenum and retroperitoneum). One patient with an apparent gastric lesion on CT scan was found to have a mass of pancreatic origin at operation. Operative procedures included: pancreaticoduodenectomy (four), distal pancreatectomy (three), total pancreatectomy (one), and retroperitoneal tumor resection (one). Pathological diagnoses included: solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm (two), mucinous cystic neoplasm (two), serous microcystic adenoma (two), myositis ossificans (one), degenerative neurilemoma (one), spindle cell tumor (one), and intraductal papillary carcinoma (one). We conclude that patients with large or unusual-appearing pancreatic or periampullary tumors should be managed aggressively. Major resections can be done safely with the achievement of an excellent quality of life in individuals at the extremes of age. Unlike the usual pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the prognosis for many of these neoplasms is excellent.
