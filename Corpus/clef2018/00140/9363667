Ganglioneuroma of left adrenal gland in a patient with Turner syndrome during growth hormone therapy. We report on a Japanese girl with Turner syndrome (45,XO) who developed ganglioneuroma of the left adrenal gland during growth hormone (GH) therapy. She had received GH replacement therapy from the age of 6.8 years. At the age of 10.3 years, abdominal ultrasonography revealed a mass which occupied the upper area of her left kidney. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed a low density mass with a smooth surface located between the upper portion of the left renal vein and the pancreas. Microscopic examination resulted in a diagnosis of ganglioneuroma of the left adrenal gland. At present we cannot conclude that patients who have received GH replacement therapy are at higher risk for developing tumors compared to those without GH replacement therapy.
