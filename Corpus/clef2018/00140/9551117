Stereo display of MR angiograms. To provide methods for stereoscopic visual demonstration from 3D reconstructed MR angiographic images.Stereoscopic viewing can be obtained with pairs of images that are displayed at angles of 15 degrees. Optical devices as stereoscopic binoculars or minor stereoscopes facilitate stereoscopic viewing. The possibility of stereoscopic projections for a larger auditorium is mentioned.Using three clinical examples the advantages of stereoscopic display of MR angiograms are demonstrated.MR angiography allows stereoscopic viewing with simple methods, like CT- and conventional rotation angiography. This principle, which has been known for 100 years, may thus acquire a new significance.
