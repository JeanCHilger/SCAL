Acinar filling during secretin-stimulated MR pancreatography. The purpose of this study is to report a new sign, "acinar filling," observed on dynamic MR pancreatography after secretin stimulation in patients with suspected early chronic pancreatitis.Acinar filling might reflect tissue hypertension or loss of pancreatic parenchyma compliance or both. This finding is probably an insensitive but specific sign of early chronic pancreatitis.
