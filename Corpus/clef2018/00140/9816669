Multifocal hemangioblastoma in a young woman with Hippel-Lindau syndrome. A 25 years old female person suffered from v. Hippel-Lindau disease with three manifestations within the central nervous system (cerebellum, nerve root C1 and Medulla oblongata). Pancreatic cysts, a cyst and a tumour of the kidney were diagnosed as well. In a first operation, the large cerebella's tumour and the small haemangioblastoma of the nerve root C1 were removed via a suboccipital craniectomy. A few weeks later, after the patient had made a good recovery, the tumour at the craniocervical junction was removed through a far lateral approach. The postoperative course was without complications. The MRI control seven months after surgery was free of tumour and the young person was in a good clinical condition, without neurological deficit.
