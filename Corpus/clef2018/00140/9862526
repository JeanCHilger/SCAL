Splenic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma arising in heterotopic pancreatic tissue. A mucinous cystadenocarcinoma along with remnants of normal pancreatic tissue was discovered in the spleen of a 21-year-old woman. Extensive clinical, radiological, ultrasound and computed tomography investigation revealed that the patient's pancreas and ovaries were unremarkable. We presume an origin from heterotopic pancreatic tissue for this neoplasm and present a review of the literature in this regard.
