Aneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery. We report a case of gastroduodenal arterial aneurysm incidentally discovered by abdominal ultrasonogram, in which three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) was useful for diagnosis. An 85-year-old man was hospitalized because of fever and liver dysfunction. Carcinoma of the papilla of Vater was diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, while abdominal ultrasonogram and CT scan revealed a round mass measuring 6.2x4.1 cm on the ventral side of the pancreatic head. Three-dimensional CT demonstrated that the mass arose from a branch of the common hepatic artery and projected downward, indicating a gastroduodenal arterial aneurysm. During pancreatoduodenectomy and aneurysmectomy, it was confirmed that this aneurysm arose from the gastroduodenal artery.
