Papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. A sex-steroid dependent tumor. The rate of growth of a papillary-cystic tumor of the pancreas seemed to be enhanced by the concurrence of pregnancy. Progesterone receptors in the tumor were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and by molecular biology methods.Papillary cystic tumor of the pancreas is extremely rare, occurring predominantly young females. Owing to the low frequency of the tumor, there is scarce information about the conditions that promote tumor growth.In this report, we present the temporal association between very rapid growth of a papillary-cystic neoplasm and pregnancy. Clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular biology analyses were performed.A 21-yr-old woman was admitted because of recurrent epigastric abdominal pain associated with episodes of nausea and vomiting, and a history of an abdominal tumor of about 50 mm near the head of the pancreas, detected by ultrasound. On admission the patient had a flat, nontender abdomen without palpable masses. Laboratory analysis including hematologic and hepatic tests were strictly normal only CA 19-9 (42 U/mL, normal 37 U/mL) was above normal values. One week after admission, an abdominal computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan revealed an 81.6-mm cystic mass localized in the head of the pancreas, and 1 wk later, in a laparotomy, a papillary-cystic neoplasm of 120 mm, limited to the head of the pancreas, was found. Three months later, in a routine follow-up visit, an 18-wk pregnancy was clinically diagnosed and confirmed by ultrasound exploration. The pregnancy continued without complications, and a normal male infant (3.7 kg) was born at 39 wk of gestation, by vaginal delivery. Eighteen months after tumor resection, the patient was asymptomatic and her child was in good health. We propose that progesterone affects tumor growth.
