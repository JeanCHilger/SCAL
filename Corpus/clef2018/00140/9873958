Clinicopathologic differentiation of atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail aplasia. Congenital aplasia of the body and tail of the pancreas is derived from a defect of the dorsal pancreatic anlage and should not be considered a type of acquired atrophy of these structures.Congenital aplasia of the body and tail of the pancreas radiologically mimics acquired atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail.Two patients with radiologically identified aplasia of the body and tail of the pancreas were studied clinicopathologically.An 82-yr-old man was diagnosed radiologically as having both carcinoma of the head of the pancreas and aplasia of the body and tail of the pancreas and underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. Pathologically the carcinoma was distributed in the anterosuperior part of the head of the pancreas, and spread into the duct of Santorini and intraductally to a portion of the main pancreatic duct beyond the junction of the ducts of Santorini and Wirsung. Consequently, obstructive pancreatitis of the body and tail of the pancreas developed, resulting in marked atrophy that mimicked aplasia of the body and tail of the pancreas. A 74-yr-old woman was diagnosed radiologically as having two carcinomas, one of the gallbladder and one of the stomach, and aplasia of the body and tail of the pancreas. During surgery, suspected parenchymal disappearance and fatty replacement in the body and tail of the pancreas were noted. Histologic examination of biopsy specimens from the body portion revealed atrophic pancreatic tissue surrounded by fat. Therefore, these patients had atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail.
