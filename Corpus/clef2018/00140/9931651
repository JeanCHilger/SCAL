Pancreatic carcinoma--conclusions and prospects. Whereas no progress has been made in the diagnosis of early tumors, the staging of pancreatic cancer has improved, mainly through the introduction of ultrafast MRI, resulting in a higher resection rate. The early results of standard pancreatectomy are now excellent (operative mortality < 2.5%). The late results after R0 resections are improving (> 30% 5-year survival), but they are poor overall. So far, extended surgical techniques have not brought any improvement here. Unfortunately, so far adjuvant radiochemotherapy has not proved effective in a recent randomized controlled trial. Molecular and genetic research has deepened our understanding of the cancerogenesis of pancreatic cancer without leading to clinical consequences so far.
