Macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: CT and endosonographic features. Recently, the term "serous cystadenoma" has been adopted in the pathological community to qualify the so-called microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. This change in terminology was based on the emergence of a new type of serous cystadenoma of the pancreas, i.e., the macrocystic variant. We report one case of pathologically proven macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas for which the diagnosis of mucinous cystadenoma was suggested preoperatively. This rare but benign macrocystic variant exhibits radiological features similar to those of mucinous cystadenoma. In addition, inflammatory changes and foci of hemorrhage within the tumor may simulate mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.
