Ultrasonographic and MRI aspects of cystic duodenal dystrophy with aberrant pancreatic tissue. US and MR features (including MR cholangiopancreatography) of a cystic formation in a duodenal heterotopic pancreas are reported. To our knowledge, MR cholangiopancreatography of this uncommon condition has not been previously described. Imaging showed multiple cysts within a thickened duodenal wall. This thickness of the duodenal wall was related to a heterotopic pancreas with chronic pancreatitis.
