Diffusion coefficients in abdominal organs and hepatic lesions: evaluation with intravoxel incoherent motion echo-planar MR imaging. To determine the true diffusion coefficients of abdominal organs and hepatic lesions with intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) echo-planar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.Seventy-eight patients suspected of having hepatic lesions were examined with IVIM echo-planar MR imaging at 1.5 T. There were 77 hepatic masses (27 hepatocellular carcinomas, 10 metastatic tumors, eight hemangiomas, and 32 cysts) in the 78 patients. The true diffusion coefficient D and the perfusion fraction f were calculated and compared with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).Specific values of D were found for abdominal organs (liver, 0.72 x 10(-3) mm2/sec spleen, 0.80 x 10(-3) mm2/secPerfusion contributes to the ADCs of abdominal organs and hepatic lesions. The D and f values are useful for the characterization of hepatic lesions.
