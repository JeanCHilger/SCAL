Clinical evaluation of three-dimensional MR-cholangiopancreatography using three-dimensional Fourier transform fast asymmetric spin echo method (3DFT-FASE): usefulness of observation by multi-planar reconstruction. MR-cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new method that is non-invasive and permits volume data collection and three-dimensional expression. With the three-dimensional Fourier transform fast asymmetric spin echo (3DFT-FASE) method, a higher spatial resolution can be obtained both in-pain and in slice selecting direction. In this paper, the usefulness of this new technique is investigated in the clinical diagnosis of MIP images and MPR. The study was performed in 10 normal volunteers and 21 patients with abnormalities in the pancreas or bile-duct sustem. The study was done using a 1.5 Tesla super-conductive machine. The MRCP images were interpreted by three radiologists. In most cases good images were obtained. The additional clinical information provided by MPR was remarkably useful in cystic lesions, especially in mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Even when the intestine overlapped the pancreas, it was possible to evaluate the pancreatic duct by MPR. Three-dimensional observation and clinically useful diagnosis were possible by utilizing the advantageds of the 3DFT-FASE method appears quite useful in clinical application.
