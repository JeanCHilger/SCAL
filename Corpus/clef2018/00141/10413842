Endosonographically controlled fine needle aspiration cytology--indications and results in routine diagnosis. The usefulness and clinical utility of routine EUS-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNA) in the diagnosis of lesions adjacent to the upper gastrointestinal tract was prospectively studied.EUS/FNA was performed in 122 patients for 125 lesions: Mediastinal lymph nodes (n = 56), pancreatic lesions (n = 45), paragastric masses (n = 12), submucosal tumors (n = 4) and small hepatic lesions (n = 2) were successfully punctured for cytological diagnosis.Adequate material was gained in 119 out of 125 punctures (95%). Overall sensitivity, specifity, positive and negative predictive value were 90%, 98%, 98% and 89%. Results of EUS/FNA in mediastinal lymph nodes were superior (95%, 100%, 100%, 90%) to those in pancreatic lesions (80%, 100%, 100%, 80%). In paragastric masses sensitivity was 100% whereas specifity was only 67%--due to one false-positive result. Out of four submucosal tumors diagnosis was revealed in three. Two liver metastasis were successfully punctured. 35 out of 56 mediastinal nodes showed malignancy. 27 metastases of lung-, three of gastric-, two of renal cancer and three Non-Hodgkins's lymphoma were diagnosed. The cytological results of 45 pancreatic lesions showed cancer in 19 and chronic inflammation in 21, two abscesses and three benign cysts. There were no complications. 37 patients were treated on outpatient's basis.EUS-guided FNA is an accurate and safe technique to sample cytology from lesions adjacent to the wall of the upper gastrointestinal tract. New indications may be established for the diagnosis of lung cancer or metastases of other spreading out into the mediastinum or the celiac axis.
