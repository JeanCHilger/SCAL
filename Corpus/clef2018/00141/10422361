Clinico-tomographic correlations in acute pancreatitis. In the surgery ward from Baia Mare, in the period 1989-1997 have been operated yearly, on an average, 16-17 acute pancreatitis, out of which 8-9 were necrotic-haemorrhagic acute pancreatitis. The possibility of carrying out the computerized tomography allowed a more precise pre-surgery diagnosis and after surgery was improved observation of evolution of the inflammatory phenomena from the pancreatic zone so that the volume, the structure and the outline of the pancreas, the abdominal or pleural liquid collections and the aspect of the neighboring tissues have been correlated in dynamics, with the clinic aspect of the acute pancreatitis and the prognostic indexes. Even if the computerized tomography allowed a more correct evaluation of the patients suffering of acute pancreatitis, there have been 4-6 decreases due to this affection and its complications, the post-surgery death rate remaining at 17-21%.
