Sclerosing mesenteritis involving the pancreas: two cases of a rare cause of abdominal mass mimicking malignancy. Two patients presented with abdominal pain and weight loss and each was found to have an abdominal mass involving the pancreas and small bowel mesentery. In both cases a malignant process was suspected clinically, radiologically and surgically. Multiple biopsy specimens in both patients showed dense fibrosis, chronic inflammation and fat necrosis with pancreatic infiltration. Histological opinions included the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis but, with the knowledge of the presence of localized masses, these cases were eventually considered to be due to sclerosing mesenteritis. Direct involvement of the pancreas has not previously been highlighted and led to diagnostic difficulty. Both patients have responded to treatment with corticosteroids. Interestingly, one of the patients subsequently developed a tubulo-interstitial nephritis, which has not previously been reported as associated with sclerosing mesenteritis. This has also responded to corticosteroid treatment.
