Diagnosis and surgical treatment of organic hyperinsulinism. From 1982 to 1998 144 patients (males 31.7%, females 68.3%) with organic hyperinsulinism underwent surgery. Mean age of the patients was 44.2 +/- 4.6 years. The causes of the development of this disease were benign insulinoma (82.6%), malignant insulinoma (6.9%), beta-cells hyperplasia and microadenomatosis (4.2%). In 6.3% of the patients the origin of the disease was not established. The location of the insulinoma in the pancreatic head was detected in 33.8%, in the body--in 35.2%, in the tail--31%. The sensitivity of the used methods of topical diagnosis was the following: US--40.3%, CT--28.6%, angiography (selective celiacography and upper mesentericography)--76.9%, blood samples from the right hepatic vein after intraarterial stimulation of different parts of the pancreas by Ca with measurement of immunoreactive insulin level--87.2%, intraoperative palpation--86.5%, intraoperative US examination--100%. Preoperatively, the authors used combined angiographic examination, the sensitivity of which made up 94.9%, this study being a single one which allows to reveal the region of the lesion of the pancreas in beta-cells hyperplasy. Tumor enucleation (59 patients), distal resection of the pancreas (50), the excision of the insulinoma (25), duodenopancreatic resection (1), explorative laparotomy (9) were made. Postoperative complications rate arose in 43.6% of the patients, mortality rate--7.7%. The best results were achieved in enucleation of insulinoma and distal resection of the pancreas. The authors suggest that in preoperative diagnosis of insulinomas the preferable methods should be US-examination and combined angiographic examination. Intraoperative revision should be made with use of US examination. Depending on the intraoperative findings the preference should be given either to enucleation of insulinoma or to distal resection of the pancreas.
