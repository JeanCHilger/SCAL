Pancreatic pseudocyst located in the liver: a case report and literature review. Pancreatic pseudocyst in the liver is a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis. However, its frequency seems to be increasing with modem imaging procedures. The authors report a case of pancreatic pseudocyst involving the left lobe of the liver that occurred in a patient who never showed clinical evidence of pancreatitis or pancreatic injury. Complete screening led to the discovery of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. The pseudocyst was treated successfully by radiologic drainage. The pancreatic pseudocyst location and therapeutic approaches are discussed. A literature review uncovered 26 cases of hepatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and treatment of these cases are analyzed.
