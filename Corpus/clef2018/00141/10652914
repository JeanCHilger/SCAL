MR imaging of advanced gastric cancer: comparison of various MR pulse sequences using water and gadopentetate dimeglumine as oral contrast agents. To evaluate clinical usefulness of oral contrast agents (gadopentetate dimeglumine and water) and to assess proper magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in evaluating advanced gastric cancer (AGC) by comparing different MR imaging techniques.Fifteen patients with AGC were imaged with a 1.0-T MR imager and body-array coil. All patients underwent surgery or laparascopic biopsy. Fast low-angle shot (FLASH), half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE), and true fast imaging with steady-state precession time (FISP) images were obtained after ingestion of 900 mL tap water in each patient, followed by postcontrast FLASH images after additional ingestion of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). Qualitative analysis including T-staging of AGC and scoring of imaging quality and quantitative analysis were performed prospectively.In image quality and diagnostic accuracy of T-staging, FLASH imaging showed results slightly superior to those of other imaging modalities, and there was no great difference between using water and Gd-DTPA as an oral contrast agent. As for cancer-to-gastric lumen contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), HASTE and true FISP imaging were superior to FLASH imaging with Gd-DTPA (p < 0.0001). In cancer-to-pancreas CNR, FLASH imaging without Gd-DTPA showed the best result.The use of Gd-DTPA as a positive contrast agent may not be imperative, and T1-weighted FLASH imaging in combination with true FISP imaging with ingestion of tap water can be very useful in evaluating AGC with MR imaging.
