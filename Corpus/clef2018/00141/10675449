Heterotopic pancreas of the stomach: CT findings correlated with pathologic findings in six patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize the computed tomographic (CT) findings of heterotopic pancreas of the stomach.CT scans of six surgically proven cases of heterotopic pancreas of the stomach were reviewed. Three were dynamic spiral CT scans, with both arterial dominant and late phase scans. In other three, both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans were obtained by using conventional techniques. Particular attention was given to the enhancement of the heterotopic pancreas. Pathologic and surgical findings were correlated with CT findings.The locations were in the gastric antrum in five cases and in the mid-body in one. Size ranged from 1 cm to 3 cm (mean = 2.1 cm). Three cases showed homogeneous, strong enhancement similar to the pancreas and consisted mainly of pancreatic acini with the same histologic features as the normal pancreas. Two cases showed poor enhancement and consisted mainly of ducts and hypertrophied muscle pancreatic acini were a minor component. In one case appearing as a cystic lesion on CT, a pseudocyst was found with many ducts and some nests of pancreatic acini.Heterotopic pancreas of the stomach showed a diverse spectrum of CT findings. Good understanding of these CT findings may be helpful in making a correct diagnosis.
