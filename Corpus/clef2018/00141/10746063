Rupture of the pancreas in children--present trends in diagnosis and therapy. Evaluation of pancreatic injuries is presented in the professional literature in retrospective studies and views on treatment vary. The authors evaluated also in a retrospective study a group of eight child patients with a serious injury of the pancreas. The patients were 3-13 years old and were hospitalized at the Clinic of Paediatric Surgery at the Faculty Hospital Motol in 1985-1999. The group is formed by patients with pancreatic injuries (according to the Japanese classification type II and III). The authors evaluate not only diagnostic but also therapeutic procedures. In the diagnosis they evaluate the ultrasonographic examination (USG) as the examination of first choice which however need not record the extent and severity of the pancreatic injury. Computing tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) can make the original suspicion of injury more accurate, ERCP is an examination which reveals in particular type III injuries--i.e. those with affection of the pancreatic duct. Injured children where a serious pancreatic lesion was not diagnosed primarily, had to be subjected to repeated surgical revisions. All children in the presented group recovered, none of the patients died.
