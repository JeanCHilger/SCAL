Computed tomography of retroperitoneal paragangliomas. More than 10% of retroperitoneal paragangliomas are malignant. Histopathological appearance is unreliable in distinguishing benign from malignant paragangliomas. In this study the computed tomography (CT) features of retroperitoneal paragangliomas were analysed to determine if benign neoplasms could be distinguished from malignancy by their appearance at imaging. We reviewed the clinical profiles and CT scans of 27 benign and seven malignant retroperitoneal paragangliomas in 32 patients to determine the presence of any characteristic appearances of benign and malignant neoplasms. Extra-adrenal paragangliomas were more frequently malignant (50%) than adrenal neoplasms (12.5%). Benign lesions were generally smaller (average 6.1 cm) than malignant lesions (average 7.9 cm). Benign tumours were more likely to be homogeneous (46.2%) and have well-defined margins (92.3%) than malignant tumours (25 and 12.5% respectively). Larger tumours were more frequently necrotic. Malignant retroperitoneal paragangliomas infiltrated adjacent liver, pancreas, bowel, lymph nodes, blood vessels, or metastasized to bone and liver. Malignant retroperitoneal paragangliomas are frequently extra-adrenal, large and heterogeneous, with ill-defined margin and necrosis. CT is useful for delineating the location, extent and nature of these tumours. Infiltration of surrounding tissues or organs, metastases, and resectability are accurately assessed by CT.
