Endoscopic ultrasonography of neuroendocrine tumours. Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the upper gastrointestinal tract are mainly located in the pancreas, stomach or duodenum. The aims of preoperative work-up are the localization of primary tumour(s), determination of local tumour invasion, of lymph node metastases and of the hormones secreted by the tumour. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) offers ideal conditions to localize and stage NETs of the foregut. We report our results in localizing and staging NETs of the foregut in 40 patients examined between 1990 and 1997 by EUS, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transabdominal ultrasound (US). EUS shows the highest sensitivity in localizing insulinomas compared with SRS, US, CT and MRI. US and EUS should be the first-line diagnostics if insulinoma has been proven by a fasting test. Further diagnostic procedures are unnecessary in most cases. Further diagnostics such as CT or MRI to search for distant metastases are necessary in large tumours or local invasive tumours. EUS shows the highest accuracy to detect or exclude pancreatic gastrinomas, but fails to detect extrapancreatic gastrinomas in about 50%. The combination of EUS and SRS gives additional information. First-line diagnostics in gastrinoma patients should be SRS and CT or MRI. If no metastases are detected, EUS should be the next preoperative imaging procedure. In nonfunctional NETs, EUS provides the best information on local tumor invasion and regional lymph node involvement.
