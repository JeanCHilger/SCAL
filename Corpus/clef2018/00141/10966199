Mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas: CT findings. This article reviews the CT imaging features of the most frequent mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas and stresses important distinctive patterns that may help distinguish specific entities. Various neoplasms (lymphangioma, lipoma, teratoma, pancreatoblastoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, lymphoma, and sarcoma) are reviewed, with key differential points (structure, fatty and water densities, calcification, pattern of contrast enhancement, vascularization, and necrotic or regressive changes) emphasized. In addition, epithelial tumors are considered in the differential diagnosis.
