Ampullectomy of carcinoma of the papilla of vater in an elderly patient without jaundice. A 79 year-old woman was admitted to Aioi City Hospital for a closer examination of hepatic dysfunction. A filling defect was observed at the distal end of the intrapancreatic common bile duct by computed tomography combined with drip infusion cholangiography. The diagnosis of adenoma with dysplasia at the papilla of Vater was obtained by a biopsy performed during duodenoscopy. As a result, we performed an ampullectomy. Histologic examination revealed a papillary adenocarcinoma which partly extended just beyond the muscle of Oddi. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 35th postoperative day. Here, based upon our experience, we discuss such problems as the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis and the indications for ampullectomy.
