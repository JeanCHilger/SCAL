MR imaging of pancreatic masses. MR imaging of the pancreas has evolved with better understanding of pathologic and radiologic correlation and with continued improvement in rapid-acquisition breath-hold or breathing-independent MR imaging techniques. MR imaging should be considered essential in the evaluation of pancreatic disease and particularly for optimal presurgical detection, characterization, and staging of pancreatic masses.
