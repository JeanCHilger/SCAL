Ultrasonographic diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum--case report. Meckel's diverticulum is the congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract affecting about 2% of the population. It is a true diverticulum containing all layers of the ileum wall. Heterotopic tissue is frequently present (25%): gastric mucosa, duodenal mucosa, jejunal mucosa and pancreatic tissue. Meckel's diverticulum is localized about 50 cm from the ileo-colic valve on the external border of the ileum. Most of Meckel's diverticula are clinically silent clinical symptoms (19%) are in cases of complications such as: strangulation of the bowel in a ring formed by the diverticulum, intussusception of the diverticulum into the ileum, volvulus, incarceration of the diverticulum in hernia, tumour originating in the diverticulum. The diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is very difficult. The most useful in the diagnosis are plain abdominal radiographs, barium studies, CT, sonography and scintigraphy Abdominal sonography shows a tubular fluid structure localized far from the coecum. The wall of the diverticulum is swollen and in the lumen are chyme or fat.
