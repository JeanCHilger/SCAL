Three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography: applications for abdominal imaging. Three-dimensional (3D) gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is a versatile technique that combines speed, superb contrast, and relative simplicity. It has a wide range of applications, particularly in the abdomen and pelvis, where superb images of the abdominal aorta and renal arteries are routinely obtained. Aneurysms, atherosclerotic lesions, and occlusions of the major mesenteric arteries are also well depicted. In addition, 3D gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography is ideal for noninvasive evaluation of the systemic and mesenteric veins and can be used to demonstrate parenchymal lesions in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and other organs. It is also useful in staging genitourinary neoplasms: Parenchymal lesions, venous extension, and adenopathy are all clearly depicted. Three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography can be useful in the preoperative evaluation of potential transplant donors and recipients and in the evaluation of vascular complications following transplantation. Delayed 3D acquisitions of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can be performed routinely to generate gadolinium-enhanced urograms and demonstrate obstruction, delayed function, filling defects, and masses. A variety of methods for increasing the speed and improving the resolution of 3D acquisition are currently under investigation. These include novel imaging and reformatting techniques and the use of intravascular contrast agents with much longer vascular half-lives.
