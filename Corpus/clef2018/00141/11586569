Acute pancreatitis: resultos of a diagnostic-therapeutic protocol in 80 consecutive cases. The treatment of acute pancreatitis cannot be standardized in the absence of a prompt diagnosis and of an accurate severity and prognostic score. This study, based on 80 consecutively observed patients, compared the aetiological, clinical, diagnostic (laboratory and imaging) and prognostic data used to select the most appropriate therapy for each patient. The results confirm that the Ranson score shows a satisfactory prognostic relationship between the number of positive parameters and the severity of the disease. Ultrasound, which is useful for defining the aetiologic factors and in the follow-up of peripancreatic effusions, has proved to be limited as a means of imaging abnormalities of the pancreatic parenchyma. CT scans are confirmed as being the only method of accurately demonstrating the presence of necrosis and of evaluating its effective extent. ERCP was performed as soon as possible in the presence of biliary stasis or of suspect ultrasonographic signs. Surgical treatment proved necessary only in 7.5% of cases, on each occasion to drain infected necrotic foci. Promptness of the surgical indication plays an important role in the outcome of necrosectomy and drainage performed with the closed technique. Mortality was limited to 1.25% in our series. A correct diagnostic approach together with prompt treatment can reduce the mortality rate of this disease to a minimum.
