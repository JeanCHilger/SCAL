Lymphangioma of the pancreas and the duodenal wall: MR imaging findings. Pancreatic lymphangiomas are rare benign tumours with a histogenesis not yet completely understood. Predominantly the cystic aspect of this lesion can complicate the differentiation from other neoplastic and non-neoplastic cystic tumours of the pancreas. We present a case of a middle-aged woman with a lymphangioma involving the duodenal wall and the pancreatic head. With special regard to MR imaging findings differential diagnosis is discussed.
