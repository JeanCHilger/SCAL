Imaging appearances of metastases from neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas. Endocrine tumours of the pancreas (ETPs) are rare neoplasms that are frequently malignant. Despite their usual slow growth, metastases do occur and have a major impact on prognosis. Metastases may be the first manifestation of disease, and recognition of particular radiological features of these hypervascular metastases should suggest their possible neuroendocrine origin. Although somatostatin receptor scintigraphy has changed the imaging strategy for these tumours and has become their principal imaging modality, radiological techniques are still required for precise localization of scintigraphic hot spots and monitoring of response to therapy. This pictorial review shows the typical radiological features of ETP metastases and emphasizes the role of different imaging modalities.
