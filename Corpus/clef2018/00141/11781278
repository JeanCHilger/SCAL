Diagnosis and patient management of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas by using peroral pancreatoscopy and intraductal ultrasonography. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas has attracted increasing interest because of its unique presentation. The differential diagnosis between malignant and benign tumors is extremely important in the determination of the therapy for IPMT. The aims of this study are to determine the usefulness of peroral pancreatoscopy (POPS) and intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) in IPMT for the differentiation of malignant from benign disease, and to evaluate the significance of these techniques as new preoperative examinations.Sixty histopathologically confirmed patients with IPMT underwent POPS and/or IDUS preoperatively. POPS was perfomed in all patients, and IDUS in 40. Findings of POPS and IDUS were compared with histopathology of resected specimens. The postoperative follow-up data were analyzed.Protruding lesions were detected by POPS in 40 patients. They were classified into 5 groups. Fish-egg-like type with vascular images, villous type, and vegetative type were considered to be malignant. By IDUS, lesions protruding 1 mm or more were observed in 36 patients. Of the lesions protruding 4 mm or more, 88% were malignant. Combination of POPS and IDUS improved the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant IPMT. The 3-year cumulative survival rate and disease-free survival rate were extremely high at 95% and 93%, respectively.The combination of POPS and IDUS results in a considerably improved differential diagnosis between malignant and benign IPMT and is useful for determining an effective therapeutic approach. These new techniques can contribute to improvements in postoperative results.
