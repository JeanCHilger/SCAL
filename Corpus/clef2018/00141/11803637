Blunt injuries of the pancreas in children. Conservative management is mainly proposed for pancreatic trauma without ductal injuries. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess our experience with traumatic pancreatic injuries and to compare patients with medical or surgical treatment.From January 1989 to December 1998, 21 children, 13 boys and 8 girls with a mean age of 8 years (range: 1 to 17 years) were treated for pancreatic injuries. Main mechanisms of injuries were bicycle's falls (n = 7), passengers in motor vehicle collision (n = 6), and other road collisions (n = 5). Diagnosis of pancreatic trauma in 17 patients was made through ultrasonography and/or CT scan. In 4 patients, the diagnosis was made intraoperatively. Associated injuries were splenic (n = 6), hepatic (n = 5) and duodenal (n = 5). Thirteen patients had only medical treatment and 8 patients required laparotomy. The two groups were comparable according to the rate of high grade pancreatic lesions.Two complications, a pancreatic fistula and a pseudocyst, occurred in the operative group and improved spontaneously. One death due to a head trauma, one acute pancreatitis and seven pancreatic pseudocysts (six required percutaneous drainage), occurred after medical treatment. The mean hospital stay, shorter after medical treatment, was not significantly different between the two groups (26 days vs 32 days). During the follow-up, no late complications have been observed.Traumatic pancreatic injuries are rarely lethal but are often associated with other intra-abdominal injuries. Conservative treatment is advocated for grade 1 to 4 isolated pancreatic injuries. This conservative approach may be associated with the development of post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts which are easily cured by percutaneous drainage.
