Chronic pancreatitis with pancreas divisum treated with pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy: a case report. Pancreas divisum, the most common congenital variant of pancreatic ductal anatomy, occurs when the ventral and dorsal pancreatic-buds fail to fuse. Herein, we report on a 42-year-old male suffering from chronic pancreatitis with pancreas divisum. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed this diagnosis. A pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was then performed. Pathological examination of the pancreas demonstrated chronic pancreatitis without malignancy. The postoperative clinical course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 10 days after surgery.
