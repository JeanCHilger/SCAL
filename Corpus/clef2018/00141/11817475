Imaging features of pancreatic neoplasms. Pancreatic masses are common in daily imaging practice. The advent of helical CT and breathold MRI has provided a new impetus to the study of the pancreas not only for the potential of characterizing pancreatic masses and pancreatitis but also because of the more accurate staging of pancreatic neoplasms using this technique. Pancreatic tumors are classified according to its histologic origin. Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common. Regarding ductal adenocarcinoma, despite the fast evolving imaging techniques promising an earlier diagnosis and an accurate staging, still the prognosis is extremely poor. However, new surgical data indicate that long-term survival although rare, occurs on resected tumors less than 2 cm, without vascular encasement or adenopathy. Logically, early detection and accurate staging of tumors has become the main focussing in pancreatic imaging since it may result in an increase in the survival of these patients. In this context, the role of imaging to identify, characterize and stage pancreatic neoplasms will be described. Furthermore, the key radiological features of a gamut of more uncommon pancreatic neoplasms will be illustrated. These include other exocrine epithelial tumors (anaplastic carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, acinar cell carcinoma serous cystic pancreatic adenoma, mucinous cystic tumors, intraductal mucinous papillary tumor, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm), endocrine tumors or islet cell tumors (insulinoma, gastrinoma, gluconoma, vipoma, non-functioning tumors), rare non-epithelial tumors (lymphoma, teratoma) and metastases to the pancreas.
