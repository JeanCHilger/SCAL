Magnetic resonance imaging of the exocrine pancreas. The currently available MRI, techniques that are used to perform imaging of the pancreas are reviewed. A basic pancreas examination includes: fat-suppressed breath-hold T1-weighted and respiratory triggered or breath-hold T2-weighted fast sequences The use of dynamic MRI with both extracellular gadolinium chelates and specific contrast agents is stressed in the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic diseases. It is concluded that an "all-in-one" approach including MR angiography of the pancreatic vessels and MR cholangiopancreatography of the biliopancreatic ductal system, confirmed by further studies, is presumably the most cost-effective imaging technique in the evaluation of a vast array of exocrine pancreatic diseases.
