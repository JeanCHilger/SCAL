The role of pancreatoscopy in the preoperative evaluation of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm managed by operative resection of the affected segment of the pancreas.To evaluate the role of peroral pancreatoscopy in the diagnosis and preoperative localization of the affected region of the pancreatic duct and to undertake the appropriate operation for each patient.Five patients with suspected intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas were studied using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, computed tomography of the abdomen, endoscopic ultrasonography, and peroral pancreatoscopy. The findings from these studies were compared, and operative resection was performed in each patient based on pancreatoscopic findings.Of the five patients with suspected intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, only four had histologically confirmed tumor, and the remaining one patient had a retention cyst of the pancreas. Pancreatoscopy correctly identified all four patients with the tumor while excluding the diagnosis of papillary tumor in one.Peroral pancreatoscopy is valuable in the preoperative evaluation of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas, especially in the localization of such tumor.
