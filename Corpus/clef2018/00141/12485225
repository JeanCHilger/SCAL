Pancreatic abscess: 10 years experience. Secondary infections of pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis account for most of the deaths following acute pancreatitis. These infections occur in the form of 'infected pancreatic necrosis' and 'pancreatic abscess'. The latter is a rare complication of acute pancreatitis in comparison with the former.Twenty-one patients with pancreatic abscess were managed over a 10-year period at a tertiary care centre in Northern India. The present report details the clinical profile, investigations performed and management strategy (surgery and intervention radiology) of these patients. The role of surgery and percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) in the management of pancreatic abscess is discussed, with emphasis on the successful outcome seen in a properly selected group of patients managed by PCD.Of the 21 patients, 12 were managed by percutaneous intervention, nine were managed surgically (of these, two had a prior PCD) and two patients were managed conservatively. The overall mortality was 9.5% (2/21). Thus, percutaneous management was suitable for 57% patients, was successful in 83.3%, with a mortality of 8.3%. Surgical therapy alone was offered to 33% of patients, was successful in 85.7%, with a mortality of 14.2%. Complications were seen in four of the nine patients managed by percutaneous drainage alone and eight of the nine patients managed surgically.Pancreatic abscess is a potentially lethal complication in patients recovering from acute pancreatitis. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention with careful selection of patients based on computed tomography imaging for surgical or percutaneous radio-logical management, is met with a successful outcome in a majority of patients. The roles of surgery and PCD are complementary.
