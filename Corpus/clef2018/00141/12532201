Cystic tumors of the pancreas. Considerations upon 34 operated cases. To point out the morphologic, clinic and therapeutic aspects of pancreatic cystic tumors.34 pancreatic cystic tumors (21 males and 13 females, aged between 21 and 68 years), admitted in the last 15 years were analyzed. They were true cysts in 3 cases (9.9%) and pseudocysts in 31 cases (91.1%), located on the head of the pancreas in 8 cases, on the body in 19, on the tail in 6 and on the body and tail in 1 case. We noticed in the past medical history of the patients with pseudocysts a recent acute pancreatitis attack (26 cases), chronic pancreatitis (4 cases) or a recent abdominal trauma (1 case). The delay between the acute pancreatitis attack and the onset of the pseudocyst varied between 18 days and 2 months. The diagnosis was established by clinical picture (Shefer-Silvis triad), laboratory findings and imaging tests (barium meals, ultrasound test and/or CT test). Thirty cases (27 pseudocysts and 3 true cystic tumors) were operated on: the main surgical procedures were cystogastrostomy (12 cases), cystojejunostomy (6 cases) or cystoduodenostomy (3 cases) we also performed distal pancreatectomy (3 cases), laparostomy or external drainage in 5 cases.We registered 1 death (mortality rate of 3.3%), 2 pancreatic fistulae, 1 pancreatic abscess and 2 recurrences.1. The pseudocyst, as an evolutionary complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, is the most frequent cystic tumor of the pancreas, true pancreatic cysts being extremely rare. 2. The diagnosis is established by clinical pictures, laboratory findings and imaging tests. 3. The treatment is surgical, cystogastrostomy or cystojejunostomy being the main surgical procedures.
