Endoscopic ultrasound: diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) comprises several techniques of performing high-frequency ultrasound via an endoscope placed in the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and pancreaticobiliary tree and rectum). It has rapidly become an important tool in the investigation of a variety of lumenal disorders as well as locoregional staging of gastrointestinal malignancies. Needle biopsy of peri-intestinal structures, such as lymph nodes and pancreatic masses, can also be performed under real-time ultrasound control. To date, the utilization of this technology in Australia has been limited by cost constraints and a paucity of training opportunities. EUS continues to be a rapidly growing area in clinical gastroenterology. Recent studies continue to define its role, particularly in the loco-regional staging of a variety of malignancies. In addition, new instruments permit tissue sampling and a variety of therapeutic manoeuvres under direct ultrasound guidance.33 26-32)
