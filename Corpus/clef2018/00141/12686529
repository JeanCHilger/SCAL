Incidental pancreatic cysts: clinicopathologic characteristics and comparison with symptomatic patients. Widespread use of computed tomography and ultrasound has led to the identification of increasing numbers of patients with asymptomatic cystic lesions of the pancreas.Retrospective case series of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.University-affiliated tertiary care referral center.Two hundred twelve patients with pancreatic cystic lesions seen in our surgical practice during 5 years (April 1997-March 2002).Presence or absence of symptoms, cyst size and location, cytologic or pathologic diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcome.Seventy-eight (36.7%) of 212 patients were asymptomatic. Incidental cysts were smaller (3.3 +/- 1.9 vs 4.6 +/- 2.7 cm P<.001) and were found in older patients (65 +/- 13 vs 56 +/- 15 yearsIncidental pancreatic cysts are common, occur in older patients, are smaller than symptomatic cysts, and are unlikely to be pseudocysts. More than half of them are either malignant or premalignant lesions and therefore cannot be dismissed.
