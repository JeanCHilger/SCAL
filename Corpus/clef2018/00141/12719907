Multidetector-row helical CT and advanced postprocessing techniques for the evaluation of pancreatic neoplasms. An important feature of multidetector-row helical computed tomography (CT) is the increased speed of scanning that permits routine use of very thin collimation and acquisition of near isometric imaging data of the abdomen within the time span of a single breath-hold. The parallel escalation in the capabilities of workstations makes feasible the practical use of advanced postprocessing techniques to create high quality volumetric imaging. This article highlights the unique contributions of multidetector-row CT and advanced postprocessing techniques to the evaluation of the pancreas and peripancreatic vascular structures and their value in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic neoplasms.
