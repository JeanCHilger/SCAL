Fatty replacement of the pancreas in a patient with asymptomatic pulmonary cystic fibrosis. The authors report the case of a 26-year-old woman with hepatomegaly, who had recurrent and progressive nausea and abdominal pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated fatty replacement of the entire pancreas resulting from cystic fibrosis. The pulmonary disease was totally asymptomatic. Fatty replacement of the pancreas is the most frequent pattern in older patients with cystic fibrosis. This pattern correlates with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction.
