A case of breast cancer metastasizing to cervix after resection of pancreatic metastasis. A case of breast cancer that metastasized to the cervix 10 years and 8 months after mastectomy is reported. The patient had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy due to solitary metastasis to the head of the pancreas 4 years previously. The cervical metastasis was associated with abnormal genital bleeding. After pancreaticoduodenectomy the serum levels of CEA, CA15-3 and NCC-ST-439, which are markers of breast cancer, were within normal limits, but the serum level of CA15-3 had increased month by month. The patient had abnormal genital bleeding and presented to the department of gynecology at our hospital. The tumor was in the cervix, bled easily and 2.5x2.0 cm in size on ultrasonography. It was thought to be carcinoma of the cervix, but biopsy revealed the tumor to be an adenocarcinoma pathologically and CA15-3 was immunohistochemically demonstrated in the resected specimen, similar to lobular carcinoma of the breast. Abdominal CT scan revealed involvement of the ovaries and uterus, prompting hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. After discharge, she received chemoendocrine therapy. However, she subsequently died due to peritoneal carcinomatosis.
