A Japanese adult case of cystic fibrosis causing bone demineralization. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited, multisystem disorder characterized by an abnormality in exocrine gland function. It leads to chronic pulmonary disease in most cases and pancreatic insufficiency in 85 percent of patients. Although this disease is not uncommon in Caucasians, it has been considered very rare among Japanese. The majority of patients are diagnosed in infancy or childhood. The patient in this case report was a 45-year-old Japanese man who had not been diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis. This patient had recurrent episodes of pulmonary infection that started in childhood, and plain films of the chest showed increased interstitial markings, hyperaeration, and bronchiectasis. CT of the upper abdomen showed a generally enlarged pancreas with complete fatty replacement. Serum and urine pancreatic enzyme levels were low, suggesting pancreatic insufficiency. Repeated sweat tests were positive. A roentgenologic skeletal survey showed general demineralization, which may be multifactorial. In this case, it was concluded that vitamin D deficiency caused by vitamin D malabsorption and/or insufficient sunlight exposure was mainly responsible for the demineralization and that chronic respiratory acidosis might also be partially responsible.
