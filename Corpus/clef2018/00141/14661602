The role of spiral CT in the preoperative evaluation of malignant gastric neoplasms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of spiral CT in preoperative staging in patients with gastric cancer.A total of 28 patients with an established diagnosis of 24 gastric adenocarcinoma, 2 gastric lymphoma, 1 carcinoid tumor, 1 leiomyosarcoma were evaluated with spiral CT for serosal invasion, pancreatic invasion, metastasis and peritoneal involvement. Results were compared with surgical and pathological staging.The accuracy of spiral CT in determining the depth of tumor invasion, pancreatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, peritoneal metastasis, liver metastasis and splenic metastasis were 82% (23/28), 96% (27/28), 82% (23/28), 96% (27/28), 100% (28/28) and 100% (28/28) respectively. The differentiation between T2-T3, T3-T4, N0-N1, N1-N2, N2-N3 were possible in 83% (15/18), 92% (23/25), 79% (15/19), 73% (8/11), and 89% (8/9). The accuracy of spiral CT in overall TNM staging of gastric adenocarcinomas was 67% (16/24).Spiral CT is an effective tool in the preoperative staging of gastric malignancies.
