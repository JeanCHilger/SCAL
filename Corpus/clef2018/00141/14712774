Two resected cases of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination after successful treatment with TS-1 plus low-dose CDDP. We report two resected cases of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination after successful treatment with TS-1 plus low-dose CDDP. Patient 1 presented with right hypochondralgia and underwent laparotomy with diagnosis of type 4 gastric cancer by gastrointestinal fiberscopy. However, the tumor was judged to be unresectable due to peritoneal dissemination, and chemotherapy was performed. At the completion of course 1, he underwent laparotomy again. Although the tumor involved the body of the pancreas and transverse colon, there was no peritoneal dissemination. Therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed with distal pancreatectomy, partial colectomy, cholecystectomy, and D2 lymph node dissection. Patient 2 presented with anorexia and was diagnosed with type 3 gastric cancer by gastrointestinal fiberscopy. CT revealed the tumor was unresectable due to peritoneal dissemination, and so chemotherapy was performed. He underwent laparotomy at the completion of course 3. There was no peritoneal dissemination, so a total gastrectomy was performed with cholecystectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Both patients remain alive and in good condition without any signs of recurrence after surgery.
