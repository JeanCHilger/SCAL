CT staging of pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma. Sixteen cases of carcinoma head pancreas and seven cases of periampullary carcinoma are staged together on CT scan because of their morphological similarity and similar parameters. Following parameters are considered for CT staging: tumour mass, involvement of splanchnic vessels, locoregional lymph nodes and presence or absence of hepatic metastases. Findings were confirmed on surgical exploration. A contrast enhanced CT scan was 58.3 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific for the involvement of lymph nodes and 100 percent sensitive and 93.4 percent specific for hepatic metastases. The cases diagnosed as non-resectable on CT staging were found inoperable on exploration. Authors believe that for all practical purposes, pancreatic and periampullary malignancies can be grouped together and a contrast enhanced CT scan can provide reliable information for the staging of the tumor.
