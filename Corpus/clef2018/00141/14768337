Therapeutical options in pancreatic pseudocysts. This paper presents the "N.Gh.Lupu" surgical clinic's experience, that consists in 65 cases of pancreatic pseudocysts operated in the last 10 years (1989-1998), 30 females and 35 males, with a mean age of 52 years old. The diagnosis was mainly based on the classical echography and CT-scanner, the clinical picture being non specific in the majority of cases. Although the predominant use of the nonsurgical interventional procedures is recommended, this presents the maiden attempts of the authors in this field, the surgical techniques used being as it follows: cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, cystodigestive anastomosis, external drainage. The perioperative mortality was null, the postoperative one consisting in 3 cases (2 cases in the early period and 1 case in the later period).
