Recurrent glucagonoma 20 years after surgical resection. Glucagonoma is a rare islet alpha-cell pancreatic tumor. Patients usually present with necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes mellitus, thromboembolism, and weight loss. Diagnosis is based on the presence of a pancreatic tumor in association with hyperglucagonemia. Tumor characterization is made by computed tomography and/or pancreatic endoscopic ultrasonic and indium-labeled octreo-scan. Surgery is the main component of the treatment, in some cases in association with chemotherapy. We report the case of a 72-year-old patient who developed a recurrent glucagonoma, 20 years after surgical resection.
