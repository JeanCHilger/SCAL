Diagnostic imaging of polysplenia syndrome in the adult. Polysplenia syndrome is a congenital disorder of situs that is characterized by the presence of multiple spleens and a variable combination of thoracic and visceral anomalies. We present three adult cases of polysplenia syndrome with emphasis on the diagnostic imaging findings. Computed tomography could best determine the exact location and shape of the anomalous organs. The visceral anomalies observed in our patients included multiple spleens, interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC), azygos or hemiazygos continuation, left-sided IVC, symmetrical liver, anomalous fissure of the liver, anomalous lobe of the liver, median location of the gallbladder, short pancreas, inverted stomach, gallbladder and pancreas, and intestinal malrotation.
