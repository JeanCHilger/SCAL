Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: two cases in male patients. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare lesion with low malignant potential occurring predominantly in young women. This is a report of two cases in young male patients. Clinical data were retrieved retrospectively from a prospective database of patients with pancreatic tumors. The two patients were caucasian males, ages 34 years (Pt1) and 41 years (Pt2) at the time of diagnosis. Pt1 presented with intermittent epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 9-cm mass involving the pancreatic head. He underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, with en bloc segmental colectomy due to mesocolon involvement. Pt2 was asymptomatic, diagnosed with abdominal mass by screening ultrasound. He had an 11-cm tumor involving the pancreatic tail encasing the splenic vessels on CT. He underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy en bloc. Pathology in both cases was reviewed by staff pathologists as well as outside consultants. SPT is a rare tumor of the pancreas that is diagnosed primarily in young women. The cases presented here demonstrate SPT of the pancreas in two men. In both cases, the clinical presentation was relatively unremarkable. Both have had benign late postoperative courses, consistent with the low malignant potential of this lesion.
