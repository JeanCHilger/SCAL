Pancreatic Cancer Registry in Japan: 20 years of experience. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is defined by the histology and extent of disease. Preoperative histologic diagnosis and diagnostic imaging are fundamentals in managing the disease, but it is not rare to find unexpected peritoneal dissemination or liver metastasis at the time of operation. The overall resectability rate of pancreatic cancer is 40% in Japan. Resecting the portal vein and peripancreatic plexus were performed on 40% of the patients who underwent pancreatectomy for invasive cancer in the head of the pancreas. Long-term survival was only found in patients who underwent pancreatectomy. Radical lymph node dissection, or combined resection of the large vessels, did not seem to improve survival further than the standard resection. Multidisciplinary treatments combined with surgery were performed, and various effects of postoperative chemotherapy after pancreatectomy, intraoperative- and postoperative-radiation therapy, or postoperative chemotherapy for unresectable tumor, were shown. Development of unconventional therapies and refinement of the conventional therapy should be promoted on a randomized prospective trial basis. To promote this effort, which requires the international comparisons and cooperation, JPS developed a computerized JPS registration system downloadable from the JPS website (http://www.kojin.or.jp/suizou/index.html).
