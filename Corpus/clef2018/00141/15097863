Primary angiomyolipoma of the pancreas. Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare tumor characterized histologically by a mixture of spindle cells, adipose tissue, epithelioid cells, and blood vessels. AML usually occurs in the kidney but can involve the liver and, rarely, other sites. We describe a 74-year-old woman without tuberous sclerosis who presented with spontaneous hemorrhage into a primary AML of the pancreas and underwent curative surgical resection. We are aware of only one previous report describing a clear cell "sugar" tumor of the pancreas, which probably represents a monotypic epithelioid variant of AML. The pancreas should be included among sites that can give rise to AML.
