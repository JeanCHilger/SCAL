Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the native pancreas in a pancreas-kidney transplant recipient. Recent data from the International Pancreas Transplant Registry confirm the benefits of pancreas transplantation, even in high-risk diabetic patients previously considered unqualified for such procedures. With patient survival currently extending into decades, de novo malignancies are now more frequently diagnosed in pancreas recipients. This is the first reported case of an intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the native pancreas in a high-risk pancreas after kidney recipient. The patient underwent a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy and has remained tumor-free for 9 months. This case report demonstrates that (1) pancreas transplantation can be successfully done in patients with significant cardiocerebrovascular disease, (2) de novo pancreas malignancies can occur within the first year after pancreas transplantation, and (3) tumors of the native pancreas warrant the same surgical treatment in pancreas recipients as in the general population, despite the need for posttransplant immunosuppression and the increased operative risk.
