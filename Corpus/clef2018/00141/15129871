The role of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in obstructive jaundice. To evaluate the diagnostic value of MRCP in studying the sites and cause of obstructive jaundice in comparison with other imaging modalities at the Department of Radiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, from January 1999 to May 2001.Forty nine consecutive patients included 19 men and 30 women, suspected of obstructive jaundice. Patients underwent ultrasound (n = 49), CT (n = 11), ERCP (n = 25) and biliary surgery (n = 17). Final diagnosis was established by surgical exploration, endoscopic sphincterectomy, cytology and clinical follow up.Of the 49 patients 17 had choledocholithiasis. Twenty five patients had malignant strictures, out of which 11 had non-specific malignant strictures, 7 had pancreatic carcinoma, 3 had Klatskin tumors, 3 had periampullary carcinoma and 1 had gallbladder carcinoma. Six patients had benign strictures and 1 patient had choledochal cyst. Overall, MRCP was sensitive (88%) and specific (96.8%) in detecting choledocholithiasis. MRCP sensitivity and specificity in detecting benign main bile duct stricture was equal to 83.3% and 97.6% respectively, and 92% and 100% for malignant stricture.Our prospective study confirms that MRCP, a noninvasive and well tolerated imaging technique is of value in the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice.
