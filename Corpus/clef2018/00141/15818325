Graft-versus-tumor effect against advanced pancreatic cancer after allogeneic reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation. The prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer is extremely poor and therefore a novel treatment strategy is desired. The authors thus started a prospective study of allogeneic reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIST) for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this approach for such patients.Only patients with pathologically proven pancreatic cancer that was locally advanced or metastatic and not amenable to curative resection were included. The conditioning regimen consisted of gemcitabine, fludarabine, and busulfan.In the first stage of this study, the authors treated seven patients. Treatment-related mortality before day 100 was observed in one patient. The median survival after RIST was 229 days. An objective response on computed tomographic scan was observed in two patients and another had a tumor marker response. Marked tumor shrinkage was observed in one of the remaining patients after donor lymphocyte infusion. These antitumor effects appeared after the effect of the conditioning regimen had disappeared. In addition, some of these responses were associated with an increase in the serum anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibody level.Pancreatic cancer appeared to be sensitive to a graft-versus-tumor effect therefore, a larger clinical study with a refined strategy is warranted.
