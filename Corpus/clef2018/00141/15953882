A case of osteoclast-like giant cell tumor of the pancreas with ductal adenocarcinoma: histopathological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular biological studies. Osteoclast-like giant cell tumor of the pancreas is a very rare neoplasm, of which the histiogenesis remains controversial. A 63-yr-old woman was hospitalized for evaluation of epigastric pain. An abdominal computerized tomography revealed the presence of a large cystic mass, arising from the tail of pancreas. A distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. Histologically, the tumor was composed of mononuclear stromal cells intermingled with osteclast-like giant cells. In addition, there was a small area of moderately to well differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma. The final pathologic diagnosis was osteoclast-like giant cell tumor of the pancreas with ductal adenocarcinoma. Here, we describe the histopathological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular biological findings of this tumor with review of the literature pertaining to this condition.
