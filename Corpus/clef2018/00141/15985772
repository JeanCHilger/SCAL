Clinical considerations of primary hydatid disease of the pancreas. The pancreas is a rare primary location of hydatid disease. The purpose of our study is to gain more insight into this entity and to focus on the management and the diagnostic approach to the disease.The medical records of 5 patients with hydatid cysts of the pancreas were reviewed.Four of the cysts were primary, while in 1 case a coexisting cyst was found in the liver. The body and tail of the pancreas were the most common locations. Clinical presentation varied according to the anatomic location of the cyst. Abdominal pain, discomfort and vomiting were the main clinical symptoms. One patient presented with obstructive jaundice, while another patient manifested a mild episode of anaphylactic shock. The indirect hemagglutination test was positive in 3 of 4 cases. A computed tomography scan successfully imaged all cysts and calcification of the cystic wall was found in 3 of 4 cases. All patients underwent surgical therapy. Hydatid cysts in the tail of the pancreas were successfully treated with distal pancreatectomy, while cysts in the body and head of pancreas were treated with proper evacuation, pericystectomy and omentoplasty. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients except 1 who presented a pancreatic fistula and was re-operated. The mean length of hospitalization after surgery was 11-12 (range 10-13) days, except for the patient who needed to be re-operated. No evidence of cyst recurrence was observed during the follow-up period.Hydatid cystic masses of the upper abdomen might also originate from the pancreas especially in endemic countries. Surgical excision of the entire cystic lesion remains the optimal treatment, offering hope for a complete cure.
