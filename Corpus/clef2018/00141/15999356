Value of CT criteria in predicting survival in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic head carcinoma. Survival is often poor after resection of pancreatic tumors. We correlated the pre-operative CTs with survival to find criteria that have prognostic value. To establish the prognostic value of CT in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic head carcinoma.In 71 consecutive patients with potentially resectable pancreatic head carcinoma, prognostic factors on CT were scored, for example, tumor size, peripancreatic infiltration, grades of vascular encasement, and local irresectability. All patients underwent surgical exploration. CT findings were compared with results of surgery and histopathology. Prognostic factors for resected and unresected tumors were analyzed using single and multivariate analysis.Forty-one of 71 tumors were resected (24 radical). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of CT for surgical irresectability were 0.67, 0.63, and 0.57, respectively. For a non-radical resection, these were 0.62, 0.75, and 0.83, respectively. The median survival was 21 months for resectable tumors and 9.7 months for unresectable tumors. For resected tumors, a tumor diameter of > 3 cm (relative hazard 3.8) and CT signs of local unresectability showed a poor survival. The median survival of resected tumors <2 cm was nearly 30 months.CT signs of local irresectability and a tumor diameter of >3 cm predict a poor survival after resection.
