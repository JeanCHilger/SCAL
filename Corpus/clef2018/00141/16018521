Pancreatic injury from blunt abdominal trauma in childhood. Pancreatic trauma in children is relatively uncommon, but carries high morbidity and mortality rates when diagnosis is delayed. Preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic lesion might be difficult, especially in the case of isolated injury.Authors analyse seven cases of pancreatic trauma in childhood. In three cases surgical intervention was required due to pancreatic transection with main pancreatic duct rupture. The injuries of the 5-10 years old male patients were diagnosed and operated on within 24 hours.In two cases distal resection were performed with splenic preservation. In one case--where the operation was performed within 8 hours--preservation of the distal pancreas was also achieved by distal pancreatogastrostomy. The postoperative period was uneventful in all cases. Impaired glucose metabolism was not found in the operated cases during the follow up.Authors emphasise the importance of CT scan and the responsibility of the first attending physician regarding both diagnosis and correct surgical management.
