Endoscopic management of pancreaticopleural fistulas: a report of three patients. Pancreaticopleural fistulas are a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, and are usually treated by surgery. We report three patients whose pancreaticopleural fistulas were successfully treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and drainage (stenting, nasopancreatic drainage). In one patient a pancreatic pseudocyst persisted despite successful initial closure of the leak using this method and, as it was also suspected to be infected, additional drainage of the pseudocyst was required. Endotherapy of pancreaticopleural fistulas could obviate the need for surgery when conventional medical treatment has failed in this condition.
