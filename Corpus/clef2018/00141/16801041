Differential diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas based on imaging features. Lymphangioma is a benign tumor, which is a consequence of lymphatic malformation with blockage of lymphatic flow. Most lymphangiomas occur in the neck and axillary region, and < 1% occur in the mesentery or retroperitoneum. Lymphangiomas arising from the pancreas are extremely rare. We report the case of a 34-year-old woman with cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas without major symptoms or signs. A 6 x 6 cm intra-abdominal cystic mass was incidentally revealed by sonography during a health examination. It is always a challenge to differentiate the lesion from other possible cystic-like pancreatic neoplasms. Differential diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma from other cystic-like tumors of the pancreas can be performed based on their imaging characteristics, including presence of septa, cystic or wall calcification, soft tissue, wall thickness, single or multiple loculation, and dilatation of the pancreatic duct. Post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging is excellent in defining the origin of intra-abdominal cystic mass and intracystic septa.
