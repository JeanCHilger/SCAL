Palliative endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage of a malignant pancreatic cyst causing gastric outlet obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts has been well described but it is not an established therapy for malignant pancreatic cystic neoplasms. We report the first EUS-guided cystogastrostomy for the palliative treatment of a cystic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.We describe a 70-year-old male with a nonresectable cystic pancreatic adenocarcinoma causing partial gastric outlet obstruction treated successfully with palliative EUS-guided cystogastrostomy stent placement. The diagnosis was confirmed by EUS-guided fine needle aspiration. Computerized tomography (CT) and EUS staging revealed vascular invasion precluding the patient from surgical resection. Cystogastrostomy was performed entirely under EUS guidance utilizing a 10-Fr double pigtail stent. After cystogastrostomy stent placement, the patient developed dramatic symptomatic improvement of gastric outlet obstructive symptoms, although subsequent imaging did not reveal complete collapse of the cystic structure.EUS-guided cystogastrostomy can be considered in the palliative treatment of nonresectable pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Cyst decompression may result in significant symptomatic improvement, although the architecture of malignant cysts may prevent complete resolution.
