Solid and papillary neoplasm of the pancreas: report of three cases. We report 3 cases of solid and papillary neoplasm of the pancreas, which is a rare pancreatic tumor with distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. Sonographic, computed tomographic (CT) and gross pathologic findings of these 3 patients were obtained and compared. The tumors had a smooth, enhanced capsule and variable internal architecture. Two of the tumors appeared to be of the heterogeneous soft tissue density type, while one of the tumors was of the mixed solid and cystic type. Because the CT appearance of this tumor is subject to variation, it should be differentiated from other pancreatic lesions with variable CT appearances. Several CT features such as soft tissue density of the mass in a precontrast study, a well-enhanced capsule and the absence of pancreatic or biliary duct dilatation, as well as the characteristic young-female predilection, may aid in a correct diagnosis before surgery.
