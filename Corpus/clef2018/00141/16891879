Chronic pancreatitis. As in our previous reviews, we endeavor to review important new observations in chronic pancreatitis made in the past year. Topics recently reviewed were truncated to accommodate a surge in publications on clinical aspects of chronic pancreatitis, which contained new observations or insights into new or old concepts.Cystic fibrosis carriers have been found to be at increased risk of pancreatitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis may belong to a multiorgan immunoglobulin G4-related autoimmune disease, and the natural history of chronic pancreatitis differs among the etiologies. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging improves upon previous methodologies for diagnosing reduced pancreatic exocrine secretion, and fecal elastase-1 has been found to be a poor test for diagnosing pancreatic malabsorption. Visceral hyperalgesia or heightened central pain perception may contribute to pain in chronic pancreatitis. Instruments are evolving to assess quality of life in chronic pancreatitis, and fibrolytic agents have been found to have therapeutic promise.Researchers this past year have further characterized genetic, molecular and clinical aspects of chronic pancreatitis. Advancing the understanding of fibrogenesis, mechanisms of exocrine insufficiency, calcification, and pain and continuing development/modification of diagnostic tests should lead to improved prevention, detection and treatment of the condition. More accurate quantification of outcomes is critical for translating potential therapies from bench to bedside.
