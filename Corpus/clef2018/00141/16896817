A case of pancreatoblastoma prenatally diagnosed as intraperitoneal cyst. Pancreatoblastoma in childhood is a very rare malignant tumor, but is considered to have a relatively good prognosis because of its low metastatic potential. We report 1-day-old female infant who was recently found to have an intraabdominal cyst on prenatal ultrasound examination. The tumor was a unilocular, cystic mass without invasion or metastasis to other organs, allowing total resection. It was diagnosed postnatally with pancreatoblastoma.
