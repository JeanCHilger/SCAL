Unexplained hematuria during pregnancy: right-sided nutcracker phenomenon. We report a case of hematuria in a pregnant patient caused by right renal vein hypertension, as a result of compression of right renal, the inferior caval and the right gonadal veins because of posterior displacement of the pancreas caused by the presence of the gravid uterus. Hematuria resolved after a cesarean delivery. This condition has not been, to our knowledge, previously described.
