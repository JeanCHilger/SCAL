Acute appendicitis in a kidney-pancreas transplant recipient: report of a case. The prompt diagnosis and management of acute surgical conditions in immunocompromised solid organ transplant recipients are of critical importance. These conditions may or may not be related or to the transplanted allograft(s). This is a case report of a 41-year-old woman who received a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant. Nine years after the transplant, she developed acute appendicitis with a periappendiceal abscess and a fecalith, and she was treated with percutaneous drainage of the abscess and eventual semielective appendectomy. This is the first known report of acute appendicitis in a pancreas allograft recipient in the English literature.
