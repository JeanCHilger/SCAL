Diabetic muscle infarction after kidney and pancreas transplantation: case report and literature review. Diabetic muscle infarction (DMI) is a rare, long-term complication of poorly controlled diabetes (typically of type I). DMI was first described in 1965 and more than 100 cases have been reported thereafter in the English literature. Usually, there is a coexistence with concomitant nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The etiology remains uncertain, but appears to be attributable to diabetic microangiopathy and hypercoagulability and is believed that hypoxia-reperfusion injury is involved. DMI presents with sudden onset of pain associated with a tender mass in the thigh in most instances. The diagnosis is based on magnetic resonance imaging, which is not specific but highly indicative. Treatment is conservative with relapses occurring in 50% of the patients, but not necessarily in the same muscle group. We describe a case of DMI that occurred 4 months after simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation in one patient with type I diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease.
