Diagnostic procedures and more particularly, place of scintigraphy in neuroendocrine tumors, example of vipoma in MEN 1. Functioning endocrine pancreatic tumors in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) are rare. We present a case of a symptomatic neuroendocrine tumor in a 27-year old woman. The identification of the nature of the neuroendocrine tumors was difficult despite the use of a wide range of diagnostic procedures. This case is interesting in many ways: this is an exceptional illustration of MEN 1 with vipoma associated with calcitonin secretion and it is also a good example of the benefits and limitations of each diagnostic procedure in the heterogeneous group of neuroendocrine tumors.
