Liver embolization with trisacryl gelatin microspheres (embosphere) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. To report our experience of liver embolization with trisacryl gelatin microspheres (Embospheretrade mark) in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.Fifteen patients underwent selective embolization of the right or left hepatic artery with Embosphere. One lobe was embolized in seven patients and both lobes, on separate occasions, in eight patients. Seven patients had midgut carcinoids, two had lung carcinoids, one suffered from a thymic carcinoid, and five had endocrine pancreatic tumors. Eight patients suffered from endocrine symptoms, seven of whom had carcinoid syndrome and one WDHA (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria) syndrome.Partial radiological response was seen after eight embolizations (in six different patients), stable disease was observed after 13 embolizations (after three of these, necroses occurred), while radiological progression was noted after only two embolizations. Only two patients experienced a biochemical response. Clinical improvement of carcinoid syndrome was observed after five embolizations. There were no major complications. Fever >38 degrees C was seen after all but four embolizations, and urinary tract infections were diagnosed after eight embolizations.Selective hepatic artery embolization with Embosphere particles is a safe treatment for patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and may lead to partial radiological response as well as symptomatic improvement of disabling endocrine symptoms.
