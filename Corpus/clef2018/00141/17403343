Primary pancreatic lymphoma in pediatric patients. Primary involvement of the pancreas in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is extremely rare in children and adolescents. Indeed, we have only found three cases of primary pancreatic lymphoma in this population published in the English literature. We report the case of a 13-year-old girl diagnosed with primary pancreatic lymphoma. We describe the ultrasonography and computed tomography findings, discuss the differential diagnosis with other pancreatic tumors that affect pediatric patients, and review the literature.
