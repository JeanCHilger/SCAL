Problems in diagnosing lymphoma of the pancreas with computed tomography. A case report. Primary lymphoma of the pancreas is a rare form of extranodal lymphoma accounting for less than 0.5% of pancreatic tumors. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas with histopathological examination and immunohistochemical assay confirm the diagnosis. A 73 year old male presented with recurrent pancreatic type abdominal pain with significant weight loss over 1 year. He was pale with ill defined epigastric mass. Contrast enhanced CT showed an ill defined poorly marginated non enhancing hypodense mass lesion involving the body of the pancreas. CA 19-9 was normal. CT guided aspiration cytology was suggestive of hemolymphoid malignancy. Immunohistochemistry was positive for Leukocyte Common Antigen and CD 34. It was negative for CD3 and CD 20 indicating an undifferentiated lymphoma. Patient received two sessions of chemotherapy and was followed-up.
