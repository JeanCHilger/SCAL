The role of intra-arterial calcium stimulation test with hepatic venous sampling (IACS) in the management of occult insulinomas. Occult insulinomas remain a clinical challenge. Specifically designed protocols are necessary to aid detection and facilitate a focused pancreatic exploration.Seventeen non-multiple endocrine neoplasia (non-MEN) patients referred to this medical center in the past 10 years because of equivocal diagnosis, failure of previous operation or difficulty in localization for insulinomas were studied. A routine intra-arterial calcium stimulation test with venous sampling (IACS test) was done for lesion localization. An exploratory laparotomy with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) examinations was performed.Preoperative imaging (sonography, high-resolution computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging) found six insulinomas, and IOUS found an additional six in the pancreatic regions all were compatibly indicated by the IACS test. The remaining five patients with occult lesions by IOUS were treated by 40% (1) or 60-70% (4) distal pancreatectomies when insulin gradients were demonstrated on calcium stimulation to the splenic or to the superior mesenteric artery, respectively, and nesidioblastosis was found in each pathology examination. There were no complications related to the arterial stimulation and venous sampling (ASVS) test. No patient had recurrent hyperinsulinism, permanent morbidity, or mortality from surgery.IACS test helps in the diagnosis of equivocal pancreatogenous hypoglycemia, indicating the pancreatic region of priority exploration and guiding a pancreatic resection.
