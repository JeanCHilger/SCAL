Ultrasonographic assessment of chronic pancreatitis severity. Pancreatic index. To introduce the pancreatic index assessing severity of chronic pancreatitis (CP).Ultrasonography was made in 28 patients with clinically documented diagnosis of CP. A total of 6 groups of ultrasonographic signs served the basis for calculation of scores for a complex formalized semiquantitative criterion--the pancreatic index (PI). Ultrasonographic signs--the size of the head, calcinates, structure, maximal size of the ductus pancreaticus, pseudocysts, etc. were assessed in scores from 1 to 3. Severity of the disease was classified according to total PI.The following correlation was found between severity of CP and the PI: in mild CP--57%, in moderate CP--71%, in severe CP--66%.Ultrasonographic PI objectively evaluates severity of CP course.
