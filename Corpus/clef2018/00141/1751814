A nine year retrospective analysis of resectable pancreatic cancer at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Tokyo: clues to diagnosis and diagnostic assessment. A nine year retrospective survey was carried out at the National Cancer Center Hospital in order to define the diagnostic clues and most suitable diagnostic assessment in resectable pancreatic cancer patients. Forty six cases were detected (27 pancreatic head cancers, 19 pancreatic body and tail cancers). There were 8, 26, 3 and 9 cases of t1, t2, t3 and t4 tumour size cancers, respectively. Abdominal pain and/or discomfort and back pain were the most common initial symptoms and chief complaints. Jaundice was present only in pancreatic head cancer cases. Abnormal GTT and CA 19-9 were the biochemical tests most commonly found abnormal, irrespective of tumour size. ERCP followed by US and CT were the most accurate technical tests. The best care toward the awareness of the initial symptoms needs to be followed, as a first choice, by a proper biochemical (CA 19-9, GTT) and technical (US, ERCP, CT) assessment in the hope of identifying those patients whose prognosis might be improved by an early operation.
