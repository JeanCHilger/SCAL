Endoscopic ultrasound and IL-8 in pancreatic juice to diagnose chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic juice (PJ) [IL-8] has been proposed as a marker for pancreatic diseases. We compared the accuracy of PJ [IL-8] and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to diagnose chronic pancreatitis (CP).79 patients with symptoms suspicious for CP were enrolled. PJ emptied into the duodenum was collected during an upper endoscopy with IV secretin and [IL-8] was measured. CP was diagnosed when PJ [IL-8] was >20 pg/ml. CP was diagnosed at EUS when >or=4 of the 9 established criteria were present. CP was diagnosed by using composite gold standard: ERCP, histology, CT or MRI, and clinical follow-up (mean 20 months).38 patients had CP, whereas 41 patients had no pancreatic disease. To diagnose CP, PJ [IL-8] was significantly less sensitive compared to EUS (47 vs. 71%), but equally accurate (71 vs. 80%) and specific (93 vs. 88%). By combining PJ [IL-8] and EUS, sensitivity and specificity significantly increased to 82% (either IL-8 or EUS positive) and 100% (both IL-8 and EUS positive).Both PJ [IL-8] and EUS are accurate diagnostic modalities for CP. PJ collection can be performed at the time of EUS. PJ [IL-8] and EUS are complementary with higher sensitivity and specificity when used together.
