EUS-FNA cytology of pancreatic exocrine tumors. Comparison of experiences with pathological diagnosis. In this minireview, the main clinical applications and results of EUS-FNA (Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration) Cytology in the cystic and solid neoplastic lesions of the exocrine pancreas are described. EUS-FNA provides a safe and accurate mean to diagnose pancreatic tumors in early and advanced stages. A personal observation of a case of acinic cell carcinoma is briefly presented, with extensive cytological iconography of routinely stained smears, integrated with cytochemical/immunocytochemical analysis for diagnostic purposes.
