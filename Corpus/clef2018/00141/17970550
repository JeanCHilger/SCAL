Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features. The technologies of computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound (transabdominal and endoscopic) have advanced considerably in recent years, having a major impact on the management of pancreatic cancer, guiding surgery for the potential of cure, and avoiding needless surgery in those patients who are unresectable. Knowledge of how these modalities should be utilized, how they can be optimized, and the appearance of ductal adenocarcinoma on each modality are crucial for them to be used effectively and accurately.
