Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas with portal vein compression presenting as portal hypertension. Solid pseudopapillary tumour (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm, which occurs predominantly in young females and is usually amenable to cure by surgical resection. Imaging plays an important role in its diagnosis. We present the sonographic, CT and MRI features of SPT in a young female whose chief complaint was recurrent haematemesis secondary to portal venous compression.
