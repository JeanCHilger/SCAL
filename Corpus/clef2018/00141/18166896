Adenomyoma of the main biliary tract: a real diagnostic trap. Two cases and a review of the literature. Adenomyoma of the biliary tract is a benign neoplasm but its clinical, radiological and intraoperative features can mimic pancreatic or biliary cancer. These similarities may yield to useless pancreatoduodenectomy. We report here two cases of adenomyoma treated by pancreatoduodenectomy. The analysis of these two cases and the review of literature show that radiological and pathological knowledge of this disease, associated with pre and intraoperative evaluation (echoendoscopy-guided biopsy, brushing and intraoperative biopsy) can achieve diagnosis and thus may avoid inappropriate resection. For asymptomatic patient, simple follow-up seems to be the rule. For symptomatic patient endoscopic resection or surgical segmentary resection where appropriate is recommended.
