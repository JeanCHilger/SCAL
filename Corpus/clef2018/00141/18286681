Endoscopic ultrasonography for evaluating patients with recurrent pancreatitis. Acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) is still a complex diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. In up to 30% of cases of ARP, it is not possible to establish the etiology of the disease. In the other 70%, many factors play an etiological role in ARP: microlithiasis, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), pancreas divisum, hereditary pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, a choledochocele, annular pancreas, an anomalous pancreatobiliary junction, pancreatic tumors or chronic pancreatitis are diagnosed. EUS should be useful in ARP as it is sensitive for diagnosing bile duct stones, gallbladder sludge, pancreatic lesions, ductal abnormalities and chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) appears to be diagnostic in the majority of patients with previously unexplained pancreatitis, and offers an alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as the initial diagnostic test in patients with ARP.
