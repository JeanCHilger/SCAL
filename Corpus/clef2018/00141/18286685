Diagnosis and management of relapsing pancreatitis associated with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. One of the most important causes of relapsing pancreatitis is a cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. These low grade malignancies may cause pancreatitis by obstructing or communicating with a pancreatic duct. Patients with relapsing pancreatitis and a focal fluid fluid collection should be investigated for the possibility of a mucinous cystic neoplasm. Cross sectional imaging can provide a diagnosis with the imaging findings of a low attenuation cystic lesion containing mural calcification (CT scanning) or a lobular T2 enhancing lesion (MRCP). Endoscopic ultrasound can provide more detailed imaging with the ability to guide fine needle aspiration of the cyst fluid. Cyst fluid analysis can provide a diagnosis of a mucinous cystic lesion with the combination of cytology (mucinous epithelium), elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the presence of DNA mutations. Management of these patients consists of surgical resection and monitoring in patients not able to withstand surgery.
