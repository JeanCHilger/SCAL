Gadolinium-DTPA as an oral contrast medium for magnetic resonance tomography of the pancreas. 52 patients with normal pancreas, pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (Magnetom 0.5 T). Using T1-, proton density- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences images were obtained before and after oral administration of Gadolinium-DTPA (Gd-DTPA, 1 mM, 15 g/l Mannit, 5-13 ml/kg). Gd-DTPA resulted in hyperintense labeling of small bowel in all sequences and improved visualization of pancreatic head, body and tail in 15, 14 and 7 of 27 patients with normal pancreas and in 17, 8 and 6 of 25 patients with diseased pancreas. Better delineation of pseudocysts and tumorous gut wall invasion were diagnostically profitable. With regard to motion artifact reduced MRI of the intestine using fast sequences Gd-DTPA may be a suitable oral contrast agent to improve the imaging of the pancreas.
