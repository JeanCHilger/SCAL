Role of endosocopic ultrasound in the diagnosis of cystic tumours of the pancreas. With the increased use of sophisticated imaging, cystic lesions in the pancreas are being recognized with greater frequency. Although imaging alone may not provide a specific diagnosis in many cases, a combination of imaging characteristics, clinical presentation, and additional procedures such as endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of cystic lesion, allows appropriate management. Cystic lesions in the pancreas can be divided pathologically into congenital cysts, pseudocysts and cystic neoplasm. At least four different types of cystic neoplasm have been described: mucinous neoplasms, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, serous neoplasms and papillary cystic neoplasms The most important diagnosis is differentiating between mucinous and non-mucinous cystic lesion because of their different potential of malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound provides the highest resolution of the pancreas and endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration can supply further diagnostic information on the basis of cytology, fluid viscosity, concentration of tumour glycoproteins, amylase level, molecular analysis that may contribute to the better clinical outcome of these neoplasms.
