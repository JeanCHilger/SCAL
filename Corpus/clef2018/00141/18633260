Pathological complete response in an elderly patient with locally advanced gastric cancer treated with S-1/CDDP. We report a patient with locally advanced gastric carcinoma successfully treated with S-1/CDDP. The patient was a 77-year-old woman who had gastric cancer surgically diagnosed as T4N2, invading the pancreas and mesocolon. After the firsts exploratory laparotomy, chemotherapy was begun as follows. S-1(80 mg/day)was orally administered for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks' rest as a course, and CDDP(75 mg/body)was administered by intravenous drip on day 8. Because of severe anorexia and nausea, however, the CDDP administration had to be discontinued. Therefore, we changed the procedure to S-1 single treatments, 2 weeks' administration followed by 2 weeks' rest. The total 9 courses of this procedure proved successful. Subsequently, she underwent curative surgery consisting of total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection, combined with distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and obtained pathological CR. S-1/CDDP appears to be an effective treatment modality for advanced gastric cancer.
