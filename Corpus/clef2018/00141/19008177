Acute pancreatitis and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has multiple clinical manifestations and risk factors, but the events that actually trigger acute episodes of TTP are often unclear. We describe the case of a 56-year-old woman who presented with clinical signs and symptoms of TTP and acute pancreatitis. We discuss whether pancreatitis was due to ischemic pancreatic damage caused by microvascular platelet clumping in the frame of TTP, or whether acute pancreatitis, a disorder that results in an intense systemic inflammatory response, may be a triggering event for acute episodes of TTP.
