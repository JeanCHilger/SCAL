S-1+gemcitabine (GEM) therapy was effective in a case of unresectable pancreatic head carcinoma. Treatment results of pancreatic head carcinoma are not good and long-term survival, especially in nonresectable cases is extremely difficult to obtain. The case reported here is of nonresectable pancreatic head carcinoma in which S-1+gemcitabine (GEM) proved to be effective.A 70-year-old male. The patient initially complained of epigastralgia. Jaundice was also noted and upon further study, pancreatic head carcinoma, portal vein and common hepatic artery infiltration along with duodenal infiltration were diagnosed. Gastrojejunostomy and cholecystectomy were performed with a preoperative diagnosis of Phb, TS2 infiltrative type T4, CH (+), DU (+), S (+), RP (-), PV (+), Ach (+), PLX, OO (-), N0, M0, and Stage IVa. Perioperative findings showed no hepatic or peritoneal metastases. Following surgery, S-1+ GEM (S-1 100 mg/day, day 1-14 GEM 1,000 mg/m(2) was administered on day 8 and day 15 for 2 weeks followed by one week of no administration) was started. After completing 2 courses, there was no change in the tumor, but after finishing the sixth course, there was a notable reduction in tumor size, and after finishing the 10th course, a further reduction was noted. Currently at the end of the 14th course, the tumors are unidentifiable upon imaging. At 1 year and 5 months from the initial diagnosis, there has been no recurrence and chemotherapy is being continued. In the case reported here, there have been no adverse side-effects from the S-1+GEM therapy, it is a safe method which does not lower QOL in patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma, and we can look forward to the possibility of extended survival times.In the case of unresectable pancreatic carcinoma, S-1+GEM therapy may be able to provide an improved long-term prognosis.
