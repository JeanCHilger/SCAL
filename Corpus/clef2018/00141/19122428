Synchronous double invasive ductal carcinomas of the pancreas with multifocal branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas. A 52-year-old man with a history of distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer was admitted to our hospital because of jaundice. CT scan revealed double tumors in the pancreatic head and body concomitant with multicystic lesions of the pancreas. Total pancreatectomy with splenectomy and remnant gastrectomy was performed. Final histological diagnosis was double invasive ductal carcinomas of the pancreas head and tail with multifocal branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous adenomas of the pancreas. The present case suggests that entire pancreas might have malignant potential in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
