Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors as a variant of cystic pancreatic tumors. The problems of diagnosis and surgical treatment. Retro- and prospective investigation of the diagnosis and treatment results of 6 patients, suffering intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), was conducted. In 2 patients the central type malignant IPMN were diagnosed, in 1 - the central type of IPMN without malignization signs, in 2 - the IPMN of lateral type without malignization signs, in 1 - the multiple malignized IPMN of lateral type. The magnet resonance cholangiopancreatography, permitted to determine the pancreatic ductal system tumoral involvement, had constituted the main method of instrumental diagnosis. Radical operation was performed in 4 patients (in 3 - pancreatoduodenal resection, in 1 - subtotal distal pancreatic resection), in 2 - palliative operations. Follow-up in radically operated patients in terms from 6 to 21 months showed no recurrence of the disease.
