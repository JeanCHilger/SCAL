Invasive diagnostic procedures for insulinomas of the pancreas. Insulinomas are the most common cause for hypoglycemia with endogenous hyperinsulinism. Insulinomas are the most frequent endocrine tumor of the pancreas and 10% occur as multiple tumors (e.g. multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) or in rare cases as islet cell hyperplasia. A further 10-15% of insulinomas are malignant. Non-invasive imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (US) and somatoreceptor scintigraphy (SRN) show a lower sensitivity for detection and localization of tumors, because in many cases insulinomas are smaller than 2 cm in size. Invasive pre-operative diagnostic procedures, such as transhepatic peripancreatic venous blood sampling (TPVB) and the intra-arterial calcium stimulation test (ASVS) are much more time-intensive compared to CT, MRI and US with an examination time of 2-3 h but achieve a more exact pre-operative detection and localization with sensitivities mostly greater than 95% and are therefore the diagnostic methods of choice.
