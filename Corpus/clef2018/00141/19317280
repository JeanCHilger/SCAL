Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas as a cause of recurrent pancreatitis. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic tumor mostly seen in young women. We here report a twelve-year-old girl presenting with recurrent attacks of pancreatitis. No history of a systemic disease, trauma, drug usage or infection was present. All other etiologic factors like familial, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, cystic fibrosis, medications were excluded. On abdominal ultrasound a heterogeneous mass was noticed at the tail of pancreas. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging proved that the mass was cystic. The mass was surgically removed. The diagnosis was pancreatic solid cystic papillary epithelial neoplasm. Although acute pancreatitis due to SPT was exceptionally reported, this is the first description of SPT leading to recurrent pancreatitis especially in children.
