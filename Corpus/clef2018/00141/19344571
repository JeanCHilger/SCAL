Semiautomatic landmark-based two-dimensional-three-dimensional image fusion in living mice: correlation of near-infrared fluorescence imaging of Cy5.5-labeled antibodies with flat-panel volume computed tomography. Connecting fluorescence signals with anatomic structures enhances our ability to monitor biologic processes in mice. Here, we present a semiautomated approach to correlate two-dimensional (2D) noninvasive near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with three-dimensional (3D), high-resolution, flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT). We developed an algorithm to colocalize fluorescence signals of NIRF-labeled antibodies directed against matriptase and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) to orthotopic carcinomas in mice visualized by fpVCT. For this purpose, mice were anesthetized and fixed on a multimodality animal bed containing fiducial markers filled with iodine-containing contrast agent and fluorescent dye. After intravenous administration of contrast agent and Cy5.5-labeled antibodies, NIRF and fpVCT images were obtained, without repositioning the mice. Binding of Cy5.5-labeled matriptase-specific antibody to pancreatic tumors and Cy5.5-labeled uPAR-specific antibody to mammary carcinomas was assessed by time-domain NIRF imaging measuring the location of fluorescence intensity and its lifetime. In summary, we developed a novel 2D-3D registration technique for image fusion with NIRF imaging and fpVCT to provide complementary information in tumor models on the in vivo association of functional information with anatomic structures. The combination of fpVCT with NIRF imaging will now allow targeted and effective monitoring of preclinical tumor therapies.
