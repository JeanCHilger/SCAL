Endoscopic necrosectomy of organized pancreatic necrosis: a currently practiced NOTES procedure. Endoscopic necrosectomy is now an established minimally invasive method for treatment of organized pancreatic necrosis.Review of methods and results of endoscopic treatment of pancreatic necrosis.Reports by multiple groups have demonstrated favorable results of endoscopic necrosectomy. The mortality of critically ill patients undergoing endoscopic treatment in several series is approximately 10%. Some patients will eventually also require surgery for situations such as complete pancreatic duct disruption, but even in these cases endoscopic necrosectomy is useful because pancreatic surgery can often be delayed until the patient is stable.Endoscopic necrosectomy will likely assume an increasing role in the treatment of pancreatic necrosis. This should result in reduced morbidity and mortality in these critically ill patients.
