Ultrasound and CT findings in hepatic and pancreatic parenchyma in acute schistosomiasis. A case of acute toxaemic schistosomiasis is presented. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenomegaly, heterogeneous hepatic parenchyma and heterogeneous focal lesions in the pancreas. CT confirmed lymph node enlargement and hepatosplenomegaly, and showed multiple small focal nodular lesions in the liver and focal lesions in the pancreas. To our knowledge, this is the first description of pancreatic lesions associated with acute Schistosoma mansoni infection.
