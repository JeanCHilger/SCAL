The detection and prognosis of small pancreatic carcinoma. During a period of 16 years, 203 proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas were studied. Tumor size was measured on either the resected or the autopsy specimen. Four tumors were smaller than 1 cm, and 17 tumors were between 1.1 and 2 cm. ERCP has been found to be the most accurate in the diagnosis of small pancreatic carcinoma. Followup of 44 patients in whom the tumor was resected showed that survival depended on tumor size. In four patients with tumors smaller than 1 cm without parenchymal invasion, the postoperative 5-yr cumulative survival rate was 100%. Pancreatic carcinoma smaller than 1 cm limited to duct epithelium is considered as early cancer. Various diagnostic imaging modalities are now available to evaluate patients in whom pancreatic carcinoma is clinically suspected. These include ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and angiography. More recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and peroral pancreatic ductal biopsy also have been used. This report compares diagnostic modalities for pancreatic carcinoma in order to provide a data base for their rational use in the diagnosis of small resectable pancreatic carcinomas.
