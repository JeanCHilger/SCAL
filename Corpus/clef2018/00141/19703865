Main pancreatic duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: accuracy of MR imaging in differentiation between benign and malignant tumors compared with histopathologic analysis. To retrospectively determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging combined with MR cholangiopancreatography (CP) in differentiating benign from malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) involving the main pancreatic duct (MPD), with histopathologic analysis as the reference standard.The informed consent requirement was waived for this institutional review board-approved study. A total of 51 patients with histopathologically proved IPMNs (MPD IPMN, n = 29 mixed type IPMN, n = 22), underwent MR imaging, MR CP, and surgery, with a mean interval of 2.6 months between MR examination and surgery. Qualitative image analysis included assessment of the site of MPD dilatation (head of the pancreas, body and/or tail of the pancreas, or diffuse), presence or absence of duct wall nodules, and contrast enhancement of the MPD walls. Quantitative image analysis included measurement of the maximum diameter of the MPD. A comparison of adenomas and borderline IPMNs with cancerous IPMNs was performed with the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.At histopathologic analysis, 27 IPMNs were classified as carcinomas 13, as borderline tumorsDuct wall nodules and enhancement of the MPD walls are signs of malignant MPD or mixed type IPMNs.http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.2531080604/-/DC1.
