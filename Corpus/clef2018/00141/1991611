Cystic tumors of the pancreas: evaluation by ultrasonography and computed tomography. The personal series of 30 cystic tumors of the pancreas [12 serous cystic tumors (SCT) and 18 mucinous cystic tumors (MCT)] is presented. All neoplasms were evaluated with ultrasonography (US) 28 of 30 with computed tomography (CT) the tumoral histotype could be correctly defined in 73% of cases (seven of 12 SCT and 15 of 18 MCT). Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with diagnostic aims (preparation of cytological smears and/or biochemical assays) was performed in only 10 of 30 cases, yielding a 100% sensitivity
