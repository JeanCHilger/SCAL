Primary hydatid cyst of the pancreas. Hydatid cyst of the pancreas is rare, accounting for less than 1% of the various sites of hydatid disease, even in countries where echinococcosis is endemic. We report a case of pancreatic hydatid cyst to increase awareness for this important condition.We describe a 33-year-old male with abdominal discomfort of one-year duration. On abdominal examination, there was mild tenderness with fullness in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory investigations revealed no abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a cystic mass over the head of the pancreas. Abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of a solitary cyst in the pancreatic head, with no enhancement on contrast CT. Indirect hemagglutination test for hydatid disease was negative. A pre-operative diagnosis of cystic neoplasm of the pancreas was made and laparotomy was done on exploration there was a cystic mass arising from the head of the pancreas. A pericystectomy was carried out and the diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the pancreas was confirmed by histopathology. The postoperative period was uneventful and no recurrence was seen after 2 years of follow-up.Pancreatic hydatidosis, though very rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions in the appropriate epidaemiological setting.
