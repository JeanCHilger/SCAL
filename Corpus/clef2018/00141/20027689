Carcinoma of the papilla of Vater following treatment of pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) is frequently associated with biliary cancer due to reflux of pancreatic enzymes into the choledochus, and even after surgery to correct the PBM such patients still have a risk of residual bile duct cancer. Here, we report the case of a 59-year-old female with carcinoma of the papilla of Vater which developed 2.5 years after choledochoduodenostomy for PBM. During the postoperative follow-up period, computed tomography obtained 2 years after the first operation demonstrated a tumor in the distal end of the choledochus, although she did not have jaundice and laboratory tests showed no abnormalities caused by the previous operation. As a result, carcinoma of the papilla of Vater was diagnosed at an early stage, followed by surgical cure. For early detection of periampullary cancer in patients undergoing surgery for PBM, careful long-term follow-up is needed.
