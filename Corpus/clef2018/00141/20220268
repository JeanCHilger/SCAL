Chronic anemia due to watermelon stomach. Antral gastric vascular ectasia is a rare cause of chronic anemia. When encountered, the diagnosis is usually delayed. Endoscopic findings are well established, although radiologic findings are not. Patients respond well to surgery. Our case was of a 62-year-old female with chronic anemia who required multiple blood transfusions and iron replacement therapy, without significant response. Computed tomography revealed a focal thickening of the gastric antrum. Endoscopy showed vascular ectasia between the antrum and corpus. The patient underwent gastrectomy. We reviewed the literature on gastric angiodysplasia and have presented our unique tomography findings in this first report on a novel association between ectopic pancreas and gastric angiodysplasia.
