Acute gastrointestinal bleeding as a complication of pancreatic pseudocysts. We report on 6 patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts, operated on for acute bleeding into the cyst. The splenic artery and vein, the renal artery, the aorta and the splenic parenchyma were identified as bleeding sites. In 4 patients the acute hemorrhage occurred during hospitalization. In all patients the operative procedure included hemostasis and/or drainage/resection of the cyst. In 3 cases an additional splenectomy was performed. None of the patients died postoperatively. In 5 patients the pancreatitis was induced by alcohol abuse. In all patients the pseudocysts were diagnosed prior to the acute hemorrhage. CT-scan and angiography were able to localize the origin of the bleeding in 2 cases.
