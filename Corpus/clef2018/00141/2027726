Sarcoma botryoides of the common bile duct: preoperative diagnosis by coronal CT and PTC. Sarcoma botryoides of the extrahepatic bile ducts is a rare cause of obstructive jaundice in the pediatric population. It is rarely diagnosed preoperatively. We present a case of this tumor which was diagnosed by ultrasound, computerised tomography and PTC. Coronal CT sections were particularly useful in demonstrating the relationship of the tumor to the porta hepatis, pancreas and duodenum.
