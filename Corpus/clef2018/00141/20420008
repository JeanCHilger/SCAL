Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: diagnostic significance in malignant diseases of bile and pancreatic ducts. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MR CP) is a relatively new, noninvasive method in patients with pancreaticobiliary diseases, which is comparable to invasive endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). One of the most common indications for MRCP is malignant obstruction of the bile and pancreatic ducts. Standard imaging protocol includes routine abdominal study followed by a sequence for MRCP adapted to each of the patients and site of the malignant process. MRCP is a simple to perform, does not exposure the patients to radiation, requires no anesthesia, is less operator dependent and allows better visualization of ducts proximal to an obstruction. Thus, during one examination only, it is possible to assess not only pancreaticobiliary system but also abdominal structures, which increases diagnostic value of MR and is therefore, optimal method in evaluation of these patients.
