Fish bone penetration of the duodenum extending into the pancreas: report of a case. We report a case of fish bone penetration of the duodenum extending into the pancreatic head, which was successfully treated by surgery. A 73-year-old woman was admitted with upper abdominal dull pain that had persisted for 3 days. Computed tomography showed a linear calcified body, which appeared to penetrate the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb into the pancreatic head. A laparotomy was performed based on the preoperative diagnosis of localized peritonitis caused by penetration of the duodenum into the pancreas by an ingested foreign body. The foreign body was safely removed from both the pancreas and duodenum and was found to be a fish bone, measuring 4 cm in length. Neither an abscess nor hematoma was detected at the site of the pancreatic head. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of fish bone penetration of the duodenum with a migration to the pancreas.
