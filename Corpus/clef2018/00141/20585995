True aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal arteries: a single institution experience. True pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysm is a rare but potentially fatal disease. The aim of this study was to make recommendations for management of true PDA aneurysm.True aneurysms of the PDA were diagnosed at our institution between 1996 and 2007 and analyzed retrospectively, for clinical presentation, management, and outcome.Eight patients were admitted to our institution for true aneurysms of the PDA. Five patients had aneurysmal rupture, and three were asymptomatic. In the rupture group, computed tomography (CT) showed the retroperitoneal hematoma around the pancreas and aneurysm, ranging from 5 to 25 mm (median, 12 mm). In the non-rupture group, CT revealed saccular aneurysm, ranging from 10 to 20 mm (median, 16 mm). The celiac axis was occluded in two patients, stenotic in four, and normal in two. Two patients underwent laparotomy, and we finally performed transcatheter arterial embolization in seven. All patients are alive, and there is no evidence of recurrence after median follow-up of 6 years.We recommend treatment of all true PDA aneurysms at the time of diagnosis. True PDA aneurysm with celiac artery stenosis or occlusion requires precise techniques for embolization to preserve blood flow in the celiac artery territory.
