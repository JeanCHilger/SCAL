Retroperitoneal liposarcoma: a case report. A 35-year-old woman who had visited an other hospital because of epigastralgia and anorexia was found to have a giant abdominal tumor, and was referred to our hospital. On admission, the abdomen was markedly distended. Abdominal CT scan and MRI showed the presence of a retroperitoneal tumor which occupied almost the entire abdominal cavity. She was operated a under a diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma. The tumor was located between the subphrenic space and the pelvic cavity, and was compressing the stomach, duodenum, pancreas and colon. Removal of the retroperitoneal tumor, including the right kidney, was performed. The resected tumor was 34 × 28 × 20 cm, weighed 5.5 kg and showed a variety of finding. The pathological diagnosis was a mixed type of retroperitoneal liposarcoma, consisting of well-differentiated type and myxoid type. We reported a case of giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma, with a review of the literature.
