Diagnosis of pancreatic plasmacytoma by endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration. Plasmacytoma presents more frequently in middle age men with aerodigestive tract involvement, especially in the head and the neck. Gastrointestinal tract involvement is uncommon, but the organ most commonly involved is the stomach. We report the first case in the literature in which final diagnosis was made by fine- needle aspiration biopsy guided by endoscopic ultrasound with adequate sample for pathologic analysis. The treatment of this entity is systemic chemotherapy but its effectiveness is limited. Plasmacytoma should be taken into account in differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses.
