Extraparietal or lymphatic late relapse of neoplasms: confirmation by means of EUS-FNA key for the treatment. After treatment intended to cure systemic neoplasms, a series of monitoring strategies are followed.To analyse our experience in confirming the cases of lymphatic or extraparietal relapse in areas accessible to endoscopic ultrasonography plus fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in long-term monitoring (>1 year of treatment for the primary neoplasm) and define what implications have been derived with regards histopathological confirmation in relation to treatment.Retrospective analysis was made of all EUS-FNA carried out in our Endoscopy Unit during the period from 1/07/2007 to 28/02/2010 by means of searches in the Endobase (Olympus) database. Medical records of patients and drug therapy were reviewed in order to check the chemotherapy used in each case.From a total of 154 EUS-FNA carried out in our service, we have detected histopathological confirmation of malignancy in primary neoplasm treated with initial curative intention at least 1 year before. Locations were: esophageal extraparietal involvement of a squamous cell carcinoma (one patient), perirectal adenopathy of rectal adenocarcinoma (one patient), multiple lymphatic relapse of melanoma (two patients), perigastric adenopathy relapse of gastric adenocarcinoma (one patient), pancreatic head mass secondary to initial breast ductal carcinoma (one patient). In all cases, this fact has involved a directed treatment: surgery (one patient), radiotherapy (one patient), chemotherapy (four patients).Confirmation by means of EUS-FNA of late relapse in any section of the digestive tract allowed a treatment to be carried out by surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.
