Magnetic resonance imaging surveillance detects early-stage pancreatic cancer in carriers of a p16-Leiden mutation. Surveillance of high-risk groups for pancreatic cancer might increase early detection and treatment outcomes. Individuals with germline mutations in p16-Leiden have a lifetime risk of 15% to 20% of developing pancreatic cancer. We assessed the feasibility of detecting pancreatic cancer at an early stage and investigated the outcomes of patients with neoplastic lesions.Individuals with germline mutations in p16-Leiden (N = 79 31 maleAfter a median follow-up period of 4 years (range, 0-10 years), pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 7 patients (9%). The mean age at diagnosis was 59 years (range, 49-72 years). Three of the tumors were present at the first examination, and 4 were detected after a negative result in the initial examination. All 7 patients had a resectable lesion 5 underwent surgery, 3 had an R0 resection, and 2 had lymph node metastases. Possible precursor lesions (ie, duct ectasias, based on MRCP) were found in 9 individuals (11%).MRI/MRCP detects small, solid pancreatic tumors and small duct ectasias. Although surveillance increases the rate of resectability, carriers of a p16-Leiden mutation develop aggressive tumors.
