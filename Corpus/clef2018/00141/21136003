Duodenal duplication cyst communicating with the main pancreatic duct. A rare cause of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Duodenal duplication cysts (DDC) are rare congenital anomalies. They are usually seen in infancy and childhood. However, rarely it can also present in adulthood. It presents as a cystic or tubular mass, which can be communicating or non-communicating. Total excision is the ideal surgical procedure. However, if total excision is not feasible, subtotal excision and cystoduodenostomy should be carried out. We present a 13-year-girl with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of DDC was suspected by abdominal CT, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. She was successfully treated with subtotal excision and intraduodenal cystoduodenostomy. Operative findings and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis. Diagnostic modalities and management options for DDC are discussed along with recommendations and review of the literature.
