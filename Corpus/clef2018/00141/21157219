Imaging diagnosis of post-ERCP focal pancreatitis mimicking pancreatic carcinoma by follow-up F-18 FDG PET/CT. Pancreatitis is the most common complication of diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The incidence of clinical post-ERCP pancreatitis is about 5%. The authors describe a case of 60-year-old man who developed an unusual focal, instead of usual diffuse pancreatitis after diagnostic ERCP. F-18 FDG PET/CT in 3 days after ERCP detected focal FDG uptake because of pancreatitis, and the diagnosis was confirmed by spontaneous resolution of the lesion on 1-week follow-up PET/CT study.
