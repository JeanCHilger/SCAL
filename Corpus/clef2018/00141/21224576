Non-functional pancreatic endocrine carcinoma with multiple liver metastases--a case report. A 60-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of upper abdominal discomfort and body weight loss. Abdominal CT showed multiple liver tumors with early enhancement and delayed washout. There were no abnormal findings in other organs. IVR-CT showed hypervascular masses, but it is not a typical tumor staining of HCC. To obtain the diagnosis, we performed laparoscopic partial liver resection in the left lateral segment. Histological examination suggested a primary hepatic carcinoid a tumor. But primary hepatic carcinoid tumor is comparatively rare, so we underwent further examinations. Two months later after the liver resection, the tumor of pancreatic tail was detected by CT and MRI. We could obtain the diagnosis of pancreatic endocrine tumor by EUS-FNA. We conducted a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and partial colonic resection. She had no symptom related to neuroendocrinology. The final diagnosis was non-functional endocrine carcinoma of pancreas. After that, we added extended right hepatic lobectomy with radiofrequency ablation in left lobe. The woman remains alive without a recurrence after the surgery.
