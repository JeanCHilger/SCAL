Gastroenterological endoscopy. Endoscopy is often used in gastroenterology. It can prevent early recurrence of bleeding from esophageal varices. Computed virtual chromoendoscopy can diagnose pathological changes at the esophagogastric transitional zone in non-erosive reflux disease. In the buried bumper syndrome the internal bumper, which has migrate into the gastric wall, should be removed endoscopically. Double-balloon enteroscopy is one of the flexible enteroscopy techniques with an acceptable complication rate and remains the diagnostic and therapeutic gold standard for small bowel endoscopy. Hyperplastic polypoidal lesions of more than 1 cm in the colon should be removed, because it is not possible to distinguish definitively between hyperplastic polyps and serrated adenoma. Endoscopic ultrasound of the biliary tract makes it possible to remove biliary tract stones cost-effectively and without radiology. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided necrosectomy of the pancreas has become the standard method and has replaced percutaneous drainage and operative intervention.
