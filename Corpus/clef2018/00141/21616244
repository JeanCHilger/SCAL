Surgery or endoscopy to treat duodenal duplications in children. Gastrointestinal duplications (duodenal duplications [DDs]) are a rare congenital malformation generally located in or adjacent to the medial border of the duodenal wall. The goal of therapy is surgical excision. Conservative endoscopic management represents an alternative option.The aim of the study was to highlight the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in guiding the endoscopic or surgical treatment of DD.Between 2002 and 2010, 6 patients (2 male mean age, 7.83 yearsAfter EUS evaluation, endoscopic treatment was successfully performed in 4 patients, 2 of whom required surgical treatment. Bleeding occurred in 1 patient after endoscopic resection and in 1 patient after surgery. The mean follow-up time without pathologic signs was 3.3 years (range, 0.25-8).Endoscopic ultrasound can effectively guide surgical or endoscopic therapies. Bleeding is a possible complication.
