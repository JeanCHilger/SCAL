Synchronous ectopic pancreatoblastoma in a child: a case report. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare primary pancreatic neoplasm of children that may arise in any portion of the pancreas. We report a case of a 3-yr-old boy who presented to with abdominal pain our hospital and a progressive bulge in his right abdomen. Biochemical evaluation and serum levels of tumoral markers were within reference limits. On the computed tomography, two tumors were found. One located in the head of the pancreas however, a laparotomy revealed that the head of pancreas was compressed but normal. The other was in the left abdomen near the spleen and the tail of the pancreas. The diagnosis of two synchronous pancreatoblastoma originating from the omentum was confirmed by pathology. Therefore, a pancreatoblastoma should be considered when a large well-defined, lobulated, and heterogeneous mass is identified in the pancreas of children. In addition, an ectopic pancreatoblastoma should be considered when identified within or near the ectopic pancreatic tissue.
