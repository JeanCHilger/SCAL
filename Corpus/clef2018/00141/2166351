Insulinoma in a black South African. A case report. A 69-year-old black woman with an insulinoma presented with recurrent episodes of sweating and confusion culminating in two episodes of hypoglycaemic coma. The diagnosis was confirmed by finding an inappropriately elevated serum insulin level in the presence of hypoglycaemia after a fast of 14 hours. Computed tomography revealed a large tumour in the head of the pancreas. Removal of the tumour necessitated partial resection of the head and body of the pancreas, which in turn necessitated certain repair and drainage procedures. Postoperative complications, while not insignificant, were acceptable. At 1-year follow-up the patient is well.
