A case of spindle cell type anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas -review of Japanese case report-. We present a case of spindle cell type anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas in a 63-year-old woman. A pancreatic mass was incidentally detected by routine abdominal ultrasonography examination for her hepatitis B infection, and she was admitted to our hospital for further examination. Computed tomography revealed a hypo-vascular mass measuring 25mm in maximal dimension at the pancreas body. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass as the pancreas body and a swollen lymph node near the tumor. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed disruption of the main pancreatic duct, and carcinoma cells were detected in pancreatic juice obtained via an endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube. We diagnosed this case as an invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas body, therefore the distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (D1+Î±) was performed. The histopathological diagnosis for this case was a "spindle cell type anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas". The patient has remained well with no evidence of recurrence for 9 months since her operation.
