From the Archives of the AFIP. Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. Microcystic adenoma is a benign pancreatic neoplasm typically seen in elderly women. Presenting symptoms and signs such as pain, weight loss, jaundice, and a palpable mass are usually observed, but the lesion may be incidental and does not necessarily require excision. The tumor is generally large and well demarcated. It contains innumerable small cysts, giving it a honeycombed appearance. On computed tomographic scans, the hypervascular tumor has attenuation values close to those of water before contrast material is administered, but it usually enhances afterward. On sonograms, it is often predominantly echogenic, although some larger cysts may be seen. A calcified central scar may be seen with either modality.
