Peroral endoscopical diagnosis for the early stage of cancer in bilio-pancreatic system. PCPS (peroral cholangio-pancreatoscopy), a modality of mother and baby scope systems, was very useful for the diagnoses of bile duct tumors. The endoscopical findings and pathological findings obtained on the biopsy specimen collected under the direct view were valuable. For the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases, PMPS (peroral micro-pancreatoscopy), in which ultrathin quartz fibers are used for the baby scope, was useful. By this method, we could observe the inside of the pancreatic duct through an untreated normal papilla. This is very helpful for endoscopical diagnosis of small pancreatic cancers. EUS (endoscopic ultrasonography) was also a useful method for the diagnosis of small pancreatic cancers. EUS could draw the three layers of the common bile duct and gall bladder walls, and could distinguish a cholesterol polyp from a non-cholesterolic one. Combined application of these methods will aid in the discovery of early stages of cancers in the bilio-pancreatic system.
