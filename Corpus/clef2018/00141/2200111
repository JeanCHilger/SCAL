Pancreatitis-induced pseudocysts of the spleen: a rare complication. Secondary splenic cysts usually occur following blunt abdominal trauma. In rare cases, the spleen can be affected in pancreatitis. Since the clinical findings are fairly uncharacteristic, this was a difficult diagnosis to make before imaging examination techniques became available. These cysts only became apparent as a result of their complications. Today, thanks to sonography and abdominal CT-scan, these cysts can be detected in their asymptomatic stage. Furthermore, interventional sonography allows the puncture and drainage of these cysts, and this technique is thus an alternative to surgery. Two cases of pancreatitis with splenic involvement are presented.
