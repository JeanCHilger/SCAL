Chronic pancreatitis in 2011. The incidence of chronic pancreatitis grows slowly but steadily. At present, alcohol is the most frequent risk factor, although the new forms of so called non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, such as genetically induced pancreatitis and its autoimmune variety, are carefully watched. Alcohol consumption continues to be most closely associated with the disease, though it is no more than a risk factor and other aspects, e.g., genetic predisposition, are prerequisite to the disease development. Imaging methods play a fundamental role in diagnosing the disease non-invasive magnetic resonance and CT, invasive but safe endosonography, and diagnostically rarely used ECRP that, because of its invasive nature, is currently predominantly used for therapeutic purposes. Genetic markers are also exploited, including CFTR mutation, SPINK 1 and PRRS 1 gene, immunoglobulin G4 in the autoimmune form of the disease as well as, alternatively, pancreatic biopsy. Disease symptoms, i.e., pancreatic malabsorption (enzymes with high lipase content) and pancreatic pain are treated conservatively, with paracetamol as the first line therapy for pain followed, if necessary, by so called synaptic analgesics. Alternatively, endoscopic techniques (drainage) or surgery (drainage and resection) are applied. Hereditary and non-hereditary chronic pancreatitis is among the risk factors for pancreatic cancer and thus patients with these diseases should be closely followed up.
