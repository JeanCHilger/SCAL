The place of ERCP in pancreatic diagnosis. The change caused by sonography and computed tomography. Based on 1099 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms (ERCP), 659 examinations conducted in 1973-1980 prior to the introduction of computed tomography (CT) and 440 performed in 1988-1989, the impact of sonography and CT on ERCP is studied. The availability of CT did not cause any significant change in the frequency of and indications for ERCP. The rate of successful ERCP examinations increased from 73.6% to 92%. Complications occurred in 2.3%, and the mortality rate was 0.4% and was similar in both periods. ERCP was the third imaging procedure, being applied after sonography and CT, in most patients. The diagnostic value of ERCP in pancreatic disease is compared with that of sonography and CT in 116 patients with histologically or clinically proven diagnosis. The sensitivity is 79% for ERCP and 78% for CT. Indeterminate findings were recorded in 11% of the ERCP and 8% of the CT examinations these rates can be decreased by complementary use of both imaging modalities.
