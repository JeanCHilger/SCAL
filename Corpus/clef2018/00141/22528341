A case of extrapancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumor in the retroperitoneum. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) is an uncommon epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas. Very rarely it has also been described outside the pancreas. We report such a case located in the right adrenal site in a 37-year-old woman, describing the computed tomography features of the neoplasm. The image features of extrapancreatic SPT in our case are compatible with those of conventional pancreatic SPTs. Although it is still difficult to make an accurate preoperative diagnosis of an extrapancreatic SPT, the presence of an encapsulated solid and cystic mass especially with widely distributed calcifications is at least suggestive of the diagnosis. Being aware of the rare occurrence of primary SPT outside the pancreas may help improve the diagnostic specificity of the disease.
