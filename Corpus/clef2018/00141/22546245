Autoimmune pancreatitis and non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis: computed tomography pattern. To retrospectively differentiate diffuse autoimmune pancreatitis from non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis at clinical onset with multi detector row computed tomography.36 Patients suffering from diffuse autoimmune pancreatitis (14) or non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis (22) were enrolled. Qualitative analysis included stranding, retroperitoneal fluid film, capsule-like rim enhancement and pleural effusion. In quantitative analysis pancreatic density was measured in all phases. The vascularization behaviour was assessed using the relative enhancement rate across all phases.Pancreatic density resulted lower in non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis compared to diffuse autoimmune pancreatitis patients in pre-contrast phase and higher in pancreatic phase. Relative enhancement rate evaluation confirmed different vascularization behaviours of the two diseases. Only non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis Patients presented peripancreatic stranding and fluid in the retromesenteric interfascial plane.Multi detector row computed tomography is a useful technique for differentiating diffuse autoimmune pancreatitis from non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis at clinical onset. Peripancreatic stranding and retroperitoneal fluid film, characteristic of non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis, and late-phase peripheral rim enhancement, characteristic of diffuse autoimmune pancreatitis, provide qualitative clues to the differentiation. A quantitative study of contrast enhancement patterns, considering the relative enhancement rate, can assist in the differential diagnoses of two diseases.
