Diagnosis and treatment of traumatic injuries of the duodenum and pancreas: 21 cases. Twenty one consecutive patients who sustained injuries to the duodenum or/and pancreas were admitted to our hospital over a ten year period. Sixteen blunt injuries and 5 penetrating injuries were encountered. Penetrating injuries were always suspected and treated by time following blunt injury diagnostic delay was encountered in 7 patients and insufficient surgical procedure because of intraoperative misinterpretation in 2 patients. Most of the patients had associated intra-abdominal organ injuries. Adjuncts to diagnosis such as abdominal roentgenograms, serum amylase levels and gastroduodenography were not helpful. CT-Scan and ultrasound allowed to confirm the suspected diagnosis in 3 cases only. Intraoperative diagnosis was also challenging. Complete mobilization of the structures surrounding the duodenum and the pancreas to provide entire exposure was necessary. In 6 patients treated first in a peripheral hospital, diagnosis of the injury have been missed at first laparotomy and reoperation was necessary in all of them. Suture closure of the duodenum and drainage of the pancreatic region were the most common reparative technique used. More complicated procedures with pancreatic and/or duodenal resection were performed in 6 patients. Overall mortality in patients surviving more than 24 hours was 14% (suture line dehiscence after delayed operation and one death due to brain injury).
