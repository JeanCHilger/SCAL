Cystic neoplasms of the exocrine pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare and their diagnosis and treatment can be difficult. This report details 7 patients who had histologically proven serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystadenoma and cystadeno carcinoma. Computed tomography and sonography allowed excellent preoperative assessment but to attempt a distinction between the histological variants may be hazardous. Two tumours were only autopsy findings and 5 patients underwent laparotomy. It is confirmed that potentially malignant mucinous cystadenomas and cytadenocarcinomas should be resected whenever possible serous cystadenomas are always benign and should therefore be resected only when the diagnosis is doubtful or if they cause symptoms.
