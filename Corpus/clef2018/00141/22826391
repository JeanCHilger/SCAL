Pancreatic imaging mimics: part 2, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and their mimics. This pictorial essay reviews the imaging appearance of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as a number of mimics on CT.Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have a distinct appearance, typically characterized by a well-defined hypervascular mass best visualized on arterial phase images. However, a number of other lesions can mimic the CT appearance of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, including pancreatic metastases, acinar cell carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, pancreatic hamartoma, serous adenoma, intrapancreatic splenules, exophytic gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and peripancreatic paragangliomas.
