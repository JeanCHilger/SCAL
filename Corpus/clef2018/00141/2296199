Cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas: neo-adjuvant therapy and CEA monitoring. Cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas is generally considered to be unresponsive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We present two cases of laparotomy-proven unresectable cystadenocarcinoma which responded to intravenous 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m2/24 hr x 5 days x 2) and 4,000 rads of radiation therapy. Both patients had objective response with marked shrinkage of the tumor as determined by clinical examination and computed tomography. At reexploration both tumors had become completely resectable with histologically clear margins and negative lymph nodes. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were elevated in both patients at initial presentation (86 and 71 ng/ml). The CEA levels declined to 19.9 and 66.0 ng/ml, respectively, after neo-adjuvant therapy, and both fell to normal levels after resection. Although surgical resection has been considered the only curative therapy for patients with pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma, we suggest that preoperative irradiation and chemotherapy may reduce the size of seemingly unresectable tumors. We also recommend serial CEA determinations in patients with levels initially elevated as a marker of the response to neo-adjuvant and operative therapy.
