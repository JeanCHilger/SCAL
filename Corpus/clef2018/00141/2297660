Role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in differentiating pancreatic cancer coexisting with chronic pancreatitis. The pancreatographic appearance and the clinical presentation of ten patients presenting with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas coexisting with chronic pancreatitis were compared with those of 45 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), without malignancy, investigated at the same time period. All ten patients, had typical pancreatographic findings of CP, combined with an elongated narrowing of the duct of Wirsung. Marked localized irregularity of the adjacent main duct and of side branches were found in all ten patients. Such findings were not detected in the other 45 patients with CP only. Ultrasonography or computed tomography have detected a definite pancreatic mass in only five of these patients, and in six patients with CP without malignancy. It is concluded that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is highly accurate in detecting pancreatic cancer coexisting with CP. It is primarily helpful in elderly patients having severe degrees of CP to rule out cancer.
