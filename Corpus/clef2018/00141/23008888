Pancreatico pleural fistula: an unusual complication of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatico-pleural fistula secondary to chronic pancreatitis is a rare cause of pleural effusion. This case report presents a case of a middle aged female, a known case of chronic pancreatitis who presented with severe epigastric pain and progressive shortness of breath. CT and MRCP were useful in visualising the fistulous communication between the pancreas and pleural cavity. Treatment consisted of ERCP placement of a pancreatic stent, which facilitated internal drainage of pancreatic fluid thus resolving the pleural effusion and promoting healing of the fistula.
