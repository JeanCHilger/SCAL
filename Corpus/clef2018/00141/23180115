Pancreatic metastases of cerebellar hemangiopericytoma occurring 24 years after initial presentation: report of a case. Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) preferentially developing in soft tissues and the meninges has been gradually recognized to be an aggressive, highly metastatic tumor. We herein report the case of a 65-year-old male with pancreatic metastases of cerebellar HPC that developed following two resections of intracranial local recurrent foci, 24 years after the initial craniotomy and 7 years after resection of metastases to the lungs and kidneys. Follow-up abdominal computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solitary tumor in the pancreatic body. Since no other recurrent foci were detectable, distal pancreatectomy was performed. Another metastasis was incidentally found in the resected pancreas. Both foci were pathologically proven to be metastases of HPC. Among the 12 reported cases of pancreatic metastases of HPC, including ours, this case showed the longest duration between initial onset and the development of pancreatic metastases, suggesting that providing long-term follow-up is necessary for HPC patients.
