Role of CT in evaluation of the extension of pancreatic cancer. CT findings of 39 lesions from 37 cases of pancreas cancer were correlated with surgical and/or pathological findings. Each finding was recorded following "General rules for surgical and pathological studies on cancer of pancreas" proposed by Japanese pancreatic society. CT employed in this study is Somatom II (Siemens) with scan time of 5 seconds and slice thickness of 8 mm. Contrast study with bolus injection of contrast medium is a basic procedure in all the cases. The results are as follows: 1) T factor (size of the tumor) was underestimated in 9 lesions, no overestimation was observed. It is because that the contrast enhancement surrounding low density was not included in the size of the tumor. 2) No positive results were observed in lymph node group of #17, but many false positives in #12. Results of diagnosis of lymph nodes metastasis was poor, the total accuracy was 65.5%. 3) CT was very effective in the diagnosis of V factor, total accuracy was 95.5%. 4) In S (serosal invasion) and RP (retroperitoneal infiltration) factors, the total accuracy was 81.0%, and 87.1% respectively, when the protrusions into and the disappearance of the surrounding fat plane were taken into account. 5) CT is not effective in the diagnosis of CH (bile duct invasion) factor, because of non-differentiation between compression and invasion from the surrounding pancreas tumor. 6) Results of CT were good in Du (duodenal invasion) factor. 7) Finally, it was concluded that CT is effective in the staging diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
