Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) manifestations of the normal duodenal papilla. This study aimed to investigate Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) manifestations of the normal duodenal papilla, thereby improving the knowledge on the CT manifestations of the normal anatomy of the duodenal papilla.A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the CT results of 70 normal duodenal papilla cases examined by 64-MDCT. The analysis particularly focused on the position, size, morphology, and enhancement pattern of the duodenal papilla, as well as the ampulla of Vater.In axial images, the average base diameter of the duodenal papilla was (7.3 ± 1.4)mm, whereas the average height was (6.5 ± 1.8)mm. Majority of the duodenal papilla (52.9%, 37/70) showed a round shape. In most cases (97.1%, 68/70), the duodenal papilla were located at the middle and lower third of the descending duodenum. In 84.3% of the cases (59/70), the arterial phase enhanced CT scan images were optimal for the visualization of the papilla. The "target sign" could be clearly identified from arterial phase images in 71.4% (50/70) of the cases. In 72.9% (51/70) of the cases, the ampulla of Vater had a common channel (Y type).64-MDCT can clearly visualize the normal anatomy of the duodenal papilla and surrounding structures, thereby providing valuable information for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in this region.
