Combined resection of the inferior vena cava for hepato-biliary and pancreatic malignancies. Seven cases of hepato-biliary and pancreatic malignancies that underwent partial resection of the inferior vena cava) were reviewed. Histological findings of inferior venca cava involvement were direct invasion in 5 cases, tumor thrombus in 1 case, and adhesion in 1 case. Correct preoperative diagnosis of inferior vena cava involvement was made in only 2 cases. A retrospective study on enhanced CT revealed that irregular deformity of the inferior vena cava had suggested inferior vena cava involvement. Total occlusion of the inferior vena cava was employed temporarily for inferior vena cava resection in 3 cases. A saphenous vein graft was used for reconstruction in 2 cases. Complications due to inferior vena cava resection are, as yet, unknown. One patient is alive, without recurrence, 24 months after the operation. One case underwent re-resection of liver metastasis, and is alive 17 months after the operation. Although advanced hepato-biliary and pancreatic malignancies involving inferior vena cava have been regarded as having a poor prognosis, an aggressive surgical approach may be applicable in some cases.
