Characterization of focal pancreatic lesions using normalized apparent diffusion coefficient at 1.5-Tesla: preliminary experience. To compare the capabilities of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and normalized ADC using the pancreatic parenchyma as reference organ in the characterization of focal pancreatic lesions.Thirty-six patients with focal pancreatic lesions (malignant, n=18 benign tumors, n=10Significant differences in ADC values were found between malignant (1.150 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) and benign tumors (2.493 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) (P=0.004) and between benign tumors and mass-forming pancreatitis (1.160 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) (P=0.0005) but not between malignant tumors and mass-forming pancreatitis (P=0.1092). Using normalized ADC, significant differences were found between malignant tumors (0.933 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s), benign tumors (1.807 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) and mass-forming pancreatitis (0.839 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) (P<0.0001).Our preliminary results suggest that normalizing ADC of focal pancreatic lesions with ADC of apparently normal adjacent pancreatic parenchyma provides higher degrees of characterization of focal pancreatic lesions than the conventional ADC does.
