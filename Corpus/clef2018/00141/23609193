TL-118-anti-angiogenic treatment in pancreatic cancer: a case report. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors. In recent years, little progress has been made in understanding and treatment of the disease. The two most commonly used chemotherapy drugs approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are gemcitabine and fluorouracil. Anti-angiogenic treatment is one of the current promising approaches in cancer translational research. Its aim is to inhibit development of new blood vessels and thereby prevent further tumor growth. We present a first description of a pancreatic cancer patient treated with standard chemotherapy and TL-118, an anti-angiogenic combination of 4 drugs that target non-overlapping aspects of the angiogenic process (Provided by Tiltan Pharma Ltd for compassionate use). Our patient, treated with standard chemotherapy combined with TL-118, was diagnosed about 16 months ago and is still considered progression free, while being treated with that combination. Moreover, when the treatment with TL-118 was stopped, there was a clear elevation of tumor marker which dropped again with the renewal of TL-118. This effect was not achieved by gemcitabine treatment alone. Recently, a phase II clinical trial of TL-118 for pancreatic cancer patients that have not yet been treated with chemotherapy was initiated. (Tiltan Pharma Ltd). The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TL-118 in gemcitabine-treated metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. This report describes a new approach in treating pancreatic cancer, enabling patients to obtain a longer progression-free survival using this new anti-angiogenic drug combination, added on standard chemotherapy.
