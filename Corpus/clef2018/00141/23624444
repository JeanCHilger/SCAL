Diagnosis and management of pancreaticopleural fistula. Pancreaticopleural fistula is a rare diagnosis requiring a high index of clinical suspicion due to the predominant manifestation of thoracic symptoms. The current literature suggests that confirmation of elevated pleural fluid amylase is the most important diagnostic test. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is the recommended imaging modality to visualise the fistula, as it is superior to both computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in delineating the tract within the pancreatic region. It is also less invasive than ERCP. While a trial of medical regimen has traditionally been the first-line treatment, failure would result in higher rates of complications. Hence, it is suggested that management strategies be planned based on pancreatic ductal imaging, with patients having poor chances of spontaneous closure undergoing either endoscopic or surgical intervention. We also briefly describe a case of pancreaticopleural fistula in a patient who was treated using a modified Puestow procedure after failed endoscopic treatment.
