Comparison of performance and safety of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography across pediatric age groups. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been shown to be overall effective and safe in children, but its performance characteristics and safety profile have not been specifically evaluated according to age. We aim to compare the indications, findings, interventions, and safety outcomes of ERCP across pediatric age groups.A retrospective cross-sectional study of pediatric patients (ages 17 or below) who underwent ERCP between October 1998 and April 2011 at a tertiary-care academic center. Data on indications, findings, technical success, and adverse events of ERCP were collected and compared according to age groups (0-6, 7-12, or 13-17 years).There were 289 procedures performed in 154 children (mean age, 11.5 years). The number of patients undergoing ERCP increased with age teenagers constituted the largest group (52.6%) and had the most procedures (49.8%). Children aged 0-6 years had an equal distribution of biliary and pancreatic casesERCP is generally safe in the pediatric population, although the risk of mild post-procedure pancreatitis may be higher among the youngest children.
