Cytologic features of lipid-rich variant of pancreatic endocrine tumor-report of two cases with literature review. Pancreatic endocrine tumor (PET) is an uncommon neoplasm of the pancreas with distinct cytomorphologic features. Lipid-rich PET, a rare variant, histologically deviates from that of a conventional PET. There is only one case report of the cytologic features of this rare entity in the literature. We report two cases of lipid-rich PETs diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy. Case 1 showed large aggregates, small clusters, and single cells with plasmacytoid appearance, small uniform nuclei, coarse chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Abundant distinct small cytoplasmic vacuoles were present in almost all tumor cells and the background was clean. Case 2 showed flat cohesive sheets of medium-sized uniform cells with indistinct plasmacytoid appearance, uniform nuclei, fine and evenly distributed chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Distinct small cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen only focally. Immunohistochemical stains in cell blocks of both cases confirmed the diagnosis of PET. Lipid-rich PET may be misinterpreted on cytology specimens if the pathologist is not aware of this rare entity since it mimics clear cell carcinoma of the kidney, adrenal cortical neoplasm, or adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
