An autopsy case of secondary iron-overload cardiomyopathy. A woman over 70 years of age presented with anemia and appetite loss. She had no history of blood transfusions, although she had been receiving iron infusions for anemia for seven years. She had an elevated serum ferritin level (7,951 ng/mL) one month before admission. Abdominal computed tomography showed increased hepatic density and echocardiography showed normal heart valves and heart-wall motion. The patient eventually experienced atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation and died of heart failure. An autopsy revealed iron deposits in the liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, thyroid gland, gastric mucosa and myocardium. Iron-overload cardiomyopathy was diagnosed based on the iron deposits, myocardial disarray and interstitial fibrosis.
