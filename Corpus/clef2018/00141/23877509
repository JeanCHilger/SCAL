Increased FDG uptake of heterotopic pancreatitis in the stomach. Heterotopic pancreas is the presence of pancreatic tissue lying outside of its normal location and lacking anatomic or vascular connections with the pancreas. Heterotopic pancreas can undergo inflammatory changes similar to the normal pancreatic gland. We present 2 rare cases showing increased (18)F-FDG uptake in the heterotopic pancreatitis of the stomachs. To our knowledge, heterotopic pancreatitis with increased tracer accumulation on FDG PET/CT has not been reported before. Heterotopic pancreas should be included in the differential diagnosis of abnormal gastric FDG accumulation along with tumor and infectious processes.
