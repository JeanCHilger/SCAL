Real-time virtual sonography visualization and its clinical application in biliopancreatic disease. To evaluate the usefulness of real-time virtual sonography (RVS) in biliary and pancreatic diseases.This study included 15 patients with biliary and pancreatic diseases. RVS can be used to observe an ultrasound image in real time by merging the ultrasound image with a multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography (CT) image, using pre-scanned CT volume data. The ultrasound used was EUB-8500 with a convex probe EUP-C514. The RVS images were evaluated based on 3 levels, namely, excellent, good and poor, by the displacement in position.By combining the objectivity of CT with free scanning using RVS, it was possible to easily interpret the relationship between lesions and the surrounding organs as well as the position of vascular structures. The resulting evaluation levels of the RVS images were 12 excellent (pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer, cholecystolithiasis and cholangiocellular carcinoma) and 3 good (pancreatic cancer and gallbladder cancer). Compared with conventional B-mode ultrasonography and CT, RVS images achieved a rate of 80% superior visualization and 20% better visualization.RVS has potential usefulness in objective visualization and diagnosis in the field of biliary and pancreatic diseases.
