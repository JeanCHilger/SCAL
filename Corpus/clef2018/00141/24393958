A case of pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma 27 years after nephrectomy. A 78-year-old man was admitted to Ogikubo Hospital for pancreatic tumors detected by computed tomography (CT). The patient had undergone right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 27 years previously. Dynamic CT revealed a hypervascular mass in the pancreatic head and a cystic mass in the pancreatic body that were approximately 35 mm and 20 mm in size, respectively. Total pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histological examination of the resected specimens revealed metastatic tumors from RCC and they were diagnosed as clear cell type. Metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas is uncommon. Pancreatic metastasis from RCC is rare however, it could occur many years after the initial diagnosis and treatment of the primary tumor. A long and careful follow-up that includes examination of the pancreas is mandatory after nephrectomy for RCC. In this paper, we discuss a case of RCC metastasis to the pancreas and report it in the literature.
