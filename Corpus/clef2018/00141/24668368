Gastric obstruction due to intramural pseudocyst associated with heterotopic pancreas. An unusual case of gastric outlet obstruction caused by a gastric intramural pseudocyst associated with heterotopic pancreas is illustrated. Heterotopic pancreas is defined as the presence of aberrant pancreatic tissue that is anatomically and vascularly distinct from the pancreas itself (Liu et al. Am Surg. 78:E141-3, 2012). Heterotopic pancreatic tissue has been reported in many locations along the gastrointestinal tract, identified most commonly in the stomach where it is usually an asymptomatic anatomic curiosity than a source of clinical concern. We encountered an unusual instance in which heterotopic pancreas in the distal stomach was associated with heterotopic pancreatitis and intramural pseudocyst formation that led to gastric obstruction.
