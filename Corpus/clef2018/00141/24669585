Undifferentiated carcinoma of pancreas: a rare entity with aggressive behavior and possible genetic link. An aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma of pancreas is a rare tumor, especially with a strong personal and family history of malignant melanoma. Limited literature review and few case reports described a genetic association between distinct types of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma.We present an uncommon case of an aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas in a 50-year-old Caucasian female. Initially, she presented with intermittent epigastric postprandial pain and mild nausea. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed a 5 cm heterogenous pancreatic tail mass, which on biopsy was found to be a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. Past medical history included malignant melanoma, with extensive family history of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma. However, not genetically confirmed, a hereditary pancreatic linkage was highly suspected. A week later, repeat computed tomography demonstrated tremendous enlargement of the pancreatic tail mass. Within a few weeks, the patient developed aggressive metastasis in various organ systems, followed by multiple surgeries. An emergent first round of chemotherapy was started, followed by an intensive care unit stay, and she eventually died.Our case exposes the aggressive behavior of undifferentiated carcinoma of pancreas, along with possible hereditary link between pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma.
