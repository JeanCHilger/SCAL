Frequency and significance of physiological versus pathological uptake of 68Ga-DOTATATE in the pancreas: validation with morphological imaging. The objective of this study was to assess the relevance of physiological (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT findings in the pancreas guided by morphological imaging (MI) in comparison with pathological tumour uptake in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).A total of 138 patients with pancreatic NET (pNET n=38) or non-pNET (n=100) underwent (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. Pancreatic regions with intensity higher than background were localized with anatomical reference support [head/uncinate process (HUP)Physiological uptake was seen in 10/38 pNETs (SUV(max) range, mean±SD and median in HUP and BT: 2.4-12.7, 5.9±3.2 and 4.6 3.8-6.6, 6.6±2.5 and 5.6, respectively). A total of 18/38 showed high uptake (SUV(max) range, mean±SD and median in HUP and BT: 6.9-50, 26.9±13.5 and 27Physiological pancreatic uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE showed low SUV(max), whereas tumours showed higher SUV(max) this is in agreement with previously published data. Equivocal findings showed SUV(max) in the grey area between physiological and pathological ranges, and for these lesions MI and histological confirmation are required for final diagnosis.
