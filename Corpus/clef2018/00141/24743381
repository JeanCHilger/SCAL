Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of pancreas divisum: a systematic review and meta-analysis. This study aimed to perform a structured meta-analysis of all eligible studies to assess the overall diagnostic use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) alone or with secretin enhancement (secretin-enhanced MRCP [S-MRCP]) in the detection of pancreas divisum.Two authors independently performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2013. Studies were included if they allowed construction of 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables of MRCP and/or S-MRCP compared with criterion standard. DerSimonian-Laird random effect models were used to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, specificity, and quantitative receiver operating characteristics.Of 51 citations, 10 studies with 1474 patients were included. Secretin-enhanced MRCP had a higher overall diagnostic performance than MRCP (S-MRCP: pooled sensitivity, 86% [95% confidence interval (CI), 77%-93%] specificity, 97% [95% CI, 94%-99%]Secretin-enhanced MRCP has a much higher diagnostic accuracy than MRCP and should be preferred for diagnosis of pancreas divisum.
