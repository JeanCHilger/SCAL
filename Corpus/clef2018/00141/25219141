Splenectomy as a part of debulking surgery in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The aim of the study was the assessment of perioperative complications in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who underwent splenectomy to achieve optimal debulking.We analyzed eight debulking procedures with splenectomy and the postoperative period in ovarian cancer patients, FIGO stage III/B-IV. Preoperative diagnostics included multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or diffusion-weighted echo-planar magnetic resonance (MR-DWI). The following factors were analyzed: size of the removed tumor, size of remains left, blood loss, packed red blood cell transfusion, quantity and reason for reoperations, pancreatic amylase concentrations in the drainage fluid, wound infection, fever over 38 degrees C, and length of hospitalization.Complete debulking was achieved in 8 patients, including 5 cases with no macroscopic residual lesions and 3 patients with lesion diameter of < 10 mm. Median operative time was 175 min. There was one case of reoperation caused by perforation of the stomach wall (histologically confirmed stress ulcer). Median blood loss was 1050 ml and the rate of packed red blood cells transfusion was 75%. Elevated amylase levels in the drainage fluid was noted in 6 patients. Amylase concentration was greater than 5 times the normal serum value during the first postoperative day. After postoperative day 3 it was lower than normal serum range. There were no cases of postoperative fever wound infections, or deaths. The length of hospitalization was 6 days.Splenectomy as a part of cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer may contribute to achieving complete debulking and bring benefits, especially in cases with no macroscopic residual disease. The risk of intra- and postoperative complications related to splenectomy seems to be acceptable.
