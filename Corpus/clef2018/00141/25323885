Prognostic significance of volume-based FDG PET/CT parameters in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated with chemoradiation therapy. We investigated the prognostic role of volume-based parameters measured on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scans in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) treated with chemoradiation therapy (CRT).We enrolled 60 patients with LAPC who underwent FDG PET/CT before CRT. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary pancreatic cancers were measured on FDG PET/CT scans. Treatment response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine independent prognostic factors.The progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional progression-free survival (LRFPS), and overall survival (OS) for this population were 6.2, 10.9, and 13.2 months, respectively. The overall treatment response rate was 16.7% at 4 weeks after CRT, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 80.0%. DCR was significantly higher in patients with low SUVmax, MTV, or TLG, and showed strong correlation with longer survival times. On univariate analysis, MTV and TLG were significant prognostic factors for PFS, LRPFS, and OS, together with pre-CRT and post-CRT CA19-9 levels. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that MTV together with the pre-CRT CA19-9 level were independent prognostic factors for PFS, LRPFS, and OS, as was TLG for LRPFS and OS.MTV and the pre-CRT CA19-9 level provided independent prognostic information in patients with LAPC treated with CRT. Volume-based PET/CT parameters may be useful in identifying which subgroup of patients would benefit from radiation therapy as a part of CRT.
