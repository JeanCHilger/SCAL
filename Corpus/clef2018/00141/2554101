Value of diagnostic localization of insulinoma. The value of diagnostic localization of insulinoma The value of diagnostic localization statements are contradictory. Basing on our own patient material (n = 41) the preoperative localization of an insulinoma was correct with sonography in 57.7%, with computed tomography in 21.4%, with computed tomography with bolus injection of contrast medium in 73.3%, with angiography 63.9% and with percutaneous transhepatic portal vein catheterisation with selective test of hormones (PTP) in 76.9%. Intraoperative 38 of 41 insulinomas were palpable and twelve of 16 insulinomas were seen during intraoperative sonography. Although we palpate more than 90% of all insulinomas we support a preoperative diagnostic localization for easier intraoperative palpation.
