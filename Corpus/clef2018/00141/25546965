Modern possibilities of endovascular surgery in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic inflammatory diseases. Demonstration of possibilities of an effective application of endovascular techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic inflammatory diseases. Group N1 - 41 patients with severe acute pancreatitis, whose complex treatment was complemented with catheterization of the celiac trunk and subsequent regional intra-arterial drug perfusion of the pancreas and spiral celiac angiography. Group N2 - 18 patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis in whom endovascular surgery was performed with the aim of diagnosis and arresting of arrosive haemorrhage. Regional intra-arterial perfusion of the pancreas is effective as a method of prevention of septic complications, progression of pancreatic necrosis in patients with aseptic forms of severe pancreatitis, in case of infected necrotizing pancreatitis significant advantage of this method over the standard multimodality treatment was observed. Effectiveness of endovascular surgery in the diagnosis and haemostasis of arrosive arterial haemorrhage is showed. The results of this study suggest that the effective use of endovascular surgery as possible in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and late postnecrotic complications.
