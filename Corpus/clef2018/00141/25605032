Should all branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms be resected? The relationship between branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and malignancy remains controversial and difficult to assess.Between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2013, we identified 84 patients with IPMN who underwent resection.Preoperatively, 55 patients underwent endoscopic ultrasounds and 58 underwent biopsy. Only 7 lesions were specified preoperatively as branch-duct, which inconsistently correlated with the surgical specimen. Of the 82 patients where the duct was specified, there were 33 malignant lesions. There was no correlation between branch-duct origin and invasive carcinoma. Malignant tumor size did not significantly differ by the duct of origin. Of the 28 patients with invasive carcinoma, branch-duct lesions were significantly associated with the presence of positive lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and lymphovascular invasion.Our study supports the resection criteria for branch-duct IPMN based on size and symptoms. However, it also questions the reliability of our preoperative testing to rule out malignant branch-duct IPMN lesions.
