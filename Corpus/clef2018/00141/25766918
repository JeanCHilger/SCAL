Role of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography in gastrointestinal cancers. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) has become a routine imaging modality for many malignancies and its use is currently increasing. In the present review article, we will summarize the evidence for FDG-PET/CT use in digestive cancers (excluding neuroendocrine tumours), and review the existing recommendations. While PET/CT is nowadays considered to be an important tool in the initial workup of oesophageal and anal cancers, new data are emerging regarding its use in assessing therapeutic efficacy, radiotherapy treatment planning, and detection of recurrence in case of isolated tumour marker elevation. Moreover, PET/CT may help decision making by detecting distant metastatic sites especially in potentially resectable metastatic colorectal cancer and, to a lesser extent, in localized gastric and pancreatic cancers. Finally, incidental focal colonic FDG uptakes require exploration by colonoscopy, as they are often associated with premalignant or malignant lesions.
