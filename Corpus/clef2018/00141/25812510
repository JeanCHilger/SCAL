A case of ampullary carcinoma progression-free for four years after treatment with TS-1. A 63-year old man was referred to our hospital because of fever, appetite loss, and increased biliary enzyme levels. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a tumor in the duodenal papilla, diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma via biopsy, and computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple tumors in the liver. Chemotherapy with TS-1 was initiated based on a diagnosis of ampullary cancer with multiple liver metastases. After TS-1 treatment, the multiple tumors were no longer detectable, and the primary tumor did not increase in size for 4 years. At this time, however, the patient experienced fever, jaundice, and appetite loss. The hepatic mass was not detected via CT or MRI. The primary tumor was determined to be resectable therefore, we performed subtotal stomach preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The patient was discharged 55 days after surgery and is alive without recurrence 2 years after surgery.
