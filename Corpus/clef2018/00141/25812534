Impact of FDG-PET findings on decisions regarding patient management strategies: a multicenter trial in patients with lung cancer and other types of cancer. To date, numerous studies have been conducted on the diagnostic capabilities of positron emission tomography using [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). However, no studies designed to evaluate the influence of FDG-PET on the selection of patient management strategies within the Japanese healthcare system have been reported to date. The aim of the present study was to investigate prospectively the proportion of patients whose management strategies were modified based on FDG-PET findings (strategy modification rate).The strategy modification rate was calculated by comparing the patient management strategy (test and treatment plans) after FDG-PET with the strategy before FDG-PET for 560 cancer patients with nine types of cancer (lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head/neck cancer, brain tumor, pancreas cancer, malignant lymphoma, cancer of unknown origin, and melanoma). In addition, the details of the modifications to the patient management strategies were analyzed.The strategy modification rate for patients with lung cancer was 71.6% (149 of 208 patients, 95% confidence interval 65.0-77.7%), which was higher than previously reported strategy modification rates for lung cancer before and after FDG-PET (25.6%). The strategy modification rates for patients with cancers other than lung cancer were as follows: breast, 44.4% (56/126) colorectal, 75.6% (62/82)The results from this study indicate that FDG-PET can contribute to the modification of management strategies (particularly treatment plans), especially for lung cancer patients but also for patients with other types of cancer.
