A case of hemosuccus pancreaticus associated with chronic pancreatitis. The term "hemosuccus pancreaticus" was coined by Sandblom in 1970, to describe a syndrome manifested by massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage through the pancreatic duct and the ampulla of water. A case of hemosuccus pancreaticus which had no hematemesis and melena is reported in comparison with two previously experienced cases. A 68-year-old alcoholic man was referred to Eiju General Hospital for poor appetite and occasional colicky pain in left epigastrium. Abdominal angiography and computed tomography revealed an aneurysm at the tail of the pancreas and hemosuccus pancreaticus caused by true aneurysm was strongly suspected. Laparotomy revealed chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst at the tail of the pancreas that was considered to be the cause of the pain. Resection of pancreatic tail and splenectomy was performed without complication. Histopathological diagnosis of the resected pancreas was chronic pancreatitis. He has complained no abdominal pain and melena for 6 months after operation.
