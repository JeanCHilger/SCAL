Two cases of squamoid cyst of the pancreatic ducts. Two patients were referred to our hospital with cystic lesion (diameter 5 cm) of the pancreas and elevated serum CEA and CA19-9. We diagnosed them with malignant cystic neoplasms of the pancreas and performed distal pancreatectomy. Histologically, in both cases the cysts were lined with flat, transitional, squamoid cells without keratinization. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed two rare cases of squamoid cyst of the pancreatic ducts.
