Chronic Sclerosing Sialadenitis of the Submandibular Gland as the Initial Symptom of IgG4-Related Disease: A Case Report. Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic condition accompanied by tumefactive lesions, dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis in various organs, and, frequently, elevated serum IgG4 levels. Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (also termed KÃ¼ttner's tumor) is thought to be a lesion of IgG4-RD thus, IgG4-related sialadenitis may be the initial symptom of IgG4-RD. We herein report a 64-year-old Japanese female with IgG4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis of the right submandibular gland and retroperitoneal fibrosis, who subsequently developed tubulointerstitial nephritis and pancreatitis. She was referred to our Department for treatment of swelling of the right submandibular gland
