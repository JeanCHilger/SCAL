A compound heterozygous mutation of ABCC8 gene causing a diazoxide-unresponsive congenital hyperinsulinism with an atypical form: Not a focal lesion in the pancreas reported by ¹⁸F-DOPA-PET/CT scan. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a severe heterogeneous disorder due to dysregulation of insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cells leading to severe hypoglycemia in infancy. 18-fluoro-l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography ((18)F‑DOPA‑PET)/CT is a useful tool in distinguishing between focal and diffuse disease preoperatively. But recent studies have suggested that the scanning may not be accurate as initially estimated. In this study we characterize a case of CHI with a compound heterozygous mutation of ABCC8 gene. The results of clinical investigation, gene mutation analysis, (18)F‑DOPA‑PET/CT scan, and pathological examination showed some new characteristics that have never been reported. The patient was unresponsive to medical therapy with diazoxide and received pancreatectomy twice. Genetic analysis identified a compound heterozygous mutation in ABCC8 genes. Imaging with (18)F‑DOPA‑PET/CT indicated a focal lesion in the head of the pancreas. The pathological diagnosis was an atypical form of CHI. The patient presented with a phenotype of atypical CHI unresponsive to diazoxide. It is considered that a relationship existed between the compound heterozygous mutation and the atypical form. (18)F‑DOPA‑PET/CT is a useful tool in distinguishing between focal and diffuse forms preoperatively but the accuracy is not 100%. The scan result is best combined with genetic analysis and intra-operative biopsy to confirm the histological subtypes. The combination will provide the optimal strategy for the surgical treatment of patients with CHI.
