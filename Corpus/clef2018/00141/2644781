Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children. In the past, children with pancreatic pseudocysts have been managed surgically. We report seven children 3-13 years old with posttraumatic pancreatic pseudocysts who were managed with percutaneous catheter drainage. All procedures were performed with local anesthesia and intramuscular sedation under sonographic or CT guidance. Two of the pseudocysts were drained via a transgastric approach, the other five via direct transcutaneous access to the pseudocyst. The catheters were in place an average of 25 days (range, 8-66). There were no serious complications. Six patients became asymptomatic with return of the serum amylase to normal and resolution of the pseudocyst on follow-up sonograms. One patient, in whom the catheter became dislodged after 2 weeks, became asymptomatic, but he had a residual 2-cm pancreatic pseudocyst that resolved over the next 6 weeks. Our experience suggests that percutaneous drainage is a safe and effective method of treatment for traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children.
