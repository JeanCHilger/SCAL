Biliary concrements: the endoscopic approach. Since 1970, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) has received much attention as a diagnostic method in pancreaticobiliary disease. The information given by ERCP is of great value in the management of patients with symptoms after biliary tract surgery and especially in patients with suspected obstructive jaundice. In patients with symptoms highly suggestive of cholelithiasis, ERCP examination should be considered for definitive diagnosis despite a negative oral cholecystogram and ultrasound finding. Endoscopic papillotomy is a major advance in the treatment of many elderly and high-risk patients with common bile duct stones. It should replace surgery in most of these patients with retained or recurrent stones and appears justified in many patients who have not yet undergone cholecystectomy, either in the hope of avoiding biliary surgery altogether or to defuse an acute clinical situation. The rule of endoscopic treatment in the young and fit has yet to be established.
