Ultrasonographic manifestation and evaluation of imaging diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The ultrasonographic data of 50 patients with chronic pancreatitis are presented. Ultrasonographic manifestations were described as follows: Pancreatic focal or diffuse enlargement in 70% of these cases, reduced its size in 2%, retained its normal size in 28%, inhomogeneously increased echogenicity in 68%, coarse, focal dense echoes in 8%, decreased echogenicity in 20%, normal echogenicity in 4%, irregular contour in 40%, pseudocyst formation in 6%, abnormal pancreatic duct in 44%, dilated common bile duct in 20% and focal pancreatic mass in 14%. Patients in the study had a normal sonogram only in 4%. Abnormal ultrasonographic findings, especially pseudocyst and pancreatic calcification may be considered as important diagnostic evidence. In the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, the coincident rate of ultrasonography, ERCP and CT was 80%, 75% and 81%, respectively. Their diagnostic value was evaluated and compared. CT was the most sensitive and accurate. Ultrasonography was simpler and non-invasive, it may be used as a method of choice. Combination of using these various imaging techniques may increase the diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic coincident rate of combined ultrasonography and CT was 91%, and that of combined ultrasonography and ERCP was 91%.
