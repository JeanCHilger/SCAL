Peroperative echography in 14 cases of pancreatic insulinoma and gastrinoma. Fourteen cases of endocrine tumors (10 insulinomas and 4 gastrinomas) were to studied by intraoperative ultrasonography (IOU). Localization was established by preoperative ultrasonography in 1/14, by CT scan in 1/11, by arteriography in 6/12 and by pancreatic venous sampling in 7/8. Tumor size ranged from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm. Manual palpation was positive in 10/14. The tumor was accurately and completely localized by IOU in 9/10 insulinomas: the one false negative was probably due to micro-adenoma. The intrapancreatic tumor was localized only in 1/14 gastrinomas. Intraoperative sonography localized lymph nodes in all cases. One distal pancreatectomy was improperly performed because of an accessory spleen. After reviewing 59 other cases in the literature, we propose: a) to abandon venous sampling in insulinomas because of adequate performance of IOU b) to use IOU as a complementary investigative method along with other preoperative methods of localization in gastrinoma.
