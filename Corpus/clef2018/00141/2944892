Radiologic findings of retroperitoneal perforation after sphincterotomy. The radiographs of all patients with perforation into the retroperitoneum following endoscopic sphincterotomy, performed between 1981 to 1984 at University Hospital, London, Ontario were reviewed retrospectively. The incidence of perforation was very low. There were only three patients with perforation (1.1%), although 264 sphincterotomies had been performed. The initial and most important radiological findings are air and contrast medium in the retroperitoneum outlining the right kidney a mottled air and soft tissue density in the right anterior pararenal space due to leak of duodenal contents, bile and air
