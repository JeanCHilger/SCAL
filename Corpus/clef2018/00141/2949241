Pancreatic pseudo-tumor caused by bilio-pancreatic tuberculous lymphadenitis. 2 cases. Peripancreatic tuberculous lymphadenitis is rare and of difficult diagnosis. The two cases described illustrate two clinical aspects according to the proximity of the biliary tract: either anterior lymph nodes responsible for obstructive jaundice, or posterior lymph nodes responsible for chronic epigastric pain. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is essential to exclude a pancreatic lesion and facilitate the interpretation of the CT images. Tuberculosis must then be suspected. In the absence of another tuberculous localisation, laparotomy is necessary to assert the diagnosis. Antituberculous chemotherapy alone, administered for 9 to 12 months, cures this form of tuberculous lymphadenitis.
