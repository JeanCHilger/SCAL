Glucagonoma without cutaneous manifestations. A 63 year old man presented with features of the glucagonoma syndrome, that is thromboembolic disease, weight loss, raised sedimentation rate, diabetes mellitus, hypoproteinaemia and reduced plasma amino acid levels, but without necrolytic migratory erythema. The plasma glucagon level was raised and the tumour was demonstrated by abdominal CT scan. Immunofluorescent studies of the resected tumour confirmed the diagnosis. The normal tissue zinc status supports the view that necrolytic migratory erythema is related to zinc deficiency.
