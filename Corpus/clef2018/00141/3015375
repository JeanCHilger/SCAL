The search for the primary tumor in patients with skeletal metastases of unknown origin. Forty-six patients who had been evaluated because of skeletal metastases of unknown origin, were reviewed. Twenty-six of the patients were referred to an orthopedic surgeon before confirmation of the metastases by biopsy 20 others were referred to an oncology clinic after a diagnosis of bone metastases had been established. A simple diagnostic sequence consisting of a medical history, physical examination, routine laboratory studies, chest roentgenogram, technetium 99m phosphonate bone scintigram, and intravenous pyelogram identified the site of the primary tumor in 14 patients
