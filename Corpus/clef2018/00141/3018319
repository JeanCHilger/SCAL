Inflammatory fibrous histiocytoma of the retroperitoneum. A 64-year-old man with the chief complaint of abdominal fullness was hospitalized on the suspicion of pancreatic tumor. The tumor was thought to be a pancreatic or retroperitoneal tumor, based on examinations of ultrasonography and CT scan of the upper abdomen, angiography of abdominal arteries, and ERCP. Laparotomy revealed that the tumor was inoperable inflammatory fibrous histiocytoma. Combined anti-cancer chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine induced partial response. The duration of response was six months, and the patient died of tumor growth 18 months after the initial diagnosis.
