Isolated ventral pancreatitis in an alcoholic with pancreas divisum. An alcoholic with no history of clinical pancreatitis was found to have pancreas divisum and marked changes of chronic pancreatitis isolated to the ventral pancreas. Pancreas divisum has been suggested to cause recurrent pancreatitis in some patients. Gross and histologic changes of pancreatitis in only the dorsal pancreas of surgically resected specimens from patients with pancreas divisum is thought to support the concept that obstruction at the minor papilla produces dorsal pancreatitis. Alternative explanations for the occurrence of segmental pancreatitis and the possible synergistic role of ethanol and bile are reviewed.
