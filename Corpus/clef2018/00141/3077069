Obstructive jaundice caused by metastasis to the head of the pancreas by a malignant melanoma. We report on a 68-year-old patient who developed an obstructive jaundice 13 years after surgery of a malignant melanoma of the right ear. The initial sonographic and CT diagnosis of a benign pseudocyst of the head of the pancreas had to be revised based on ERCP, sonographically guided puncture and papillary biopsy. By Whipple's procedure, the solitary intrapancreatic metastasis could be successfully removed.
