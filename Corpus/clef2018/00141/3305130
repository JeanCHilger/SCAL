Diagnosis and treatment of choledochocele complicated by choledocholithiasis (case report). We report a case of choledochocele associated with choledocholithiasis. The patient became symptomatic when a gallstone was trapped within the choledochocele, causing intermittent biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) provided the diagnosis and endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed for definite nonoperative treatment. The lesion could not be identified on ultrasound even after its demonstration by ERC. The importance of direct cholangiography in the diagnosis of a choledochocele is discussed.
