Pancreatitis and the biliary tree: the continuing problem. Gallstone-associated pancreatitis continues to have a mortality rate that approaches 10 percent. In a review of 132 fatal cases of acute pancreatitis, no less than a third of the gallstone-associated cases were diagnosed for the first time at autopsy. Early diagnosis of gallstones in these patients remains problematic, but clinical and biochemical factors may aid ultrasonography in defining patients who require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Early operation is advisable in patients with mild disease, but endoscopic papillotomy should be considered in those with severe disease who fail to stabilize after admission. Chronic pancreatitis is frequently associated with cholangiographic evidence of biliary obstruction, and serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations offer a valuable means of monitoring cholestasis. If operation is needed to deal with biliary obstruction, the options are to carry out Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy or resection of the pancreatic head, the choice being dictated by the indications for direct pancreatic operation.
