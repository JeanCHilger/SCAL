Infected pancreatic fluid collections: percutaneous catheter drainage. Thirty-eight infected pancreatic fluid collections in 23 patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis were drained percutaneously following initial diagnosis with computed tomography and fine-needle aspiration. Fifteen (65.2%) patients were cured completely without surgery. Eight (34.8%) patients required some type of surgery despite successful treatment of the fluid collection, and in two (6.5%) the collection recurred after catheter removal. Complications occurred in three (13%) patients, but only one complication (4%), empyema, was a direct result of catheter drainage. Catheter drainage time averaged 29 days for 16 patients with isolated collections and 96 days and 104 days for patients with collections with pancreatic duct fistulas (nine patients) or gastrointestinal fistulas (14 patients), respectively. This study confirms that infected pancreatic fluid collections can be safely and effectively treated with percutaneous catheter techniques in most patients.
