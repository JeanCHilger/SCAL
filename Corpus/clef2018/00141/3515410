Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm and spurious aneurysm of the splenic artery--diagnosis by angio-CT and ultrasound. Pseudoaneurysm of the pancreas is a severe complication secondary to pancreatitis. The splenic artery is most often involved, followed by the pancreaticoduodenal vessels and the gastroduodenal artery. Selective arteriography is considered the method of choice in preoperative diagnosis. In a patient with chronic pancreatitis angio-CT and ultrasound allow a definitive diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery.
