Ruptured arterial aneurysms in the area of the celiac trunk. Three cases of ruptured aneurysms of the digestive arteries are reported and the different available radiological methods leading to the diagnosis are discussed. Computed tomography and selective arteriography seem to be the methods of choice in this condition. Since the patients do not usually present typical signs until the aneurysm ruptures, the diagnosis is late. Early management of these patients is necessary in order to decrease the mortality rate.
