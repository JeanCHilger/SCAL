Interventional radiology in the spleen. Despite the widespread use of interventional radiologic techniques, there has been reluctance to apply these to the spleen. Concern for bleeding and difficulty in negotiating around the colon and pleura have limited its use. The authors report their experience with interventional radiology of the spleen in 35 cases, including percutaneous biopsy (n = 5), diagnostic and therapeutic fluid aspiration (n = 14), and catheter drainage of abscesses (n = 9), hematomas (n = 2), intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocysts (n = 2), and necrotic tumor (n = 1). Transsplenic fluid aspiration and biopsy of the pancreas and adrenal gland were performed as well (n = 2). All procedures were performed under computed tomographic or ultrasound guidance. Biopsies were performed with 22- or 20-gauge needles only no complications were encountered. Diagnoses included primary and secondary malignancies and an infectious process. Drainages were successful in 11 of 14 patients
