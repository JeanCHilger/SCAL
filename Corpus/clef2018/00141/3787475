Adrenocortical carcinoma. From 1962 to 1985, 47 patients with carcinoma of the adrenal cortex were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. There were 21 men and 26 women. Seventy-two percent of the tumors were functional and 28% were nonfunctional. Despite the advent of ultrasonography and computerized tomography, these tumors were infrequently diagnosed until they infiltrated adjacent organs or metastasized to distant sites. Only 30% of patients had tumors confined to the adrenal gland their mean duration of survival was 5.0 years. Seventy percent of the patients had invasion of the kidney, lymph nodes, liver, diaphragm, and/or pancreas at the initial operation
