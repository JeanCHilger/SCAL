Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of abdominal and pelvic lesions. Passes necessary for secure diagnosis with fluoroscopy and CT-guidance. The number of passes performed at each occasion of biopsy of abdominal and pelvic lesions was recorded in 296 patients. In 178 patients the percutaneous fine needle-biopsy was guided by fluoroscopy (FL), in 118 by computed tomography (CT). At FL correct results were obtained in 73% of the patients, at CT in 91%. The highest accuracy was obtained at biopsy of adrenals, kidneys, ureter and soft tissue masses and the lowest accuracy in the pancreas. 59% of the correct diagnoses were obtained at the first pass at FL, the corresponding figure at CT was 81%. At least 3 passes were necessary for obtaining diagnostic material of the pancreas while for other organs and soft tissue masses 2 passes often were sufficient. In most patients with false negative/inconclusive diagnoses or with non-representative material only 2 passes had been performed.
