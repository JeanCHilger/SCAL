Pancreatic masses that angiographically simulate intrasplenic lesions. Major improvements in the resolving power of computed tomography and ultrasound over the last decade have greatly improved the preoperative evaluation of abdominal masses. Angiography is, however, still often required for vascular mapping and assistance in the differential diagnosis. Although the site of origin of an avascular, intrasplenic mass may be the spleen, our experience and review of the literature indicates that such primary or secondary splenic masses are relatively rare. A primary pancreatic mass often a pseudocyst is a more frequent cause and should figure prominently in the differential diagnosis.
