Fluid collections in the intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal spaces: comparison of MR and CT. Fourteen patients with abnormal subdiaphragmatic fluid collections (eight intraperitoneal, two extraperitoneal, and four intra- and extraperitoneal) were examined with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MR and CT provided equivalent information concerning the presence and extent of fluid collections in 13 of the 14 cases. Image acquisitions with two different repetition times (TRs) and two echo times (TEs) were necessary, in most cases, to detect and discriminate between different types of pathologic fluids. Transudative ascites demonstrated long T1 and T2 relaxation times, whereas abscesses, phlegmon, pancreatic pseudocyst, exudative pancreatitis, and chronic hematoma demonstrated an intermediate or short T1 and a long T2.
