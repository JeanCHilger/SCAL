Sonography and computer tomography for follow-up of carcinoma of the pancreas (author's transl). Follow-up of 20 patients with incurable carcinoma of the pancreas is described, who were treated with palliative chemo- or radiotherapy. It was concluded that the course of the disease can be adequately followed by sonography and CT. Control of palliative therapy can be achieved by non-invasive means with little stress to the patient. Whether the attempt to do so is justifiable depends on the success of modern forms of treatment.
