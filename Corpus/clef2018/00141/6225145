Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: computed tomographic demonstration of unusual extranodal involvement. With the advent of computed tomography, lymphomatous involvement of sites other than lymph nodes is being seen with increasing frequency. Review of computed tomographic scans in 400 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma revealed 37 patients to have involvement of 56 unusual sites below the diaphragm: psoas/iliacus muscle (16 patients), kidney (13 patients), pancreas (5 patients), adrenal (4 patients), skin/subcutaneous tissue (4 patients), abdominal wall musculature (4 patients), peritoneum (4 patients), omentum (3 patients), and female reproductive tract (3 patients). These were mostly seen in patients with lymphomas of diffuse architecture, especially diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Concomitant retroperitoneal and/or mesenteric adenopathy was very common extranodal involvement was rarely the only site of initial or recurrent lymphoma.
