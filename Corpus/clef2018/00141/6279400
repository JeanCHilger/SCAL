Efficiency of different radiodiagnostic techniques in pancreatic disorders. Using figures from the literature and from our own case material, the diagnostic efficiency of the barium meal, computerized tomography, angiography, ERPC and biopsy have been compared in acute and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic and papillary carcinoma and islet cell tumour. In acute pancreatitis, CT is the method of choice. In chronic pancreatitis, ERPC has the highest diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, it is capable of giving an indication for operative intervention, and facilitating the choice of operative method. In pancreatic carcinoma, combination of ERPC, angiography and/or biopsy provides the highest diagnostic accuracy. Angiography and ERPC can provide early diagnosis, and angiography and CT can predict the operability of a tumour. CT is also the most important of the non-invasive diagnostic techniques. Carcinoma of the papilla is easily and reliably recognized by endoscopy. For islet cell tumours, angiography still remains the method of choice.
