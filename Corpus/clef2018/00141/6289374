Diagnosis of insulinoma of the pancreas by computed tomography . By example of a case the possibility for diagnosis of insulinoma by sequence computed tomography is demonstrated. If clinical symptoms are clear computed tomography should be performed before angiography, as in most cases sonography is not very successful for localisation. Because of high vascularisation of the tumor it can be found by computed tomography after one or more intravenous bolus injections or after high dose infusion of a renal excreted contrast medium. By aid of magnification technique and sequence computed tomography insulinomas of 5 mm in diameter can be recognized.
