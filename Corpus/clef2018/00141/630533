Computed tomographic scanning in patients with lymphoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen was performed in 40 patients with lymphoma and the results compared to conventional diagnostic techniques. Overall 34 (85%) of 40 CT scans correctly reflected the presence or absence of lymphoma. Close agreement between the findings of lymphography and CT was noted in 26 of 27 cases. CT has particular utility for assessment of lymphomatous involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes, high retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and extranodal abdominal sites other than the spleen or liver (e.g., pancreas, kidney). Abdominal CT is a useful noninvasive diagnostic technique for the initial staging and subsequent evaluation of selected patients with lymphoma.
