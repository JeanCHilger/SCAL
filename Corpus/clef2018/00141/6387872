Value of sonography, computer tomography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy and nuclear magnetic tomography in diseases of the gallbladder and bile ducts. The effectiveness of ultrasound, computed tomography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy and nuclear magnetic resonance in diseases of the biliary tract is described. Ultrasound should be the first examination in clinical suspicion of cholelithiasis and has a higher accuracy than oral cholecystography. Computed tomography is very expensive and should be carried out in suspected gallbladder carcinoma, cholecystitis with abscess formation, tumour in the porta hepatis and pancreatic head and in sonographically unclear cases. Nuclear magnetic resonance can determine the ability of the gallbladder to concentrate bile. Ultrasound can distinguish with high accuracy between obstructive and inflammatory jaundice. In clinical suspicion of bile duct lesions an infusion cholangiogram must be carried out, if bilirubin is lower than 5 mg% if bilirubin is higher, an ERC or PTC should be performed. If in biliary obstruction a suspicion of tumour in porta hepatis or head of the pancreas is present, computed tomography should be effected.
