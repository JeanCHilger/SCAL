Computed tomographic diagnosis of complications of transhepatic cholangiography and percutaneous biliary drainage. Over a 12-month period we evaluated, using computed tomography, 11 patients suspected of having developed complications of biliary interventional procedures. CT scans revealed 3 hepatic abscesses, 3 intrahepatic or subcapsular hematomas, 3 bilomas, of which 2 were infected, 1 pancreatic abscess, and 1 case of extension of tumor along a biliary catheter tract. Computed tomography provided information which allowed very specific preoperative diagnoses and which guided plans for further evaluation and treatment.
