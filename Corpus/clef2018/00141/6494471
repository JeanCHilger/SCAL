Computed tomographic findings in penetrating peptic ulcer. Four cases of peptic ulcer penetrating the head of the pancreas were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT). Findings common to 3 cases included (a) an ulcer crater, (b) a sinus tract, and (c) enlargement of the head of the pancreas. Additional findings, not seen in all patients, included (d) edema involving the base of the ulcer and/or the adjacent bowel wall and (e) loss of fascial planes between the base of the ulcer and the head of the pancreas. Unlike other modalities, the inherent spatial resolution of CT allows a confident diagnosis of this important complication of peptic ulcer disease.
