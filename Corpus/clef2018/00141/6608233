Sonography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of carcinoma of the gallbladder. The computed tomographic and sonographic findings of 26 patients with gallbladder carcinoma were reviewed, and the problems and pitfalls encountered with these imaging techniques are discussed. The most common finding, a mass filling or replacing the gallbladder, was seen in 42% of the patients. A mass protruding into the gallbladder was seen in 23%, and diffuse asymmetric thickening of the gallbladder wall in 15%. Recommendations are made to avoid some of the diagnostic problems encountered. With careful and meticulous technique early carcinoma of the gallbladder may be detected with greater frequency by cross-sectional imaging techniques.
