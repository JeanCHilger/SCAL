Radiological evaluation of the peri- and pararenal spaces by computed tomography. Computed tomography (CT) gives an excellent opportunity to revisit normal anatomy and to understand pathological aspects. Renal fascia alterations, on CT scans, are a sensitive sign of local lesion. While a thin renal fascia has no pathological significance, any thickening may be considered abnormal although nonspecific. It is found in pancreatitis as well as in cancer of the pancreas, in renal tumors as well as in pyelonephritis. It may persist as a scar. On the other hand, lack of fascial thickening allows us to rule out renal extension of a neighboring lesion or to decide that a renal mass is an ancient slowly-growing benign one.
