Pancreatic carcinoma. This retrospective review of 33 consecutive patients with cancer of the pancreas was undertaken to investigate epidemiologic factors, presenting symptoms, diagnostic methods, site and extent of cancer, treatment approaches, and survival data. The most frequent presenting complaint, reported by 23 patients (70%), was abdominal pain. Diagnosis was established by radiography or radionuclide scanning in 11 patients (33%). Nine patients (27%) were inoperable. One patient (3%) received resection in attempt for cure, 15 (46%) had palliative bypass procedures, and eight (25%) had laparotomy only. Eighteen patients (55%) received chemotherapy, with or without operation, and two (6%) had irradiation. The mean survival was 5.1 months. One third of the patients were dead a month after diagnosis. All patients died within 16 months of diagnosis, regardless of treatment method or extent of disease.
