The role of computed tomography in abdominal and pelvic trauma. CT findings in 32 patients with abdominal and pelvic trauma are the subject of this report. Four patients had more than one organ involved. The most common abdominal organ to be injured in our series was the pancreas, unlike other series. Findings of pancreatic, splenic, hepatic, renal, and pelvic injuries are described. The role of CT in the investigation of a patient with abdominal and pelvic trauma is discussed and compared with other imaging modalities. CT was found to be superior especially as it is highly sensitive and not organ specific.
