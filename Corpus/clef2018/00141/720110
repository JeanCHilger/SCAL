Computed tomography-guided biopsy. I. Overview. The authors are preparing a series of communications on CT-guided biopsy procedures to be published in future issues of this journal. The present article, which previously appeared in the Cleveland Clinic Quarterly, is intended to serve as an introduction to the concept of CT-guided biopsies. Because the principles of the biopsy procedure remain the same, we do not believe that a "rewrite" of the previously published article would be required. We hope that by presenting this article and subsequent articles concerning the use of CT-guided biopsies, the reader will acquire an appreciation of the proper role of this exciting new technique in comparison to the available imaging modalities. We believe that as individuals become more experienced with the imaging capabilities of these CT devices, they will want to develop the technique of obtaining biopsy confirmation of the imaging diagnosis.
