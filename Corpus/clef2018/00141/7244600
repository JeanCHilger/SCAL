Dilated Wirsung's ducts: contribution of axial tomometry. The normal pancreatic main duct is not visualized by CT except with the latest equipment permitting a slice thickness of 1-2 mm. In our series the main duct dilatation is due to benign lesions in 46% of the cases and due to malignancies in 54%. In the absence of typical signs of chronic pancreatitis and of clinical features of acute pancreatitis, the duct dilatation is usually of tumoral origin. CT frequently is sufficiently diagnostic for surgery to be performed. In duct dilatation with evidence of obstructive lesion, E.R.C.P. is still required.
