Abdominal angio-CT: technique of injection and scanning (author's transl). Angio-CT consists in a rapid bolus intravenous injection of contrast medium followed by serial sequential fast scanning to include the arterial and the venous phases. Injection of contrast medium of 50 cm3 are made 3 or 4 times for a total of 150 divided by 200 cm3 of contrast medium at an iodine concentration of 29 g/100 cm3. At the beginning, scans are intercalated with injections, until the total amount of contrast medium is reached. Thereafter, the scans are rapidly continued to cover the whole organ under study. The scanning during the vascular enhancement has considerably helped our diagnostic accuracy and has a made the drip-infusion technique out-moded.
