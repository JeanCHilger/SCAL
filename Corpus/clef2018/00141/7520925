Needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas. A study of five cases with an emphasis on utility and differential diagnosis. In this study, our experience with five cases of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas is described, which was seen over a 13-yr period. The diagnosis in four of the cases was made from aspirated material that was obtained under computed tomography (CT) guidance and, in one case, following an intraoperative aspirate. In four cases, the tumor was found to be in the head of pancreas, whereas in one case, the neoplasm was located in the tail. All the cases were elderly male patients. As a result of our study, it is believed that aspiration cytodiagnosis of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (a rare subtype of pancreatic carcinoma) can be made with confidence when performed intraoperatively or with imaging assistance. Also, aspiration cytology is a sensitive, specific, and relatively simple procedure that provides adequate material on which a confident diagnostic interpretation can be made of this uncommon neoplasm.
