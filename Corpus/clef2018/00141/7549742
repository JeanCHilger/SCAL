Magnetic resonance cholangiography. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) can be performed with data from a routine imaging protocol, without the need for additional pulse sequences or special equipment. We studied three patients with obstructive jaundice who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver. T2-weighted fat suppressed fast spin-echo sequences were processed with a maximum intensity projection algorithm to create three-dimensional images of the dilated portions of the biliary tree. Results were correlated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography. These images compared favorably with those acquired on scanners in which special breath-holding gradient echo protocols are used.
