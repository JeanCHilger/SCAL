Case report: computed tomography features of complete splenic infarction, cavitation and spontaneous decompression complicating pancreatitis. Splenic infarction is a rare complication of pancreatitis. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman, who had undergone previous drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst, and who represented with left upper quadrant pain. Absence of enhancement of the splenic parenchyma during contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) allowed confident diagnosis of complete splenic infarction. A later CT scan revealed splenic cavitation with spontaneous decompression into the stomach. The aetiology of these unusual complications of pancreatitis is discussed.
