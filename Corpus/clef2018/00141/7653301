The diagnosis and treatment of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is a disease in which there are still considerable difficulties of etiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic nature due to a lack of knowledge of the mechanism responsible for the pancreatic autodigestion process. With the objective of evaluating the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic options, with particular emphasis on surgical treatment, we undertook a prospective clinical study of 153 cases of acute pancreatitis, over a period of 66 months (January 1986-June 1991) based on a specially prepared computerised register. The analysis of the results we obtained allows us to emphasise the following: a) the most common etiology was the alcoholism, closely followed by cholelithiasis, with values of approximately 40% for both b) abdominal ultrasonography allowed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in 51.2% and the diagnosis of associated pathology in 56.7%, particularly cholelithiasis (41.7%)
