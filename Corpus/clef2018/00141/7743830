Complications of biliary cysts. Apropos of 10 cases. Ten cases of complications of simple biliary cysts were reported: 4 intracystic haemorrhages including 1 intraperitoneal rupture, 3 bacterial infections including 1 case with invalidating pain. Complications of biliary cysts raises the problem of the differential diagnosis with cysts caused parasites, neoplastic processes (cystadenomas and pseudocysts of the liver) and with intrahepatic collections of pancreatic or traumatic origin. Imaging and echo-guided puncture are the most appropriate exploration techniques. MRI has been particularly helpful to evaluate bleeding in an intrahepatic cyst. A pathology examination of the cyst wall and its contents should always be performed. Theoretically, partial cystectomy (performed here in 8 cases) is the indicated treatment. Total cystectomy (1 case) is justified when the diagnosis of cystadenoma cannot be excluded. The role of liver resection is very limited. Preventive resection of a simple biliary cyst greater than 8 cm can be indicated, particularly with videolaparoscopy.
