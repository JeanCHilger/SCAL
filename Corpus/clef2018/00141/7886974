Hereditary pancreatitis--a case report. A female patient with hereditary chronic pancreatitis is described. She presented initially at the age of 18 years with abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis. Predisposing etiological factors were not recognized. During the ensuing years she had recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and chronic pancreatitis with extensive pancreatic calcifications was finally demonstrated. Six other family members within three generations were affected by chronic pancreatitis suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. None of the affected patients showed signs of diabetes mellitus, aminoaciduria or hyperparathyroidism.
