Primary lymphoma of the pancreas. Lymphoma of the pancreas is uncommon. Secondary invasion from contiguous, retroperitoneal lymph node disease is the predominant mode of involvement. Lymphoma originating in and remaining localized to the pancreas is very rare. A case of primary lymphoma confined to the pancreas, in a 35 year old man, is described. Only two other similar cases could be found in the English literature.
