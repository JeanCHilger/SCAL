Analysis of Ki-ras in pancreatic fluid aspirate. A new diagnostic possibility in investigation of pancreatic cancer. The prognosis for pancreatic carcinoma is generally poor. The chance of survival could be improved if curative surgery were performed, but early diagnosis is then essential. Fine-needle aspiration cytology and endoscopic retrograde cholepancreaticography (ERCP) are widely used in order to obtain a precise diagnosis before laparotomy. In almost all patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas, the oncogene Ki-ras is activated by point mutation. We describe a patient where conventional diagnostic procedures were inconclusive. However, DNA-analysis of aspirate from the pancreatic duct and from a pancreatic cyst showed activated Ki-ras oncogene. A malignant diagnosis was later confirmed. We propose that DNA-analyses of pancreatic fluid or tissues should be used whenever facing problems with an early and accurate diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.
