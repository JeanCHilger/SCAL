Imaging islet cell tumours. The localization of islet cell tumours presents a challenge to the radiologist and requires meticulous attention to detail in both technique and interpretation. As several imaging techniques are capable of demonstrating the tumour and none is absolutely accurate, a rational approach to the localization of these tumours requires a careful consideration of cost, sensitivity and the availability of special expertise. In almost all cases, initial imaging is performed with a combination of transabdominal ultrasound and CT. This will demonstrate the tumour and any hepatic metastases in about 40% of gastrinomas, 80% of insulinomas and almost all other functioning and non-functioning tumours. Where these tests are negative or equivocal, arteriography (which may be combined with ASVS) is the next line of investigation. If the tumour remains undetected, it is likely to be a small insulinoma or gastrinoma. Further investigation is dependent on local practice and the tumour type. Endoscopic ultrasound is rapidly emerging as a technique of high sensitivity in detecting small pancreatic tumours and may also demonstrate extrapancreatic gastrinomas. Transhepatic venous sampling and somatostatin receptor imaging have the advantage that they are not directly dependent on tumour size and they are particularly applicable to difficult cases where other imaging modalities are negative. TPVS is invasive and, while sensitive for insulinomas, is frequently unhelpful in gastrinomas. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, on the other hand, is more sensitive for gastrinomas. In future, MRI may prove to be at least as accurate as CT but as yet its exact role is uncertain. At the time of surgery, intraoperative ultrasound is a useful adjunct to palpation, and may avoid a standard distal pancreatectomy in patients with insulinoma.
