Duodenal diverticula associated with acute pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of duodenal diverticula as an etiologic factor in acute pancreatitis.We have reviewed the records of patients with diverticulum of the second portion of the duodenum diagnosed by gastroduodenal radiology or endoscopy during the period 1991-1992 in our hospital. As a control group we studied patients without duodenal diverticulum. All subjects underwent biliary-pancreatic ultrasonography. Thirty-eight patients had a duodenal diverticulum and gallstones 36 had a duodenal diverticulum but no gallstones 21 had gallstones alonePatients with duodenal diverticula had a greater prevalence of gallstones than those without (51.3% VS 33.3%, p < 0.005). Of the thirty-eight patients with duodenal diverticula and gallstones 23.7% had acute pancreatitis. None of the 21 patients without duodenal diverticulum and with gallstones had acute pancreatitis, p < 0.05. The median age of patients with duodenal diverticulum without gallstones was 64.25 years, range 34-85, and the age of those with duodenal diverticulum and gallstones was 70.4 years, range 37-87, p < 0.05.1) Gallstones may cause acute pancreatitis in patients with D2 duodenal diverticula. 2) Patients with a D2 duodenal diverticulum frequently have gallstones. 3) The fact that the age of patients with duodenal diverticulum was lower than that of patients with both duodenal diverticulum and gallstones suggests that duodenal diverticula may play a role in the pathogenesis of gallstones.
