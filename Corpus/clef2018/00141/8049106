Value of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pancreatic and gastroduodenal endocrine tumors. To present our experience in the localization of endocrine-gastroenteropancreatic tumors (EGPT) by endoscopic ultrasonography.Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed in 10 patients with 13 pancreatic tumors and four in the digestive tract.Sensitivity and diagnostic efficacy were 69% and 70%, respectively. These values were greater than those observed by other image techniques. Also, additional diagnoses and other three tumors of less than 1 cm undiagnosed by ultrasonography (US), Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR), were detected. Specificity was 80% because among five case-controls a false positive was found. With more experience and the possibility to find small tumors, USE should improve other image techniques in the diagnosis and localization of endocrine digestive tumors.
