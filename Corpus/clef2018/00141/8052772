Predictive value of tomographic images in pancreatic diseases. In patients with acute pancreatitis, ultrasound is used to clarify the etiology of biliary pancreatitis by diagnosis of cholelithiasis and to follow up pancreatic fluid collection in pseudocyst development. CT ist the imaging modality of choice in clinically severe pancreatitis of patients representing diagnostic dilemmas or failing responds to conservative therapy and in patients with suspected complications. The radiologic diagnosis in chronic pancreatitis is primarily based on ultrasonography, CT and ERCP. ERCP is the most accurate method for diagnosis of pancreatic ductal changes. Screening for pancreatic neoplasms is accomplished by ultrasonography, while CT is used for detection, diagnosis and staging. Magnetic resonance tomography has proved to be equal to CT. The highest diagnostic accuracy for detection of small neoplasms and for local staging is achieved by endoscopic ultrasonography.
