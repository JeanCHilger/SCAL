Hydatid cyst of the pancreas. Apropos of 7 cases. The authors present a series of seven cases of hydatid cysts of the pancreas. This localization is rare since it accounts for less than 1% of the various sites of hydatid disease. The clinical signs are variable according to degree of bilio-pancreatic involvement. The preoperative diagnosis was established in three patients by ultrasonography, computed tomography and positive serology. Protruding dome was used in five patients. Distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy and Whipple resection were performed in other patients. There was no mortality and the postoperative morbidity was dominated by external biliary or pancreatic fistulae and local sepsis.
