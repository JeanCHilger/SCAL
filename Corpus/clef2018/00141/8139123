Clinicopathological features and diagnostic points of uncommon pancreatic tumors. Clinicopathological features of uncommon pancreatic tumors including solid cystic tumor (SCT), acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatoblastoma are described, based upon a literature survey and own experiences. They are often discovered by US and CT as asymptomatic pseudocystic tumor. SCTs almost always occur in young female and Pancreatoblastoma, in children less than five years old. The prognosis is very favorable in SCT, and relatively good in acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatoblastoma. Pancreatoblastoma is often associated with the elevation of serum AFP levels. Characteristic histological features and immunocytochemical features are also described, all of which are very different from those of usual pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Molecular biological features including the results of k-ras and p53 point mutation are also discussed. In addition to the clinicopathological features, these uncommon tumors are very different from usual ductal carcinoma in the molecular biological features.
