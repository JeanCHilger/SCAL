Diagnosis and surgical treatment for endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Clinical features, diagnostic accuracy of imaging study, and the outcome of surgical treatment for endocrine tumors of the pancreas were analyzed in 12 patients who underwent surgery for the past 16 years and 11 months. The 12 cases were classified into two groups: functioning tumors in 8 (insulinoma in 7 including one malignant case, and malignant glucagonoma in one), and nonfunctioning tumors in 4 including 3 malignant cases. In functioning tumors, tumor size was 2 cm or less in 6 benign cases, but 5 cm or more in 2 malignant cases. In nonfunctioning tumors, tumor size was larger, ranging from 3.5 to 8.0 cm. Diagnostic accuracy for localization of functioning tumors was 66.7% for US, 75.0% for CT, 66.7% for endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP), and 50.0% for selective angiography, while all nonfunctioning tumors could be detected by any diagnostic imagings. Percutaneous transhepatic portal venous sampling for immunoreactive insulin was very helpful to localize insulinoma. Stenosis or obstruction of the main pancreatic duct on ERP and arterial encasement on angiography highly suggested a malignant tumor. Even for malignant cases with liver metastasis, resection of the primary tumor with debulking of metastatic disease or intraarterial infusion chemotherapy was considered to prolong patient prognosis.
