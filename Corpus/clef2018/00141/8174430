Role of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography in pancreatic ascites. We present a case of pancreatic ascites. The diagnosis was strongly suspected on the basis of ascitic fluid analysis and was confirmed by observation of pancreatic duct contrast leakage at endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). Computed tomography was not helpful in this case. For localization and final confirmation of the lesion, ERP is the most valuable investigative method.
