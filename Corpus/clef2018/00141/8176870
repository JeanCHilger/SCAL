Diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic diseases of extrahepatic bile ducts and major duodenal papilla. Fifty-three operations were conducted on 48 patients for tumors of the extrahepatic bile ducts and the major duodenal papilla. Early diagnosis of this pathological condition is very difficult, which affects directly the results of treatment 18% of patients underwent radical operations. Modern diagnostic methods--computer tomography, ultrasonic examination, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography made it possible to detect neoplastic diseases in all of the examined patients. Radical surgical treatment is expedient in distal localization of the neoplastic process and in the absence of metastases. Endoscopic and puncture methods of decompression of the bile ducts are indicated in diffuse forms of the disease.
