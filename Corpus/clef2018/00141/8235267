Frantz's tumor (papillary epithelial and cystic neoplasms of the pancreas): report of 3 cases. Three cases of Frantz tumor, a papillary and cystic tumor of the pancreas, are discussed and compared with other cases reported in the literature. The neoplasm behaved in these three cases as a benign tumor. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in one patient and distal pancreatectomy in the other two. C T scan and ultrasonography are useful for the diagnosis of these tumors. Cut surfaces show mostly well encapsulated tumors with the characteristically solid and hemorrhagic-necrotic patterns. Usually they are of a very low-grade malignancy so the complete surgical removal is the treatment of choice.
