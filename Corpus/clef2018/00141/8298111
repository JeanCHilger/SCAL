Atypically located pancreatic pseudocysts in the liver, spleen, stomach wall and mediastinum: their CT diagnosis. It was the aim of this computed tomography study to analyse the frequency, morphology, and cause of atypically located pancreatic pseudocysts. Of 236 patients with acute (n = 87) or chronic (n = 149) pancreatitis, 85 (36%) had pancreatic pseudocysts. Pancreatic pseudocysts atypically located in the liver, spleen, stomach wall or mediastinum were diagnosed in 19 (22.4%) of the 85 patients. The mean size of intrapancreatic, parapancreatic, and atypically located pseudocysts was 2.7, 4.4, and 7.5 cm, respectively. The density values of atypically located pseudocysts did not differ significantly from those of intra/parapancreatic pseudocysts. The natural pathways along which atypically located pseudocysts develop primarily are the hepatoduodenal, gastrohepatic, and gastrosplenic ligaments.
