AIDS-related cholangitis: diagnostic features and course in 15 patients. About 60 cases of cholangitis in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been described. We report our experience concerning 15 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who had cholangitis as defined by radiological findings. Cholangitis was the revealing event of AIDS or HIV infection in 4 patients (27%). Twelve (80%) of the patients were homosexual men. The main diagnostic features were abdominal pain (73%), cholestasis without jaundice (100%), intestinal cryptosporidiosis (80%) and abnormal findings on abdominal ultrasonography (87%). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography appears to be essential for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, particularly for patients with papillary stenosis who represented 64% of our population. Biological and morphological pancreatic abnormalities were associated in 2 of the 8 patients who underwent retrograde opacification of the Wirsung duct. The microbiological yield was highest in patients who underwent multiple biopsies (duodenal and papillary) and bile sampling. The organisms found included Cryptosporidium (57%) of cases), CMV (28%) and Microsporidia (7%). Twelve-month survival after the diagnosis of cholangitis was only 14% and all deaths were related to AIDS progression. Endoscopic sphincterotomy relieved abdominal pain in 86% of the patients who underwent the procedure. Evaluation of medical treatment, particularly ursodeoxycholic acid, is necessary.
