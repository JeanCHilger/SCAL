Fine-needle aspiration of dermoid cyst of the pancreas: a case report. A 53-yr-old woman presented with a left upper quadrant abdominal mass attached to the body of the pancreas. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) yielded cyst fluid containing numerous benign, mature squamous cells, keratin debris, and inflammatory cells. The diagnosis of dermoid cyst was subsequently rendered on the resected specimen. The cytologic and histologic features are presented. FNA cytology proves to be a valuable diagnostic adjunct in the preoperative evaluation of a patient with dermoid cyst of the pancreas.
