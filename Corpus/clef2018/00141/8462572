Radiologic diagnosis of pseudoaneurysms complicating pancreatitis. Angiographic and computed tomographic (CT) examinations in five patients with arterial pseudoaneurysms complicating pancreatitis were evaluated retrospectively. Selective arteriography was superior to CT imaging in demonstrating pseudoaneurysm formation. However, angiography was performed in four patients after a CT study considered suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm none of these four patients had clinical evidence of bleeding. Correlation with surgical findings was established in four patients, indicating that pseudoaneurysms complicating pancreatitis were not located within a pancreatic pseudocyst. Some thrombus-containing pseudoaneurysms may present with a pseudocyst appearance on CT images.
