Place of celioscopy in the diagnosis of invasiveness of digestive cancers. The adequate treatment of gastrointestinal tract carcinoma requires accurate preoperative staging. Laparoscopy has been advocated for this purpose. We reviewed the data of 12 patients and the literature to compare the results of laparoscopic staging to those of conventional imaging (ultrasonography-CT scan). Laparoscopy was more sensitive in the diagnosis of peritoneal and lives metastases. It was inadequate for the diagnosis of lymph node metastases. Laparoscopy was especially useful in patients with esophagus, stomach, pancreas and liver cancers. Laparoscopic ultrasonography improved the staging of pancreatic carcinoma and the diagnosis of liver metastases.
