Endoscopic ultrasonography diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was developed for the detection of small pancreatic cancer because the complete demonstration of the pancreas by conventional ultrasonography (US) was sometimes prevented by intestinal gas and echoic reduction due to the deeper position of the pancreas head and tail. In this article, the diagnosis, staging, limitations, and hazards of EUS for diagnosing pancreatic cancer are described.
