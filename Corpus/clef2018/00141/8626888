Differentiation between multiple liver hemangiomas and liver metastases of gastrinomas: value of enhanced MRI. Hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumors are known to mimic hemangiomas on nonenhanced SE MR sequences. The usefulness of MR examination with gadolinium injection to identify lesions was prospectively evaluated.Nine patients with multiple liver metastases of gastrinomas were compared with six patients showing multiple liver hemangiomas. Patients underwent unenhanced T2-weighted SE, T1-weighted SE, and FLASH sequences, followed by enhanced sequential FLASH sequences and a 5 min delayed T1-weighted SE sequence.On T2-weighted SE sequence, all hemangiomas displayed the same typical morphology as a sharply defined, homogeneous, high signal intensity lesion, but this pattern was also observed for some or all of the lesions in seven of nine patients with gastrinoma metastases. Dynamic FLASH sequences were accurate for lesions larger than 2 cm, hemangiomas displaying a nodular peripheral enhancement with centripetal filling in, and metastases displaying either an initial homogeneous or a regular peripheral enhancement. Precise assessment of lesions smaller than 2 cm remained equivocal. Delayed T1-weighted. SE sequence (performed at least 5 min after Gd-chelate injection) was the most accurate technique to identify metastases by showing hypo- or isointensity signal, whereas all hemangiomas were hyperintense.Postcontrast delayed T1-weighted sequence is the primary technique to differentiate equivocal cases of hemangiomas from metastases of gastrinoma.
