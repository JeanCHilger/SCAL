Pancreaticopleural fistula visualized by computed tomographic scan combined with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. We report a case with left pleural effusion caused by a pancreaticopleural fistula, which was formed between a small pseudocyst in the pancreatic body and the posterior mediastinal side of left costophrenic recess. The patient, a 66-year-old male with an alcohol drinking habit, had cough and chest pain but no symptoms or signs suggestive of abdominal pathology. In this case, computed tomographic scan performed immediately after endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was very useful not only in demonstrating the presence of the pancreatic internal fistula but in clarifying its anatomical relation to the surrounding organs.
