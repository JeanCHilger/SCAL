Non-invasive evaluation of the biliary tree with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: initial clinical experience. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a new, non-invasive imaging technique for visualization of the biliary ducts. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed on 136 patients (20-87 years old) with a superconductive magnet at 0.5T (Philips Gyroscan T5). Volumetric images on coronal planes were acquired a T2 weighted turbo spin echo sequence (TR = 3000
