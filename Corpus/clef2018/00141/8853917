In-111 labeled octreotide imaging of a primary carcinoid lesion undetected by conventional imaging studies in a patient with "chronic pancreatitis". This is a case report of a patient with an initial diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis who actually had metastatic carcinoid tumor. His symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea were manifestations of the large tumor bulk within the liver as well as carcinoid syndrome. Although abdominal CT scans showed multiple liver lesions, the primary lesion was not identified by conventional imaging studies. However, the mid-gut primary lesion was visualized on in-111 labeled octreotide scintigraphy where the liver lesions were better delineated and seen to be separate from the normal pancreas when the Tc-99m sulfur colloid images were compared to the octreotide images.
