MR imaging techniques for evaluation of the pancreas. New techniques have transformed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pancreas from an imaging examination that had been inferior to computed tomography (CT) in diagnostic capability, to one that today may well be superior for many applications. These technologic advances include chemical-shift imaging, fast spin-echo T2-weighted imaging and its modifications, such as MR cholangiopancreatography, and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Taken together, these techniques can detect diseases that may be difficult to appreciate on CT, such as small pancreatic adenocarcinomas, islet cell tumors, and ductal abnormalities and calculi. Newer intravenous contrast agents such as Mangafodipir, as well as oral contrast agents, have not been widely used but show promise for future improved pancreatic MR imaging.
