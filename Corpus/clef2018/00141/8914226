MR imaging of pancreatic disorders. Newer magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer greater precision in diagnosing various pancreatic disorders, primarily through faster image acquisitions. These include breath-hold rapid T1-weighted images, fast spin-echo sequences, and angiographic techniques. Altered signal intensity on fat-saturated T1-weighted images is one of the principal signs of pancreatic disease, and may affect the gland diffusely with chronic pancreatitis or focally with carcinoma. T2-weighted sequences primarily characterize peripancreatic fluid, ductal obstruction, carcinoma, or cystic or mucinous tumors. Heavily T2-weighted cholangiographic reconstructions are important to evaluate ductal obstructions. Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced images improve the accuracy for identifying and characterizing islet-cell tumors and pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
