MR pancreatography: technique and applications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a diagnostic method that uses three-dimensional data sets for projection images, as well as arbitrary cross-sectional images, of the pancreatic ducts. The method is simple, not uncomfortable, and requires no contrast media. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was initially developed as a substitute for ERCP for diagnosis of pancreatic disorders such as neoplasm and chronic pancreatitis, but the method offers advantages other than safety and flexibility. MRCP may be the diagnostic method of choice when ERCP is contraindicated or fails. Imaging after injection of secretin may add functional information to MRCP that may reflect one aspect of pancreatic exocrine physiology. Adequate diagnostic evaluation of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic trauma, and mucinous ductal ectasia may also be feasible. Innovations such as fast sequences with breath-holding, receiver multicoils, high-power gradient systems, and postprocessing will further refine the technique. Optimized MRCP could limit indications for diagnostic endoscopic pancreatography substantially.
