Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall on aberrant pancreas. Apropos of 2 cases. Cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas is characterized by the presence in the duodenal thickened muscularis of cysts corresponding to dilated ducts lined with exocrine epithelium. The pancreas proper is normal. Cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas occurs mostly in men, in the periampullary region. Two cases, revealed by duodenal stenosis, are reported here. Symptoms and morphologic investigations favoured a diagnosis of malignancy: in one case, partial portal thrombosis was observed this complication has not been previously described in association with cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas. Endosonography was non-contributory in these 2 cases because of duodenal stenosis. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed associated in one case with portal thrombectomy. Pathologic findings allowed diagnosis of cystic dystrophy in heterotopic pancreas.
