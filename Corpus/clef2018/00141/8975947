Periampullary carcinoma detected after sphincterotomy. Although periampullary carcinoma can often be diagnosed at an early stage because of its strategic location, in a substantial number of cases (23% to 25% of periampullary carcinoma cases), the papilla can be prominent, but without an identifiable mass or ulceration. As a result, duodenoscopy alone can miss the tumor. In this series, the usefulness of sphincterotomy in establishing a diagnosis of periampullary carcinoma is documented.A total of 664 patients, who had clinical, biochemical and/or sonographic evidence of pancreaticobiliary disorders underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) at Hacettepe University Hospital between March 1985 and September 1994. All identified lesions were biopsied.In sixty-six of the 664 patients, a specific periampullary or pancreatic diagnosis could be made. These included 30 cases of pancreatic carcinoma (14 in the head, 15 in the corpus, and 1 in the tail), 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis, 15 cases of periampullary carcinoma and 11 miscellaneous. None of the 15 periampullary carcinomas was demonstrable by abdominal computed tomography, sonography or pancreatic angiography. In 12, the diagnosis was established immediately by endoscopic visualization of the tumor and biopsy. In the remaining 3, the tumor was visualized as a protruding mass only after a papillatomy was performed. All cases were treated surgically with a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. No symptoms of dumping were experienced postoperatively. The survival of these 15 patients was good with a mean survival of 24.2 months.Careful endoscopic examination of the periampullary mucosa before and after sphincterotomy is required to identify periampullary carcinoma. A pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy revealed excellent post-surgical outcome with no post operative symptoms of the dumping syndrome.
