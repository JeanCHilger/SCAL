Visceral artery aneurysms. Visceral artery aneurysms are an uncommon form of vascular disease that have a significant potential for rupture or erosion into an adjacent viscera, resulting in life-threatening hemorrhage. During the last decade, hepatic artery aneurysms have become the most commonly reported visceral artery aneurysm. This change likely reflects the increased use of percutaneous diagnostic and therapeutic biliary procedures, as well as increased use of diagnostic computed tomography after blunt abdominal trauma. A second significant development is the increased use of percutaneous catheter-based therapy in the management of visceral artery aneurysms. Nonetheless, a continued aggressive approach to the diagnosis and management of these unusual aneurysms remains warranted.
