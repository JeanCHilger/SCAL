Haemorrhage into a duodenal cyst with ectopic gastric epithelium, a rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction in an adult. Duodenal duplications, including also cysts with gastric epithelium, are congenital anomalies observed in less than 1 per 100,000 births. They are usually detected in infants or children.To evaluate and discuss the diagnostic work-up and treatment.A rare case of haemorrhage in the duodenal cyst in a 32-year-old woman with gastric outlet obstruction is presented.Computed tomography (CT) revealed cystic lesion in the duodenum. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed normal biliary and pancreatic ducts. Final histology demonstrated cystic lesion in the duodenum which was lined with gastric mucosa.Preoperative CT and ERCP are important in the differential diagnosis and planning of treatment in duodenal cystic lesions.
