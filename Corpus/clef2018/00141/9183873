Total pancreatectomy for diffuse and malignant mucinous ductal ectasia of the pancreas. Apropos of 2 cases. Two cases of mucinous duct ectasia are reported. Epithelial changes were spread along the pancreatic duct and ductal ectasia was diffuse. Multi focal infiltrating carcinoma was observed in one case, microinvasive carcinoma located in the head of the pancreas was observed. Morphologic features by computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography pancreatography were useful for preoperative diagnosis of mucinous pancreatic duct ectasia. In one case, malignancy was suggested by measurement of tumor markers in cystic fluid aspirated during percutaneous pancreatography. Total duodenopancreatectomy was performed in both cases. The two patients were alive and disease-free with a follow-up in both cases of 18 and 36 months.
