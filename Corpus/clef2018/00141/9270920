Endosonography-guided fine-needle biopsy of indurated pancreatic lesions using an automated biopsy device. We have designed and evaluated a prototype automated spring-loaded biopsy needle for endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided tissue sampling of indurated lesions in which sampling using conventional aspiration needles has failed.EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy using the new device was performed in four patients (two men, two women, mean age 65 years) with indurated pancreatic lesions that could not be penetrated with a conventional manually operated aspiration needle. The lesions were located in the head of the pancreas in two patients, in the genu in one, and in the body in one.The automatic biopsy needle allowed penetration of the pancreatic lesions in all cases. The biopsy route was transduodenal in two patients, and transgastric in the other two. The biopsies provided a core specimen for histological and cytological diagnosis in all cases. No complications occurred.The spring-loaded biopsy needle allows tissue sampling of indurated pancreatic lesions that cannot be penetrated with conventional aspiration needles. Further studies are warranted to determine whether this device can improve the results of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
