Insulinomas--nesidioblastomas. Clinical experience. Between 1980 and 1996, 16 patients (10 women) with pathologically confirmed insulinomas were operated on they represents a median of 0.9 per year and 1.1 per cent from the total of pancreatic tumors. Median age was 47.2 (+/- 22.8) years old (range 23-68). Insulinomas occurred with following frequency in: head--2 patients, body and tail--11 patients and diffuse forms (nesidioblastomas)--3 patients. The specific clinical forms only with tumoral syndrome (without hypoglycemic manifestations) and one was an intraoperative discovery. In the case of the four patients two presented with splenic-portal hypertension +/- upper digestive haemorrhages and the other two only tumoral syndrome. The surgical approach was: the midline (ten), uni- or bilateral subcostal (five), and other incisions one. There were performed tumor exeresis through: enucleation (three), segmentary pancreatectomies (two), spleno-left-pancreatectomies (nine) and the extension of an anterior pancreatectomy (one). In one case biopsy alone was done. The tumors were not intraoperatively identified in three cases (blind left spleno-pancreatectomies). The malignancy index was 4/16 (25 per cent). Postoperative mortality rate was 12.5 per cent (two patients: one acute necrotizing pancreatitis and one pulmonary embolism).
