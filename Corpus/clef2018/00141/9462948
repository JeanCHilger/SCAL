Severe acute pancreatitis. Its management and experience. The authors examined a group of 91 cases of acute pancreatitis hospitalised and treated between 1992 and 1996, using multiparametric bioclinical scores like Ranson, Imrie, Apache II systems and morphological scores obtained through C.T., they have divided the examined group into patients with A.B.P. (acute benign pancreatitis)--59 (64.84%), who don't require exquisite therapeutical means, with positive healing and A.S.P.--32 (35.16%), who require a complex medico-surgical therapeutics with unforeseeable evolution and results. The purpose of the paper was the one of establishing a diagnostical and therapeutical strategy for the A.S.P. adequate to actual conceptions. The correct diagnosis of acute pancreatitis initially has been established at 59 (64.83%) and erroneous at 32 (36.13%) cases. The diagnosis of A.S.P. has been established in 32 (35.16%). The etiology has been lithiasic (biliary) for 31.25% and nonbiliary for 68.75% patients. The C.T. examination in the best way to diagnose necrosis and infections, to follow the evolution and especially the surgical indication, achieved by the authors in 30% of cases. The initial medical treatment has been fulfilled at all the patients and the surgical one at 29 (91.63%). There have been implemented explorer laparotomies in 33.33% cases, interventions on the pancreas in 72.66%, operations associated on the biliary ways 41.37%, necessity operations 13.8%, with different types of draining (conventional and open abdomen). The results have been taxed by locoregional complications in 72.41%, general complications in 44.51% and a general rate of decrease of 43.75%. It is recommended initial surgical abstention and gravity estimations, the reanimation of all A.S.P. for prevention and treatment of general complications, surgical treatment of A.S.P. complications. The A.S.P. treatment of biliary (lithiasic) etiology after two months and after C.T. to confirm inflammatory process remission.
