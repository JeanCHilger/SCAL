Splenic vein thrombosis secondary to focal pancreatitis diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography. We report splenic vein thrombosis diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) after the failure of extracorporeal ultrasound and contrast enhanced computed tomography to establish the diagnosis in a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Subsequent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings of retroperitoneal fibrosis and confirmed the EUS findings. Splenic vein thrombosis is a well-known cause of gastrointestinal bleeding and splenomegaly pancreatitis and pancreatic tumors are its most common underlying causes. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography are frequently used to diagnose splenic vein thrombosis. We discuss the use of EUS for diagnosis of vascular anomalies in the gastrointestinal tract and the association of splenic vein thrombosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and pancreatitis.
