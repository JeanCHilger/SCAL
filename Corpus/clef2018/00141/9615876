Is pancreatoscopy of any benefit in clarifying the diagnosis of pancreatic duct lesions? Modern fine-caliber endoscopes enable clinicians to directly visualize the pancreatic duct. They allow intraductal manipulation under optical control. We tried to evaluate the additional diagnostic potential of pancreatoscopy in assessing inconclusive intraductal pancreatic changes.We prospectively performed 20 pancreatoscopies in 18 patients with inconclusive ductal abnormalities that had been previously investigated by computed tomography (CT) scan, abdominal ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The CHF-BP 30 (Olympus Optical Co., Japan) endoscope with an outer diameter of 3.1 mm and an instrumentation channel of 1.2 mm was used. Biopsies, cytological brushing and fluid collection were carried out, and the site of ductal abnormality was visualized. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) was carried out in every patient prior to insertion of the pancreatoscope.Seven intraductal tumors were histologically confirmed, i.e. five intraductal papillary mucinous tumors and two adenocarcinomas. Benign appearance of the intraductal lesion plus negative histopathological examinations were confirmed by a follow-up of two years in eight patients. Five had chronic pancreatitis, and a further three had pancreatitis with strictures, blood clot obstruction, and idiopathic benign stricture, respectively. There were no complications with the exception of one bleeding episode after EST no pancreatitis occurred.Pancreatoscopy is of diagnostic value in addition to CT, transabdominal ultrasound and ERCP in the differential diagnosis of poorly defined pancreatic lesions, particularly when assessing alterations of the ductal caliber without parenchymatous lesions.
