Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas: report of two cases. Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas is a rare variant of pancreatic exocrine carcinoma. We herein report two patients with this entity. One patient was a 60-yr-old Japanese man complaining of a palpable mass, 5.5 cm in the greatest diameter, in the epigastrium. Serum CA 19-9 was increased (2010 U/ml). Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a mass in the pancreatic tail with central necrosis and invading the posterior wall of the stomach. Angiography showed an encasement of the splenic artery and complete obstruction of the splenic vein. Distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and partial resection of the stomach were done. The patient died of uncontrolled bleeding from the duodenal ulcer four months after operation. The other patient was a 73-yr-old man who presented with jaundice. The CA 19-9 was also elevated (354.8 U/ml). Ultrasonography showed a pancreatic head mass of heterogeneous echogeneity and computed tomography demonstrated a cystic mass with an enhanced rim, indicating necrosis in the tumor center. Angiography showed a hypervascular mass in the head of the pancreas. Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy was done, but the patient died of multiple liver metastases 10 months after the operation. From our experience with the two patients, the presence of central necrosis in an infiltrative huge pancreatic tumor seems to be suggestive of the diagnosis of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas.
