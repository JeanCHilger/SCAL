Renal cancer and late pancreatic metastases. Apropos of 3 cases and review of the literature. Renal cell carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumour which can always give rise to metastases, usually situated in the lungs, bone and liver. In contrast, pancreatic metastases are exceptional and can occur late. The authors report three cases of metachronous pancreatic metastases, 1, 4 and 10 years after nephrectomy. The procedures performed consisted of Whipple procedure, tumour excision and total duodenopancreatectomy. Although rare when isolated to the pancreas, these metastases can justify even audacious pancreatic resection.
