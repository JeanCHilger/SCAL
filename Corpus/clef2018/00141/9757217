Comparative study of tumor evaluation with computerized tomography and surgery in ovarian cancer. To evaluate the results of an abdomino-pelvic scan in cancers of the ovary in comparison with surgery.We reviewed the observations concerning patients operated on for malignant tumors of the ovary between January 1992 and April 1995 in our anti-cancer center. We selected 32 patients who had had both a complete surgical abdominal exploration (laparotomy or laparoscopy) and an abdominal pelvic scan in the preceding months. We divided the abdomen into 33 areas and compared the scan of each with the surgical findings. Two cancer radiologists, including one gynecology specialist, studied the imaging separately. Neither knew the results of the surgical observations.Imaging findings varied with localization tumor size and presence or not of ascites radiologists. For certain localization, detection of lesions was difficult for both readers (pancreas, spleen, stomach), for others, recognition improved with experience (bowel, diaphragm, colon).The clinician must be aware of the variability of ovarian cancer assessment by CT scan, particularly if imaging alone is being used to guide treatment.
