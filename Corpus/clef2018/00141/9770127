Apoptosis with positive direct immunofluorescence findings in a patient with necrolytic migratory erythema. A 45-year-old man with a glucagonoma and necrolytic migratory erythema is described. Clinical, radiographic, and histologic features were typical for this syndrome. However, a skin biopsy specimen for direct immunofluorescence examination revealed apoptotic keratinocytes that stained positive with immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, and C3. These immunofluorescence findings were initially interpreted erroneously as showing erythema multiforme or a related disorder. We present a unique case of necrolytic migratory erythema with positive direct immunofluorescence findings reflecting immunoglobulin and complement deposition within dyskeratotic epithelial cells.
