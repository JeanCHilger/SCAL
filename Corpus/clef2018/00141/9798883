Value of MR cholangiopancreatography in evaluating choledochal cysts. The aim of this retrospective study was to clarify whether MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a suitable replacement for ERCP in evaluation of the choledochal cyst.Sixteen patients (six adult and 10 pediatric) with choledochal cysts underwent MRCP using a half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence. Extent of the cyst, defects within the biliary tree, and presence or absence of the anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary duct were evaluated. Findings were compared with those of ERCP.MRCP better defined the proximal biliary tree than did ERCP in two patients. Defects within the biliary tree were diagnosed correctly on MRCP in eight patients however, two defects within the distal common bile duct were missed in pediatric patients. The presence of the anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary duct was revealed accurately by MRCP in all adult patients but was revealed accurately in only four of the 10 pediatric patients.MRCP appears to offer diagnostic information that is equivalent to that of ERCP for assessment of choledochal cysts in adults. In pediatric patients, MRCP should not replace ERCP however, MRCP can play an important role as a noninvasive examination and should be considered a first-choice imaging technique for evaluation of choledochal cysts.
