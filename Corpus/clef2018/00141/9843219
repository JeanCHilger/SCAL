Pitfalls of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) represents a relatively new development in MR technology that provides a noninvasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for evaluating pancreaticobiliary tract disease. Although the accuracy of MRCP has been documented in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases including choledocholithiasis and malignancy, pitfalls associated with this technique may result in diagnostic errors. This essay illustrates both technical and interpretive pitfalls of MRCP and suggests strategies for their recognition and avoidance.
