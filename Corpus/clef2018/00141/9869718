Cost effectiveness of EUS for preoperative localization of pancreatic endocrine tumors. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is highly accurate in the localization of small pancreatic tumors. We determined the cost effectiveness of EUS used early in the preoperative evaluation of pancreatic endocrine tumors.In a study with a case-control design, 36 patients (19 men, 17 women) who underwent preoperative EUS were matched retrospectively with 36 patients who underwent surgical exploration immediately before the introduction of EUS. The number, cost, and effectiveness of preoperative localization studies, days of hospitalization, and surgical and anesthesia times were assessed.The EUS group had reduced charges for preoperative localization studies: $2620 versus $4846 per patient (p < 0.05), largely because of reductions in the number of diagnostic angiograms and venous sampling procedures performed. Surgical and total anesthesia times were decreased, as were the number of preoperative admissions for angiographic procedures. The cost-effectiveness ratio for the EUS group was $3144 per tumor localized compared with $5628 per tumor localized for the group treated before EUS became available (p < 0.05).EUS is highly accurate in the localization of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and is cost effective when used early in the preoperative localization strategy. EUS decreased the need for additional invasive tests and avoided unnecessary morbidity and resource consumption. EUS should play a primary role in preoperative localization of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
