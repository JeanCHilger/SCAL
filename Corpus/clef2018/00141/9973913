Accessory wandering spleen associated with short pancreas. A pediatric case report. We present an extremely rare case of a 5-year-old girl with short pancreas associated with three accessory spleens, one of which was a large wandering spleen. The diagnosis was established by US and CT. A large accessory wandering spleen is considered to be at risk of torsion and infarction as well as susceptible to abdominal trauma. The authors discuss the difficulty of establishing the diagnosis and underline the importance of US and CT as pre-operative diagnostic tools.
