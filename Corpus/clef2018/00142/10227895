MR virtual endoscopy of the pancreaticobiliary tract: a feasible technique? To evaluate the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) virtual endoscopy of the pancreaticobiliary tract by using MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) data sets as source images, we retrospectively reviewed MRCP data sets of 120 patients with Navigator software (GE/Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) that allowed display of inner views by surface rendering the internal wall of the bile ducts with simulated light and shadow.
