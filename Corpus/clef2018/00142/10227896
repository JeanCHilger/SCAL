Pancreaticobiliary carcinoma associated with a large choledochal cyst: role of MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography in diagnosis and preoperative assessment. The role of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR cholangiopancreatography is demonstrated in a case of pancreaticobiliary carcinoma associated with a large choledochal cyst. The size of the cyst presented considerable difficulty in evaluation with both endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography.
