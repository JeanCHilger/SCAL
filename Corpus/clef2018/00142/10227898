Malignant fibrous histiocytoma presenting as cystic pancreatic mass. Although malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a common sarcoma of late adulthood, it has rarely been reported to involve the pancreas. We describe the clinical and imaging features of a 27-year-old patient presenting with a predominantly cystic MFH. The cystic appearance of the lesion corresponded histologically to necrosis and hemorrhage within the mass.
