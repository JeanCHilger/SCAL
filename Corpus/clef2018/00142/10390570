Splenic lymphangioma: US and CT diagnosis and clinical manifestations. We tried to determine the role and problems of gray-scale sonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and color Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of splenic lymphangioma on the basis of our experience with seven adult cases with this relatively rare tumor.(1) The whole spleen was replaced by a collection of cysts of different sizes with or without calcifications in six patients. In these patients, color Doppler sonography showed the intrasplenic arteries and veins running along the cyst walls. (2) The enlarged spleen occupied the whole upper abdomen and contained numerous small cysts in one patient. The patient was initially diagnosed as having a pancreatic tumor because of the location, but color Doppler sonography clearly demonstrated two vessels (artery and vein) running parallel from the center of the mass. This characteristic vascular structure led to the determination that the mass was the markedly enlarged spleen. (3) The splenic lesion was isolated in six patients but was associated with mesenteric and pleural lymphangioma in one symptomatic patient.(1) When US shows multiple cysts of different sizes in the spleen, the diagnosis of splenic lymphangioma is not difficult to make with US and CT alone. (2) Color Doppler sonography is a very useful tool to increase diagnostic confidence because it demonstrates the vasculature of the mass. (3) When examining patients with splenic lymphangioma, one should consider the possibility of multiorgan involvement.
