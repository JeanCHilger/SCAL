Comparison of conventional and high resolution 2D RARE MRCP in diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary diseases. Evaluation of high-resolution 2D-RARE MRCP in the diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary diseases.23 patients with various pancreaticobiliary diseases were evaluated using conventional and high-resolution 2D-RARE sequences.High-resolution RARE MRCP allowed for improved delineation of biliary and pancreatic ducts at the expense of reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Pathological findings were significantly (p < 0.001) better demonstrated with high resolution RARE MRCP (score 1.65 +/- 0.54) as compared to the conventional RARE sequence (score 2.58 +/- 0.62).High-resolution 2D-RARE-MRCP improves the delineation of biliary and pancreatic ducts. This sequence should replace the conventional 2D-RARE sequence.
