Distal choledochal cyst in hydro-spiral CT. Bile duct cysts are rare abnormalities of the biliary tract. Surgical therapy has been recommended because of possible complications such as cholestasis with jaundice and the risk of bile duct carcinoma. Accurate preoperative radiological imaging is available for surgical planning. In addition to direct imaging of the biliary system in ERCP, high-resolution axial computerized imaging techniques are necessary. The use of MRCP is becoming more frequent in diagnostic imaging of the biliary tract. Similar to the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors with hydro-spiral CT technique, we demonstrate the benefits of hydro-CT in imaging of a distal choledochal cyst, the problems of differential diagnosis and the classification in the generally accepted Todani system in a case in which accurate clarification with MRCP and ERCP was not possible.
