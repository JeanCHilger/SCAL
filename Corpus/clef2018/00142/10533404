Magnetic resonance tomography of biliary and pancreatic ducts. Magnetic resonance imaging of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, MRCP, is a technique developed over the last few years. Using strongly T2-weighted sequences, images of the biliary and pancreatic ducts similar to ERCP can be obtained within one single inhalation. No contrast media or medication is required. In 23 patients 25 MRCP examinations were retrospectively compared with ERCP or PTC. One patient had normal findings three had gallbladder stones. Eight out of nine common bile-duct stones were shown. MRCP after papillotomy in one patient showed a common bile-duct stone
