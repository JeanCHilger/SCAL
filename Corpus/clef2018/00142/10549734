Staging laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography in more than 400 patients with upper gastrointestinal carcinoma. Resection offers the only chance of cure to patients with esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and hepatopancreatobiliary tumors. Staging is essential to select patients who will benefit from operation because palliation can also be performed nonoperatively. Several studies, including limited numbers of patients, have shown that laparoscopic staging prevents unnecessary laparotomies, but it is doubtful whether general application of this staging method can be advised. The aim of this study was to assess the benefit of diagnostic laparoscopy for staging patients with esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and hepatopancreatobiliary tumors.Between June 1992 and December 1996, 420 patients with a resectable tumor after conventional staging underwent diagnostic laparoscopy combined with laparoscopic ultrasonography. Histologic proof of metastases or ingrowth was used to cancel laparotomy.Laparoscopic staging avoided laparotomy in 20% of patients (sensitivity 0.70): 5% with an esophageal tumor, 20% with a gastroesophageal junction tumor, 15% with a periampullary tumor, 40% with a proximal bile duct tumor, 35% with a liver tumor, and 40% with a pancreatic body or tail tumor. Complications and port-site metastases were seen in 4% and 2% of patients, respectively.Laparoscopic staging is a safe procedure with low morbidity and without mortality in this series. It has shown no benefit in esophageal cancer, but seems beneficial for staging tumors located at the gastroesophageal junction, proximal bile duct tumors, liver tumors, and pancreatic body and tail tumors. The value of laparoscopic staging for patients with periampullary tumors is not as great as stated in previous studies and is still the subject of investigation.
