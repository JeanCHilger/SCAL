Spontaneous gas gangrene of the pancreas caused by Clostridium perfringens. The case of a 60-year-old patient with acute biliary pancreatitis spontaneously infected by Clostridium perfringens is reported. On CT scan, all the pancreatic bed was filled by gas. The patient survived. Four cases have previously been published. Three were fatal and 2 occurred after a pancreatic biopsy. Complete gas gangrene of the pancreas is a severity criterion and suggests an infection by Clostridium perfringens.
