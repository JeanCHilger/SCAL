Current role of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of common bile duct and pancreatic diseases. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a noninvasive procedure that is increasingly used in patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. The accuracy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography has dramatically improved during the last few years, and there is no doubt that magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography will have a major impact on the gastroenterologist's diagnostic work-up of patients. The key for success in dealing with hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases is the precise knowledge of their course, the indications for treatment, and the therapy available. Thus, a team approach with strong representation from gastroenterology and radiology will be the most optimal path to an improved understanding of the value of Magnetic Resonance technology.
