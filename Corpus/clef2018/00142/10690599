Gastric pseudotumor. The authors present a case report of a pseudotumor of the stomach and a brief discussion about this very unusual entity. A 75-year-old female patient was admitted with melena and a large epigastric tumor she underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, guided needle aspiration and angiography. Preoperative diagnostic hypothesis included a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the splenic artery, pancreatic cystic neoplasm with gastric invasion and pancreatic pseudocyst complicated with hemorrhage. Laparotomy revealed a gastric tumor and the patient was submitted to a radical subtotal Billroth II gastrectomy. Only the pathologic examination revealed the unexpected definitive diagnosis of an organized intramural gastric hematoma. There were no postoperative complications and she remains asymptomatic 10 months after surgery.
