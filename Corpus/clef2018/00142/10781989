Hydatid cyst of the pancreas. A rare case of hydatid cyst of the pancreas is reported. Although ultrasonography and computerised tomography scan confirmed the presence of a cystic mass in the body and tail of the pancreas, diagnosis was made only on laparotomy. A distal pancreatectomy was done and the diagnosis of hydatid cyst of the pancreas was confirmed by histopathology. Though very rare, pancreatic hydatidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of the pancreas in the appropriate epidemiological setting.
