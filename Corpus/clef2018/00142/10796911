Portal vein and its tributaries: evaluation with thin-section three-dimensional contrast-enhanced dynamic fat-suppressed MR imaging. To evaluate the visibility of the main portal vein (MPV) and its tributaries in healthy subjects at thin-section three-dimensional (3D) contrast material-enhanced dynamic fat-suppressed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether this technique provides useful information in the evaluation of patients with cirrhosis.Seventy-two patients (37 control subjects, 35 patients with cirrhosis) underwent imaging with a high-performance-gradient (25 mT/m) system.In the 37 subjects in the control group, the MPV was visualized in 37 splenic vein (SV), in 37Thin-section 3D contrast-enhanced dynamic fat-suppressed MR imaging can facilitate precise visualization of the MPV and its tributaries. Dilatation of the tributaries may be a nonspecific secondary finding that is suggestive of cirrhosis.
