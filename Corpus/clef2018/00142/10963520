Squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas with cystic degeneration. Most nonendocrine pancreatic neoplasms are adenocarcinomas of ductal cell or acinar origin. Primary carcinomas of the pancreas with squamous differentiation are rare enough to warrant a search for other primary tumors. In the past few decades, well-documented individual reports and large series reviews support the view that these squamous neoplasms are indeed of pancreatic origin and not uncommonly exhibit cystic degeneration. Late manifestation and unfavorable prognosis seem to be uniform features. We report a case with many of these features.
