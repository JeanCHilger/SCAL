Common bile duct and pancreatic injury after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for renal stone. Common bile duct and pancreatic injury are rare complications following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. We reported a case of peripancreatic abscess with inflammation change of common bile duct and pancreatic head following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for right renal stone. Its anatomical location and subsequent clinical course suggest it was related to trauma caused by the shock wave. It should be considered a relative contraindication to apply extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in cases of right renal stone associated with large gall stones.
