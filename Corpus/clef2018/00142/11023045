Metastatic gastrinoma to the liver 20 years after primary resection. Gastrinoma is a rare endocrine tumor that is frequently associated with liver metastasis. The liver metastasis is usually seen simultaneously or soon after a primary operation. A 47-year-old woman who had had a total gastrectomy 20 years earlier developed liver metastasis. An interval of this length between surgery and metastasis is extremely rare. The total gastrectomy prevented the patient from developing the usual symptoms of hypergastrinemia that would have enabled early diagnosis of the metastasis. Laboratory examinations on admission revealed a high serum gastrin concentration (1500 pg/ml). Computed tomography showed an irregularly enhanced mass lesion with an uneven, low-density central area in the right anterior inferior segment of the liver. An extended right hepatectomy was performed. Intraoperative ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in the remnant pancreas. Examination of the cut surface of the specimen revealed a yellow, firm, elastic tumor, 55 mm in diameter. The interior of the tumor appeared necrotic. Histopathologically, the tumor was composed of cells with hyperchromatic, dysplastic nuclei arranged in a trabecular pattern with nest formation. Gastrin staining was positive. A histologic diagnosis of metastatic gastrinoma was made. The patient's gastrin concentration returned to normal and she was well at 2-year follow-up.
