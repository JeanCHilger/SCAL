Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (NETP) are rare. We report our surgical experience of 11 patients with NETP. These included 5 patients with benign insulinomas. Raised serum insulin and C-peptide levels with hypoglycemia were always diagnostic. Ultrasonography, CT, visceral angiography, arterial stimulation and venous sampling, and intraoperative ultrasound localized the tumor in 0/5, 1/5, 3/4, 2/2, 3/3 cases, respectively. The 6 other malignant NETP (one gastrinoma, 2 carcinoids, 3 non-functioning) were managed by pancreatic resection (Whipple's operation = 3, distal pancreatectomy with total gastrectomy = 1, total pancreatectomy = 1, distal pancreatectomy with left nephrectomy and proximal gastrectomy = 1). Two patients died postoperatively. We had 5 major and 2 minor postoperative complications, with 2 deaths. During follow up from 1 to 7 years, one patient with malignant carcinoid tumor died at two and half years, of local recurrence. The other 8 patients are disease-free with good quality of life.
