Leiomyosarcoma of pancreas: imaging features. Leiomysosarcoma of the pancreas is rare. Radiological findings of four patients with this condition were reviewed. CT scan appearances were those of a predominantly homogenous, large, solid, enhancing mass with few areas of necrosis. A cystic appearance with thickened and nodular enhancing walls was seen in one case. A constellation of imaging findings including large size at presentation, greater vascular enhancement and absence of biliary dilatation should suggest leiomyosarcoma.
