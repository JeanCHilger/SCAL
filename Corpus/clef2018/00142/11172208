The imager replacing the pathologist in the diagnosis of hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease. Advances in imaging technology, specifically cross-sectional imaging techniques (ultrasonography, computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), are dynamic and rapid. They have dramatically changed the management of hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. Although imaging is not identical to the traditional gold standard of a tissue diagnosis, it often obviates its need and provides a much better insight into clinically relevant pathology compared with a biopsy. However, this requires a thorough insight into the clinical and pathologic aspects of the disease, knowledge of limitations of imaging techniques, and insight in management implications. The clear identification of characteristic disease findings on imaging, such as a cirrhotic configuration of the liver or gallstones that match clinical findings, are most helpful. Imaging and tissue investigation often have a complementary role in patient management. Their yield is highest if they are part of a critical integration of clinical findings by a multidisciplinary team. The latter should help as much in identifying specific opportunities for treatment as preventing futile and potential harmful interventions. The contribution of imagers and pathologists to the management of patients will continue to be redefined in the new century. Noninvasive and virtual imaging will develop further. A specific and challenging role for the pathologists and clinical imagers in close cooperation with many other disciplines will be to identify sensitive molecular targets that can be used to provide noninvasive images that not only accurately provide a diagnosis, but also resolution of disease and response to specific therapy.
