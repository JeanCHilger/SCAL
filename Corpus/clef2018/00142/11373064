A discrepant finding between magnetic resonance imaging and other imaging modalities suggests a microcystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is generally considered as having no malignant potential. Thus, of clinical importance is a differential diagnosis of this neoplasm from other solid tumors that are often malignant.We report a case of microcystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic ultrasonography showed a solid mass in the body of the pancreas with a diameter of 15 mm, but magnetic resonance imaging revealed it as a unilocular cystic lesion. Histological examinations on the surgically resected tissue specimen showed a honeycombed tumor with innumerable tiny cysts appearing grossly as a solid mass. The discrepant finding between magnetic resonance imaging and other imaging modalities observed in this case is suggestive of and might be specific to microcystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas.Magnetic resonance imaging is a mandatory modality to identify pancreatic serous cystadenoma that contains no visible cystic compartments on computed tomography and ultrasonography.
