Insulinoma with subsequent association of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. We report a patient with insulinoma associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A 67-year-old woman was first admitted to our hospital for an abdominal mass. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a large pancreatic tumor, which was then diagnosed as an unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. At the age of 71, she presented symptoms of hypoglycemia. Fasting blood glucose was 21 mg/dl and plasma immunoreactive insulin level was 846 microU/ ml. Plasma gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and somatostatin levels were all normal. At the age of 73, hypoglycemic attacks occurred more frequently and she was admitted to our hospital. Abdominal CT scan showed multiple liver metastases. Chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin was performed. Three months later, she had an emergency laparotomy because of a perforated duodenal ulcer. Plasma gastrin level was 1,960 pg/ml at that time. Gastric hypersecretion was well controlled with a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) but she died of widespread cancer dissemination 8 years after her first admission. On autopsy, histologic examination revealed a mixed acinar-endocrine carcinoma of the pancreas. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for insulin, gastrin, and alpha1-antitrypsin.
