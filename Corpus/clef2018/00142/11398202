Role of ultrasonography in the staging of gastrointestinal neoplasms. This article reviews the capabilities and limits of ultrasonography (US) in the staging of gastrointestinal neoplasms. US is a well-established tool in the investigation of abdominal diseases. Its role is very important in the first approach to liver, gallbladder, biliary, and pancreatic diseases, but its abilities for accurate staging may be limited by various factors, which will be discussed. In the evaluation of the stomach and intestine, US is rarely utilized, but it can occasionally demonstrate an unsuspected gastrointestinal mass that usually must be evaluated further with specific techniques (endoscopy and barium studies) to confirm the diagnosis and to perform an accurate staging (with endosonography and computed tomography).
