Post-splenectomy multiple pancreatic pseudocysts. A patient was admitted for breathlessness associated with post-splenectomy multiple pseudocysts and succumbed after internal drainage of the pseudocyst. Although the occurrence of pseudocyst following splenectomy is uncommon, failure to identify and treat this condition at an early stage could result in fatal consequences. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of pseudocyst occurring after splenectomy. The advent of interventional radiology has provided better treatment option for patients with solitary pancreatic pseudocysts with success rates similar to those with open surgery but with lower morbidity and mortality rates. However, its role in the management of multiple pseudocysts remains to be defined.
