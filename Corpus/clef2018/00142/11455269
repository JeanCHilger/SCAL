Extrapancreatic pseudoaneurysm after pancreas transplantation. Pseudoaneurysms after pancreatic transplantation are an infrequent event. Repair usually involves removal of the transplant. We describe a patient with a pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic transplantation. The pseudoaneurysm originated from the external iliac artery distal to the donor Y-graft anastomosis. Diagnosis was made by duplex ultrasound. Surgical repair was effected through a retroperitoneal incision enabling vascular control. The patient has done well postoperatively, and with 1-year follow-up, continues to have normal renal and pancreatic allograft function.
