Pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery after pancreas transplantation treated by endovascular stenting. Pseudoaneurysm after pancreas transplantation can have serious consequences, including rupture, hemorrhage, and graft loss. We describe a 38-year-old patient who presented with a pseudoaneurysm of the donor superior mesenteric artery 1 month after pancreas transplantation. Selective arteriography was performed and the lesion was repaired with endovascular placement of a 28-mm covered stent. Laparotomy was avoided. The pancreatic graft was continuing to function well 9 months later. As far as we know, this minimally invasive approach was not previously reported. According to published series, pseudoaneurysms often occur secondary to infection and require operative intervention necessitating graft pancreatectomy. Patients can present with serious symptoms including hypotension and shock. Therefore, it is important to detect pseudoaneurysm in a timely manner. Computed tomography and Doppler ultrasound are important diagnostic tools in this regard. We demonstrated the utility of endovascular stenting in the treatment of pseudoaneurysm after pancreas transplantation. When used in a timely manner in well selected patients, endovascular stenting can abrogate the need for operative intervention and its attendant morbidity.
