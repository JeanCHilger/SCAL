Huge cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 33-year-old woman who presented with palpable abdominal swelling found to be caused by a huge lymphangioma of the pancreas. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed a large multilocular cystic mass with water-dense contents, which was derived from the pancreatic head. A pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) was performed because the tumor had invaded the duodenum. The resected tumor, which was 23 x 12 x 23 cm in size with 21 of serous fluid, was pathologically diagnosed as a cystic lymphangioma. The endothelial cells lining the internal surface of the cystic spaces were immunohistochemically positive for factor VIII-R antigen and CD31. Our review of the literature revealed 45 reports of lymphangioma of the pancreas, including this one, but to the best of our knowledge this is only the fifth case that required a PD. Nevertheless, we recommend that a complete resection be performed to reduce the risk of recurrence.
