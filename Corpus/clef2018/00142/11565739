An obese man with anxiety, sweating, and headache. A 47-year-old man reported becoming confused, disoriented, and anxious while driving his car. He recalled sweating and having blurred vision, palpitations, and a diffuse headache shortly before pulling to the side of the road and losing consciousness. Emergency service personnel arrived about 15 minutes later and administered a 50% solution of dextrose intravenously. On regaining consciousness, the patient had no weakness,shortness of breath, chest pain, or loss of bowel or bladder function. He had experienced a similar episode one week earlier and several others in the distant past. Each time, symptoms had been alleviated by eating.
