Bile duct papillomatosis: unrecognized preoperative diagnosis. The diffuse biliary or pancreatic papillomatosis is a rare pathology. Reported cases in the literature underscore the difficulties of preoperative diagnosis of these lesions, their extensive nature, their tendency to relapse, and their malignant potential. The case that we report differs by the isolated involvement of the biliary tract and by the increasing role of imaging (MRCP) for diagnosis and follow-up.
