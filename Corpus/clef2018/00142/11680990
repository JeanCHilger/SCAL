Clinical efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of biliary tract diseases. This study was carried out to clarify the efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the diagnosis of biliary tract diseases, Three hundred and eleven patients who underwent MRCP and ERCP during the period from January 1999 to December 1999 at our institution were included in the study. Two gastroenterologists who were blinded to results of direct cholangiography and final diagnoses interpreted MRCP images prospectively. The biliary duct was visualized by MRCP and ERCP in 99.4% and 89.5% of the cases, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRCP in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis were 95%, 97%, and 97%, respectively. MRCP depicted the presence of strictures with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 97%, 96%, and 96%, respectively. There were three false-positive cases because of artifacts from arterial compression, The accuracy of MRCP and ERCP in differentiation of benign strictures from malignant ones was 85% and 96%, respectively. Based on these results, it is concluded that MRCP has high capability in visualization of the biliary tree, and in detection of stones and strictures, To avoid over and under-diagnosis, awareness of some pitfalls inherent in, MRCP is important. We suggest that MRCP should be recommended for patients with suspicion of biliary tract diseases in the initial stage of making diagnosis.
