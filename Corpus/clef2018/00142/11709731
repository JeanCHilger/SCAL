Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIMP) - a clinical entity of its own?. A 34-year-old man with chronic inflammation of both tear glands for 10 years was admitted because of severe upper abdominal pain and jaundice.Transaminase and cholestasis parameters were raised, as were gamma-globulins on electrophoresis. Ultrasound revealed an echo-poor diffusely enlarged pancreas with hypervascularity on colour-Doppler. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) indicated chronically changed pancreatic ducts of varying diameter and stenosis, as well as a filiform distal stenosis of the common bile duct. A pancreatic biopsy showed chronic sclerosing pancreatitis with broad periductal lymphocytic infiltration.ERCP and a guide-wire papillotomy were performed, followed by placement of a nasobiliary catheter. All findings markedly improved on oral prednisone.This case supports the supposition that in idiopathic chronic pancreatitis autoimmune processes may be responsible for the changes in the pancreatic ducts. Immunosuppressive treatment is thus recommended in these cases.
