Duodenal pancreatic heterotopy diagnosed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: report of a case. We describe herein the case of a heterotopic pancreas that caused stenosis in the second portion of the duodenum. A 46-year-old man presented with upper abdominal pain and a 12-month history of intermittent vomiting. There was no history of melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, clay-colored stools, jaundice, or hepatitis and he did not describe any food dyscrasias, although fatty foods and alcohol seemed to make the symptoms worse. No specific medication or change in position relieved the pain. An initial diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis with multiple pseudocysts was made on the basis of elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, and abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) findings. Medical treatment with octreotide was given for 8 weeks, but without any marked effect. Double-contrast barium examination and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were not diagnostic. Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography revealed findings indicative of cystic dystrophy of a heterotopic pancreas (CDHP), and an endoscopy supported this diagnosis. A pancreatoduodenectomy was performed and pathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of CDHP. In our opinion, MR cholangiopancreatography is the diagnostic tool of choice when CDHP is suspected.
