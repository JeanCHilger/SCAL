Judgement of gross type and local invasion of advanced gastric carcinoma by spiral computed tomography. To evaluate the value of spiral computed tomography(sCT) in the judgement of gross type, invasion to serosa and adjacent organs of advanced gastric carcinoma.The sCT results of 53 cases of advanced gastric carcinoma undergone gastrectomy were compared with surgical pathologic findings.The accuracy of judging gross type, location and size of gastric carcinoma was 92.5%, 88.7%, 81.1% respectively 80.5% of serosal invasion was correctly judged by extraluminal fat sign, while 63.4% by serosal contour sign (P < 0.05). Different serosal types could be differentiated by CT features. The accuracy of judging invasion to pancreas, spleen and transverse colon was 87.8%, 87.8%, and 90.2%Spiral computed tomography is of help in the identification of the gross type, invasion to serosa and adjacent organs of gastric cancer in its stage of progression.
