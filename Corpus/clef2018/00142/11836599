Adenosquamous cell carcinoma arising from the papilla major. A 47-year-old man was admitted to hospital with complaint of general fatigue. Shortly before the admission a suspected obstructive jaundice was diagnosed at a local hospital. On admission, the physical examination was significant for jaundice total bilirubin was 6.43 mg/dl. The tumor marker CA19-9 was 2056 U/ml. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed and showed dilatation of common bile duct and main pancreatic duct, accompanied with an endoscopic naso-biliary drainage (ENBD) in order to reduce the jaundice. The duodenoscopy showed enlarged and deformed papilla. Hypotonic duodenography showed a filling defect at the medial side of the second portion of the duodenum. Ultrasonography (US) showed a hyperechoic lesion, sized 15 mm in diameter, at the pancreas head with dilatation of biliary tract and main pancreatic duct. An abdominal enhanced CT scan showed a mass sized 15 mm at the lower edge of the common bile duct. A selective hepatic arteriography showed no special finding. We performed a pancreatoduodenectomy with dissection of the lymph nodes. The tumor, sized 22x15x20 mm, was white colored and solid on the papilla. Histopathological inspection of the specimen showed an adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the bile duct in the papilla. The tumor was found to infiltrate the neighboring pancreas and to contain metastasis in lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament, post pancreaticoduodenal and para-aortic lymph nodes. This is the first report on a case of adenosquamous carcinoma of the papilla major.
