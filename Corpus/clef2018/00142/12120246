Radiologic imagings of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. An increasing number of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas have been detected with the progress of radiologic modalities. These cystic tumors include solid pseudopapillary tumor, serous cystadenoma, mucinous cystic tumor, and intraductal papillary mucinous tumor. The latter two lesions have been reported under a clinical nick-name of 'mucin-hypersecreting' cystic tumor. In the diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, clinical findings such as age, sex and location of lesion were informative. US and CT were useful to check up the presence of cystic lesion of the pancreas. ERCP was useful to examine the cystic lesion but it has some limitations. ERCP did not visualize the cystic lesion when the lesion was filled with excessive mucin. MRI (T2-weighted image) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were powerful to display the entire cystic lesion. In the assessment of grade of malignancy, EUS was valuable to demonstrate the precise internal structures such as mural nodule. In this communication, radiologic diagnosis of cystic tumor of the pancreas was briefly reviewed focussing on 'mucin-hypersecreting' tumor of the pancreas.
