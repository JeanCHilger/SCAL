Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas is a rare benign tumour of the pancreas without malignant potential which usually appears in older women. Pain, weight loss, palpable mass and jaundice (if the tumour is localized in the head of the pancreas) are the main symptoms. Thanks to the modern imaging techniques (US, CT, FNB) the tumour is discovered and with rising frequency exactly preoperatively diagnosed. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. In risk patients without symptoms surgery is not necessary but patients have to be regularly followed-up. The authors present a 70-year old woman in whom, because of constant epigastric pain, a multicystic mass of the pancreatic body, 58 x 40 mm in diameter, was discovered and removed by distal pancreatectomy. The spleen could not be saved. Histologic examination showed a microcystic adenoma. Three years after surgery the patient is symptom-free with normal ultrasonographic findings.
