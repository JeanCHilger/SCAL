Evaluation of focal pancreatic masses: comparison of mangafodipir-enhanced MR imaging and contrast-enhanced helical CT. The detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors as well as the reliable staging of pancreatic cancer are important tasks for radiologic evaluation. Contrast-enhanced helical CT has been the standard modality for pancreatic imaging in many institutions, but MR imaging has gained a considerable role in the evaluation of patients with equivocal CT findings. Recently, the first organ-specific MR contrast agent targeted to the liver and pancreas, mangafodipir trisodium, has been registered in the European Union (EU) for use in MR imaging of the pancreas. This paper reviews technical considerations and characteristic imaging findings of mangafodipir-enhanced MR imaging in the assessment of focal pancreatic lesions. Contrast-enhanced MRI has proven to be very helpful in the detection of small tumors or the identification of tumor-simulating lesions in patients with equivocal CT findings. Mangafodopir may improve the staging of pancreatic cancer by increasing the sensitivity of MRI in the detection of liver metastases. This review summarizes the potential of contrast-enhanced MRI and the limitations compared with contrast-enhanced helical CT.
