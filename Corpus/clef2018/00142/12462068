How to use contrast material in multislice CT examinations. Since the introduction of multislice CT in the clinical field, the acquisition time for helical CT becomes very short. As a result, contrast material administration becomes more difficult but at the same time offers new opportunities. Scan protocol should be optimized depending on the organ. To reach the best contrast enhancement, several different approached have been proposed. In general, higher injection rate result in higher level of arterial enhancement suitable for CT angiography. Scan timing should be optimized using bolus triggering or test injection technique. Sufficient amount of contrast material should be used in parenchymal imaging including liver and pancreas. For venous imaging including portal vein, sufficient contrast medium is also required to obtain diagnostic 3D imaging. Multislice CT may be beneficial in CTAP and CTHA examinations. In chest CT examinations, the amount of contrast material relative to single slice helical CT can be reduced. The overall quantity, flow rate and type of contrast medium still need to be optimized in further studies.
