Clinical and biochemical profiles of young diabetics in North-Eastern India. We compared the clinical and biochemical profiles of young diabetics in North Eastern India.Seventy diabetics who were detected at less than 30 years of age were studied. Patients with ketoacidosis or ketonuria on insulin withdrawal were grouped as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients with history of chronic abdominal pain with or without exocrine pancreatic dysfunction who either on ultrasonography (USG) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticoduodenography (ERCP) revealed pancreatic calcification and/or ductal dilatation were grouped as fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD), those having BMI < 19 kg/m2 with history or stigmata of childhood malnutrition and who were ketosis resistant were taken to be protein deficient diabetes mellitus (PDDM)/malnutrition modulated diabetes mellitus (MMDM) and those who neither had ketonuria nor history of chronic abdominal pain, malabsorption or stigmata of malnutrition were grouped as NIDDM of young (NIDDY).Amongst the young diabetics studied FCPD constituted 32.9%, IDDM 28.6%, MMDM 21.4% and NIDDY 17.11%. USG abnormalities were observed in 21 of the 23 patients of FCPD. Seven out of these showed pancreatic head calcification on X-ray while 14 showed pancreatic duct dilatation and calcification or calculi on USG. In the two remaining patients, ERCP revealed tortuousity of main pancreatic duct and calcification which were not detected on USG. Majority of FCPD and MMDM patients revealed insulin resistance on insulin tolerance test (ITT). HDL was significantly lower in NIDDY, while VLDL and triglycerides were significantly higher in FCPD and MMDM as compared to controls. Microvascular complications of diabetes were seen in all these groups, with peripheral neuropathy being more common in FCPD (43.5%) and background diabetic retinopathy in NIDDY (41%).We conclude that FCPD and MMDM together form majority (54.29%) of young diabetics at our center and a sizeable proportion of them may have microvascular complications, even at the time of diagnosis.
