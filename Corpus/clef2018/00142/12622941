MRI and magnetic resonance angiography in evaluating simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation. To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three dimensional (3D) contrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the diagnosis of complications of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT), as confirmed by biopsy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).Five MR examinations of five patients were performed within 28 days to 2 years after surgery on GE 1.5T MR system. Imaging techniques included axial and sagittal chemical fat-suppressed T1-weighted image (T1WI) and T2-weighted image (T2WI), additional contrast axial or saggital chemical fat-suppressed T1WI were obtained after 3D contrast MRA for calculating the mean percentage of the parenchymal enhancement (MPPE) of the pancreas and kidney. 3D contrast MRA was performed with Smartprep technique. MRA data were analyzed with maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multi-planner reformat (MPR).In five cases of transplant pancreases, MRI found two normal pancreas grafts, one case of acute rejection, one case of chronic rejection with 70% fibrosis and one case of late pancreatitis. In five transplant kidneys, MRI detected four normal kidney grafts and one case of acute rejection with infarction. MPPE could distinguish infarction from other complications. 3D contrast MRA could display vascular complications of SPKT, such as stenosis or occlusion, aneurysm formation of transplanted vessels and narrowing at the site of anastomosis, as confirmed by DSA.With combined application of MRI and 3D contrast MRA, complications of SPKT can be clearly identified.
