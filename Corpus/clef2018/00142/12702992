Symptomatic adult annular pancreas. Annular pancreas is most often found in neonates and infants younger than 1 year of age. Annular pancreas in adults is rare and clinically identifiable when symptomatic. Upper gastrointestinal radiography and surgical confirmation were the most common methods for diagnosing annular pancreas in the 1950s to 1980s. However, the revolution in image modalities has enabled preoperative diagnosis in the last 20 years. Many surgical methods have also been developed, and the one used depends on the presentation and extent of the pancreas annulus. We report two cases of symptomatic adult annular pancreas at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan.
