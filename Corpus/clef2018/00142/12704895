Adenoma of Vater's ampulla: what is the value of endoscopic diagnosis and therapy?. The method of choice to detect tumors of the papilla of Vater is endoscopic diagnosis. However, no definite decision on the dignity can be made through the macroscopic appearance itself. Only the combination of various diagnostic methods (side view duodenoscopy with biopsy, endosonography, ERCP, IDUS) allows a reliable statement on the local growth of tumors and the dignity. If there are no signs for local infiltration, histological indications for a carcinoma or distant metastasis, the endoscopic resection in specialized centers is recommended.
