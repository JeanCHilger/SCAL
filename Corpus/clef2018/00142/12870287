Distal pancreatic resection with splenic preservation for metastasis of renal carcinoma diagnosed 24 years later from the nephrectomy. Renal cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor with a singular biological behaviour, presenting in some reported cases very late metastases. This report describes a case of solitary pancreatic metastasis from kidney carcinoma, operated on 24 years before, that appears exceptional because of the long disease-free period after nephrectomy and the unusual metastatic site. The 73-year-old woman concluded the follow-up several years before she presented aspecific abdominal pain and ultrasonographic examination and CT-scan revealed the presence of a mass in the pancreatic istmus. The mass was excised with splenic preservation and was diagnosed to be a pancreatic metastasis from clear cell renal carcinoma. We discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic features of this tumors. It appears important to obtain the diagnosis preoperatively, because good results may be obtained with surgery, justifying an aggressive surgical approach.
