Magnetic-resonance tomography in diagnosis of hepatopancreatoduodenal tumors. Results of magnetic-resonance tomography (MRT) in 112 patients with diseases of hepatopancreatoduodenal zone were analyzed, 24 of them had tumors of bile ducts and pancreas. New noninvasive diagnostic method--magnetic-resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCPG)--performed in addition to routine MRT was evaluated. The technique of MRCPG, analysis of results, manetic-resonance semiotics are presented. This method is compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. It is concluded that combination of consentional MRT with MRCPG increases possibilities in diagnosis of hepatopancreatoduodenal cancers, complicated by obstructive jaundice, as a rule.
