Results of computerized tomography after Whipple operation of chronic pancreatitis. 53 patients were controlled with CT after Whipple resection. The median age of the patients was 49 years, the median time after surgery nine years. Diagnostic criteria were the identification of the residual pancreas, signs of pancreatic atrophy and radiological signs of chronic pancreatitis. CT was performed with slice thickness of 4 mm and steps of 4 mm. The residual pancreas was visible in all 53 cases. Pancreatic atrophy was found in 26 cases, in four of these the residual pancreas was only 2 mm in size. Signs of chronic pancreatitis were found in 16 cases. By comparing preoperative and postoperative CT-scans, seven progresses of pancreatitis were detected. Signs of acute pancreatitis were not found in the 53 patients. Fatty liver degeneration was found in 7.5%. We found that CT is the most reliable technique to visualize the pancreas after Whipple resection. CT should be performed in all patients with clinical symptoms of an acute pancreatitis. CT should also be performed in patients with residual pancreas pseudocysts. There is no indication for CT in the routine examination of asymptomatic patients after Whipple resection.
