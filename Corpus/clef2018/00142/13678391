Arterial infusion chemotherapy for the patient of unresectable pancreatic carcinoma with multiple liver metastases: a case report. Despite various treatment trials for unresectable pancreatic carcinoma with liver metastases, the outcome has not been satisfactory. This paper reports a case of pancreatic carcinoma with multiple liver metastases that responded well to arterial infusion chemotherapy.A 65-year-old male was diagnosed with multiple liver tumors, and needle biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. With endoscopic ultrasonography, a tumor in the pancreatic head was detected, and pancreatic carcinoma with multiple liver metastases was diagnosed. He received arterial infusion chemotherapy: cisplatin at a dose of 10 mg/body/day and 500 mg/body/day of 5-fluorouracil After 14 days administration, liver metastases had decreased in number and size, but thereafter, because of hepatic arterial occlusion, the same dose of drugs was administered intravenously. The patient was discharged from the hospital and was given chemotherapy 3 days a week on an outpatient basis. Although the chemotherapy was effective, it was stopped because of severe general fatigue 5 months after discharge. His general status continued to gradually worsen, and he died 12 months after diagnosis.Prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma with liver metastases is poor however, transarterial infusion chemotherapy may be effective to improve the prognosis and quality of life of the patients.
