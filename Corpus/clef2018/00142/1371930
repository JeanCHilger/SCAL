Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. Pseudocysts of the pancreas are a rare cause of a mediastinal mass. They are clinically characterized by the combination of thoracic symptoms (shortness of breath, dysphagia, pleural effusions) with complaints in the upper abdominal quadrants and weight loss. The diagnosis is usually made by CT scan or MRI including upper abdominal views. Internal drainage via an abdominal route performed either as cystogastrostomy or cystojejunostomy is the treatment of choice.
