Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: a heterogeneous disorder. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare tumors with a relatively better prognosis as compared to other pancreatic cancers. They may be mistaken for pseudocysts. Seventeen patients who underwent surgical resection were analyzed. Seventy percent of the patients were females and 76.7% of the tumors were located in the tail of the pancreas. Preoperative diagnosis was made on the basis of ultrasonography and/or computed tomography findings in 60% of patients. Retrospective review of the imaging modalities revealed one or more findings suggestive of cystic neoplasms in 90% of the patients. These included multiloculated cysts, thickened cyst wall, intracystic mass or calcifications, and presence of liver metastasis. All the tumors were completely or partly excised. The final histopathological diagnosis was microcystic adenoma in 2, mucinous cyst adenoma in 1, papillary cystic neoplasm in 3, cystic neuroendocrine tumor in 5, and cystadenocarcinoma in 6. Of the 17 patients, 10 had malignant tumors. Seven patients with benign tumors and 3 patients with malignant tumors are disease free 12-30 months after resection. Cystic neoplasm must always be considered as a possibility when dealing with cystic lesions of the pancreas and a careful evaluation of ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan may give a clue to the diagnosis.
