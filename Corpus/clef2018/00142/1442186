Gastrinoma localized in the pylorus in a patient with recurrent peptic ulcer. We report a clinical case of a woman, 56 years old, with a history of duodenal ulcer and esophagitis, under medication with H2 receptors blockers during 3 years. Plasma basal gastrin was near normal levels. A stimulation test with secretin was compatible with gastrinoma. CT scan and selective angiography didn't localize the tumor. At laparotomy we found a pyloric nodule that prove to be the gastrinoma. Eighteen months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic and with a normal endoscopic examination and secretin stimulation test.
