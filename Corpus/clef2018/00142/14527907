Comparison of linear array endoscopic ultrasound and helical computed tomography for the staging of periampullary malignancies. The purpose of this study was to compare linear array endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and helical computed tomography (CT) scan in the preoperative local staging evaluation of patients with periampullary tumors.Patients evaluated with EUS and CT for suspected periampullary malignancies from 1996 to 2000 were analyzed. Surgical/pathology staging results were the reference standard.Forty-eight patients (28 men and 20 women mean age, 62 +/- 4.9 yearsLinear array EUS was consistently superior to helical CT in the preoperative local staging of periampullary malignancies.
