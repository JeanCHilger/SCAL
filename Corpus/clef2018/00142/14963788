A dermoid cyst in the greater omentum as a rare epigastric tumor. A 36-year-old female presented with unspecific epigastric discomfort, without weight loss, night sweat or fever. Ultrasound and computed tomography showed a solid tumor with a diameter of 9 cm in the left upper abdomen, without any connection to the stomach, the pancreas or spleen. Laparoscopy showed a connection to parts of the greater omentum. Two days after laparoscopic resection the patient was discharged from hospital. Histology revealed the rare diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. A possible malignant degeneration of the tumor has to be considered, and therefore the tumor should be resected. Since the operation the patient is asymptomatic and without tumor recurrence.
