Blunt injuries to liver, spleen, kidney and pancreas in pediatric patients. 96 children with blunt injuries to liver, spleen, pancreas and kidney were analysed. The aim of this review was to determine the accuracy of radiologic imaging and to define clinical factors present on admission which could be predictive of major injuries resolving only by operation. Two thirds of the lesions could be treated non-operatively. Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound examination (US) varies between 60 and 90%, depending on the type of the injured organ. Peritoneal lavage was progressively abandoned in favour of US. CT scan has a 100% accuracy in the determination of the type and the extension of the injury. Our review revealed 6 clinical factors present on admission with a statistically significant predictive value for surgical intervention.
