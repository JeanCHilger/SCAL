Lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas: case report and review of the literature. The aim of this report was to describe the clinical and pathologic features of lymphoepithelial cysts of the pancreas, establish the differential diagnosis of other pancreatic cysts, and review the literature. A 53-year-old man was incidentally diagnosed with a pancreatic lesion after an abdominal CT scan. This study showed a solid mass in the tail of the pancreas not enhanced by helical CT. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a low-density tissue mass on the surface of the pancreas, less echogenic than the surrounding parenchyma. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed with a suspected diagnosis of mucinous cystic tumor. The patient has had an uneventful postoperative period, and the pathologic finding was a lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas is an unusual and benign entity that must be taken into consideration when evaluating a cystic lesion of the pancreas because a different therapeutic approach may be required.
