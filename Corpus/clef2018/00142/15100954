Hemosuccus pancreaticus secondary to intraductal rupture of a primary splenic artery aneurysm: diagnosis by ERCP and successful management by interventional radiology. This report describes the case of a 65-year-old man with a prolonged history of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin. During a 2-year period, he underwent 28 endoscopic procedures, three angiographies with or without heparin provocation, a nuclear scan, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, none of which were diagnostic. A blind ileocecal resection was also carried out. A diagnosis of hemosuccus pancreaticus secondary to a ruptured primary splenic artery aneurysm was obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and successful interventional radiographic embolization of the splenic artery aneurysm was conducted. During a 17-month follow-up period, no relapse of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed.
