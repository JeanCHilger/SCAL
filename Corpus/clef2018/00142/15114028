Radial endoscopic ultrasound and spiral computed tomography in the diagnosis and staging of periampullary tumors. The early detection and accurate staging of pancreatic and ampullary cancer is of utmost importance for the achievement of surgical radical treatment. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in detection and staging of pancreatic and ampullary cancer, comparing its results to those obtained with spiral computed tomography (SCT).Sixty-one patients with suspected pancreatic and ampullary tumors were included, 46 (75, 4%) of whom presented with obstructive jaundice. Patients underwent EUS and SCT within a 7-day period. Examiners were unaware of the previous imaging results, except conventional echography. Image interpretation was compared to surgical and histopathological findings.Fifty-six (91, 8%) patients were surgically explored. Clinical follow-up and/or tissue diagnosis determined the correct diagnosis in the remaining five patients. Pancreatic cancer and ampullary cancer were observed in 29 (47, 6%) and 10 (16, 4%) patients, respectively. Chronic pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis were the most common diagnosis in patients with non-neoplastic disease. EUS was more effective than SCT for the definition of the final diagnosis in patients with obstructive jaundice (87.0 vs. 67.4%, p = 0.04). Both exams were equally effective for detecting pancreatic cancer but EUS predicted more accurately the involvement of portal-mesenteric axis by the tumor (87.0 vs. 67.4%, p = 0.04). EUS was particularly useful in the diagnosis of cancer of papilla of Vater.In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma without unequivocal signs of distant metastatic disease, EUS is more accurate than SCT to predict venous involvement by the tumor. EUS is superior to SCT to detect ampullary adenocarcinoma. Both methods are equally ineffective to detect nodal involvement in pancreatic and ampullary cancer.
