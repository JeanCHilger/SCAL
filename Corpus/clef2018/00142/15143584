On the improvement of surgical treatment of destructive pancreatitis. Results of treatment of destructive pancreatitis during the recent 20 years have been analyzed. Among 189 patients with this disease there were 54.5% of women and 45.5% of men aged from 20 to 80 years. The main principle of the surgical treatment was active ablation of all foci of destruction in the pancreas, abdominal cavity and retroperitoneal fat.

Combined use of the operations, flow lavage of bursa omentalis and retroperitoneum, complex therapy using intraarterial laserotherapy have allowed to reduce postoperative complications from 41 to 17% and mortality from 31 to 11.5%.
