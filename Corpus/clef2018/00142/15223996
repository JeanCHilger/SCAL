Should pancreas imaging be recommanded in patients over 50 years when diabetes is discovered because of acute symptoms? The relationship between diabetes mellitus and cancer of the pancreas is complex and incompletely understood. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that new-onset diabetes in a patient over 50 Years old is a classical indication of pancreatic cancer. But there is no official directive in France that a scan should routinely be performed in such cases. We have studied 115 patients aged over 50 who were hospitalized for new-onset diabetes (fewer than 30 days) whose instability required insulin treatment. Routine imaging revealed abdominal disorders in 14 patients, 6 (5.2%) of whom were suffering from pancreatic adenocarcinomas. No clinical indication or laboratory test, apart from an unusually severe anorexia, suggested the discovered disorders. We therefore routinely carry out a pancreas scan, preferably by MRI, on all patients over 50 Years old presenting with new-onset diabetes, even if there are not clinical or laboratory indications of cancer. This is the only way in which small pancreatic cancers can be detected, thus providing the best hopes for successful treatment. Unfortunately, too often, this approach also detects only tumors that are already well developed. However, nowadays, it is not conceivable for a clinical team to discharge a patient from hospital with such a serious disease undiagnosed.
