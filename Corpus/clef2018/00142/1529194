Role of current diagnostic procedures in gastroenterology: MRI. The diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in gastroenterology has not been definitely defined. In focal liver lesions MRI has a high sensitivity and aids in the differential diagnosis. In pathologies of the gall bladder and the pancreas, MRI currently has no clinical relevance. MRI diagnosis of pelvic fistulas and abscesses in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is both sensitive and specific. MRI is superior to CT in detecting and differentiating recurrent rectal cancer.
