Intraoperative ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing pancreatic duct injury and adjacent tissue damage in a patient with penetrating pancreas trauma. We report a case of pancreatic injury, caused by a stab wound, in which ductal injury and wound depth were clearly identified by intraoperative ultrasonography. A 65-year-old woman was emergently admitted to our hospital after stabbing herself in the abdomen in a suicide attempt. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and laboratory examination revealed liver and pancreatic injury with massive abdominal bleeding and free air. Operative findings included injuries of the stomach, small bowel, colon, liver, and pancreas. The pancreatic lacerations were 1 cm in length, in the body. Intraoperative ultrasonography enabled the diagnosis of a lacerated main pancreatic duct with no damage to the major vessels posterior to the pancreas.
