Pancreatic pseudopapillary tumor in a male child. Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are exceedingly rare in males. They are almost exclusively encountered in young females (mean age 26 years) and have a female predominance. It is most commonly detected incidentally, but may occasionally present with sudden pain or symptoms related to compression of adjacent organs.We report the case of a 12-year-old boy having a solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas presenting with a tender upper abdominal mass following a slight trauma. Radiological investigation showed the lesion to be a cystic mass arising from the body and the tail of the pancreas. The child underwent emergency distal pancreatectomy and has remained free of recurrence for 3 years.In the pediatric age group, solid-pseudopapillary tumors may present acutely with a tender abdominal mass following a slight trauma. Awareness of this fact will allow appropriate and prompt management to be undertaken.
