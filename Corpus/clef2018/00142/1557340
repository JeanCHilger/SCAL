A case of primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the pancreas. Non-Hodgkin pancreatic lymphoma is a rare disease. Its diagnosis is difficult without histological examination. Ultrasonographic, computed tomodensitometric, and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatographic findings are not pathognomonic. The better prognosis of these tumors, compared to adenocarcinoma, and their sensitivity to chemotherapy, implies the need for pathologic examination of every pancreatic tumor.
