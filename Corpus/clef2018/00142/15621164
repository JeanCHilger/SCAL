Toxoplasmosis after a simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation. We report the case of a simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant recipient who presented with vague neurologic symptoms 21 months following the surgery. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fundoscopy findings were normal. Serology titers for antitoxoplasmic antibodies were increased. This was an atypical presentation of toxoplasmosis in a simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant patient.
