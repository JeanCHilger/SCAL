Pancreas divisum and the dominant dorsal duct syndrome. Pancreas divisum, the most frequent congenital malformation of the pancreas, results from the absence of embryologic fusion of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts which keep an autonomy of drainage. The dorsal pancreatic duct is dominant and drains the major part of the pancreatic fluid through a non adapted accessory papilla. The high prevalence of pancreas divisum in patients presenting recurrent acute pancreatitis, the presence of obstructive pancreatitis electively located on the dorsal pancreatic duct and the results of the treatments targeted on the accessory papilla are the arguments pleading for the pathogenic character of the pancreas divisum. Currently, the diagnosis of pancreas divisum is based on magnetic resonance imaging. For symptomatic patients (after exclusion of patients with intestinal functional disorders), results of endoscopic sphincterotomy or surgical sphincteroplasty are favourable in 75% of patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis. They are worse in patients with chronic pain. Surgical sphincteroplasty must be discussed in the same manner as the endoscopic treatment for sometimes avoiding multiplication of the procedures.
