Solitary cardiac metastasis from a clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. A case report and review of the literature. A case of solitary septal metastasis from a clear cell carcinoma of the kidney is reported in a 55-year-old man who 5 years before had undergone right nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. Since then, he had been successfully treated by means of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or operated on, at almost yearly intervals, for secondary pancreatic, pulmonary and cerebral single metastases. Diagnosis was obtained by routine computed tomography. The septal mass was surgically removed and the patient was discharged on the 4th postoperative day.
