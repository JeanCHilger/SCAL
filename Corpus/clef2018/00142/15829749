Disseminated metastasis following periampullary cancer resection masquerading as uveitis. The Uveitis Masquerade Syndromes (UMS) are a group of ocular diseases that mimic intraocular inflammation, but are in fact neoplastic in nature. We report a patient with disseminated malignancy who presented with uveitis 5 years after an apparently successful resection of periampullary adenocarcinoma. The Masquerade Syndrome was detected by cytological examination of the vitreous.
