Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: radiological-pathological correlation. We report two cases to demonstrate the imaging features of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas (SPNP) in children. The SPNP is heterogeneous and often shows evidence of a pseudocapsule and haemorrhage, reflecting the pathology of this tumour. In an appropriate clinical context an accurate preoperative diagnosis can be made without the need for biopsy. This is important because tumour seeding may be more important in chemoresistant tumours such as SPNP than in the more common paediatric neoplasms.
