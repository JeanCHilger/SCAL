Bile duct schwannoma developed in the remnant choledochal cyst-a case associated with total agenesis of the dorsal pancreas. A 59-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital due to upper abdominal pain. At the age of 44, she was diagnosed with a congenital choledochal cyst, Todani's type Ic. She then underwent bypass operation with end-to-side choledochojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y technique as well as cholecystectomy. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed an 'oval' shaped cystic lesion with a maximal diameter of 25 mm, which had been 'spindle' shaped with a maximal diameter of 18 mm, 15 years ago. It also showed an anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union. In addition, a complete absence of the dorsal primordia of pancreas was revealed by magnetic resonance image and computed tomography scan. The patient underwent the surgical exploration for the resection of the 'oval' shaped cystic lesion. Haematoxylin and eosin staining of the thin section of the resected cyst showed a compact spindle cell pattern which was compatible with schwannoma, Antoni type A, which was confirmed by immunocytochemical technique. We present a very interesting case showing choledochal cyst, anomalous pancreaticobiliary ductal union, total agenesis of the dorsal pancreas and late-development of bile duct schwannoma in the remnant choledochal cyst.
