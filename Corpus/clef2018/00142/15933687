Pancreatic FNA in 1000 cases: a comparison of imaging modalities. Image-guided FNA is a popular method for evaluating pancreatic lesions, but few large studies on pancreatic FNA exist.Cytologic material, imaging reports, and clinical follow-up information were reviewed from pancreatic FNA cases performed over a 5-year period.A total of 1050 pancreatic FNAs were obtained by EUS (n = 843), US (n = 140), and CT (n = 67). On-site assessment was performed in 89.2% (n = 937) of cases. Findings were as follows: positive for neoplasm 48.9% (n = 503), negative 29.1% (n = 306), descriptive 10% (n = 105), suspicious 5.9% (n = 62), atypical/inconclusive 4.6% (n = 48), and nondiagnostic/inadequate 1.5% (n = 26). Follow-up in the form of histology or at least 6 months of clinical observation was available for 61.2% (n = 643). There was an overall false-positive rate of 0.3% and a false-negative rate of 14.3%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were as follows: 79.4, 99.0, 99.4, 67.9, 84.5 for the total series, respectively 79.9, 98.8, 99.2, 72.5, 86.5 for EUS, respectivelyAll imaging modalities showed moderate to high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Logistic regression analysis showed that for lesions <3 cm, the EUS method had higher accuracy than US or CT. No statistically significant difference was seen for larger lesions or for the number of FNA passes.
