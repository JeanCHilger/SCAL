MR imaging of the pancreas. MR imaging is a valuable tool in the assessment of the full spectrum of pancreatic diseases. MR imaging techniques are sensitive for the evaluation of pancreatic disorders in the following settings: (1) TI-weighted fat-suppressed and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced SGE imaging for the detection of chronic pancreatitis, ductal adeno-carcinoma, and islet-cell tumors (2) T2-weighted fat-suppressed imaging and T2-weighted breath-hold imaging for the detection of islet-cell tumors
