Exceptional ultra-late recurrence of papilla Vater carcinoma after pancreaticoduodenectomy: two cases at 17 and 25 years. Curative resection does not always equate with long-term survival. Cancer of the papilla Vater can remain clinically quiescent for decades prior to regional or distant recurrence. Nevertheless, late and ultra-late recurrence (respectively 10 and 15 years after initial treatment) are exceptional events. This protracted disease-free interval challenges the concept of a "cure" for cancer of the papilla Vater. In the first case reported here, a 74-year-old female underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in 1985 for cancer of the papilla Vater revealed histologically as a well-differentiated papillotubular adenocarcinoma, stage IA (UICC classification). Multiple hepatic recurrences were found 17 years after the operation hepatic biopsy showed histologically well to moderately differentiated papillotubular adenocarcinoma. She died about 17.5 years after the original operation. The second case is that of an 82-year-old female who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in 1974 for cancer of the papilla Vater, histologically a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, stage IA. In the 25.5 years after the operation, the cancer recurred at the choledochoduodenal anastomosis and involved the liver hilus. Autopsy showed histologically well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma at the locations indicated, together with lung and lymph node metastases. The ultra-late recurrences (>15 years) in these cases are highly exceptional and, to our knowledge, this is the first report of such recurrences in cancer of the papilla Vater. It can occur in any patient, with or without identifiable risk factors. Because cancer of the papilla Vater can recur in many prognostically favorable cases after prolonged disease-free intervals, the possibility of delayed recurrence should not be ignored.
