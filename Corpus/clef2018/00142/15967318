Multiphasic CT and MRI appearances of extramedullary multiple myeloma involving the stomach, pancreas, and bladder. Multiple myeloma is a hematological malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of clonal plasma cells. Skeletal involvement is one of its hallmarks, while extraosseous involvement is comparatively uncommon. There have been no previous reports of the imaging findings of multiple myeloma involving the stomach, pancreas, and bladder in the same patient. The stomach and pancreatic lesions were demonstrated as hypervascular nodules on computed tomography (CT), more conspicuous on arterial phase images. Early phase post-contrast imaging might improve the detection of extraosseous myeloma.
