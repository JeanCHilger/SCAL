Primary T-cell lymphoma of the pancreas in children. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is frequently reported among the extranodal sites of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but primary lymphoma of the pancreas is very rare. We report the case of a 11-year-old boy explored for epigastric pain with fever leading to the diagnosis of high-grade primary non Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma, originating from pancreas. This pancreatic lesion is documented by sonography, CT and MRI. This patient died quickly with sever infection.
