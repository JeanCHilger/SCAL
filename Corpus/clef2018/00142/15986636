Endoscopic treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Progress in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of pancreatitis has not yet opened significant new therapeutic options. Apart from dietetic and analgesic concepts, interventional endoscopy and pancreatic surgery are the mainstays of therapy. The often complex pathological anatomy requires the complete armamentarium of interventional endoscopy including endoscopic ultrasound. Stenoses, fistulae, pseudocysts and retroperitoneal necroses can be treated endoscopically. Failures of endoscopic treatment, relapses and inflammatory tumors of the pancreatic head as well as suspected malignancy should be operated. Endoscopic as well as surgical procedures are demanding and should be carried out by experienced teams with a sufficient case volume.
