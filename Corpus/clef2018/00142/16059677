MR-guided biopsies of lesions in the retroperitoneal space: technique and results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and precision of MRI-guided biopsies of retroperitoneal space-occupying tumors in an open low-field system. In 30 patients with indistinct retroperitoneal tumors [paraaortic lesion (n=20), kidney (n=2), suprarenal gland (n=3) and pancreas (n=5)] MR-guided biopsies were performed using a low-field system (0.2 T, Magnetom Concerto, Siemens, Germany). For the monitoring of the biopsies T1-weighted FLASH sequences (TR/TE=160/5 ms 90 degrees ) were used in all patients and modified FLASH sequences (TR/TE=160/13 ms
