Optimization of Gd-DTPA-enhanced balanced turbo field echo sequence in abdominal imaging: clinical application. We performed MRI examinations of patients in order to confirm the enhancement effect of the balanced turbo field echo (bTFE) sequence with centric view ordering and SPIR (SPIR-centric-bTFE) as mentioned in the prior paper, and to evaluate the actual image quality of this sequence.The upper abdomens of 30 patients with various abdominal disorders were examined with the SPIR-centric-bTFE sequence before and after Gd-DTPA administration. To assess the enhancement effect of Gd-DTPA, ROI measurements were taken in the aorta, superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, liver and bile juice in the common bile duct in each patient both in pre- and postcontrast images. Visual evaluations were also carried out in order to depict the peripheral vessels in the peritoneal fat and the apparent brightness of the soft-tissue organs.In all patients, the signal of the arteries after Gd-DTPA administration increased by about 50% compared with precontrast images. On the other hand, the veins and the liver showed a signal gain of less than 20% in postcontrast images. Consequently, only the signal of the arteries appeared enhanced in the postcontrast images. The visual evaluation revealed that postcontrast SPIR-centric-bTFE acquisition can depict the thin vessels clearly and the abdominal soft-tissue organs brightly.The balanced turbo field echo sequence with centric view ordering and SPIR after Gd-DTPA injection was considered the most appropriate protocol when this sequence was employed for abdominal imaging.
