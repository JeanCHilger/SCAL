Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas: MR imaging and pathologic correlation. Correlation of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings and those at pathologic evaluation was attempted in six cases of solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas. All patients were female, and the mean patient age was 26 years (range, 13-73 years). On T1-weighted spin-echo images, tumors were well demarcated, and areas of high signal intensity were evident within them. At macroscopic examination, these areas corresponded to solid portions with marked hemorrhagic necrosis or cystic portions filled with hemorrhagic debris. In three of four masses surrounded by macroscopically evident fibrous capsules, a rim of low intensity was revealed at T1-weighted imaging. When T1-weighted spin-echo imaging reveals obvious areas of high intensity within a sharply marginated tumor of the pancreas, especially in a young woman, solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm might be a primary diagnostic consideration.
