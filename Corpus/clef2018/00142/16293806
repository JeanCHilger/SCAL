Evaluation of bowel distention and bowel wall appearance by using neutral oral contrast agent for multi-detector row CT. To prospectively evaluate the performance of an orally administered 0.1% barium suspension, Volumen, as a bowel-marking agent for multi-detector row computed tomography (CT).This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and conformed to the institutional standards for research funded by a commercial sponsor. A total of 60 patients (33 women, 27 men average age, 58.2 years) who were referred for multi-detector row CT of the pancreas were randomized into two groups. Prior to examination, group 1 consumed 1200 mL of Volumen over a 30-minute period and group 2 consumed 1200 mL of a solution containing three parts water and one part methylcellulose over a 30-minute period. Results were independently reviewed by two radiologists who were unaware of the contrast agent used. The degree of distention and the visualization of mural detail were qualitatively scored on a five-point scale. Differences were evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney test at a confidence level of 95%.There was significantly better distention in the stomach (P = .013), duodenum (P = .006), jejunum (P = .029), and ileum (P = .014) [corrected] in group 1 compared with group 2. Significant distention was also evident by comparing the products of the widest cross-sectional diameters in duodenum (P = .143), jejunum (P < .001), and ileum (P < .001). Group 1 also demonstrated significantly better visualization of mural features in the duodenum (P = .003), jejunum (P = .024), and ileum (P = .01) and a trend toward better visualization of mural features in the stomach (P = .092).Oral administration of Volumen provided excellent distention and excellent visualization of mural features in the gastrointestinal tract.
