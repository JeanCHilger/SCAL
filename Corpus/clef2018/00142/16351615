Multiple pancreatic metastases from clear cell renal carcinoma: diagnosis with chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging before surgery. We present a case in which multiple pancreatic tumours were diagnosed as metastatic clear cell renal carcinomas with chemical shift MRI (CSI) before surgery. Radiologists may be unable to recognize the loss of intensity on CSI macroscopically. We believe that it is useful to make subtraction images and calculate signal intensity on CSI, even if the lesions are multiple metastatic tumours.
