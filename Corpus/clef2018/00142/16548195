Comparison of multi-slice spiral CT and magnetic resonance imaging in evaluation of the un-resectability of blood vessels in pancreatic tumor. To compare the values of multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating the un-resectability of blood vessels in pancreatic tumor.Images obtained from MSCT and MRI of pancreas in 14 patients with pancreatic cancer were retrospectively reviewed. MSCT scanning included arterial phase, pancreatic-portal phase, and delay-phase. MRI scanning included fat-suppressed T2WI, dual-echo T1WI, and fat-suppressed T1WI before and after injection of contrast (arterial phase, pancreatic-portal phase, delay-phase, and late delay phase). Seven patients received operations within two weeks after the examinations. The staging of peripancreatic blood vessels in MSCT and MRI images was evaluated and compared. The veracity of MSCT and MRI in assessing the un-resectability of peripancreatic blood vessels was calculated and compared according to the findings in operation.All the tumors were observed in MSCT and MRI images. Statistical difference existed in staging of peripancreatic blood vessels and in evaluating their un-resectability between MSCT and MR (P < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the un-resectability assessed by MSCT were 77.8%, 95%, 91.8%, 77.8%, and 95%, respectively, and those assessed by MR were 66.7%, 90%, 85.7%, 60%, and 92.3%, respectively.Dynamic MSCT is better than dynamic MR to some extent in evaluating the un-resectability of peripancreatic blood vessels in pancreatic tumor.
