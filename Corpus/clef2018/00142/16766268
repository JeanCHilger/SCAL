Application of a single needle type for all image-guided biopsies: results of 100 consecutive core biopsies in various organs using a novel tri-axial, end-cut needle. To assess feasibility, results and complications in image-guided biopsies using a single needle design in various organs.100 consecutive percutaneous biopsies were performed in 54 females and 46 males aged 24-87 years (mean age/standard deviation: 64.5 +/- 12 years) using a full-core end-cut tri-axial full-automatic biopsy needle (18 gauge BioPince, InterV-MDTech, Gainesville, Florida) under CT (n = 45) or ultrasound (n = 55) guidance. In 63 biopsies a coaxial technique was used.Biopsies were obtained of liver (n = 32), lymph nodes (n = 17), thyroid (n = 11), lung (n = 9), adrenal (n = 9), pelvis (n = 6), chest wall/pleura (n = 6), mediastinum (n = 4), lytic bone lesions (n = 2), retroperitoneum (n = 1), muscle (n = 1), pancreas (n = 1), peritoneum (n = 1). Between 1 and 6 (mean/SD 2.83 +/- 0.92) needle passes were performed. In 77 cases a malignant (40 metastases, 37 primary tumours) and in 23 a benign lesion was diagnosed. Of the 23 benign lesions a specific diagnosis was possible in 22. In one case necrosis and haemorrhage was diagnosed. In this patient surgery and autopsy both revealed a mediastinal haematoma of unknown origin. Eight minor complications (mild pain/local haematoma requiring no therapy) and three major complications (three pneumothoraces in nine lung biopsies requiring two aspirations and one drainage) were observed. There was no mortality.Percutaneous image-guided biopsy using the described full-core end-cut needle resulted in a specific diagnosis in 99/100 consecutive biopsies in various organs with a low complication rate. We use this needle type for all CT- or US-guided biopsies in all organs except for solid bone.
