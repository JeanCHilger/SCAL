Evaluation of the Manchester classification system for chronic pancreatitis. Classifications of chronic pancreatitis based on either histologic (Marseilles) or endoscopic (Cambridge) criteria are not widely used.The present study describes the development and validation of a three-stage clinical categorical classification system for chronic pancreatitis.Patients with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (577.1: ICD-9) for 1993 were identified from records of the Hepatopancreaticobiliary service at a University hospital. Endoscopic or CT evidence of chronic pancreatitis were mandatory for inclusion.Forty one patients met the criteria and were categorized according to a 3-stage system as mild, moderate or end-stage disease.The clinical course over the subsequent decade was followed by chart review with re-categorization of stage at each review.At the outset of the study, 18 (44%) patients were categorised as having mild disease, 19 (46%) as moderate and 4 (10%) as end-stage. The number of patients with mild disease fell over the subsequent 5 years and at the end of the 10-year chart study period, no patients were categorised as mild. The number of patients with diabetes at the outset of the study period was 2 (5%). At two years this was 3 (7%), five years 10 (24%) and 10 years was 25 (61%).These results show that the Manchester classification of chronic pancreatitis is both practical and feasible and now requires prospective evaluation and independent appraisal by other centres.
