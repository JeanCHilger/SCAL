Successfully operated ruptured gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. Visceral real and pseudoaneurysms are the rarest aneurysms of the arterial system. The aneurysms of the duodeno-pancreatic arcade constitute only 2-3% of all aneurysms. Their frequency after pancreatitis can reach 10%.On the basis of an individual case the authors summarize their experiences with this rare, but varied disease, and they review the literature data.Their female patient of 62 with alcoholic antecedent was hospitalized with haematemesis, melaena, anaemia, icterus repeated several times, while abdominal CT scan verified the pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery. The night before the elective operation a hypovolaemic shock arose with strong abdominal pain. Subsequent to the treatment of shock the authors performed the gastroduodenal artery ligation and Kehr-drainage. After an uneventful postoperative care she was discharged.Splanchnic aneurysms are rare, they are difficult to diagnose. Their importance lies in the fact that the risk of their rupture is 50% with a high mortality rate. Considering the patient's antecedent and concomitant diseases (alcoholism and pancreatitis) their occurrence shall be considered as a risk factor, so that the diagnosis could be established as soon as possible.
