Application of multidetector-row CT for pancreas imaging. Recent development of multidetector-row CT (MDCT) has improved the z-axis resolution of spiral CT and provided the isotropic imaging capability, which enables various postprocessing technique without degradating the quality of image compared to transverse images. In this review, protocols for the examination of pancreas, various postprocessing techniques for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease and the special application of MDCT for specific disease of pancreas including pancreatic carcinoma will be discussed.
