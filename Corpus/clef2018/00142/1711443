Current concepts in the management of pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is often a mild, self-limiting illness that responds to simple supportive therapy in the form of intravenous fluids and analgesics. More severe attacks may result in organ failure or pancreatic necrosis. Such patients should be identified early in the course of an attack and actively monitored within an intensive care unit or high dependency area. Supportive therapy remains the basis of management. Attention to the adequacy of the fluid balance and oxygenation are of prime importance and supportive therapy may include inotropic support, assisted ventilation and renal dialysis. Pancreatic necrosis should be sought by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning, and surgical intervention may be required if the patient's clinical condition continues to deteriorate. Surgery should ideally be delayed until the second or subsequent week when necrosectomy (debridement of necrotic pancreatic tissue) may be possible rather than formal pancreatic resection. The role of various drugs to suppress pancreatic secretion and inhibit pancreatic enzymes, although shown to be consistently effective in experimental pancreatitis, has not been established by controlled clinical trials in humans. Recent controlled studies examining peritoneal lavage in humans have failed to confirm the beneficial results suggested in earlier studies. Early endoscopic sphincterotomy for patients with severe gallstone pancreatitis and ductal calculi has been reported to reduce mortality and morbidity in one controlled clinical trial and may prove to be an important advance.
