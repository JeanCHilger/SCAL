Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are neoplasms of the pancreatic duct epithelium characterized by intraductal papillary growth and thick mucin secretion. Quantities of mucin fill the main and/or branches of pancreatic ducts and cause ductal dilatation. This review encompasses IPMNs, including symptoms, diagnosis, management, and prognosis.A Pubmed database search was performed. All abstracts were reviewed and all articles in which cases of IPMNs could be identified were further scrutinized. Further references were extracted by cross-referencing.Only one-third of all patients are symptomatic. According to the site of involvement, IPMNs are classified into three types: main duct type, branch duct type, and combined type. Most branch type IPMNs are benign, while the other two types are frequently malignant. The presence of large mural nodules increases the possibility of malignancy in all types. Presence of a large branch type IPMN and marked dilatation of the main duct indicate the existence of adenoma at least. Synchronous or metachronous malignancies may be developed in various organs. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, and intraductal ultrasonography clearly demonstrate ductal dilatation and mural nodules, while magnetic resonance pancreatography best visualizes the entire outline of IPMNs.Prognosis is excellent after complete resection of benign and non-invasive malignant IPMNs. The extent of pancreatic resection and the intraoperative management of resection margins remain controversial. Total pancreatectomy should be reserved for patients with resectable but extensive IPMNs involving the whole pancreas its benefits, however, must be balanced against operative and postoperative risks. Regular monitoring for disease recurrence is important after surgery.
