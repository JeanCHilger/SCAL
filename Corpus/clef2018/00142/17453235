Solid type clear cell carcinoma of the pancreas: differential diagnosis of an unusual case and review of the literature. Pancreatic neoplasms have been reliably classified on the basis of their histopathology and immunophenotype. In this study, we report on a pancreatic tumor whose phenotype and genotype could not be assigned to any known tumor entity. The tumor was observed in the pancreatic head of a 54-year-old woman. It was found to be a solid infiltrating carcinoma with abundant clear cells. Apart from cytokeratin, the tumor cells expressed vimentin, S100, and MUC-1. DNA microarray analysis revealed a transcription profile clearly differing from that of normal pancreatic tissue and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Despite metastatic behavior, the tumor displayed a more favorable course than conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We suggest that this tumor be called solid type clear cell carcinoma of the pancreas.
