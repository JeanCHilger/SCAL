pERCePtions on ERCP utilization in the United States. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), once a popular modality for diagnosing biliary tract and pancreatic disease, has passed its peak utilization. In the current issue of AJG, Jamal and colleagues summarize the trends in ERCP utilization in the United States from 1988 to 2002. While ERCP utilization had increased among certain ethnic groups, its overall use has dropped considerably since 1996. In particular, they report that the use of ERCP as a diagnostic tool and in the outpatient setting has declined. The introduction of less invasive pancreaticobiliary imaging tools, namely, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), is likely responsible for this trend. However, ERCP is still used widely and appropriately in the therapy of pancreaticobiliary disorders. The complementary nature of alternative diagnostic tools such as EUS suggests that ERCP use will continue at its current rate, rather than fall out of favor.
