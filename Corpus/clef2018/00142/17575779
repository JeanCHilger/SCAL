Laparoscopic removal of a pancreatic foreign body. We present a case report of a laparoscopically retrieved foreign body that migrated into the pancreas. The patient is a 44-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and was subsequently found by computed tomographic scan to have a foreign body in the head of the pancreas. After attempted endoscopic retrieval, we successfully removed the foreign body laparoscopically, thus avoiding laparotomy. Laparoscopy is an effective tool for pancreatic exploration.
