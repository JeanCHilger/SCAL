Small pancreatic lipoma: case report and literature review. Pancreatic lipomas are very rare and only 19 cases have so far been reported. We present a case of small asymptomatic pancreatic lipoma found incidentally in a 45-year-old man with findings of ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, including fat-suppressed proton-density-weight imaging. We also provide a brief review of the literature.
