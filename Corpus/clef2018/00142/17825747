Pancreatitis in initially occult gastric heterotopic pancreas. Heterotopic pancreas is an uncommon but important entity in the differential diagnosis of a gastric mass, as it has management and prognostic implications distinct from other gastric tumors. We present a case of heterotopic pancreas in the stomach, which was initially endoscopically occult but developed superimposed pancreatitis leading to its clinical presentation and detection as an apparently new gastric neoplasm.
