Xanthogranulomatous pancreatic abscess secondary to acute pancreatitis: two case reports. Xanthogranuloma is a rare type of inflammation and very few cases have been reported in the pancreas. We report two cases with xanthogranulomatous pancreatic abscess that followed acute pancreatitis. In both cases, multiple pseudocysts in the pancreatic tail were infected with several species of bacteria and Candida albicans. In one case, abdominal angiography revealed a hypoperfused pancreatic tail due to prior atherosclerotic obliteration of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. In the other case, the splenic artery was completely occluded by a transarterial embolization performed to treat an aneurysm that appeared in the course of pancreatitis. In both cases, distal pancreatectomy was performed as inflammation of the pancreatic tail was resistant to conventional antibiotic therapy, and pathologic examination revealed xanthogranulomatous inflammation around the pancreatic tail and spleen. Although the underlying pathogenesis is unclear, the prolonged infection and/or relative hypoxia induced by hypoperfusion are likely causative factors for the xanthogranulomatous changes in these pancreatic abscesses.
