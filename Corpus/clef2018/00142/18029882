Comparison of contrast-enhanced sonography and MRI in displaying anatomic features of cystic pancreatic masses. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy rates of unenhanced sonography, contrast-enhanced sonography, and MRI in displaying the anatomic features of cystic pancreatic masses larger than 1.5 mm in diameter.Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced sonographic and MRI examinations of 33 patients who underwent resection of a cystic pancreatic mass were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists blinded to the final histologic diagnosis reviewed the images, specifically assessing the presence of intralesional mural nodules and septa. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were calculated on the basis of correlation with surgical findings. Results of unenhanced sonography, contrast-enhanced sonography, and MRI were compared by McNemar test. Correlation of unenhanced and contrast-enhanced sonographic versus pathologic results was established with Spearman's test. Interobserver variability was determined.Contrast-enhanced sonography correctly depicted intralesional septa in 14 of 15 lesions (sensitivity, 93.3% specificity, 88.8%Contrast-enhanced sonography compares favorably with MRI in displaying the anatomic features of cystic pancreatic masses seen on transabdominal sonography.
