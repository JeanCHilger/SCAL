Ectopic papilla of vater in the stomach, blind antrum with aberrant pyloric opening, and congenital gastric diverticula: an unreported association. We present an extremely rare combined congenital anomaly consisting of ectopic drainage of the common bile duct in the lesser curvature of the stomach, congenital gastric diverticula, blind antrum with aberrant pyloric opening, and redundant spleen. The diagnosis was made during routine endoscopy in a 35-year-old woman, who presented complaining for regurgitation and retrosternal burning in the last 4 years. To our knowledge this is the first description of this rare combination of congenital anomalies. The possible embryogenetic backgrounds, and the possible clinical significance of this rare condition are discussed.
