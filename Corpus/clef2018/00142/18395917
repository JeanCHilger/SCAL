Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided trucut biopsy for the preoperative diagnosis of peripancreatic Castleman's disease: a case report. Castleman's disease (CD) of the pancreas/peripancreas is extremely rare. The recently introduced, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided trucut biopsy (TCB) is a useful diagnostic modality for obtaining tissue samples from peripancreatic lesions. However, its role in diagnosing CD remains unknown. We report a case of localized, peripancreatic, hyaline-vascular CD biopsied using EUS. The pathology results were initially interpreted as an extranodal, marginal-zone B-cell lymphoma. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study for the IgH gene rearrangement revealed a polyclonal pattern. We also reviewed the relevant literature. To our knowledge, this is the first illustrated report on EUS-TCB findings of CD with its pathology results of EUS-TCB mimicked a B-cell lymphoma.
