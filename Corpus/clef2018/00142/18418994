Dual-phase computed tomographic angiography in three dogs with pancreatic insulinoma. This article describes the findings in three dogs with histopathologically confirmed pancreatic insulinoma using dual-phase computed tomographic angiography (CTA). In all three dogs, dual-phase CTA findings identified lesions not seen on ultrasonography, including the actual identification of the primary pancreatic neoplasm in two dogs. CTA findings were in agreement with the surgical and histopathological findings. In two dogs, the insulinomas were found to have a strong enhancement during the arterial phase of the study but not at the other phases, which stresses the importance of dual-phase computed tomography for the diagnosis of this type of pancreatic neoplasia, in agreement with current knowledge in humans.
