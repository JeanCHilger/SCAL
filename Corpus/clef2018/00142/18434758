A new invasion score for determining the resectability of pancreatic carcinomas with contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography. It was the aim of this study to evaluate a new infiltration score to determine the resectability of pancreatic carcinomas in preoperative planning.Eighty patients with suspected pancreatic tumor were examined prospectively using 16-row spiral CT. The scans were evaluated for the presence of pancreatic carcinoma, peripancreatic tumor extension and vascular invasion using a standardized questionnaire. Invasion of the surgically relevant vessels was evaluated using a new invasion score. The operative and histological findings and the clinical follow-up served as the gold standard.Forty patients had a pancreatic carcinoma, 5 had metastasis of a different primary tumor, and in 35 patients, there was no malignant pancreatic disease. The sensitivity for tumor detection was 100%, with a specificity of 88% for differentiating between malignant and benign pancreatic tumors. Invasion of the surrounding vessels was evaluated correctly using the invasion score, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 99%. In evaluation of resectability, a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 89% were achieved.Using 16-row spiral CT, the invasion score is a valid tool for correctly assessing invasion in relevant vessels in cases of pancreatic carcinoma and for determining resectability.
