Case of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. We recently experienced a case of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas, which is a rare benign pancreatic cystic tumor. A 59-year-old-man was pointed out as having a pancreatic tumor based on abdominal ultrasonography findings obtained during a medical check-up. Thereafter, abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI studies revealed the presence of a multi-cystic tumor in the pancreas body to tail measuring 45 mm in size which had no infiltrating tendency. The operative findings showed a yellowish-white colored cystic tumor covered with a thin capsule, which could be easily extirpated from the pancreas. The dissected tumor, which contained a curd-like material and a condensed milky liquid, was diagnosed to be a lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas based on the pathological findings. Similar reports of lymphoepithelial cysts arising in the pancreas have recently been increasing.
