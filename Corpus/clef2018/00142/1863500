Short pancreas in polysplenia syndrome. Two cases with the polysplenia syndrome also had a short pancreas. To the best of our knowledge the radiologic characteristics of this anatomic anomaly have not yet been reported. Both cases were asymptomatic with regard to their anomaly-complex. The radiologic findings of the short "pancreas" are similar to the only pathologic description of this association. The awareness of this association led to the diagnosis of the second case after a few months only. A physician performing ERCP in the polysplenia syndrome should keep in mind the possible presence of the "short pancreas" when the whole length of the pancreatic duct is not visualized.
