Knowledge of indications and utilization of EUS: a survey of oncologists in the United States. Since its advent, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has emerged as an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal and adjacent cancers. Yet, it remains unclear how non-gastroenterologists who manage these malignancies use EUS in their practices.A link to a self-administered questionnaire, hosted on our university website, was emailed to 650 practicing medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists in the United States.Data were analyzed from 100 responses. When available, the overall utilization of EUS for staging nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was significantly low (19.0%), although available. When EUS was unavailable, majority of the patients with pancreatobiliary cancer (79% P<0.01) were not referred for staging, unlike those with esophageal (57.9%) and rectal cancer (73.7%) were. EUS availability did not impact its use in staging gastric cancer. Majority of the respondents thought EUS made an impact in managing patients with rectal (89.5%), esophageal (84.5%), and pancreatobiliary cancers (58.5%) but not gastric (54.7%) or NSCLC (61.5%). In staging NSCLC, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate (35.7%) and mediastinoscopy (34.7%) were noted as the most accurate for tissue sampling of lymph nodes in levels 5, 7, and 8. EUS was deemed better than computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging by 42% in detecting small pancreatic tumors. Majority have not referred patients for EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis for palliation of pain in unresectable pancreatic cancer.These data highlight the utilization of EUS that did not necessarily follow established guidelines. Further research is essential to evaluate obstacles to utilization of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirate.
