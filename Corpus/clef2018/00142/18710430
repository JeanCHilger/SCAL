Hepatitis C virus infection enhances insulin resistance induced by visceral fat accumulation. To clarify the impact of visceral obesity on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, we examined the relationship between insulin resistance development and visceral fat accumulation.We analyzed 87 HCV-infected patients with mild fibrosis (stage 1 or 2) in comparison with 125 sex- and age-matched patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The degree of visceral fat area (VFA cm(2)) at the umbilical level was measured by abdominal computed tomography and divided into two grades: no visceral obesity, VFA<100 and visceral obesity, VFA>/=100. Insulin resistance was evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Pancreatic beta-cell function was evaluated by homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta). Serum soluble tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-receptors 1 and 2 and adiponectin were measured.Insulin resistance evaluated by HOMA-IR and QUICKI was correlated with visceral fat accumulation, and was higher in HCV patients than in NAFLD patients with visceral obesity. HOMA-beta was higher in HCV patients than in NAFLD patients for each VFA grade. Serum-soluble TNF-receptors 1 and 2 were higher in HCV patients than in NAFLD patients with visceral obesity.Hepatitis C virus infection is a risk factor for development of insulin resistance, particularly in patients with visceral obesity.
