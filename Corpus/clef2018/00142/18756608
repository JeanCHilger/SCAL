A case of long survival in poorly differentiated small cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the pancreas is rare. It has similar histological features to pulmonary small cell carcinoma and is equally aggressive. Most patients with SCC in the pancreas reported in case studies died within 1 year after diagnosis. We present a case of unusually long-term survival after surgery and combined chemotherapy for SCC of the pancreas. A 62-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain and jaundice. Computed tomography revealed dilated common bile duct caused by external compression of the mass in the pancreatic head. Exploratory laparotomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) was performed with histopathological analysis confirming a primary small cell carcinoma of the pancreas. After an uneventful postoperative recovery, the patient was treated with 6 cycles of combined chemotherapy consisting of cisplantin and ectoposide. During the follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence and the patient has remained in a good health condition for 36 mo since the diagnosis.
