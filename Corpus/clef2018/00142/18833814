Diagnostic value of unusual gross appearance of aspirated material from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of pancreatic and peripancreatic cystic lesions. To evaluate the diagnostic value of the gross appearance of aspirated material from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic orperipancreatic cystic lesions.This study focuses on nonneoplastic (peri)-pancreatic cystic lesions on EUS-FNA. Eight cases were identified with distinct gross appearances of aspirated material by the authors' experience and by computerized review. Gross observations are evaluated together with clinical data, radiologic findings, laboratory markers and cytologic and surgical microscopy findings.Aspiration of cystic lesions often results in nonspecific cytologic findings. Gross and microscopic appearance of aspirated material can provide valuable information. We divide findings of 8 cystic lesions into 3 different patterns according to their gross appearance at on-site EUS-FNA: Pattern 1, 2 cases of biloma Pattern 2, 1 case of lymphoepithelial cyst with sebaceous differentiationThe full value of FNA is achieved only with the integrated approach, including the gross appearance of the cytology specimens. Certain unusual gross appearances of the aspirated material can add valuable information toward a pathologic diagnosis.
