Glucagonoma syndrome without diabetes mellitus. A patient developed depression, weight loss, ulcers and a migrating, denuded erythematous skin area. Punch biopsy revealed necrolytic migrating erythema. Computerised tomography and endoscopic ultrasound showed a solid tumour of the pancreas. A blood sample showed an increased level of glucagon without diabetes. Glucagonoma syndrome is characterized by glucagon overproduction, diabetes, depression, deep venous thrombosis and necrolytic migrating erythema. Glucagonoma is frequently diagnosed late which increases the risk of metastases. It is important not to rule out glucagonoma in patients with a relevant clinical picture but without diabetes.
