Detection of preoperatively unrecognized multiple pancreatic pseudocysts by intraoperative ultrasonography. Report of two cases. During two pancreatic operations, intraoperative ultrasonography detected multiple pancreatic pseudocysts that were unrecognized preoperatively. In each operation, a single pseudocyst was detected by preoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography, and intraoperative surgical exploration. In addition, high-resolution ultrasonography used during the operations also identified and precisely localized additional smaller pseudocysts. Also, the use of color Doppler imaging during the operations enabled the delineation of small blood vessels around the pseudocysts. The accurate diagnosis of multiple pseudocysts and the precise anatomic information provided by intraoperative ultrasonography permitted appropriate surgical treatment of the pancreatic pseudocysts which, in turn, might help prevent recurrence of the disease.
