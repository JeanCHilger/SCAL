Primary squamous cell carcinoma of pancreas diagnosed by EUS-FNA: a case report. Squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas has been sparsely described since the 1940s, and generally has a poor prognosis. Herein, we present a case of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastasis, both confirmed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in literature utilizing EUS-FNA for a cell-type specific diagnosis of primary pancreatic squamous cell carcinoma with a liver metastasis.
