Clinical presentation can predict disease course in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas. Preoperative diagnosis of malignancy within intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN) solely by clinical or radiological findings is not always possible. We sought a correlation between preoperative clinico-radiological findings and outcome.A prospective database of pancreatic resections for IPMN (2002-2008) and a retrospective pathological revision of all pancreatic cancer specimens (1995-2001) were analyzed. The patients were grouped into asymptomatic with preoperative diagnosis of IPMN (group 1), symptomatic with a preoperative diagnosis of IPMN (group 2), and those with a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer whose specimen revealed a background of IPMN (group 3). The groups were compared for demographics, clinical presentation, pathological findings, and outcome.Of the 62 patients with IPMN, 19 were in group 1, 23 in group 2, and 20 in group 3. Their median age (range) was 65.6 (46-80), 67 (50-84), and 73.4 (57-86) years, respectively. The clinical presentation for groups 2 and 3 included abdominal pain (56% vs. 32 %), weight loss (8% vs. 52%), obstructive jaundice (4% vs. 57%), pancreatitis (22% and 5%), and new onset of diabetes (14% and 44%). Invasive cancer was found in one patient in group 1 (5.2%), two patients in group 2 (8.7%), and all patients in group 3. IPMN was present in 23 of 217 (10.6%) of all resected pancreatic cancer specimens. Five year survival for patients with invasive disease was 47% and 92% for patients with noninvasive disease (mean follow-up 37.6 months).Benign IPMN can usually be differentiated from adenocarcinoma preoperatively. The clinical presentation is highly indicative of disease course.
