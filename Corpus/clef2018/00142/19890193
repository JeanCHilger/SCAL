Pancreatic PEComa (sugar tumor): MDCT and EUS features. PEComas (tumors showing perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation) of the pancreas are exceedingly rare.We herein report on a 60-year-old female who noticed a bulge in her right upper quadrant while exercising. Subsequent multidetector-row CT scan showed a 3.5 cm well-defined, encapsulated, hypovascular, solid tumor in the body of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a mixed hypo- and hyper-echoic, well-defined, heterogeneous tumor.Although three pancreatic PEComas (sugar tumors) have been described previously, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pancreatic PEComa with illustration of its multidetector-row CT and endoscopic ultrasound features in the radiological literature.
