Diagnosis of pancreatic disorders using contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography and endoscopic elastography. Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography (CE-EUS) and EUS-elastography are cutting-edge diagnostic modalities for pancreatic disorders. Each pancreatic disorder has characteristic hemodynamics. CE-EUS uses color Doppler flow imaging to classify pancreatic lesions into a spectrum of solid and cystic patterns. Although there is overlap in the patterns generated by specific types of tumors, some types of tumors tend to produce distinct flow images. EUS-elastography can assess tissue hardness by measuring its elasticity. This parameter appears to correlate with the malignant potential of the lesions. Tissue elasticity studies can provide information on both its pattern and distribution. The former is the conventional method of morphologic diagnosis, but it is restricted to observations made in a region of interest. The latter is an unbiased analysis that can be performed by image analysis software and is theoretically constant, regardless of regions of interest. The evolving modalities of CE-EUS and EUS-elastography might provide clinical utility in the diagnosis of pancreatic disorders.
