Value of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis of neoplastic tumor(-like) pancreatic lesions in daily clinical practice. To investigate the value of EUS-guided FNA in the diagnosis of solid and cystic pancreatic tumor(-like) lesions as well as metastatic tumor growth within peripancreatic lymph nodes and its impact on therapeutic decision-making. The results of the cytologic and pathohistological investigation were compared with i) each other and ii) the detection rates of various imaging procedures.Overall, 153 patients (mean age, 56.9 years) underwent EUS-guided FNA from I/ 2000 - III/ 2003.Comparing various imaging procedures such as CT scan (80 %), MRI (57.1 %) and abdominal US (88.8 %), EUS achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy: 100 %. For EUS-based T-staging in 26 patients with malignant tumor lesions undergoing surgical intervention, there was a sensitivity of 73.3 % (specificity, 85.9 % PPV, 69.2 %EUS-guided FNA allows more precise diagnosis clarification (malignant tumor growth and tumor entity) in solid and cystic pancreatic tumor(-like) lesions, which may assist in early and sufficient therapeutic decision-making.
