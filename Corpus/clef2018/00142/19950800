The efficacy of diffusion-weighted imaging for the detection and evaluation of acute pancreatitis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that evaluates the random motion of water molecules in biological tissues. The clinical utility of DWI has been established for acute stroke and brain tumors. Recent technical advancements in MRI have enabled DWI for the body and several studies have revealed the efficacy of DWI for detecting various diseases. This study documents the efficacy of DWI for the evaluation of acute pancreatitis.MRI was performed with sequences including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging, MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and computed tomography (CT) examinations on 11 patients with mild acute pancreatitis. MRI examinations were performed using 1.5-T imager (Toshiba, Otawara, Japan). Two experienced radiologists evaluated the presence or absence of acute pancreatitis, complications and the cause of acute pancreatitis on the MRI and CT images.There were no differences between the DWI and the CT images regarding their abilities to detect acute pancreatitis. However, DWI could detect acute pancreatitis more clearly than CT without enhancing material. The DWI findings were consistent with the clinical findings, the results of chemical analyses and the CT findings. Furthermore, DWI could detect pancreatic cancer causing acute pancreatitis and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could detect choledocholithiasis and pancreas divisum causing acute pancreatitis.DWI can be a powerful tool for the evaluation and follow-up of acute pancreatitis.
