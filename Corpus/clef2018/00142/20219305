A case of pancreatic schwannoma successfully treated by enucleation. Benign pancreatic schwannoma is a very rare cystic and solid tumor, which poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Herein, we present a case of 4-cm solitary benign schwannoma of pancreatic uncinate process, with pancreas divisum, incidentally discovered in a 53-year-old woman. Preoperative diagnosis was established by endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Simple enucleation of the tumor from the surrounding parenchyma was successfully performed. No complications were found after the operation.
