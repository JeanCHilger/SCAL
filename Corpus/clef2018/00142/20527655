Pancreatic tuberculous abscess diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration is a useful diagnostic aid in evaluation of cystic pancreatic mass. We report our patient with pancreatic tuberculous abscess who presented with pyrexia, and was found to have cystic pancreatic mass on CT scan. Pancreatic tuberculous abscess was diagnosed with the help of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), thereby obviating the necessity for surgery.
