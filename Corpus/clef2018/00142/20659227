Endoscopic resection of ampullary adenoma after a new insulated plastic pancreatic stent placement: a pilot study. Although pancreatic stent insertion is recommended for the prevention of post-procedure pancreatitis during endoscopic papillectomy, insertion of the stent after the procedure can be technically difficult. The aim of the present study was to determine the feasibility and safety of inserting a newly developed insulated pancreatic stent before endoscopic papillectomy.We conducted a prospective pilot study involving 11 consecutive patients with adenomas of the major duodenal papilla. After a 5F polytetrafluoroethylene-insulated pancreatic stent was inserted through the tumor, the stent and tumor were simultaneously grasped with a snare. After resection of the tumor with the stent in place, the tumor was incised perpendicularly along the edge of the stent for retrieval of the specimen.In all patients, the insulated pancreatic stents were successfully inserted before endoscopic papillectomy and were resistant to electrical current retrieval of the specimen was technically feasible and successful without stent migration. There were no stent-related complications, but five papillectomy-related complications (including mild bleeding [n = 4] and late papillary stenosis [n = 1]) occurred without any episodes of acute pancreatitis or perforation.Pre-resection stenting with a polytetrafluoroethylene-insulated stent in patients with adenomas of the major duodenal papilla is a feasible and useful technique to prevent pancreatitis.
