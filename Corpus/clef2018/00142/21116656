Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided ablation therapy. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) imaging has undergone extensive technological advancement since its development in the 1980s, including improvement of echoendoscopes with larger channels and accessories.These advancements enable not only tissue procurement for diagnosis but also therapeutic interventions that hitherto would have required surgery, with its attendant risks. A wide array of interventional procedures are performed under EUS guidance, including celiac plexus neurolysis, drainage of pancreatic and pelvic fluid collections, drainage of obstructive pancreatic-biliary ducts, ablation of cyst neoplasms in the pancreas, and implantation of fiducial markers and radioactive seeds into gastrointestinal tumors. Various experimental procedures are also underway to evaluate the role of EUS in radiofrequency ablation, vascular therapy, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. In this review, we examine the various EUS-guided ablation therapies currently undertaken in humans.
