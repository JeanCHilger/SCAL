Use of Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT to confirm portal vein tumor thrombosis in a patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. A 37-year-old man complained of increasing severity and frequency of abdominal pain over a 2-year period. Initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated diffuse enlargement of the pancreas associated with a filling defect in the portal vein, splenomegaly with wedge-shaped peripheral splenic hypodensities and multiple hepatic hypodensities. Findings were suggestive of a pancreatic malignancy complicated by hepatic metastases, splenic infarcts, and portal vein thrombosis. We describe the use of gallium-68 DOTA-DPhe1, Tyr3-octreotate positron emission tomography/computed tomography (Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT) in confirming the diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with portal vein tumor thrombosis.
