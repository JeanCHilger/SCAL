Severe acute pancreatitis: advances and insights in assessment of severity and management. The patients with acute pancreatitis are at risk to develop different complications from ongoing pancreatic inflammation. Often, there is no correlation between the degree of structural damage to pancreas and clinical manifestation of the disease. The effectiveness of any treatment is related to the ability to predict severity accurately, but there is no ideal predictive system or biochemical marker. Severity assessment is indispensable to the selection of proper initial treatment in the management of acute pancreatitis. The use of multiparametric criteria and the evaluation of severity index permit us to select high-risk patients. Furthermore, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning and contrast-enhanced MRI play an important role in severity assessment. The adoption of multiparametric criteria proposed together with morphological evaluation consents the formulation of a discreetly reliable prognosis on the evolution of the disease a few days from onset.
