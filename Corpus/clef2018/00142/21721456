Pancreatic panniculitis: a cutaneous presentation as an initial clue to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare complication of pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic carcinoma. It is clinically manifested by erythematous subcutaneous nodules typically located on the legs which can occur before or at the onset of pancreatic disease.An 81-year-old woman presented with painful subcutaneous nodules at both shins, recurrent epigastric pain, anorexia and significant weight loss. Physical examination revealed mild pallor, palpable epigastric mass and multiple tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules discrete to both lower extremities. The skin biopsy showed lobular panniculitis with marked subcutaneous fat necrosis and ghost adipocytes compatible with pancreatic panniculitis that was an important clue for further investigations. Elevations of serum amylase and serum lipase were then noted. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed pancreatic cancer with duodenal involvement and multiple liver metastases.Pancreatic panniculitis is associated with pancreatic cancer and represents an important clue to the diagnosis.
