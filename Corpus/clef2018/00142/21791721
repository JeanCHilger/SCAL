Bladder metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma. Report of 2 cases and bibliographic review. Metastases to the urinary bladder are rare, representing less than 2% of bladder tumors. We report two cases of bladder involvement by primary gastric adenocarcinoma and perform a bibliographic review of the literature on this subject.A search for published data was performed in the PubMed database using the key words "bladder", "secondary malignant tumors" and "metastatic gastric carcinoma". We reviewed the two cases of secondary bladder involvement by primary gastric adenocarcinoma managed at our institution.Case 1: 62 year old female presenting with irritative LUTS, hypogastric pain and constitutional symptoms, with bilateral hydronephrosis. After bilateral nephrostomy, bladder wall biopsies revealed poorly differentiated metastatic gastric carcinoma. Case 2: 41 year old male with gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy with pancreatic involvement, under neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen, with sporadic macroscopic hematuria. Cistoscopy revealed a protuberant bladder mass with biopsies conclusive for secondary bladder involvement by gastric carcinoma.Bladder metastasis from primary gastric adenocarcinoma usually means advanced disease with multiple metastatic involvement and peritoneal dissemination. The overall prognosis is very poor.
