Tumors of the ampulla diagnosed by CT hypotonic duodenography. Adenocarcinoma is an uncommon gastrointestinal malignancy.

Conversely, in the vast majority of cases, CT is unable to demonstrate the duodenal tumor. We describe a technical procedure that has permitted CT visualization of a small ampullary tumor in two cases.
