A case of Chlamydia trachomatis peritonitis mimicking tuberculous peritonitis. Lymphocytic ascites with low serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) are observed mainly in tuberculous peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and pancreatic disease. However, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) induced generalized peritonitis causing diffuse ascites has been rarely described. We report a 26-year old female patient, who was diagnosed as generalized peritonitis with diffuse ascites due to Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Gynecologic examination did not show the clue of PID and in the analysis of ascites, low SAAG, predominant lymphocyte count and high level of adenosine deaminase were noted. Although the best impression was tuberculous peritonitis on the base of these findings, the laparoscopic finding was consistent with PID and the PCR for C. trachomatis infection in cervical swab was positive. This case suggests that C. trachomatis peritonitis should be considered as a rare cause of low SAAG and lymphocytic ascites in sexually active women and should be intensively evaluated including laparoscopic examination.
