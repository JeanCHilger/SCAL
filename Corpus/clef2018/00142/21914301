Diagnosis and surgical interventions for the chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to the inflammatory lesions at the opening of the pancreatic duct. To explore the diagnostic methods and reasonable surgical interventions for the chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to the inflammatory lesions at the opening of the pancreatic duct.From January 2002 to November 2010 the data of 28 patients who were diagnosed as the chronic obstructive pancreatitis (COP) was retrospectively reviewed. Out of the 28 patients, it was analyzed that the clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, surgical finding and surgical interventions of the 13 patients who were diagnosed as COP due to the inflammatory lesions at the opening of the pancreatic duct in the exploratory operation accompanying recurrent acute abdominal pain with increased serum amylase and lipase, dilation of entire pancreatic duct on imaging before surgery. The conditions included pain recrudescence, quality of life, pancreatic changes on imaging and the serum amylase and lipase after surgery were recorded.All the 13 patients had clinical manifestations of COP. However, 12 patients had different manifestations on imaging from those chronic pancreatitis imaging due to tumors at the duodenal papilla, ampulla or inner pancreatic duct. Via exploratory operation and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), there were short pancreaticobiliary common channel or pancreas divisum existing in most patients. There was no acute abdominal pain with the increased serum amylase and lipase in the 12 patients who receiving the transduodenal mastoid, ampulla and pancreatic ductal opening incision and plasty, the paramastoideus incision and plasty in the visit.The imaging character of COP due to the inflammatory lesions at the opening of the pancreatic duct is the dilation of the pancreatic duct without the chronic obstruction in the bile duct. The patients with short pancreaticobiliary common channel or pancreas divisum easily suffer COP due to the stenosis of the pancreatic ductal opening caused by the duodenal mastoiditis or paramastoiditis. The local plasty surgery to correct the stenosis at the pancreatic ductal opening and improve the drainage of the pancreatic duct is an easy and effective management.
