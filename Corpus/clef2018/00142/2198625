CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of adrenal masses. Experience of the technic in 54 neoplasm patients. Cross-sectional CT and US imaging have allowed the visualization of adrenal glands anatomy and abnormalities. In cancer patients a unilateral or bilateral adrenal enlargement may result from metastasis because the adrenal gland is one of the most common locations for metastasis in thoracic and abdominal tumors. We report our experience in 54 patients who underwent adrenal biopsy for unilateral (44 cases) or bilateral (10 cases) masses during CT examination mostly for lung cancer studies. Twenty-nine of 54 patients (53.7%) had metastatic deposits in the enlarged parenchyma. Other lesions included various pathologic conditions such as primary malignant tumors (2 carcinomas, 2 lymphomas, and 1 pheochromoblastoma) (5.5%), pheochromocytomas (3.7%), nonfunctioning adenomas (14.8%), and simple hyperplasias (12.4%). Eight of 10 patients with bilateral enlargement were metastatic the extant 2 had simple hyperplasia. Biopsy was useless in 5 cases (9.2%), especially in the beginning and due to poor technique. All procedures were carried out with 18 and 19 G needles and under CT guidance, after standard scanning. The posterior approach was initially used, for both right (15%) and left (7.4%) lesions, but 3 pneumothoraces occurred. At present, we prefer transhepatic approach for the right adrenal gland: this access route is, in our experience, the safest and quickest. Left adrenal masses were approached anteriorly through the left hepatic lobe
