A new case of solitary true pancreatic cyst. A true cyst of the pancreas is extremely rare, and few cases have been reported in adult patients. The authors report a new case of this rare pathological entity. A 35-year-old male patient was admitted to our unit with a cystic mass, about 6cm in diameter, located in the pancreatic head, in proximity to the duodenum, vena cava, biliary tree and right kidney. Clinical features and imagery were suggestive for a benign neoplasm, as did surgical findings. Cystoduodenostomy was done. Histological finding revealed a cyst lined by cuboidal epithelium without morphologic alterations. Analysis of the cyst fluid showed a high level of CA 19-9 (10,000Uml(-1)). After 1-year follow-up, the patient was found to be doing well without any abdominal symptoms. Ultrasound images revealed no cyst recurrence.
