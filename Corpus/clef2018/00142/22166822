Small renal cell carcinoma with pancreas metastasis: a case report. A 53-year-old-man was treated in the Department of Surgery for a pancreatic tumor because asymptomatic, nodular masses, 4 cm-in diameter were discovered in the tail of the pancreas on computed tomography (CT). The pancreatic masses were metastases of renal cell carcinoma on pathological examination. Contrast-enhanced CT and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging showed a small, 1.3 cmdiameter mass in the right kidney. The size of the renal tumor was small, but it appeared to have high malignancy because of spread to the pancreas. We chose radical nephrectomy in consideration of intrarenal spread of carcinoma. The resected specimen was diagnosed pathologically as clear cell carcinoma, G2＞ G1, pT1apN0M0, exp, INFα, v (-), ly (-). At follow-up one year after surgery, there was no evidence of recurrence.
