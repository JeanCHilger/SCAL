A case of cholesterol granuloma in pancreas. Cholesterol granuloma is a histological term used for the description of a tissue response to a foreign body such as cholesterol crystals. Cholesterol granuloma is histologically characterized as fibrous granulation tissue containing cholesterol crystals within surrounding giant cells. Cases of cholesterol granuloma of the pancreas are very rare. We report a case of a 47-year old male who had a cholesterol granuloma of the pancreas. Abdominal CT showed 24 mm-sized cyst in the pancreas and peri-pancreatic regional mass infiltrating to the stomach. PET-CT revealed increased 18F-FDG uptake at the cyst and peri-pancreatic mass. Thus, Whipple's operation was done. The disease was confirmed by surgical pathologic examination of the tissue. Pathologic examination of resected specimen showed numerous cholesterol crystals surrounded by multinucleated foreign body giant cells. We report on this case and give a brief review of the literature.
