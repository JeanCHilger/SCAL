A case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen mistaken as a pancreatic mass due to different enhancing pattern from normal spleen. Most cases of accessory spleen show similar features as normal spleen in imaging studies. However, some accessory spleen has unusual scan feature which can be misdiagnosed. We present a case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen that was discovered incidentally during a workup for abdominal pain in a 47-year-old woman. CT and MRI revealed a different enhancing pattern from that of the spleen. Further evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography failed to identify the pancreatic mass. Therefore, it was surgically removed and diagnosed pathologically as an accessory spleen.
