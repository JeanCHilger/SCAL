A case of pancreatic mucinous carcinoma which includes calcification. A 60-year-old woman was pointed out a tumor, 2.6 cm in diameter, at the pancreas body, by screening ultrasonography examination. Jaundice and anemia were absent and no abdominal mass was palpable on physical examination. Enhanced CT revealed the tumor directly invaded to splenic vein, but lymph node metastases were not detected. ERCP showed a pancreatic duct was obstructed by the tumor, accompanied with dilatation of the peripheral pancreas duct. Because we cannot rule out the malignancy tumor, pancreatoduodenectomy and lymphadenectomy was done. The tumor was very hard and serosal invasion was suspicious in the operative findings. Histopathological study showed that the tumor was occupied with colloid differentiation, in which free mucinous epithelial malignant cells were floating. Then we diagnosed the tumor to be pancreatic mucinous carcinoma. Extra pancreatic extension such as vascular involvement was not proved microscopically. However, ten months after the resection, CT scan showed a recurrent tumor sized 4 cm diameter, at the middle abdominal cavity, which suspected to be disseminated diseases. Mucinous carcinoma occurs relatively rare in pancreas, of which the incidence is 1 .4% in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. We report herein the pancreatic mucinous carcinoma case with a calcificated region, which resulted in early recurrence with abdominal seeding.
