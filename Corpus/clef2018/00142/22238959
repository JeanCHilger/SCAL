Clinical parallels of computer tomography and intraoperative findings in benign cystic formations of the pancreas. A comparative analysis was made of preoperative computer diagnostics and intraoperative findings in 151 patients operated at various periods of chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n=76) with exacerbation of pancreatitis (or relapsed acute against the background of chronic) and 75 patients without exacerbation. Ninety (59.6%) patients have arrived with complications. Sensitivity of the method of computer tomography in patients with pancreatic exacerbation is 97.4%, without exacerbation is 98.7%. Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct is divided into three degrees. The dilatation of the 2nd and 3d degrees was diagnosed in 78 patients. All the patients were operated on the pancreas in the volume of direct interventions including external drainage which was performed in 69, internal in 56, separately resectional operations in 19, isolated cystectomy in 7 patients, In the group of patients operated out of exacerbation a correlation between the degree of the internal pancreas duct hypertension according to the data of preoperative computed diagnostics and the number of operations of internal drainage was followed. The presence of pancreatitis exacerbation (or relapsed acute against the background of chronic) in 27.5% (n=21) did not allow lateral pancreaticojejunostomy to be performed. In 23 patients the presence of exacerbation, complications of CP due to proper cystic formation (suppuration) and from adjoining organs was not considered contraindication to longitudinal and bilateral pancreaticojejunostomy. Low indices of postoperative lethality (0.7%) and of the number of postoperative complications (6%) confirmed the possibility to liquidate intraductal hypertension in complicated CP at earlier terms that protects the patients from many stages of surgical treatment.
