Resection of the second portion of the duodenum sacrificing the minor papilla but preserving the pancreas for a recurrent duodenal adenocarcinoma: report of a case. Duodenal adenocarcinoma is a relatively rare malignancy and pancreaticoduodenectomy would be a standard procedure to achieve curative resection. We report a case of resection of the 2nd portion of the duodenum with nodal dissection preserving the pancreas. The patient was a 75-year-old man with right-sided paresis suffering from early cancer in the 2nd portion of the duodenum. Despite 3 times of endoscopic mucosal resections, mucosal local recurrence was found. The depth of the tumour involvement continued to be limited within the mucosal layer. We performed segmental duodenal resection with nodal dissection sacrificing the minor papilla, while preserving the pancreas and the major papilla. The pathological diagnosis was primary intramucosal adenocarcinoma the surgical margin was negative for cancer and there was no nodal metastasis. This procedure can be an alternative to pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with earlystage adenocarcinoma in the 2nd portion of the duodenum when the major papilla can be spared, especially in high-risk patients.
