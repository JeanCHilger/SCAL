Chronic pancreatitis presenting with pseudocyst of pancreas and pseudo-aneurysm of hepatic artery. A 2-y-old girl presented with recurrent abdominal pain and hematemesis. The patient was diagnosed to have chronic calcific pancreatitis complicated by pseudocyst of the head of pancreas and pseudo-aneurysm of the common hepatic artery. Diagnosis was made using abdominal ultrasonography and CT angiography. The rarity of the presentation of pseudocyst with pseudo-aneurysm formation in a pediatric patient is noted. The pseudo-aneurysm was treated by embolization of the artery and the pain being refractory to analgesics was managed by celiac plexus blockade.
