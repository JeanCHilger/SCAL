Pancreatic transplants: CT-guided biopsy. With use of computed tomographic (CT) guidance, 10 biopsies of pancreatic allografts were performed in four patients to determine the cause of pancreatic dysfunction. All biopsies were performed with an 18-gauge biopsy needle and with use of a biopsy gun. On four occasions, simultaneous biopsies of the pancreatic head and tail were performed. In nine of the 10 biopsies, specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. In two of the four simultaneous procedures, important histologic differences were noted between specimens from the head and those from the tail of the allograft. No complications occurred. These findings demonstrate the ease, accuracy, and safety of CT-guided biopsies of pancreatic transplants with a biopsy gun. Simultaneous sampling of the pancreatic head and tail may provide important clinical information that may not be available when the usual cystoscopically guided biopsy of the pancreatic head is used.
