Imaging of acute pancreatitis: update of the revised Atlanta classification. Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreatic gland with increasing incidence worldwide. Usually the clinical presentation and course are mild, with an uneventful recovery. In 10% to 20% of patients, however, local and systemic complications develop, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In 1992, the Atlanta symposium provided definitions for acute pancreatitis and its severity. Insights into the pathophysiology of the disease, improved diagnostic imaging, and implementation of minimally invasive techniques have led to classification updates. This article reviews the cross-sectional imaging features of acute pancreatitis and presents proposed definitions of the revised Atlanta classification.
