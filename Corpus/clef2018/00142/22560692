Cystic tumors of the pancreas: imaging and management. Cystic tumors of the pancreas are a subset of rare pancreatic tumors that vary from benign to malignant. Many have specific imaging findings that allow them to be differentiated from each other. This article (1) reviews the imaging features of the common cystic pancreatic lesions, including serous microcystic adenoma, mucinous cystic tumor, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, and solid pseudopapillary tumor, and including the less common lesions such as cystic endocrine tumors, cystic metastases, cystic teratomas, and lymphangiomas and (2) provides comprehensive algorithms on how to manage the individual lesions, with recommendations on when to reimage patients.
