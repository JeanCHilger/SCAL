EUS elastography: advances in diagnostic EUS of the pancreas. Elastography is an imaging modality for the evaluation of tissue stiffness, which has been used for the analysis of superficial organs, such as those of the breast and prostate. The measurement of tissue elasticity has been reported to be useful for the diagnosis and differentiation of tumors, which are stiffer than normal tissues. Endoscopic ultrasonography elastography (EUS-EG) is a promising imaging technique with a high degree of accuracy for the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic tumors. Recent introduction of second generation EUS-EG allows for the quantitative analysis of tissue stiffness. Here, we review our knowledge and preliminary experience with the use of EUS-elastography for the diagnosis of pancreatic disease.
