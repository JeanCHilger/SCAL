Endoscopic ultrasound-guided antitumor agents. The development of linear-array endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), with its real-time guidance of needle advancement, changed EUS from a diagnostic procedure to an interventional procedure. EUS-guided fine-needle injection (EUS-FNI) is an attractive minimally invasive delivery system with potential applications in local (intratumoral) and combination therapy against esophageal and pancreatic cancers. The evidence of the feasibility of EUS-FNI of antitumor agents has been expanding with promising results.
