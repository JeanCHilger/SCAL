Rare pancreatic neoplasm: MDCT and MRI features of a typical solid pseudopapillary tumor. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm, predominantly observed in young women and with greatest incidence in the second and third decade. It has clinically good behavior, although large at the time of diagnosis. We report the case of a thirty-year-old woman with a giant mass in the pancreas, incidentally discovered during an abdominal ultrasonography. The mass was later investigated by multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The cystic-solid appearance of the encapsulated lesion suggested to radiologists the possibility of a solid pseudopapillary tumor. Imaging features of this pancreatic neoplasm and differential diagnosis from other cystic pancreatic tumors are discussed in our report, in order to help radiologists and clinicians achieve correct diagnosis and management.
