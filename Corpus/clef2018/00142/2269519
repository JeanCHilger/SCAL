Computed tomography and acute pancreatitis. Computed tomography (CT) is the best overall imaging modality in the clinical management of acute pancreatitis. It can detect complications such as phlegmonous extension outside the gland, abscess and pseudocyst formation, and hemorrhage. Pancreatic necrosis can be diagnosed with the use of dynamic CT scanning after the rapid bolus injection of iodinated contrast media. The information gathered can be used to guide clinical management and provide anatomic detail for percutaneous aspiration and drainage or surgical intervention when indicated.
