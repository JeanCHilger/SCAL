Two cases of portal annular pancreas. Portal annular pancreas is one of the pancreatic fusion anomalies in which the uncinate process of the pancreas extends to fuse with the dorsal pancreas by encircling the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein. We report two consecutive patients with portal annular pancreas. The first case is a 71-year-old male patient who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in the head of pancreas. His preoperative computed tomography scan showed the suprasplenic type portal annular pancreas. The second case is a 74-year-old female patient who underwent a laparoscopic anterior radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) for pancreatic body cancer. In operative finding, portal confluence (superior mesenteric vein-splenic vein-portal vein) was encased with the uncinate process of pancreas in both cases. Therefore, they required pancreatic division at the pancreatic neck portion twice. During the postoperative period, grade B and A, respectively, postoperative pancreatic fistulas occurred and were controlled by conservative management. Surgeons need to know about this rare pancreatic condition prior to surgical intervention to avoid complications, and to provide patients with well-designed, case-specific pancreatic surgery.
