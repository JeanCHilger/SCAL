Solid-pseudopapillary carcinoma: a case study and literature review. Solid-pseudopapillary tumour (SPT) is a rare exocrine tumour of the pancreas and is considered to have low malignant potential. Few morphological criteria are used to predict malignant behaviour such as equivocal perineural invasion, angioinvasion and invasion to surrounding tissue, and should be designated as solid-pseudopapillary carcinoma (SPC). We report a case of SPC. Clinical and radiological findings are typical for SPT with no metastatic disease. There is no tumour recurrence after 4&emsp14months postresection. Clinical history and radiological findings were retrieved from the patient's record sheet and Viarad system. H&E staining and few immunoproxidase staining were reviewed by several pathologists. The histological findings are typical for SPT, with additional perineural invasion. There is no angioinvasion or capsular invasion identified. This is our first experience in diagnosing and managing SPC. We look forward to seeing the patient's disease status during her next routine follow-up. We expect good disease-free survival and very low risk of tumour recurrence, in view of only one risk factor (perineural invasion) and uninvolved surgical margins by the tumour.
