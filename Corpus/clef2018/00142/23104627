Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare entities accounting for between 0.13 and 2.7 per cent of pancreatic tumours. This neoplasm has a predilection for females under the age of 35. The authors report this case of a SPN incidentally discovered when a 59-year-old female underwent a chest x-ray to investigate a wheeze. A subsequent CT abdomen revealed a 10 cm well-circumscribed mass adjacent to the tail of the pancreas. This mass was successfully resected. Immunohistochemical markers established the diagnosis of a SPN. The wheeze associated with the presentation of this case was unrelated to the tumour which was an incidental finding. These neoplasms are largely asymptomatic and indolent reaching a large size before detection. Diagnosis is confirmed on histology and in this case surgical resection was curative and there was no metastasis at presentation.
