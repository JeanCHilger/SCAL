High alcohol consumption increases the risk of pancreatic stone formation and pancreatic atrophy in autoimmune pancreatitis. This study aimed to investigate risk factors for pancreatic stones and atrophy in autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).Seventy-one patients with AIP observed for more than 1 year were enrolled. The frequency of pancreatic stone development and atrophy on computed tomography as well as their risk factors were examined.Pancreatic stones and atrophy were observed in 13 and 43 patients, respectively. Alcohol consumption of greater than 50 g/d was the only significant risk factor for pancreatic atrophy in univariate analysis. Alcohol intake of greater than 50 g/d was observed in 6 of 13 patients with stones and 10 of 58 patients without stones (46% vs 17%, P = 0.059). Alcohol intake of greater than 50 g/d was observed in 14 of 43 patients with atrophy and 2 of 28 patients without atrophy (33% vs 7.1%, P = 0.018). In multivariate analysis, alcohol consumption was a significant risk factor both for pancreatic stone formation (odds ratio [OR], 7.47 P = 0.040) and atrophy (OR 6.24Alcohol consumption of greater than 50 g/d increases the risk of pancreatic stone development and atrophy in patients with AIP.
