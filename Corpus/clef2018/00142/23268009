A case of interstitial lung disease associated with gemcitabine treatment in a patient with locally advanced pancreatic cancer following proton beam radiotherapy. A 69-year-old woman who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer underwent proton beam radiotherapy(67.5 GyE/25 Fr) concurrent with gemcitabine chemotherapy (GEM 800 mg/m2 day 1, 8) at Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center, followed by GEM chemotherapy (1,000 mg/m2 day 1, 8, 15/28 day)at Kobe University Hospital. She visited our hospital because she was suffering from dyspnea 212 days after first administration of GEM. A chest computed tomography revealed that infiltrations were spreading in the bilateral lung fields. A bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. We diagnosed GEM related interstitial lung disease with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. We introduced steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g/day) for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone (40 mg/day), which was tapered gradually. She recovered and was discharged on the 24th day after admission.
