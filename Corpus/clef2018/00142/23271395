Ratio of pancreatic duct caliber to width of pancreatic gland by endosonography is predictive of pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to determine whether (1) a pancreatic duct (PD) diameter to pancreatic gland width (G) ratio (PDG) by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) predicts pancreatic cancer (PC) and (2) whether this ratio better indicates PC compared to PD dilation alone.Patients presenting for EUS were classified into the following 4 categories: (1) normal, (2) noncalcific chronic pancreatitis (NCCP), (3) calcific CP (CCP), and (4) PC.There were 198 patients enrolled. Final diagnoses were PC (n = 34), CCP (n = 16), and normal/NCCP (n = 148). The median PD diameter (8, 5, and 2 mm, respectively P = <0.001), G (16, 20, and 17 mm, respectivelyA PDG ratio is a good predictor of PC and is better than PD dilation. This sign should be routinely used by endosonographers to improve EUS diagnostic capability of PC.
