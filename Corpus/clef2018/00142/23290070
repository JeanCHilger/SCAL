Retrospective analysis of ultrasonography for autoimmune pancreatitis. To explore the sonographic characteristics of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).The ultrasonographic features and clinical data of 8 AIP patients were analyzed retrospectively and compared with the findings of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.Ultrasound images showed diffuse pancreatic swelling (n = 6), focal pancreatic head thickening (n = 1) and tail enlargement (n = 1). In 7 patients, pancreatic echogenicities were of Grade 1 or less while the other 1 patient Grade 2. Among them, 6 showed hyperechoic "pseudocapsule". And enlarged gallbladder, dilated biliary and pancreatic ducts were seen in 2 patients with jaundice.Ultrasonic features play an important role in an early diagnosis of AIP.
