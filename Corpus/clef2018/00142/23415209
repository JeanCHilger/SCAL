Macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas masquerading as a mucinous cystadenoma: case report. Pancreatic macrocystic serous cystadenoma is an uncommon benign lesion that can be misdiagnosed as a mucinous cystic neoplasm which, in turn, harbors malignant potential. We present the case of a patient with a pancreatic macrocystic serous cystadenoma and review current diagnostic modalities.We present the case of a 28-year-old otherwise-healthy female who was incidentally found to have a pancreatic cyst. Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a 3.0 cm lobulated and septated lesion in the head of the pancreas. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the cyst revealed mucoid contents and a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 0.69 ng/mL. The presumptive diagnosis of a mucinous cystic neoplasm was made and the lesion was resected by enucleation. Surgical pathology reported a 1.60 cm dominant cystic lesion lined with cuboidal epithelium and multiple adjacent microscopic satellite cysts, consistent with the macrocystic variant of the serous cystadenoma.Pancreatic macrocystic serous cystadenoma is uncommon and can be misdiagnosed as a mucinous cystic neoplas. In order to make an accurate diagnosis and to select appropriate treatment, surgeons must be familiar with the current diagnostic modalities.
