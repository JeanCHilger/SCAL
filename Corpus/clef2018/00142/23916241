Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and biopsy using a 22-gauge needle with side fenestration in pancreatic cystic lesions. Cytologic diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is associated with low sensitivity and adequacy. A newly designed endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy device, endowed with a side fenestration, is now available.We carried out a study with the aim of evaluating the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic yield of the 22-gauge needle with side fenestration for endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration and biopsy of pancreatic cystic lesions.58 patients with 60 pancreatic cystic lesions consecutively referred for endoscopic ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration were enrolled in a prospective, dual centre study, and underwent fine needle aspiration and biopsy with the 22-gauge needle with side fenestration.Fine needle aspiration and biopsy was technically feasible in all cases. In 39/60 (65%) pancreatic cystic lesions, the specimens were adequate for cyto-histologic assessment. In lesions with solid components, and in malignant lesions, adequacy was 94.4% (p = 0.0149) and 100% (p = 0.0069), respectively. Samples were adequate for histologic evaluation in 18/39 (46.1%) cases. There were only 2 (3.3%) mild complications.Fine needle aspiration and biopsy with the 22-gauge needle with side fenestration is feasible, and superior to conventional endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology from cystic fluid, particularly in pancreatic cystic lesions with solid component or malignancy, with a higher diagnostic yield and with no increase in complication rate.
