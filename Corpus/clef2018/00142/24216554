Case report of pancreatic dermoid cyst: can fine needle aspiration make the diagnosis? Pancreatic dermoid cysts are rare, benign, germ cell tumors and part of the differential diagnosis for cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.A 35-year-old man presented with an incidentally discovered, 2 cm cystic pancreatic neoplasm of the pancreatic tail identified on CT scan. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed a complex, honeycomb lesion. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) yielded a sample of whitish, necrotic material containing histiocytes, benign epithelial cells, and lymphocytes. After distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed, histology revealed a cyst lined by stratified squamous epithelium with benign sebaceous units consistent with a pancreatic dermoid cysts.Although axial imaging reliably detects cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, diagnostic criteria for rare lesions are lacking therefore alternative modalities such as EUS/FNA can be utilized. This case report highlights the EUS and FNA findings associated with pancreatic dermoid cysts.
