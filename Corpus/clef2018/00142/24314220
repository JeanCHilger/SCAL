Feasibility and safety of CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy and subsequent iodine-125 seed interstitial implantation for pancreatic cancer. To discuss the feasibility and safety of different approaches for CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy and subsequent iodine-125 seed interstitial implantation for pancreatic cancer.A retrospective study was carried out on the complete data of 35 patients with pancreatic cancer who have received CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy with or without subsequent iodine-125 seed interstitial implantation. There were 9 lesions located in the head of pancreas, 20 located in the body, and 6 in the tail. The maximum diameter of the lesions varied from 12 mm to 60 mm (mean 37.1 mm). The patients were treated with a needle in diameter of 16-21G. Operations were undertaken via anterior, posterior and lateral approaches.Thirty-five patients underwent 43 times of CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsies. Thirty-one cases were pathologically diagnosed as cancer, 2 cases inflammatory lesions, and 2 were suspected tumors (one of which was finally diagnosed as cancer, while another was pancreatic pseudocyst). The ratio of correct diagnosis was 94.3%. Fourteen patients were treated subsequently with CT-guided iodine-125 seed interstitial implantation therapy, with a total of 65 times of needle puncture. The operations were performed via direct approach to the tumor in 18 cases, transhepatic approach in 2 cases, transgastric approach in 4 cases, transintestinal approach in 10 cases, and through mesenteric vessels in one case. Incidence of complications in the biopsy group was 2.32% (1/43), and in the implantation group was 6.15% (4/65), with a statistically non-significant difference (P = 0.600) between the two groups. Incidence of complications in the group using 16-18G needle was 4.65% (4/86), while in the group using 20-21G needle was 4.55% (1/22), also with a non-significant difference (P = 0.064). The accuracy rate of needle biopsy in this study was 94.28% (33/35).CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy and subsequent iodine-125 seed interstitial implantation are both feasible and safe for pancreatic cancer.
