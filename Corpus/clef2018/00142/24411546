Pancreatic lymphangioma. Lymphangioma develops as a consequence of lymphatic malformation and blockage of lymphatic flow. Pancreatic lymphangioma is a rare benign tumour which can grow reasonably large prior to manifestation of symptoms. On imaging, it appears as a complex multiseptated cystic mass. However, this appearance is not diagnostic and overlaps with cystic pancreatic neoplasm. We present a case of pancreatic lymphangioma incidentally discovered in an elderly lady who was managed conservatively since surgery could not be performed as the patient was high risk for surgery. Imaging findings along with follow-up of the case and review of literature is presented.
