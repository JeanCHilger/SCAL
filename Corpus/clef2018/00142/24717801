Natural history of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with mural nodules: a Japan Pancreas Society multicenter study. This study aimed to elucidate the natural history of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas with mural nodules (MNs) in branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN).Among the 402 registered patients with BD-IPMN on long-term follow-up at 10 institutions in Japan, 53 patients with MNs of less than 10 mm in height detected by endosonography were included in this study. The morphological changes of the BD-IPMN in these patients and histologic findings of the resected specimen were investigated.The median height of the MNs at the initial diagnosis was 3 mm (range, 1-8 mm), and 12 (23%) of the 53 patients showed an increase in the height of the MNs during follow-up (mean duration, 42 months). Six patients underwent surgery because of an increase in the height of MNs, yielding high-grade dysplasia in 1 patient and low-grade dysplasia in 5 patients. No patients developed invasive carcinoma derived from IPMN, and distinct pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma developed in 1 (2%) patient. The incidence of the development of malignancy in BD-IPMNs, including distinct pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, was similar to that of those without MNs.In patients who have BD-IPMN with MNs of less than 10 mm in height, observation instead of immediate resection is considered to be possible.
