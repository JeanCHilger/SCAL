Prediction of postoperative pancreatic fistulas after pancreatectomy: assessment with acoustic radiation force impulse elastography. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the usefulness of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography of the pancreas for predicting postoperative pancreatic fistula occurrence after pancreatic resection.Twenty-five patients underwent ARFI elastography of the pancreas before pancreatic resection (11 men and 14 women mean age, 59.1 yearsClinically relevant fistulas (grade B or higher) were observed in 8 patients (32% fistula group), including 5 of 18 patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy (28%) and 3 of 7 patients with distal pancreatectomy (43%). The ARFI values in the fistula group (median, 1.45 m/sThis preliminary study showed the potential feasibility of a clinical application of ARFI elastography in preoperatively predicting postoperative pancreatic fistulas after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Investigation of this method in larger studies is needed.
