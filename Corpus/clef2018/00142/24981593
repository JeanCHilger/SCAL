Management of serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Pancreatic serous cystadenomas are uncommon benign tumours that are often found incidentally on routine imaging examinations. Radiological imaging techniques alone have proven to be suboptimal to fully characterize cystic pancreatic lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound, with the addition of fine-needle aspiration in difficult cases, has showed greater diagnostic accuracy than conventional imaging techniques. The best management strategy of these neoplasms is still debated. Surgery should be limited only to symptomatic and highly selected cases and most of the patients should only be strictly monitored. In the current paper, we provide an updated overview on pancreatic serous cystadenomas, focusing our attention on epidemiology, clinical characteristics and diagnostic evaluation finally, we also discuss different management strategies and areas for future research.
