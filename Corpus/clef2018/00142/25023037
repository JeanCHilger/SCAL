Pancreatitis. Secretin increases the diagnostic yield of MRCP. The presence of ductal abnormalities after an unexplained acute attack of acute pancreatitis or in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis might lead to a misdiagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or complications of acute pancreatitis. A new study suggests secretin administered during magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) leads to a better diagnostic yield than MRCP alone.
