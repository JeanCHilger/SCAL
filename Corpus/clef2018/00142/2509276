Cholestasis caused by an intradiverticular bezoar. Endoscopic treatment. A 49 year old woman presented with fever. Blood chemistry showed cholestasis. Sonography and abdominal computed tomography showed a dilated biliary tract and a fluid collection in the head of the pancreas. A large, interposed, diverticulum of the second duodenum, filled with a bezoar, was documented by duodenoscopy. The bezoar was fragmented and removed by biopsy forceps. Retrograde visualization of the common bile duct then showed a normal biliary tree with good clearance of contrast material. The ulterior course was uncomplicated. This is the second reported case for cholestasis due to an intradiverticular bezoar in an interposed duodenal diverticula. Diagnosis and treatment were made by duodenoscopy.
