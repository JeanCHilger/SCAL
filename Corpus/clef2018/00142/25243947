Primary pancreatic choriocarcinoma revealed on FDG PET/CT. Choriocarcinoma is a cancer that usually occurs in the uterus during pregnancy. Extragonadal choriocarcinoma, although very rare, can occur. The diagnostic dilatation and curettage of the uterus in a 28-year-old woman who had vaginal bleeding and elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin level failed to identify any abnormality. FDG PET/CT revealed abnormal activity in the head of the pancreas. Pathological examination after partial pancreatectomy demonstrated primary choriocarcinoma in the pancreas.
