Pancreatic duct "Icicle sign" on MRI for distinguishing autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the proximal pancreas. To determine reliable MRI features of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) in the proximal pancreas that could allow its differentiation from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Twenty-three patients with AIP and 61 patients with PDAC in the proximal pancreas underwent MRI. Two observers analyzed MRI for lesion morphology, hypointensity degree on T1-weighted images, enhancement pattern during dynamic phases, capsule-like rim, presence of cysts and duct penetrating sign, morphology of bile duct, and icicle appearance and tortuosity of the upstream pancreatic duct. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of AIP were calculated for each category or combined.When isointensity on the portal and late phase of MRI and/or the icicle sign of pancreatic duct are applied, 100 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of AIP in the proximal pancreas was achieved. Applying both mild T1 hypointensity similar to the spleen and the icicle sign enabled 100 % specificity for the diagnosis of AIP by differentiating it from PDAC.The combination of the icicle sign in the upstream pancreatic duct and mild T1 hypointensity or isointensity on portal and late phase of dynamic MRI could be reliable MR features for the diagnosis of AIP in the proximal pancreas by allowing its differentiation from PDAC.• The icicle sign of the pancreatic duct is useful for diagnosing AIP. • Mild T1 hypointensity similar to the spleen is useful for diagnosing AIP. • Isointensity on portal and late phases MRI is useful for diagnosing AIP.
