Imaging of pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma. To describe the main imaging characteristics of pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with particular attention to CT features, underlining possible criteria for a differential diagnosis.15 patients have been included in this study. 14 patients underwent multislice CT with triphasic acquisition (unenhanced, pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases). In 9 cases a delayed phase (120 sec) was also acquired. 5 patients underwent MRI, before and after administration of gadolinium.The mean time interval between nephrectomy and recurrence was 7.5 years (range 1-17 years). On CT metastases avidly enhanced in the parenchymal phase and then demonstrated a significant wash-out, approaching isodensity to the normal pancreatic parenchyma in the portal phase. In the portal phase 20 of the 25 lesions found in the arterial phase were recognizable. On non-enhanced scans, only 13 of the 25 lesions were detected.Renal Cell Carcinomas require a prolonged CT or MRI follow-up.
