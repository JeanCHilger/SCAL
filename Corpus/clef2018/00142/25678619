Pancreaticopleural fistula: an unusual complication of pancreatitis. Pancreaticopleural fistula is an uncommon complication of pancreatitis. The authors describe a case of a man in his mid-40s with a history of alcohol abuse, who presented with dyspnoea and whose chest X-ray revealed a massive left pleural effusion. Further diagnostic work up revealed a pancreaticopleural fistula. There was no improvement with a conservative approach and endoscopic treatment was not feasible, leading to the need for a surgical intervention.
