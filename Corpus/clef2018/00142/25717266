Stent displacement in endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst drainage and endoscopic management. A pancreatic pseudocyst (PPC) is a collection of pancreatic fluid enclosed by a non-epithelialized, Ô¨Åbrous or granulomatous wall. Endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst drainage (PPD) has been widely used clinically to treat PPCs. The success and complications of endoscopic PPD are comparable with surgical interventions. Stent displacement is a rare complication after endoscopic PPD. Almost all the complications of endoscopic PPD have been managed surgically, and there is rare report involving the endoscopic treatment of intraperitoneal stent displacement. We report here a case of stent displacement after endoscopic ultrasound- and fluoroscopy-guided PPD in a 41-year-old female patient with a PPC in the tail of the pancreas. The endoscopic treatment was successfully performed to remove the displaced stent. The clinical course of the patient was unremarkable. The cyst had significantly reduced and disappeared by 12 wk. We found that both endoscopic ultrasound and fluoroscopy should be used during endoscopic PPD to avoid stent displacement. The displaced stent can be successfully treated by endoscopic removal.
