Cross-sectional imaging and the role of positron emission tomography in pancreatic cancer evaluation. Pancreatic cancer is an extraordinarily morbid malignancy with a poor prognosis. As a result, it is imperative that imaging examinations correctly identify tumors when they are relatively small and potentially still resectable, as well as accurately stage tumors to determine which patients should undergo definitive surgery. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been established as the most important modality for both initial diagnosis and staging, although positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both play important ancillary roles. This review discusses how these three modalities play complementary roles in tumor diagnosis and staging.
