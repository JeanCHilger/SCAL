A case report of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy and RFA for liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer. A 71-year-old female patient was administered 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (GS therapy) for pancreatic body cancer, and underwent pancreatic body and tail resection. She was diagnosed as having T3N0M0, Stage III disease, and adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine was started. However, a solitary 9 mm liver metastasis was found using CT imaging 3 months after the operation. We started hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (GEM+5-FU), with additional treatment using RFA after 5 courses, and a CR was achieved. The HAI regimens were changed to GEM+S-1 and a further 18 courses were administered. After HAI, adjuvant chemotherapy (S-1) was continued, but 2 further liver metastases were found. The patient was still alive 4 years after surgery and continued to undergo radiation chemotherapy.
