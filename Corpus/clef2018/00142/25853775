Graft Kidney Torsion After Simultaneous Kidney-Pancreas Transplant: Report of 2 Cases and Literature Review. Torsion of an allograft kidney is an extremely rare and potentially reversible complication. Imaging diagnosis plays a crucial role because of the absence of specific clinical features. We report 2 cases in which kidney torsion after simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant was diagnosed by ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging/angiography and present a review of the relevant literature. Radiologists and clinicians should be aware of this entity because graft salvage depends on rapid diagnosis and surgical detorsion.
