Computed tomographic false diagnoses in acute pancreatitis. With computed tomography acute pancreatitis can be differentiated into an oedematous, serous-exudative, hemorrhagic-necrotizing, suppurative-abscessing and a postacute necrotizing form with high diagnostic accuracy (83.2%). Problems occur in distinguishing necrotizing from abscessing pancreatitis. False negative and false positive errors are less frequent in detecting necrosis and its differentiation from less serious forms (4.4% and 2.1%). Dynamic CT discovers also parenchyma losses not detectable without contrast medium and allows to prove subtotal or total necrosis in case of discrete changes in the native scans. Sonographic tomography contributes to diagnostics by proving acute necrotizing pancreatitis due to a chronic inflammatory pancreatic process.
