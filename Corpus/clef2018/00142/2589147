Traumatic pancreatic transection. Pancreatic contusion or transection may result from blunt or penetrating trauma. Considerable morbidity and mortality may occur if the injury is not diagnosed and treated promptly. Clinical diagnosis of pancreatic injury due to blunt trauma is difficult, because the symptoms are often delayed and nonspecific. Computed tomographic scanning is the method of choice for the diagnosis of pancreatic injury, although abdominal ultrasound may be particularly useful in children. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is used to assess ductal integrity.
