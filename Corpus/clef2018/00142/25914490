Air leak syndrome after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a rare and fatal complication. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a state of the art diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for various pancreatic and biliary problems. In spite of the well-established safety of the procedure, there is still a risk of complications such as pancreatitis, cholangitis, bleeding and perforation. Air leak syndrome has rarely been reported in association with ERCP and the optimal management of this serious condition can be difficult to establish. Our group successfully managed a case of air leak syndrome following ERCP which was caused by a 3cm Stapfer type I perforation in the posterolateral aspect of the second part of the duodenum and was repaired surgically. Hereby, we describe the presentation and subsequent therapeutic approach.
