Appendectomy followed by a pancreaticoduodenectomy: a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Increasing usage and improved quality of imaging has increased the probability of incidentalomas which raises the question of how to deal with them. The following case illustrates the incidental finding of a tumour on a CT-scan.A 23-year-old woman presented at our emergency department with acute abdominal pain. During the workup we found that in addition to an acute appendicitis, she had a tumour in the pancreas. Cytology initially indicated pancreatic carcinoma, however, further analysis showed a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. The patient underwent a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.A solid pseudopapillary neoplasm is a relatively rare disorder of the pancreas which is mostly seen in young females. It is a benign disorder carrying a small risk of malignant transformation. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is the treatment of choice for this benign tumour of the head of pancreas.
