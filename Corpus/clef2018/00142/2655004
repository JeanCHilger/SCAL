Gastrinomas: comparison of MR imaging with CT, angiography, and US. In this prospective study, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to localize gastrinoma in 24 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The results were confirmed by means of either surgery or percutaneous liver biopsy and compared with results of computed tomographic (CT) scanning, selective abdominal angiography, and abdominal ultrasound (US). For primary extrahepatic gastrinoma (intra-or extrapancreatic), MR imaging had a sensitivity of 20% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 11%. For metastatic gastrinoma in the liver, MR imaging had a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 81%. The ability of MR imaging to depict extrahepatic gastrinomas was directly related to tumor size no tumors smaller than 1 cm were detected, and 50% of tumors 3 cm or larger were detected. MR imaging was as effective as abdominal US but less effective than either CT scanning or selective abdominal angiography for the detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma. In seven patients with hepatic gastrinoma, three gastrinomas were detected with MR imaging and with abdominal US, while five were detected with CT scanning and with selective abdominal angiography. These results indicate that, at the present time, MR imaging is generally not useful in the initial attempt to localize gastrinomas.
