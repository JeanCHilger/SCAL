ERCP in the diagnosis of bilio-pancreatic pathology. Comparison with echography and CT. The authors have evaluated both sensitivity and specificity of ERCP in comparison with other imaging methods, such as US and CT, on the basis of a study of 63 patients with suspected pancreatobiliary pathologies. Our results show ERCP of chronic pancreatitis to have 83% sensitivity and 66% specificity. As for biliary pathologies, sensitivity was 94% and specificity 88%. In pancreatic pathologies, CT sensitivity was 99% and its specificity was 70%. The combined use of ERCP and CT determines a considerable rise in the percentages, and allows the evaluation of both the excretory tree and the parenchyma. As for biliary pathologies, the role of ERCP is fundamental, since its combination with the other methods (CT: sensitivity 72%, specificity 3.5% US: sensitivity 70%, specificity 3.5%) has not determined but a slight increase in sensitivity, and no significant increase in specificity.
