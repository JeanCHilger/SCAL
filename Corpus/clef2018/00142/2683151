Endoscopic sphincterotomy and endoscopic fulguration in the management of adenoma of the papilla of Vater. Adenoma of the papilla of Vater is a rare premalignant lesion usually treated by local surgical resection. Five patients with adenomas of the papilla, presenting with obstructive jaundice, underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy with reversal of hepatic biochemistry to normal. Thereafter, four patients underwent local surgical excision. The adenoma recurred in all four patients within six to 18 months after the operation. The recurrent adenomas were eradicated by diathermic fulguration through the endoscope and were not found during a 12 to 24 month follow-up period. Snare polypectomy was performed upon one patient (who refused surgical treatment) who had a flat, broad-based adenoma, with an incomplete resection of the adenoma. This patient had adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas develop 40 months later. We conclude that endoscopic sphincterotomy is effective for biliary decompression of adenoma of the papilla of Vater presenting with acute obstructive jaundice. Endoscopic snare polypectomy of the adenoma combined with fulguration may be used as an alternative to surgical treatment in high risk patients.
