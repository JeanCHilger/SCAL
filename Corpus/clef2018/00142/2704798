Intrahepatic periportal abnormal intensity on MR images: an indication of various hepatobiliary diseases. The frequency and degree of intrahepatic periportal abnormal intensity (PAI) on magnetic resonance images in patients with or without various hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases were analyzed. In 63 patients without hepatobiliary disease, except for a small metastatic liver tumor or cavernous hemangioma, no definite PAI was seen. Definite PAI was seen in all patients with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, and cholangiocellular carcinoma. It was also clearly seen in all four cases of malignant lymphadenopathy in the hepatoduodenal ligament, in one of two cases of acute hepatitis, and in four of 47 cases of liver cirrhosis. However, in patients with bile duct dilatation or with gallstone or pancreatic disease without obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, no definite PAI was seen. Histologic studies of the liver performed in 23 patients with definite PAI showed edema, ductular proliferation, dilatation of lymph vessels, and inflammatory cell infiltration in portal tracts. It is concluded that definite intrahepatic PAI is a useful sign that indicates the presence of biliary or diffuse hepatic disease.
