Diagnosis and treatment of adult polycystic kidney disease. A review of 20 polycystic kidney disease patients in admitted to Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital is herein reported. In this series 60% of the patients were in the fourth to sixth decades of life at the time of diagnosis. The average age was 50 years. The disease was generally more commonly found in the females than in male subjects. Flank pain and gross hematuria was the most common presenting symptom in these cases. In 70% of the patients hypertension were noted, besides 55% of patients have associated liver cysts and 9% of the patients have associated pancreatic cystic diseases. In a comparison of ultrasonography, CT scans, renal angiography, intravenous pyelography and retrograde pyelography in the evaluation of polycystic kidney disease, it was found that CT scans and ultrasonography had more than a 90 per cent diagnostic accuracy rate, while intravenous pyelography had only a 30 percent accuracy rate. Because of improved treatments such as antibiotic and hemodialysis techniques the five-year survival rate of patients, with polycystic kidney diseases, may be increased.
