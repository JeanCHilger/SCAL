Gantry tilt technique for CT-guided biopsy and drainage. An angled approach to percutaneous biopsy or drainage using CT guidance is often required to avoid transgressing vital intervening structures. We describe a simple technique for CT-guided angled biopsy. By tilting the CT gantry off the axial plane, CT scans can be obtained that directly demonstrate the appropriate angle of approach while avoiding intervening structures. The gantry tilt technique provides direct visualization of the pathway of the needle tract direct visualization is not possible with previously described techniques such as stereotactic biopsy or the triangulation technique. The gantry tilt technique is a practical, simple means for performing angled CT biopsy or aspiration in many cases.
