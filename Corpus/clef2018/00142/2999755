Insulinoma: diagnostic elements. 13 cases. The mean age of the 13 patients studied (9 women, 7 men) was 50.5 +/- 15.7 years. The disease was discovered on account of malaise (3 cases), behavioural disorders (4 cases), coma (3 cases), syncope (1 case) or right hemiparesis (1 case) or in the course of systematic examination (1 case). Eleven patients consulted for evaluation of hypoglycaemia and 2 for behavioural disorders. The history was characteristic, with malaise, loss of consciousness, severe neurological disorders (seizures, hemiparesis, hemiplegia or coma) and psychiatric disorders. These symptoms typically occurred in the morning before breakfast or between meals in 9 patients, and atypically at any point of time or after meals in 4 patients. Their hypoglycaemic nature was demonstrated by blood glucose determination in 11/13 cases and by response to ingestion of sugar in 12/13 cases. The mean period elapsed between the initial symptoms and the final diagnosis was 20.3 +/- 17.3 months. Inappropriate insulin secretion was elicited a.m. before breakfast, during Conn's diet or fasting test, or by calculating the blood insulin/glucose ratio or Turner's coefficient. Prior to surgery, the insulinoma was located by ultrasonography in 3/8 cases, by computerized tomography in 2/6 cases, by selective arteriography in 6/11 cases, and by phlebography with spleno-portal catheterization and staged sampling for insulin and C-peptide assays in 8/9 cases. Histological examination after surgery (11 cases) or necropsy (1 case) showed an adenoma without evidence of malignancy.
