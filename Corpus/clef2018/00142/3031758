Differential diagnosis of chronic peripancreatic pseudocysts on the computerized tomogram. Possibility of error and pitfalls. Cystic masses within the pancreas and in its neighbourhood are often really pseudocysts. In most cases, centrally necrotic solid tumours or genuine cystic neoplasms are easy to differentiate from such pseudocysts. They are in fact rare pathologic conditions. The exclusion of a pseudocyst is sometimes more difficult, especially in peripancreatic cystic masses. Computed tomography has significantly improved the diagnostics of the upper abdomen. Nevertheless, it sometimes creates new problems. This study is a selection of cases pointing to differential diagnostic difficulties that may become pitfalls for the examiner. An image-imminent approximative diagnosis is attempted. The importance of the localisation of these lesions and of the topographical anatomy of the upper abdomen are pointed out.
