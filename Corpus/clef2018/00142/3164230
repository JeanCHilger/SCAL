Small carcinoma of the pancreas. Clinical and pathologic evaluation of 17 patients. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of 17 small carcinomas (less than 2 cm in diameter) of the pancreas are reviewed in this article. All the tumors were located in the head of the pancreas, and the clue to the diagnosis was jaundice in ten patients and abdominal pain in seven. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 were not reliable markers for detecting small carcinomas of the pancreas. Ultrasonography (US), computerized tomography (CT), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were useful diagnostic tools. Lymph node metastases were found in 41% of affected patients, capsular invasion in 24%, retroperitoneal invasion in 24%, and portal system involvement in 29%. In five patients the carcinoma was Stage I in eight patients, Stage II
