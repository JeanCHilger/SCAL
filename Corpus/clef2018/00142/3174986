Pancreas divisum: thin-section CT. Twelve patients with known pancreas divisum underwent thin-section computed tomography (CT) to determine the capability of CT to depict this pancreatic anomaly. Focal pancreatic enlargement was present in five patients. Two distinct pancreatic moieties separated by a fat cleft were noted in three patients a fourth patient had focal atrophy in the distribution of the dorsal pancreas. The two pancreatic moieties were identified at the same craniocaudal level in all four of these patients. The dorsal duct was depicted in all 12 patients, while the short ventral duct was seen in only five of the 12 patients. Failure of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts to fuse was identified in all five patients in whom both ducts were seen. CT may not enable specific diagnosis of pancreas divisum in the majority of patients. If, however, distinct pancreatic moieties or unfused ductal systems are evident, the diagnosis may be confidently suggested.
