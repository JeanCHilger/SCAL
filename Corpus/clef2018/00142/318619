Computed tomography of the pancreas (author's transl). The computed tomography gives direct visualisation of the pancreas in a transverse section. Form, size, and changed consistency of the organ can be diagnosed. Being a non-invasive technique it does not stress the patient, and can be applied to the severly ill with acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis. Other indications are chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess, pseudo-cyst and cancer. The differential diagnosis of cancer, especially from chronic pancreatitis, may be difficult. Further methods of investigation such as arteriography or endoscopic retrograde pancreatography may also have to be used.
