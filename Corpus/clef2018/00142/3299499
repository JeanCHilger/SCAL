Gastric leiomyoblastoma: report of a case. The case of a 38-year-old man with an exogastric leiomyoblastoma is reported. CT and ultrasound examinations revealed a large mass in the left hypochondrium that had both solid and cystic components. These findings mimicked those of cystadenoma of the pancreas. Because of intraperitoneal hemorrhage in the preoperative course, emergency laparotomy was performed. A large tumor was found to arise from the greater curvature of the stomach. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically.
