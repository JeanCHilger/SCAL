Blunt injuries of the pancreas in children. Diagnostic and therapeutic approach apropos of 8 cases. From 1970 to 1985, eight severe blunt pancreatic traumas were admitted. There is significant difference in morbidity between early pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy (a mean hospital stay of 23 days, low loss of weight) and initial simple external pancreatic drainage with delayed partial pancreatectomy or pancreato-cystojejunostomy Roux-en-Y (mean hospital stay of 45 days, 24% loss of weight, one death two years later). Thus it seems essential to diagnose the pancreatic injury and particularly rupture of the pancreatic duct. Aiming to evaluate these lesions, biology, ultrasonography or computerized axial tomography proved insufficient. As a result, in the last two patients, an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed confirming total transection of the pancreatic duct, one case with fistula, the other with a contrast fluid stop. The surgical approach was guided by these X-ray findings and a distal pancreatectomy performed preserving spleen. The authors propose the following protocol: endoscopic pancreatography if an evident improvement in recent pancreatic injury is not obtained in 48 hours, or in the case of former complicated pancreatic trauma in the event of total rupture of pancreatic duct, operation should be carried out: abdominal exploration guided by the X-rays findings, distal pancreatectomy or, rarely, repair of the pancreatic duct
