Acute portal vein thrombosis. The findings in acute portal vein thrombosis in a patient with chronic calcific pancreatitis and two episodes of pancreatic surgery are described. The diagnosis was made by ultrasound, which showed a dilated portal vein filled with low-level echoes, surrounding hepatic oedema, hypertrophy of the hepatic artery, splenomegaly, collateral vessels and ascites. This was confirmed by computed tomography. The ultrasonic differences in appearance between acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis are discussed, in the context of portal hypertension. The diagnosis of acute portal vein thrombosis should be considered in patients in the appropriate situation who suffer a sudden clinical deterioration with right upper quadrant or abdominal pain. Ultrasound is recommended as the imaging modality of first choice because of the flexibility of its scanning plane and its real time and Doppler capabilities. Computed tomography is valuable in patients with an ileus or heavy pancreatic calcification and for its ability to demonstrate patent vessels on intravenous injection of contrast medium.
