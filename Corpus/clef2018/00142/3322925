Early treatment of biliary lithiasis in biliary pancreatitis. Since 1982, 38 consecutive patients with biliary pancreatitis were treated prospectively in order to prevent recurrent migration of gallstones. Removal of the stones was achieved by "early surgery" i. e. within the first week after admission or by endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with severe pancreatitis. Gallstones were visualized by ultrasonography in 31 patients (82 p. 100). Microlithiasis was present in 14 (37 p. 100) and was missed at ultrasonography in 7 patients. According to Ranson's prognostic signs, only 4 patients had 4 or more signs. These 4 patients and 2 additional patients aged more than 85 underwent urgent retrograde cholangiography and endoscopic sphincterotomy. No complications could be attributed to this technique. Among the 4 patients with severe pancreatitis, 3 developed an abscess which required delayed surgery without further complications. The 32 other patients underwent a biliary operation within the first week after admission. Common bile duct calculi were present in 14 patients being discovered by cholangioscopy in 6. One patient died after operation and one was reoperated on for a pseudocyst on day 40. No recurrent attack of pancreatitis was observed in either group. Our study suggests that slightly delayed biliary operation with cholangioscopy during the same hospitalization can be performed safety in patients with mild pancreatitis. In patients with severe attack and/or poor general condition, endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe technique and deserves wider consideration in the management of severe acute pancreatitis for which delayed drainage of pancreatic necrosis may occasionally be required.
