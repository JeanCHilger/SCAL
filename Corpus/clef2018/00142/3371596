Surgical treatment of Oddi's sphincter tumors. Apropos of 56 cases. The records of 56 patients operated upon for ampullary tumors were reviewed in order to determine the best way to diagnose and treat these tumors. Thirty six males and 20 females, 30 to 89 years old, were operated upon between October 1970 and October 1985. Eighty six p. 100 had jaundice and 21 p. 100, anemia. In recent years, ultrasonography, duodenoscopy and ERCP appeared to be the most useful tests for diagnosis. Mean size of the tumors was 2.3 cm (0.5 to 5 cm). Five tumors were benign (8.9 p. 100) and 51 were malignant. According to the classification of Martin, 5 were grade I: 10, grade II: 18, grade III: and 18, grade IV. The correct histologic diagnosis was obtained on biopsy specimens taken during endoscopy in 7 of 12 patients. Nine patients underwent palliative choledocoduodenostomies: only one is alive at 3 years 47 underwent resection of the tumor: 3 local excisions associated with sphincterotomy for small benign tumors, 6 ampullectomies (followed in 3 by a Whipple procedure for recurrence) and 41 Whipple procedures. After pancreatic resection, 3 patients died during hospital stay and 12 had reversible complications
