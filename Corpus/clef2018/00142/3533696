Intraoperative ultrasonic localization of a small pancreatic pseudocyst. Intraoperative pancreatic ultrasound can be useful to identify small masses or cysts that are not readily palpable at surgery. In our case, a small (2.0 cm diameter) pseudocyst was demonstrated preoperatively by ultrasound and computed tomography, but could not be palpated at surgery. Intraoperative ultrasound located and helped to guide needle aspiration of the pancreatic pseudocyst. Other indications for intraoperative pancreatic ultrasound are reviewed.
