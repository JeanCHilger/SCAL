Cancer of the pancreas: clinical outcome in 76 cases. A final diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was established in 76 consecutive patients during 4 years. The clinical outcome was evaluated retrospectively, as well as clinical presentation and its impact on the rate of resectability. Even though the diagnostic techniques showed a high sensitivity, only 18.4% of patients had a radical resection performed. In 77.6% of the cases a tissue diagnosis had been obtained. However, in only 1/5 of them was the tissue proof obtained preoperatively. This review confirms that the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer is poor, with slight advantages in the few resectable cases. Therefore, an earlier diagnosis should be attempted in high-risk symptomatic patients, selected by means of nonaggressive tests and evaluated by means of more accurate diagnostic techniques, when suitable.
