Percutaneous pancreatico-gastric drainage of a pseudocyst. Pancreatico-gastric drainage, guided by ultrasound and endoscopy, of pancreatic pseudocysts was performed in two patients. The cysts emptied into the stomach within 12 and 24 hours, respectively. After the drainage both patients developed leucocytosis and fever, which quickly subsided after antibiotic treatment. There were no further complications or recurrences.
