Incidentally discovered carcinoma of the pancreas: a potentially indolent lesion. As examples of unusually indolent behavior of pancreatic carcinoma, two cases are discussed in which the diagnosis was made serendipitously, without symptoms referable to the pancreas. In both cases dystrophic calcification was noted, and pleomorphic giant cells were aspirated from the tumor. In one case, the patient survived 2 yr after diagnosis, dying from unrelated causes. Findings from ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are discussed. Incidental discovery of a pancreatic carcinoma does not preclude a protracted asymptomatic course.
