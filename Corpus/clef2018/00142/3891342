CT and US findings in pancreatic ductal tumours. A report of an unusual case and review of the literature. Pancreatic cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas are rare tumours usually occurring in women. The first symptoms are pain, occasionally associated with a palpable tumour in the left upper quadrant, and in rare cases the clinical and laboratory findings are suggestive of a pseudocyst. US shows a cystic neoplasm with a wall enclosing several polypoid areas. CT allows the diagnosis of the type of septa within the cyst and shows the extension of the lesion and calcifications into the wall. It also permits the assessment of the probable pathological complications associated with the tumour therefore CT cannot differentiate cystadenoma from cystadenocarcinoma. The analysis of these different phenomena is based on one observation and a review of the literature.
