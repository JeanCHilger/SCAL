Dilute oral iron solutions as gastrointestinal contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging initial clinical experience. Delineation of the gastrointestinal tract in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a problem. Ferric ammonium citrate is paramagnetic, producing a high MRI signal intensity by virtue of its spin-lattice (T1) relaxation rate enhancement properties. Water is diamagnetic, producing a low MRI signal intensity, especially with short TR and TE times. To compare efficacy for gastrointestinal contrast alteration, ferric ammonium citrate was administered to 18 patients and water was given to 10 patients. Spin-echo imaging at 0.35T was performed after administration of these agents. Ferric ammonium citrate produced high signal intensity within the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small intestine that aided in the differentiation of the gastrointestinal tract from adjacent tumors, vessels, and viscera. Delineation of the gut wall was superior using ferric ammonium citrate compared to that produced by water. Delineation of the margins of the pancreas, liver, and kidney from adjacent gastrointestinal tract was also better with ferric ammonium citrate. Optimal distinction between bowel and fat was better with water. Longer TE times (75 to 200 ms) may allow improved contrast between gut and intrabdominal fat using ferric ammonium citrate.
