Marked hypervascularity and early arteriovenous shunting with portal vein filling in chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Angiography was performed in 2 patients with chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Marked hypervascularity and early arteriovenous shunting with portal vein filling were demonstrated. Increased capillary vessels in the thickened capsule due to inflammation were observed in the pathologic specimen. The angiographic findings we report here are quite similar to those of pancreatic arteriovenous malformation.
