A large retroperitoneal encapsulation of bile from a spontaneous perforation of the common bile duct. We report a patient with spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct. This is an extremely rare condition which produces free leakage of bile into the peritoneal cavity. There has been no previous report concerning the formation of a large retroperitoneal encapsulation of bile. The preoperative diagnosis in our patient was very difficult and endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography and cystography by ultrasound guidance were helpful.
