Aneurysms of the celiac trunk branches. Clinical study of 9 patients and review of the literature. During the period 1970-1983, nine patients presented with ten aneurysms of a branch of the coeliac trunk. An exact diagnosis, in these series, was based on a CT abdominal scanning with injection of contrast medium and on a selective visceral angiography. One patient with an inoperable pancreatic cancer was not submitted to surgery. Ligation of the alimentary artery of the aneurysm in the remaining 8 patients, had to be completed in three of them by a pancreatic resection. The non development of collateral hepatic circulation and the presence of segmental portal hypertension, necessitate an hepatic revascularisation (1 pat.) and splenectomy (2 pat.) in these series. Hospital mortality of all treated patients was nihil, the long term follow-up (5 years) excellent.
