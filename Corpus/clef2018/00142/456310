Ultrasonic diagnosis of abdominal diseases (author's transl). Ultrasonic examination is a modern method used to visualize intraabdominalorgans and pathological processes affecting their organisation. This method of examination is safe and gentle as regards the patient and suitable for estimation of extraluminar pathological conditions. The report concerns experiences gained with abdominal ultrasonography effected with Echoview VI Picker (Transducer 2,25 MHz, diameter 13 mm) at the department of internal medicine of the University Policlinic in Prague in 1975--1977. There was a total of 400 examinations of the abdominal cavity effected in 358 subjects. The principal indications for examination included a clinical finding or suspicion of a disease affecting the pancreas (180X), liver (79X), spleen (30X), gall-bladder (24X), kidney (21X), or undefined palpation findings in the abdomen (74X). In 41,75% of cases sonography confirmed the abdominal finding, in 44,75% of cases the finding was not confirmed, in 13,5% of cases the finding could not be estimated dependably. As the frequency of positive findings achieved by ultrasonic examination in pancreatic pseudocysts is high, we effect sonography in the instance of suspection of this affection prior to the planned endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography as orientation examination.
