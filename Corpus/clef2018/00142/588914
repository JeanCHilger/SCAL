Comparison of ultrasound and computer-assisted tomography in pancreatic diagnosis. In a series of patients suspected of having pancreatic disease both ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) were performed. The diagnosis has been confirmed in 50 patients. Computerized tomography visualized the pancreas in all 50 (100%) whereas ultrasound was successful in 40 patients (80%). The ultrasound failures were due to bowel gas anterior to the pancreas. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 84% for computerized tomography and 64% for ultrasound however, in those cases where ultrasound successfully detected the pancreas the diagnostic accuracy was 80%.
