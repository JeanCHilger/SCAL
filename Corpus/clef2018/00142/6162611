CT demonstration of pancreatic transection: a case report and comparison with other diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of blunt pancreatic trauma. A case of prevertebral pancreatic transection demonstrated by pre-operative computed tomography is presented. The dramatic demonstration of pancreatic transection in this case suggests that CT scanning should be considered among the first-line modalities in the evaluation of suspected pancreatic injuries. In addition, the value of other diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of this disorder is reviewed.
