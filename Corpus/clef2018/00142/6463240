Congenital hepatic artery aneurysm simulating pancreatic carcinoma. The authors report a case of a hepatic artery aneurysm that simulated a mass in the head of the pancreas. The correct diagnosis was made preoperatively based on several findings: curvilinear calcification within the mass on CT, a well-defined cystic collection on ultrasound, absence of biliary duct dilatation or jaundice, and presence of other aneurysms.
