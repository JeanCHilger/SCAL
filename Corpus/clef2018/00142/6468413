Fatty infiltration of the pancreas in Shwachman's syndrome: computed tomography demonstration. The authors report the case of three siblings with Shwachman's syndrome in whom computed tomography (C.T.) gave the diagnosis of fatty infiltration of the pancrease, by virtue of its specificity in identifying fat. The clinical and radiological features of Shwachman's syndrome as well as the differential diagnosis of fatty infiltration of the pancreas in childhood are reviewed.
