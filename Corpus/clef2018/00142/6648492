Ultrasound diagnosis following blunt abdominal injury in childhood. In blunt abdominal trauma in childhood, sonography should be the primary method for diagnostic imaging. This simple and non-invasive investigation can be readily performed even in cases with severe traumatic organ lesions. In cases not requiring immediate surgery the method can be used for monitoring and follow-up. Other diagnostic procedures such as IVP, CT, abdominal plain x-ray, angiography, scintigraphy do not become superfluous but should be used according to the clinical and sonographic findings.
