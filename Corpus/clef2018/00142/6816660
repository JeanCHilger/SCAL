Value of ultrasound and retrograde pancreatocholangiography in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. 26 patients with pancreatic disease were studied with ultrasound (US) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Results were compared in terms of selectivity, sensibility and specificity. In spite of similarity of both techniques regarding selectivity and sensibility, US appeared to be more specific. Combination of US and ERCP improved considerably the capacity to visualize the gland and to detect its alterations. Additional information obtained about the pancreas from the evaluation of bile ducts with both methods was considered careful and contributed to appraise even more these explorations.
