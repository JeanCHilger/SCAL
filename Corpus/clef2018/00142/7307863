Calcified pseudocyst of the pancreas. Pancreatic pseudocysts are encapsulated collections of fluid which may complicate trauma or inflammation of the pancreas. The correct preoperative diagnosis of the pseudocyst can be established easily by the modern techniques of ultrasonography or computed tomography (1-3). However, recognition of the lesion on plain radiographs of the abdomen is rarely possible because the wall and content of pancreatic pseudocysts do not show a visually perceptible difference in density from the adjacent soft tissues (4). This report concerns an exceptional instance whereby a pancreatic pseudocyst was clearly demarcated by virtue of radiographically detectable calcium deposits in its wall.
