Chronic pancreatitis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. A 46 year-old woman with a history of chronic pancreatitis, upper epigastric pain and upper gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin is presented. A haemoductal pancreatitis was the source of bleeding due to erosion of the splenic artery with bleeding into a pancreatic pseudocyst communicating with the pancreatic duct. This case was special, because there was no aneurysmal dilatation of the splenic artery. This rare entity must always be considered in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal haemorrhage of obscure origin. The appropriate investigation to confirm the diagnosis is visceral angiography, if necessary followed by CT-scan of the abdomen.
