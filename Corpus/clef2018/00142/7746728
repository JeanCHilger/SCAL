Enhanced delineation of the pancreatic duct in MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) with a combined use of secretin. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a method that can depict the main pancreatic duct non-invasively however, its tendency to overestimate ductal stenosis is being noted. The authors used secretin to stimulate the output of pancreatic juice, which increased the signal of the main pancreatic duct and consequently minimized the occurrence of pseudostenosis artifacts in MRCP. MRCP images of 54 patients suspected of having pancreatic disease were visually evaluated by two observers before and after administration of secretin (1 clinical unit/kg). Improved delineation of the main pancreatic duct (68.5-59.3%, p < 0.05) and its side branches (40.7-29.6%, p < 0.05) was obtained with good interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.71-0.68).
