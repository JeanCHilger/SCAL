Abdominal lymphangioma masquerading as a pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Lymphangiomas are congenital abnormalities of the lymphatics that occur predominantly in the head and neck, most often in children. We present an unusual case of a middle-aged man who had a large septated cystic lesion adherent to the pancreas that could not be differentiated from a pancreatic cystic neoplasm despite analysis by ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or percutaneous needle aspiration. The correct diagnosis was established only via laparotomy and subsequent pathologic interpretation. Although lymphangiomas are rare, they should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms.
