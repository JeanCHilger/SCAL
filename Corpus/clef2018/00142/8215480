Efficacy of the treatment of gastric cancer as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of 48 hour continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with leucovorin (LV). A 51-year-old female with inoperable gastric cancer and with infiltration of pancreatic tail diagnosed by abdominal CT was treated with leucovorin (LV) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The regimen was: LV 30 mg/body/24 hr prior to 5-FU 1,000 mg/m2/day for 48 hrs. This treatment was repeated 6 times. After treatment, the size of tumor decreased so that the patient was able to be operated (Total gastrectomy with partial distal pancreatico-splenectomy). During the treatment, patient showed no side effect except for slight nausea. This neo-adjuvant chemotherapy might be a recommendable treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
