Infected pancreatic necrosis. Reexaminations planned with locoregional anesthesia. Eleven patients with infected pancreatic necrosis are presented. They were treated with necrosectomy and lavage with programmed reexploration and peridural anesthesia. Nine of these patients, had biliary stone disease as associated pathology and two were chronic alcoholics. We used the contrast computerized tomography and CT-guided percutaneous aspiration to obtain fluid for Gram stains and culture, as a diagnostic method. The patients were reoperated 3 to 5 times each 48-72 hs., with a mortality of 18.2%.
