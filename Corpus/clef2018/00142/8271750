Radiologic localization of pancreatic insulinoma. Thirty-one patients with insulinoma of the pancreas verified during operation were examined. The localization of the tumor was detected by ultrasonic examination in 9.7%, by X-ray computed tomography in 38.9%, by angiographic study in 32.1%, and by endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography in 11.1% of cases. Complex use of the methods allowed the localization of the tumor to be determined in 48.4% of cases. The smallest diameter of insulinoma diagnosed during ultrasonic examination and endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography was 1.5 cm, X-ray computed tomography and angiography demonstrated tumors measuring 1.0 cm in diameter. The diagnostic efficacy of the methods increases when the tumor is located in the body and tail of the pancreas. The examination scheme for patients with suspected insulinoma must include ultrasonic study and X-ray computed tomography when their results are negative angiography must be resorted to.
