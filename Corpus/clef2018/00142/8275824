Evaluation of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. 155 cases of chronic pancreatitis in PUMC hospital from 1952 to 1990 were investigated. Because endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and exocrine pancreatic function tests have been used since 1974, the diagnostic rate of chronic pancreatitis during 1974-1990 is 6.6 fold as that during 1952-1974. The pancreatic duct in 97 cases among 105 cases with chronic pancreatitis examined by ERCP was compared with CT and ultrasonography in diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. The accuracy of diagnosis for ERCP is 84.8%, and is significantly higher than that for CT (56.0%, P < 0.01) and ultrasonography (37.8%, P < 0.001). The detective rate of abnormal pancreatic duct for ERCP is 91.4%, and is also significantly higher than that for CT (80.0%) and ultrasonography (79.7%, P < 0.05). These data indicated that the clinical features of chronic pancreatitis in China is more related to biliary diseases, rather than alcoholism. BT-PABA test and ultrasonography are valuable screen examinations, and ERCP is credible important examination in diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
