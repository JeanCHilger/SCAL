Imaging of the portacaval space. The portacaval space is a relatively narrow region between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava that is usually well seen on cross-sectional abdominal imaging studies [1]. Various structures, including normal anatomic variants and extension of diseases from adjacent organs, can be detected within this space [1-3]. An awareness of the types of normal and abnormal structures can prevent misinterpretation and aid in evaluating the spread of malignant diseases. We describe the appearances of these entities within the portacaval space on several types of images.
