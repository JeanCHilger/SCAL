Breath hold MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) using long echo train length fast spin echo sequence in combination with surface coil. To test the feasibility of MR cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) using long echo train length (32) fast spin echo sequence in combination with shoulder surface coil, 20 patients who had had ERCP were examined. Good correlations were acquired between the findings obtained by two modalities in terms of ductal strictures, dilatations and intraductal lesions. MRCP was considered to be an examination of choice in various kinds of pathologies affecting biliary duct as well as pancreatic duct for its non-invasiveness and reasonable image quality.
