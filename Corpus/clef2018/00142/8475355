Imaging in blunt abdominal trauma. Sonography has largely replaced peritoneal lavage in the initial evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. Computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice for further evaluation of hemodynamically stable patients. It can be used effectively to visualize multiple injuries in various anatomic regions in one single study. CT is particularly helpful in detecting intra- or retroperitoneal hemorrhage and in defining the extent of injuries to the spleen, the liver, and the kidneys. Traumatic injuries to the pancreas, bowel, and mesentery can be assessed. Angiography plays a major role in the diagnosis and therapeutic embolization of exsanguinating hemorrhage associated with pelvic fractures.
