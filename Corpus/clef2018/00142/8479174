Arterial hemorrhage complicating pancreatic pseudocysts: role of angiography. Major arterial hemorrhage associated with pancreatic pseudocysts represents a formidable complication with high mortality rates. This study was undertaken to analyze presentation and outcome and to assess the role of angiography in diagnosis and management of this complication. A retrospective review of 180 patients referred for surgical management of pancreatic pseudocysts from 1964 to 1991 identified 13 patients (7.2%) with arterial hemorrhage. Eight patients presented with intracystic hemorrhage, 4 with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and 1 with intra-abdominal bleeding. Six patients had gastroduodenal artery bleeding, 4 splenic, and 1 each left gastric, right colic, and left gastroepiploic. The site of bleeding was identified with selective visceral angiography in 9 patients evidence of pseudocyst bleeding was seen in 5 of 7 patients who had contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scans. Angiographic embolization for control of hemorrhage was used in 6 patients and operative control in 7. Over the past decade, bleeding has been controlled with angiographic embolization in all patients except 1 with massive bleeding due to splenic artery erosion. Average blood loss was less in patients treated with angiographic embolization (6.8 vs 17.5 units, packed red cells, P < .05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The sole mortality was a patient with cirrhosis treated in 1969. Clinical presentation of pseudocyst bleeding is variable
