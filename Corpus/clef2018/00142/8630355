MRI of the pancreas: value of standard versus fat-suppressed pulse sequence at 0.5 T. To compare five pulse sequences in 60 patients with pancreatic disease by means of MRI at 0.5 T.T1 weighted Spin-Echo sequences (T1W SE) before and after i.v. contrast medium administration, fat-suppressed T1W SE sequences after i.v. contrast medium administration, T2 weighted Turbo-Spin-Echo sequences (T2W TSE), and fat-suppressed T2W TSE were evaluated within an ROC study.The standard sequences (T1W SE before and after i.v. contrast medium administration, T2W TSE) were superior to the fat-suppressed T1W and T2W (T)SE sequences in delineating the anatomy and for correct diagnosis. The T1W sequence with and without i.v. contrast media detected all anatomic structures best. In most instances the correct diagnosis and coexistent findings in the diseased pancreas were obtained with the T2W sequence.Fat-suppressed sequences are less useful in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease by MRI at medium field strength compared to the standard sequences.
