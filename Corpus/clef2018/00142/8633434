Current status of MR cholangiopancreatography. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an exciting new application of MR imaging that combines the advantages of projectional and cross-sectional imaging techniques. The technique of MRCP is in its infancy, and it is not yet known whether it will replace traditional techniques such as diagnostic ERCP or remain an adjunctive diagnostic tool. This article critically reviews the various techniques advocated for MRCP and discusses the potential role of MRCP in evaluating the pathology of the biliary tract and pancreas.
