Inflammatory pseudotumor of the pancreas. We describe a rare example of inflammatory pseudotumor of the pancreas in a 42-yr-old woman, which developed following chemotherapy for lymphoma of the uterine cervix. The patient had developed fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, and anemia abdominal CT scan showed a large mass in the pancreas. Examination of the resected specimen revealed a fleshy, well-circumscribed, 7-cm mass. Histologically, there was a hypocellular to moderately hypercellular, bland spindle-cell proliferation admixed with a prominent infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. The spindle cells were vimentin positive but negative for muscle markers
