Kidney cancer and pancreatic metastases. Report of 3 cases. Simultaneous or secondary pancreatic metastases of primary renal cancer are exceptional and usually delayed. The clinical signs of symptomatic lesions are varied and nonspecific. Computed tomography allows complete investigation and CT angiography visualizes typical hypervascularization, which can be correlated to angiographic examinations. In the light of 3 cases treated surgically with a significant clinical follow-up, the authors review the data of the literature.
