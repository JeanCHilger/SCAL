MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at 0.5 T: technique optimisation and preliminary results. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at 0.5 T. To our knowledge no previous studies of MRCP have been performed at mid-field strength. Thirty-one patients with dilated biliary systems were examined with three-dimensional MRCP. All patients were studied with a 0.5 T superconducting magnet. A three-dimensional turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence was acquired (TR = 5000 ms, TE = 244 ms, echo train length = 45 acquisition time = 14 min 10 s). Coronal images were post-processed with the MIP algorithm. Recently, the parameters have been optimised (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 700 ms, echo train length = 128), reducing the acquisition time to 3 min. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 26 cases
