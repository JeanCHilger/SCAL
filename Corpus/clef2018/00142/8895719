Sarcoidosis of the pancreas: a case report. Sarcoidosis involving the pancreas is quite rare, having been reported only 10 times in the English language literature. Its clinical presentation is often similar to pancreatic cancer, with common presenting symptoms including abdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, and anorexia. Diagnosis has been made in all cases at laparotomy, and in the majority of cases, no previous history of sarcoidosis was reported. Treatment has ranged from observation to pancreaticoduodenectomy for suspected malignancy. Prognosis is favorable with no significant morbidity or mortality reported postoperatively. The case we report is that of a patient with a prior history of sarcoidosis who presented with a clinical picture suggestive of pancreatic malignancy. However, the patient was found to have sarcoidosis involving the pancreas, with no evidence of malignancy at laparotomy.
