Acute pancreatitis masquerading as testicular torsion. A 40-year-old man presented with fat necrosis of scrotum as the complication of acute pancreatitis. Excessive fluid accumulation in the pancreas and the extrapancreatic spaces, including around the spermatic cord, was seen on computed tomography. Surgical specimen showed typical fat necrosis of tunica vaginalis and the spermatic cord. After the surgery, pain of the testicle subsided completely, without recurrence. From the clinical presentation alone, it had been difficult to differentiate this patient's condition from torsion of the spermatic cord.
