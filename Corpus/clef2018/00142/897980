Evaluation of cholestatic jaundice by computed tomography. Computed tomography of the abdomen can aid the clinician in distinguishing intrahepatic from extrahepatic causes of jaundice. Hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease may be clearly defined. The timing and selection of further diagnostic and surgical procedures can be guided by computed tomography and unnecessary operations and prolonged hospitalization can be reduced. Computed tomography of the abdomen should not be used as a screening procedure but should be used after simpler techniques fail to establish a definitive diagnosis.
