CT diagnosis of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the pancreas in comparison with histopathologic findings. The existence of excrescent nodules in the cystic component of intraductal papillary neoplasms (IPN) on computed tomography (CT) is useful for differentiating between malignant and benign lesions.We sought to evaluate the ability of CT to differentiate malignant from benign lesions in IPN of the pancreas.CT findings in 20 cases of IPN (11 benign and 9 malignant lesions) were compared with histopathological findings from subsequent surgery.The size of the cystic portion on CT did not correlate with the malignant potential of the lesion. Seven (78%) of 9 malignant lesions had excrescent nodules on CT, whereas 1 (9%) of 11 benign lesions did.
