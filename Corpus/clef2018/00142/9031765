Gastric duplication cyst. Scintigraphy and correlative imaging. Gastric duplication cysts are uncommon congenital anomalies, and examples imaged with scintigraphy are rarely reported in the literature. The authors report an infant with duplication of the stomach, which was extensively evaluated using scintigraphy, ultrasound, computed tomography, and upper gastrointestinal series. The role of multimodality imaging is discussed, and correlative surgical and histologic findings are presented.
