A rare cause of obstructive jaundice: peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm. We report the case of a 54-year-old-man with alcoholic calcified chronic pancreatitis complicated by jaundice and abdominal pain. Investigations (Doppler ultrasonography examination and computed tomography scan) showed peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm of the posterior and inferior pancreatico-duodenal artery and a dilatation of the common bile duct. Selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm resulted in rapid regression of both jaundice and abdominal pain. Common bile diet compression is a rare complication of peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm. Selective embolization seems to be the first line treatment in this indication.
