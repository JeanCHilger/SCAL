Solid papillary tumor of the pancreas. A clinical case. The solid papillary tumor of the pancreas is a relative rare neoplasm that often is unknown because of its diagnostic difficulties. It is frequent in young women. It has no typical clinical signs, sometimes produces abdominal mass, sometimes is found casually during investigations for other diseases. Instead the prognosis of this tumor is more typical: long-term survival is good. The natural history of the solid papillary is the same as neoplasm with a low malignancy potential. For this reason, it's important to make up a differential diagnosis between it and the other pancreatic tumors. Unlike the other malignancies, surgical conservative therapy is enough without making great demolitions of the pancreas. Lumpectomy gives a complete cure, decreasing surgical risk and dangerous functional complications. In the present paper, a case of solid papillary tumour of the pancreas is reported. It was diagnosed in a young woman and treated with simple lumpectomy. She is alive and disease free.
