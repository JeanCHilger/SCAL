Cysto-ileal diversion by Y loop of a compressive pseudocyst after segmental pancreatic transplantation. We report the case of a young female patient who underwent dual segmentary pancreatic and renal transplantation in May 1990. The immediate post-operative course was marked by the peri pancreatic collections normally noted with this technique. However, a peculiarity was a long-lasting pseudocyst of the grafted tissue which could not be drained externally despite several attempts. This was compressing the splenic vein of the tissue, thereby causing a reflux. Fear of losing tissue functionality led us four and a half years later to perform an internal cysto-ileal derivation on a bowel loop. In this way, normal endocrine function of the pancreatic graft tissue has now been maintained for over a year.
