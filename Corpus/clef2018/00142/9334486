Endoscopic therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer. Minimally invasive surgery. We report a 70 years old male with an advanced pancreatic carcinoma who was admitted to the hospital due to vomiting, progressive jaundice and severe itching. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an extrinsic duodenal compression and the abdominal ultrasound, a dilated biliary tract. During an endoscopic retrograde pancreatography a papilotomy was performed and a 7 F biliary stent was installed. Also, an endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy was done, installing a jejunostomy. These procedures allowed a better quality of life in this patient.
