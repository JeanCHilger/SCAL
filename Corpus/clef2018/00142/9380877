The use of spiral computerized tomography in the study of pancreatic insulinoma: preliminary results. Insulinomas are usually benign tumors originating in the pancreatic islets: since they are biologically active tumors, insulinomas present at clinics with hypoglycemia caused by increased insulin production. We examined 7 patients with clinically suspected insulinomas with spiral CT to investigate its capabilities in identifying and characterizing this type of lesion. Four patients had abnormal spiral CT findings (true positives) the diagnosis was confirmed at surgery in 3 patients and at instrumental follow-up in the other. The tumors were 12.2 mm in average diameter. CT showed no tumor mass in 3 cases, which was confirmed at angiography and MRI (true negatives). We observed a typical contrast pattern in 50% of cases, namely a ring-like enhancement changing into homogeneous enhancement. Multiplanar and 3D reconstructions were not necessary for lesion identification, but we used them for regional vascular mapping. In our experience, which is limited to few cases and dose not allow any statistically significant conclusion, spiral CT exhibited high sensitivity in the detection and characterization of pancreatic insulinomas which permits to reduce the resort to more invasive angiographic techniques.
