Cholangiopancreatography with magnetic resonance in the assessment of pancreatic ducts. We investigated MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings in patients with pancreatic conditions, which are mainly diagnosed based on US and CT morphologic findings. Sixty-three patients were submitted to MRCP using a .5T magnet. MRCP was performed with non-breath-hold fat-suppressed 3D turbo spin echo sequences (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 700 ms, ETL = 128, NEX = 6) with 3 min acquisition time. For better depiction of Wirsung duct and secondary ducts in the last 11 patients, a high resolution technique with a 128 x 256 matrix, 8 NEX and 8 min 36 s acquisition time was developed. MRCP images were studied both on MIP reconstructions and on single slices as well as T1- and T2-weighted TSE axial images. The diagnosis was compared with endoscopy, percutaneous procedure or CT findings in all cases. A hypointense focal mass was observed on T1-weighted TSE images in 39 pancreatic carcinoma patients (100%) and parenchymal atrophy was shown in 13 patients (33%) a sudden obstruction of the Wirsung duct was observed in 16 cases (41%) with homogeneous dilatation in 11 cases (28%). A tapered appearance of the distal Wirsung duct was demonstrated in 19 chronic pancreatitis patients, with diffuse patchy signal changes in 12 patients (63%)
