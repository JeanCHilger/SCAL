Incorrect estimation of severity of acute pancreatitis by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. In acute pancreatitis, contrast-enhanced CT is widely accepted to give reliable information in the early assessment of severity. This study critically evaluates the clinical data, outcome, and CE-CT findings in patients with incorrect radiological estimation of the severity of the condition.All patients suspected of having severe pancreatitis underwent contrast-enhanced CT. Clinical data and CE-CT findings of 341 patients were re-examined.In 28 patients (8.2%) the radiological diagnosis was inconsistent with the clinical findings. The most common reason--in 20 of the 28 patients (71.4%)--for failure to estimate the severity of pancreatitis was partial necrosis of the gland. In severe cases the partial necrosis was overlooked in nine patients (32.1%). In mild cases clinical significance of partial necrosis--overestimated as representative for the whole gland and technical failure both explained the incorrect interpretation in six (21.4%) patients and in five patients (17.9%) intermediate patchy enhancement was incorrectly regarded as low. The misleading estimation remained inexplicable in only two (7.1%) patients. These results emphasize adequate assessment of CE-CT and inclusion of all areas of the pancreas in the estimation of enhancement.
