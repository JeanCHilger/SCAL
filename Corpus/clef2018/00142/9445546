Mucin-hypersecretory pancreatic tumors: a pathology with defined characteristics. We report a case of a mucin-producing tumor of the pancreas, a rare neoplasm of which only a few cases have been described in Europe. The finding of progressive hyperamylasemia without abdominal pain suggests the presence of this type of tumor. At endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), mucinous excretion and ductal dilation were found. Its prognosis is better than adenocarcinoma.
