Multiple pancreatic masses associated with autoimmunity. A 59-year-old woman was detected to have a high titer of serum gamma-globulin, positive antinuclear antibody and multiple pancreatic masses. In the course of 1 yr, Sjögren's syndrome developed, and her pancreatic masses spread diffusely and compressed the main pancreatic duct. A pancreatic biopsy by an exploration of the abdomen showed that many CD4 positive T-lymphocytes had infiltrated to the ducts and acinar cells expressing HLA-DR antigens. This suggested a diagnosis of autoimmune-related pancreatitis. She was treated with oral prednisolone, and a marked improvement of the above abnormal findings followed. In this report, a case of autoimmune-related multiple pancreatic masses associated with Sjögren's syndrome is presented, and a possible mechanism is discussed.
