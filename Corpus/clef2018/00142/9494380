Recurrent acute pancreatitis caused by ampullar intestinal duplication filled with calculi. Anatomical anomalies are recognised but rare causes of acute pancreatitis. We report a case or a 33-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis associated with a ampullar intestinal duplication.This patient was clinically studied, and a barium contrast study of the duodenum showed a filling defect in the second part of the duodenum, that was thought to be a periampullary lipoma. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was scheduled, but cannulation of the papillary orifice failed.Laparotomy and surgical resection of the lesion were performed. Pathological study of the specimen revealed a duodenal duplication filled with multiple calculi.This entity should be considered among the lesions that can cause recurrent acute pancreatitis.
