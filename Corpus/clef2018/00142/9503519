Magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas and biliary tree. MRI of the pancreas and bile ducts is becoming more widely used due to recent advances in surface coils, breath-hold imaging techniques, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRI provides a comprehensive and accurate examination for the detection, staging, and characterization of a variety of developmental, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes that involve the pancreas.
