Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: combination of MR imaging, MR angiography and MR cholangiopancreatography for the diagnosis and assessment of resectability. The purpose of this study was to determine the possibility of integrating MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and MR angiography (MRA) to conventional MR images in the diagnosis and assessment of resectability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Twenty-three patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were prospectively examined with MR. Conventional MR images were acquired in all patients. Three-dimensional MRCP and MRA images were acquired in all patients with suspected biliary and vascular involvement. Acquisition time was less than 45 min in all cases. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists, with final reading decided by consensus among readers. Diagnosis was confirmed with surgery in 16 patients and with percutaneous biopsy in 7. Concordance among readers was high with a kappa value of 0.83. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was observed in all patients. Correct assessment of unresectability due to vascular involvement was found in 22 of 23 patients. Biliary obstruction was evident in 13 patients, involving the biliary and pancreatic ducts in 9 and the biliary ducts only in 4. Technical advances permit extensive use of MRI in the evaluation of abdominal pathologies. The combination of MR imaging, MRCP, and MRA can provide sufficient information for the diagnosis and assessment of resectability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which otherwise would require three different exams.
