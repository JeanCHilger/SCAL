The latest in ultrasound: three-dimensional imaging. Part 1. The state-of-the-art of three-dimensional ultrasound is reviewed to evaluate technological achievements and future possibilities in diagnosis and in the follow-up of medical or invasive therapy.The problems related to volumetric acquisitions in the tissues of interest to provide three-dimensional images are considered. Three-dimensional images are easier to achieve with computed tomography because the scanning system of this technique is automatic and thus provides sequential slices. The same is true for magnetic resonance imaging which can aquire volumes directly. The problem with ultrasound lies in the fact that the scans are manual and therefore less precise. To obtain three-dimensional images these devices are commonly used: manual scanning probes connected to spatial magnetic evidencers with remote processing manual scanning probes connected to spatial magnetic evidencers placed on the patient's examination table with processing internal to the ultrasound unitNearly all the papers about three-dimensional ultrasound are works in progress because the technique has not been standardized yet and some of its future diagnostic possiblities are difficult to foresee. Moreover, 'matrix' probes are still in the experimental stage. Nevertheless, this technique seems to be able to yield the best results in: fetal malformations calculating the volumes of normal and diseased organs
