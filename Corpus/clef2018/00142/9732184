Imaging techniques in the evaluation of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a highly malignant neoplasm that presents late and carries a dismal prognosis. Despite technical advances, the various imaging modalities used to evaluate and stage a pancreatic adenocarcinoma have not had a significant impact on survival rates. This article describes the various imaging modalities used to image and stage an adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and reviews their relative accuracy and limitations in diagnosing and staging this carcinoma. We conclude that for appropriate staging of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, the combination of a computed axial tomography scan and an endoscopic ultrasound represents an efficient and cost-effective approach.
