Pancreatic trauma in patients with pancreatobiliary anomaly. One patient with a choledochal cyst and anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction had pancreatic transection causing bile peritonitis. Intraoperative cholangiopancreatography revealed this anomaly. In another patient with pancreas divisum, cannulation of the minor papilla (ERCP) demonstrated focal stenosis of the dorsal pancreatic duct, corresponding to the site of the minor laceration. The possibility of a coexisting pancreatobiliary anomaly should be considered in the diagnosis of pancreatic trauma, particularly in terms of the interpretation of pancreatograms.
