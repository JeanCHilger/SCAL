Management of the pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma: report of four resected cases. The pancreas is an uncommon site for metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. In most cases, pancreatic metastases occur as part of widespread nodal and visceral involvement, and there is thus evidence of metastatic disease elsewhere in the body. We present 4 cases with resectable pancreatic metastases arising from renal cell tumors without involvement of the regional lymph nodes at the operation. Three cases out of 4 were asymptomatic and the pancreatic metastases were detected by routine follow-up examination of renal cell carcinoma. Aggressive surgical treatment for the solitary metastatic lesion is advocated. Spread of renal cell carcinoma to the pancreas is, however, via the hematogenous route, and even solitary pancreatic metastasis may be one of the manifestations of the systemic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma. No pancreatic regional lymph nodes metastases were noted. Pancreatectomy should be undertaken to remove the tumor with adequate resection margins while preserving as much of the gland as possible. The prognosis of pancreatic metastases arising from a renal cell carcinoma is discussed with a review of the literature. Adjuvant chemo- and endocrine therapy should also be considered in these cases.
