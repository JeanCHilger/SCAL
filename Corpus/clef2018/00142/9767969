Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Diagnosis and evaluation. Pain, jaundice, or weight loss are the presenting features of 90% of the cases. Patients with tumors of the body or the tail of the pancreas do not rapidly develop jaundice. Therefore, their diagnosis is delayed and metastasis are more frequently detected at diagnosis.The diagnosis may be established by ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography and most importantly by CT scan with helicoidal continuous acquisition and contrast injection. However, these methods do not efficiently detect tumors smaller than 2 cm or with only superficial peritoneal involvement. Laparoscopy and angiography are used less and less frequently to evaluate resectability. The diagnostic work-up with CT scanning is able to anticipate resectability in 50 to 90% of the cases.Histopathology must be obtained since 10% of the pancreatic carcinoma are not of the ductal type and not all pancreatic tumors are malignant. When a pathological specimen cannot be obtained during surgery, a cytology specimen may be obtained with a fine needle guided by CT scan.Survival depends on the possibility of a complete resection of the tumor. If complete resection is obtained, the prognostic factors are in decreasing importance: tumor size, lymphatic and vascular involvement, and invasion of peri-pancreatic tissues.
