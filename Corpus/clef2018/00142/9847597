PSIF/CE-FAST (fast gradient echo) and TSE (turbo spin echo). Imaging techniques of PSIF/CE-FAST (fast gradient echo) and TSE (turbo spin echo) are described. PSIF/CE-FAST is a mirror imaged FISP (fast imaging with steady state precession) technique which is applied to MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for the first time. However, it has been replaced by TSE technique because of poor resolution and motion artifacts. TSE is a fast imaging technique using multiecho method, which enables us to obtain high resolution MRCP with heavily T2-weighted images. MRCP using TSE shows high signal to noise ratio with minimal motion artifacts. Recently, breath-hold single shot fast imaging techniques within a few seconds or respiratory triggered TSE are applied to MRCP and shows higher resolution for pancreatobiliary ducts system.
