Evaluation of MRCP compared to ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic duct. Recently, Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is developed as a noninvasive diagnostic modality in the diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic tract. Using Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as the gold standard, we evaluated the diagnostic quality of MRCP and direct cholangiography. Fifty-six patients (9 cases of cholangiocarcinoma, 5 of gallbladder carcinoma, 1 of gallbladder carcinoma and anomalous arrangement of pancreaticobiliary ductal system, 4 of cholecystlithiasis, 3 of papillary carcinoma, 1 of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder, 1 of primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 of hepatolithiasis and postoperative bile duct stricture, 4 of mucin producing pancreatic tumor, 13 of pancreatic carcinoma, 1 of chronic pancreatitis and pancreas divisum, 9 of chronic pancreatitis, and 1 of chronic pancreatitis and biliary stricture) are studied prospectively with MRCP and direct cholangiography (included ERCP and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography). The image of MRCP accorded with direct cholangiography in twenty-two of 27 patients with biliary tract disease, and in sixteen of 29 patients with pancreatic disease. The different diagnosis is observed in ten of 56 patients. In cases of not visualized gallbladder, pancreatic cyst without communicated to the pancreatic duct, and pre-stenotic dilatation of biliary and pancreatic duct, the image of MRCP was better than that of ERCP. However, the image of MRCP for the diagnosis of either benign or malignant strictures, mucin producing pancreatic tumor, and a branch of pancreatic duct in patients with pancreatic carcinoma were not suitable for evaluation than that of ERCP. In our study, ERCP is superior to MRCP due to the important information for diagnosis such as mentioned above. Therefore we advocate using ERCP as the first diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic duct.
