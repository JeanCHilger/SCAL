MR cholangiopancreatography of pancreas divism and anomalous arrangement of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for pancreas divism and anomalous arrangement of pancreaticobiliary ducts (APBD). In 214 patients, MRCP was performed. In 204 patients (94%), pancreaticobiliary ductal junction could be recognized. Pancreas divism was observed in 13 of 204 patients (6%), and APBD was observed in 10 of 204 patients (5%). Dynamic MRCP after secretin stimulation was useful for diagnosing pancreas divism and APBD.
