Cystic lesions of the pancreas. The number of the literature and classification of the cystic pancreatic diseases is increasing recently. We describe MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings of the cystic pancreatic diseases according to the clinical oriented classification. Intraductal papillary tumor, mucinous cystadenoma and serous cystadenoma showed characteristic MRCP findings. However small non-neoplastic true cysts are difficult to differentiate from cystic tumors even by MRCP.
