Unusual case of disseminated sarcoidosis with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms. A 63-year-old man had for 10 months suffered from marked weight loss, night sweats, diffuse abdominal pain and increased stool frequency. He was admitted to evaluate an ultrasonically abnormal focus in the liver parenchyma and elevated liver function parameters. His sclerae were obviously icteric and he looked under-weight.He had a hypochromic microcytic anemia and abnormal liver and pancreatic function tests: total bilirubin 3.11 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 2.21 mg/dl, GOT21U/l, gamma-GT 422 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 1449 U/l, alpha-amylase 481 U/l, lipase 2827 U/l. The serum creatinine level was elevated to 1.47 mg/dl. Computed tomography revealed enlarged liver and spleen as well as an enlargement of intraabdominal lymph nodes, chest radiogram and endoscopic cholangio-pancreatography were unremarkable. Biopsies from the lower duodenum, large intestine, bone marrow and liver showed inflammatory changes with Langhans-type mononuclear granulomas. Together with these findings an increased activity of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) indicated sarcoidosis, other causes having been excluded.All signs and symptoms rapidly improved under prednisolone, and 4 weeks after begin of treatment the biochemical abnormalities had clearly regressed. The raised serum levels of soluble IL-2 receptors and of neopterin, measures of sarcoidosis activity, had decreased. Activity of ACE had fallen.Sarcoidosis can present with diverse clinical signs and symptoms. In a case of multi-system disease that cannot be readily classified, sarcoidosis should be included in the differential diagnosis.
