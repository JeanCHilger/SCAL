The use of computed X-ray tomography for assessing the local spread and lymphogenic metastasis of stomach cancer. The results of application of computer tomography (CT) in 118 patients with gastric cancer were analyzed. The method accuracy in estimation of the cancer in gastric wall spread constitutes 0.98, sensitivity--0.94, and the specificity--0.99. The method accuracy in revealing of the tumor invasion in retroperitoneal space and diaphragmatic crura constitutes 1.0, in liver--0.99, in splenic hilus--0.98, in colon transversum--0.96, in pancreas--0.94. Differential diagnosis of metastatic affection contra inflammatory changes of lymphatic nodes according to the CT data is sophisticated one. The probability to reveal the presence of metastases in lymphatic nodes more 10 mm in size, belonging to the 2nd or the 3d system of regional lymphatic drainage, constitute 85-100%.
