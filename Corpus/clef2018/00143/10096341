CT demonstration of fibrous stroma in chronic pancreatitis: pathologic correlation. Fibrous stroma found in two patients with chronic pancreatitis was investigated. The helical CT-pathologic correlation confirmed that fibrous stroma found in the subcapsular zone of the pancreatic parenchyma corresponded to the area that was identified as a hypodense zone in the early phase by spiral CT and became isodense with the internal parenchyma in the delayed phase. These CT findings have an important implication for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.
