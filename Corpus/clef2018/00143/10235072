MR imaging of pancreatic neoplasms. The role of MR imaging in the assessment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is in identification, characterization and staging of the neoplastic lesion. Technique optimization is required in order to obtain high qualities images competitive with spiral CT. The choice of imaging protocol is strictly related to the available equipment as well as fast imaging capabilities. Contrast-enhanced study using breath-hold sequences is required if working at high field strength with high gradient performance on mid-low field strength nonbreath-hold acquisition techniques, using respiratory compensation techniques, can be implemented. The use of fat saturation pulses may increase the sensitivity of MR in detecting pancreatic lesions. Other advantages of MR imaging are represented by the availability of additional noninvasive techniques for the evaluation of the biliary tree (MR-cholangiopancreatography) and splanchnic vessels (MR-angiography). Lesion identification is based on TIw sequences where the lesion appears hypointense compared with the surrounding pancreas
