A resected case of pancreatic metastasis from primary renal cell carcinoma. A 71-year-old man, who had received a right nephrectomy for a primary renal cell carcinoma 8 years earlier, and had two years later received a distal gastrectomy for duodenal ulcer, was admitted. In the subsequent clinical course, a solitary low echographical tumor was found in the pancreas. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a tumor of low density area, and celiac angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor stain of the pancreas. From the above findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic tumor was made, and a distal pancreatectomy was performed. Examination of the resected tissues confirmed the presence of a solitary tumor in the pancreatic tail. Histologically, the tumor corresponded to the initial renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed. We report a resected case of such a metastasis and review the literature.
