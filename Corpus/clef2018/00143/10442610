Selective management of pediatric pancreatic injuries. Despite trauma being the most common cause of pediatric pancreatitis, the diagnosis and management is often difficult.The hospital course, diagnostic and surgical procedures, and complications for all children with traumatic pancreatitis evaluated at a Regional Level I Trauma Center were reviewed retrospectively.Twelve of 3,500 children (0.35%, mean age, 8.7 +/- 1.2 years) were reviewed. Intraoperative diagnosis was made in three after penetrating trauma. Nine children sustained blunt pancreatic trauma (BPT) with serial radiographic imaging confirming the diagnosis in seven. Serial serum amylase levels, when performed, were normal in two and elevated in six, but did not predict injury severity or need for further intervention. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed in three children and indicated the need for surgical intervention in two and prevented planned laparotomy in one. Two children underwent computed tomography-guided fluid drainage. Pseudocysts developed in five children. Mortality rate from penetrating injuries was 66% with no deaths from BPT.A combination of serial radiographic, laboratory, and ERCP findings will improve the diagnosis and management of BPT. Penetrating or main ductal injuries require surgical intervention, and fluid collections may require drainage, but, otherwise, most BPT can be managed nonoperatively with minimal morbidity and mortality.
