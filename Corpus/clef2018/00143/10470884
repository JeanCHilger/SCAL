Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and dual-phase helical CT in the preoperative assessment of suspected pancreatic cancer: a comparative study with receiver operating characteristic analysis. The purpose of this study was to compare dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and dual-phase helical CT in the preoperative assessment of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma.Thirty-three consecutive surgical candidates (20 men, 13 women 39-81 years old) were included. MR imaging comprised fast spin-echo (TR/TE 4000/91), fat-suppressed T1-weighted spin-echo (500/15), and T1-weighted breath-hold gradient-echo fast low-angle shot (100/4Both MR imaging and helical CT revealed 29 of 31 lesions. In determining lesion resectability, the mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.96 and 0.81 (p = .01) and the positive predictive values were 86.5% and 76% (p = .02) for MR imaging and helical CT, respectively.MR imaging and helical CT performed equally well in lesion detection. MR imaging was significantly better in the assessment of resectability of pancreatic tumors.
