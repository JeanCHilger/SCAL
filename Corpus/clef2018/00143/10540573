Tuberculous pancreatic abscess in HIV-positive patients. A report of 3 cases and a review of the literature. Three cases of tuberculous pancreatic abscess (TPA) in HIV-positive patients are reported. Pancreatic tuberculosis (PTB) is a rare pathological entity with nonspecific symptomatology that presents a diagnostic challenge. Ultrasound or computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is recommended, as this may be diagnostic and negate the need for operative intervention.
