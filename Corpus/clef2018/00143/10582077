Laparoscopic management of neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas. Neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas are rare but can be fatal due to excessive secretion of regulatory peptides. The localization of these small tumours can be difficult while open surgical treatment is associated with a relatively high morbidity. Two cases are presented where endocrine tumours of the pancreas were successfully removed by laparoscopy. In the surgical treatment of endocrine pancreatic tumours, the use of laparoscopic techniques can provide a valuable means for localizing the tumour while improving the patient's comfort and decreasing operative morbidity.
