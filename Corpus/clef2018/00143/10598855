Localization of pancreatic insulinomas with MR imaging at 0.5 T. To determine the role of MR imaging in the localization of pancreatic insulinomas in patients with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of insulin-producing tumor.Thirty-one patients presenting with signs and symptoms of pancreatic insulinomas were prospectively included in our study. Twenty-six patients underwent surgery, and pathologic specimens were examined: 5 patients, in whom the initial diagnosis of insulinoma was excluded, were also studied and then followed up. All patients were studied with a high gradient power 0.5 T magnet. Images were evaluated by 2 radiologists blinded to previous investigations, tests and results.MR imaging correctly localized 24 of the 26 insulinomas (2 were false-negative and 1 false-positive) and was correctly negative in the 5 control patients. The interobserver agreement had a kappa value of 0.89.MR imaging was accurate in localizing pancreatic insulinomas and as a consequence, patients in our institution are now submitted to surgery directly after the MR examination. Invasive methods are considered only in cases in which, despite clear biochemical results, MR imaging has not demonstrated a pancreatic focal lesion.
