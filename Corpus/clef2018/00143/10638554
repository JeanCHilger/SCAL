A multispecialty approach to the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. This article reviews recent developments in pancreatic cancer research and offers a multispecialty perspective on the diagnosis and management of this challenging disease. Current findings in the molecular biology of the disease and their implications for management are examined, as well as development in diagnostic techniques, including helical computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP), and, particularly, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Surgical management, the role of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, and the critical importance of accurate preoperative imaging are also addressed in this review. Palliative techniques, including endoscopic stenting for malignant obstructive jaundice and chemotherapy for locally advanced and metastatic disease, are discussed, and results of recent clinical trials in pancreatic cancer are summarized. Finally, future directions for research are identified.
