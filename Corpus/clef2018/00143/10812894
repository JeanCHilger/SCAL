Gastric stromal tumor with CD34 immunoreactivity--a case report. Gastric stromal tumors are the most common mesenchymal tumors, and such submucosal mass lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract occur frequently. A 54-year-old woman with no major complaint was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of a mass located between the stomach and the pancreas. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a mass lesion which was located near the lesser curvature of the stomach. Selective left gastric arterial angiography revealed a hypervascular mass, and we diagnosed it as a leiomyosarcoma of the stomach. At laparotomy, there was a large solid mass 5 cm in diameter along the minor curvature of the stomach. Tumor resection with partial gastrectomy was performed, and the histological diagnosis was a gastric stromal tumor with CD34 immunoreactivity. We report a case of stromal tumor of the stomach with extramural growth and review the literature.
