Mucinous cystadenomas and intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. In mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas, diagnosis using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is limited to cystic formations that communicate with the main pancreatic duct. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a new, sophisticated method which is currently under evaluation. The authors describe the usefulness of MRCP in diagnosis of mucin-producing tumors.Six patients with mucin-producing tumors were investigated using MRCP and ERCP. Imaging was compared with surgery and histopathological examinations.Three patients were found to have mucinous cystadenomas (MC), two patients had intraductal papillary mucinous tumors (IPMT) and one patient had a cystadenocarcinoma. MRCP demonstrated the cystic formations in all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed contrast-mediated enhancement of the cystic wall in patients with MC, and visualized the pancreatic ducts completely in patients with IPMT. ERCP failed to visualize the cystic lesion in one patient with MC of the pancreatic tail. Furthermore, ERCP showed evidence of IPMT in dilated main ducts with multiple filling defects but did not visualize the ducts completely.MRCP provides visualization of pancreatic ducts, extraductal variations, and cystic formations more completely than ERCP does. It avoids complications seen in ERCP. MRCP may replace ERCP in the evaluation of mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas.
