Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography following liver transplantation. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings following all three forms of biliary anastomosis and some of the common biliary complications following liver transplantation have been demonstrated. The ability of this technique to image the biliary tree non-invasively in this group of immunocompromised patients should represent a substantial advantage over other forms of direct imaging such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiopancreatography. This form of imaging is particularly useful when a T-tube is not in place and may provide unique information not obtainable by traditional methods of direct imaging. In addition, MRCP should improve planning of biliary intervention.
