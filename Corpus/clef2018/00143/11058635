Pancreas divisum and "santorinicele": diagnosis with dynamic MR cholangiopancreatography with secretin stimulation. To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) before and after secretin administration in diagnosing santorinicele in patients with pancreas divisum.One hundred seven patients suspected of having pancreatic disease underwent MRCP before and after secretin administration (S-MRCP). S-MRCP images were evaluated for pancreas divisum and santorinicele and for size of the main pancreatic duct and santorinicele. The onset of duodenal filling was calculated on dynamic S-MRCP images.Pancreas divisum was detected in five (5%) of 107 patients at MRCP and in 10 (9%) of 107 patients at S-MRCP. Santorinicele was detected in three (21%) of 14 patients at MRCP and in an additional four (seven [50%] of 14) patients at S-MRCP in patients with pancreas divisum. Santorinicele was confirmed in six of seven patients at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in one of seven patients, ERCP was unsuccessful. The duct of Santorini was significantly (P: <.05) larger in the pancreatic head in patients with pancreas divisum and santorinicele (3.6 mm) compared with those with only pancreas divisum (2.2 mm). A noteworthy reduction in size of the pancreatic duct (26%) and of the santorinicele (63%) was observed after sphincterotomy. The onset of duodenal filling was delayed significantly in patients with santorinicele (2.1 vs 1.3 minutesS-MRCP helps in identifying pancreas divisum and santorinicele, which may be the cause of impeded pancreatic outflow.
