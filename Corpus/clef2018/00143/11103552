Pancreatic head melanoma producing obstructive jaundice: magnetic resonance characteristics aiding differentiation from adenocarcinoma. A case is reported of malignant melanoma presenting as a mass in the head of the pancreas producing obstructive jaundice. On MR imaging the mass displayed signal characteristics not typical of adenocarcinoma but instead exhibited a low signal on T2-weighted images and early phase dynamic enhancement, the combination of which should suggest the possibility of melanoma.
