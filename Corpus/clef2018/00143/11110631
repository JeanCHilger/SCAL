New imaging techniques for the evaluation of gastrointestinal diseases. This article provides an overview of recently developed, noninvasive imaging modalities for the evaluation of gastrointestinal disease processes. The advent of spiral computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and conventional magnetic resonance imaging has facilitated the noninvasive assessment of pancreaticobiliary disease. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography provides projectional images of the biliary tree and pancreatic duct, similar to those achieved by direct cholangiography, without the need to administer contrast medium. Spiral computed tomographic colonography provides virtual colonoscopic images of the colonic mucosa, allowing the detection of polyps without the risk associated with colonoscopy.
