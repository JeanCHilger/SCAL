Results of treatment in severe acute pancreatitis. To analyze our results in the management of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), especially in patients who required surgery.In a retrospective study, 90 patients admitted between January 1992 and January 1998 were diagnosed as having SAP on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria. Contrast-enhanced tomography (CT) was done in all patients. The surgical technique of choice was necrosectomy and postoperative local lavage.Seventy percent of the patients (63/90) had pancreatic necrosis. Tomography had a sensitivity of 73% in detecting necrosis. Forty-nine patients (54%) needed surgery: 31 had infected SAP and 18 had sterile pancreatitis. Overall mortality rate was 25.6% (23/90) mortality was 43.8% (14/32) in patients with infected pancreatitis and 15.5% (9/58) in those with sterile SAP (p < 0.05). The mortality rate was 44.4% higher (8/18) in patients with sterile SAP who were operated on. Patients with infected SAP who were operated on during the first week of admission had a higher mortality rate (81%) than those operated on after the first week (20%) (p < 0.05).Pancreatic necrosis and infection are the most important prognostic factors in the course of SAP. The sooner the patients are operated on, the worse the prognosis, especially if there is infection. Efforts should be aimed at avoiding the onset of infection and organ failure, and at delaying surgery.
