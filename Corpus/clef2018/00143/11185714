Simultaneous mucinous cystadenoma of ovary and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas. Mucinous cystic tumors were discovered synchronously in the tail of the pancreas and in the right ovary of an adult female. Both tumors were amenable to surgical resection. The pancreatic tumor was a noninvasive mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and the ovarian tumor was a mucinous cystadenoma. We feel these tumors represent two primaries, an uncommon occurrence, and not a single primary tumor with metastasis.
