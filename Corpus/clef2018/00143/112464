Computer tomography on the pancreas. A diagnostic extension from the surgical aspect (author's transl). 125 patients were subjected to computer tomography on account of suspected pancreatic disease. 48 patients were operated on--the computer tomography (CT) diagnosis was confirmed in 85.5% of the cases. Acute pancreatitis can be detected by CT if it is accompanied by an appropriate enlargement of the organ. Chronic pancreatitis can be recognized by deformations of the organ, calcifications or formation of pseudocysts. Pancreatic carcinoma is recognizable when it is larger than 3 cm accompanied by a change in the shape of the organ or if infiltration of neighboring structures has occurred. Computer tomography offers patients a safe, non-invasive method of performing follow-up examinations at short intervals.
