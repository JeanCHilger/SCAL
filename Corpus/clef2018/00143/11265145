The role of laparoscopy in the identification of peritoneal carcinosis from abdominal neoplasms. Analysis of our initial experience. The authors reviewed the experience on the use of laparoscopy performed since January 1997 in malignant neoplasms at their institution. The aim of the study was to evaluate the real effectiveness of this procedure in the staging of abdominal neoplasms which were considered resectable at preoperative examinations and in particular in the detection of peritoneal metastases not evidenced with traditional imaging techniques.Twenty-eight patients with malignant neoplasms: colo-rectum (15), stomach (5), pancreas (4), gallbladder (2), cardias (1), liver (1), were studied. All the patients were preoperatively examined with abdominal computed tomography (CT). In the 2 patients with gallbladder neoplasm a MR cholangiography was also performed. An explorative laparoscopy with peritoneal washing was then performed in all the patients. The diagnostic and therapeutic choices were subsequently done on the basis of laparoscopy results.Therapeutic approach was modified in 21% of cases, as a result of the detection of peritoneal metastases which were not evidenced with imaging examinations. On the contrary, peritoneal washing was not responsible of any preoperative evaluation.Laparoscopy performed in patients with abdominal neoplasms allows the detection of peritoneal micrometastases not previously evidenced through preoperative CT, thus modifying the therapeutic approach.
