Endoscopic ultrasound in idiopathic acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in patients with unexplained acute pancreatitis, and whether endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is subsequently needed.Subjects who underwent EUS for assessment of idiopathic acute pancreatitis were identified, their medical records were reviewed, and they were contacted for a follow-up telephone interview. EUS diagnosis was compared with the final diagnosis and outcome.EUS revealed a cause of pancreatitis in 21 of the 31 subjects (68%), including microlithiasis in five (16%), chronic pancreatitis in 14 (45%), pancreas divisum in two (6.5%), pancreatic cancer in one (3.2%), and was not diagnostic in 10 (32%). During a mean follow-up period of 16 months, diagnosis changed in four subjects (13%), and nine subjects (29%) had ERCP because of persistent symptoms or recurrent pancreatitis.EUS, a less invasive test than ERCP, demonstrated an etiology in two-thirds of patients with idiopathic acute pancreatitis. Most patients did not require ERCP during the follow-up period. EUS can be an alternative to ERCP in patients with unexplained acute pancreatitis.
