Intraductal mucinous tumor of the pancreas: report of a clinical case. A 49-year-old diabetic patient with abdominal pain was found at ultrasonography and computed tomography to have a cystic mass in the head of the pancreas with dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. The head of the pancreas and the duodenum were removed surgically. Examination of the operative specimen showed chronic pancreatitis, dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, and impacted mucus in the secondary ducts with villous proliferation of the ductal epithelium, thus allowing a diagnosis of intraductal adenomatosis. There was no evidence of malignancy. The resection margin was involved, and consequently the remainder of the pancreas was removed six months after the initial surgical procedure. A review of the literature showed that intraductal adenomatosis tends to spread and carries a high risk of malignant transformation. Surgery is required because of the risk of pancreatic duct obstruction and pancreatic cancer. Intraductal papillary tumour of the pancreas shares many characteristic with other adenomatous proliferation of the gastrointestinal tract (colorectal villous adenoma, bile duct adenomatosis) including the presence of villous structures with increased mucus production, a tendency to spread massively, and a high risk of malignant transformation.
