Adult intussuscepted Meckel's diverticulum presenting mainly lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Herein, we report on an adult with intussusception of an invaginated Meckel's diverticulum presenting mainly with acute intermittent lower gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas the common symptom of abdominal pain, indicating intussusception, was absent. Colonoscopy revealed a reducible polypoid lesion in the ileocecal area. Computed tomography led to suspicion of an intussusception. Surgical resection revealed a Meckel's diverticulum containing an aberrant pancreas. The unique clinical symptoms and the methods of diagnosis are discussed.
