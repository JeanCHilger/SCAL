Cystic pancreatic neoplasms: computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Cystic pancreatic neoplasms include serous cystadenomas (SCA), mucin-producing cystic tumors, cystic islet-cell tumors, and cystic solid and papillary epithelial neoplasms. Imaging techniques are of great value in the demonstration and differential diagnosis of these tumors. In this article we present the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the aforementioned cystic neoplasms. Although the radiological features are in many cases informative, a significant overlap does exist fine-needle aspiration biopsy and cytology or excisional biopsy and histological examination are necessary to determine a definitive diagnosis.
