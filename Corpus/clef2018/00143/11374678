Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas: differential diagnosis between benign and malignant tumors by endoscopic ultrasonography. Recently, intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas has increasingly been recognized. However, differential diagnosis between benign and malignant IPMT is often difficult using conventional imaging modalities. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the value of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for differentiating malignant from benign IPMT.A total of 51 patients with IPMT were preoperatively examined by EUS. The endosonograhic findings were compared with histopathological findings of the resected specimens.In main duct type IPMT, the diameter of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) was > or =10 mm in seven of the eight malignant tumors, compared with two of the seven benign tumors (p < 0.05). In branch duct type IPMT, three of the four large tumors (>40 mm) with irregular thick septa were malignant lesions. In both main duct type IPMT and branch duct IPMT, eight patients had large mural nodules (>10 mm) seven of the eight tumors were malignant and one of the eight tumors was benign. When the tumor was diagnosed as malignant according to above three findings, EUS was able to differentiate between malignant and benign IPMT with an accuracy of 86%.Main duct type tumors with > or =10 mm dilated MPD, branch duct type tumors (>40 mm) with irregular septa, and large mural nodules (>10 mm) strongly suggest malignancy on EUS. EUS would be a useful modality for differentiating between benign and malignant IPMT.
