Pancreatic metastasis of alveolar soft-part sarcoma: a case report and review of the literature. Alveolar soft-part sarcoma is a rare tumour. Patients commonly present with distant metastases both at the time of diagnosis and late in the course of disease. We present a case of pancreatic metastasis, occurring more than six years after diagnosis. Treatment consisted in subtotal pancreatoduodenectomy with pylorus resection. Both specific patterns of relapse and treatment opportunities of this uncommon feature are discussed.
