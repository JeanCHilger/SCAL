Surgical treatment of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas. IPMT (Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas) is increasingly recognized. The aim of this study was to investigate the appropriate surgical treatment for these tumors.Between January 1981 and September 1998, 62 patients with IPMT underwent surgery. We retrospectively examined the clinicopathological features and surgical outcomes of the patients.The types of IPMT were as follows: hyperplasia (20) adenoma (31)IPMT had a favorable prognosis, as compared with pancreatic duct carcinoma. When selecting a surgical procedure for treating these tumors, it is important to confirm the tumor extent, as well as the diagnosis of invasion or noninvasion. In cases with invasion, radical resection is required. On the other hand, organ-function-preserving procedures should be selected for diseases without invasion.
