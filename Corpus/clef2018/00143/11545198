A case of glucagonoma with high uptake on F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Glucagonomas are relatively rare, and can be difficult to differentiate from other pancreatic tumors. A 62-year-old woman who had suffered from diabetes mellitus was hospitalized for further evaluation of a space-occupying lesion in the head of the pancreas and tumors in the liver. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed accumulation of isotope corresponding to a tumor of the pancreas with a standardized uptake value of 4.3, and tumors in the liver with standardized uptake values of 2.4 and 2.8. The serum glucagon level was high (1,170 pg/ml) and the secretin tolerance test was negative. She was diagnosed with glucagonoma with a high serum glucagon level and clinical findings. It is suggested that glucagonoma may be one of the tumors which show high uptake of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose.
