Malignant endocrine tumor of the pancreas associated with von Recklinghausen's disease. We describe a case of malignant endocrine tumor of the pancreas associated with von Recklinghausen's disease. A 66-year-old woman with familial von Recklinghausen's disease was admitted to our hospital with weight loss and lower abdominal pain. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor in the second part of the duodenum. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a heterogeneous low-density tumor, measuring 20 x 15 mm, in the head of the pancreas, and metastatic lymphadenopathy. Angiography showed faint tumor staining without encasement or apparent increase in vascularity. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Macroscopically, there was a solid tumor, measuring 20 x 18 mm, in the head of the pancreas. Histologically, a malignant endocrine tumor was shown, with direct invasion to the duodenum, and lymph node metastases. This is the thirteenth case of pancreatic malignant tumor and the fourth case of pancreatic endocrine tumor associated with von Recklinghausen's disease reported in the world literature.
