Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation associated with duodenal ulcer and H. pylori infection. Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare condition that may cause duodenal ulcer. A 36-yr-old man with PAVM associated with duodenal ulcer and H. Pylori infection is described. The patient had recurrent episode of upper abdominal pain despite healed ulcer and H. Pylori eradication. The preoperative diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography and the patient was treated with a pancreatoduodenectomy. Histological examination of the resected pancreas revealed a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation involving the adjacent duodenal wall.
