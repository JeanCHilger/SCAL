Autoimmune-like pancreatitis in thymoma with myasthenia gravis. A patient with thymoma and myasthenia gravis admitted for surgery presented increased serum levels of pancreatic amylase and lipase. Suspecting a thymoma-related autoimmune disorder, autoantibody serum titers were determined: increased autoantibody titers to acetylcholine receptors, thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase and pancreatic insulin were detected. After thymectomy the serum levels of pancreatic enzymes decreased rapidly. Myasthenia gravis symptoms also improved. To the best of our knowledge no similar cases have been reported in the literature.
