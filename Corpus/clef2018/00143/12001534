Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the pancreas with regional lymph node involvement. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) can be found in virtually any location of the human body. Histologically a mesenchymal aspect predominates and makes these mostly benign tumors apt to be erroneously diagnosed as a soft tissue sarcoma. Cases showing infiltrative growth and local recurrence further complicate the assessment. Localization of an IMT in the pancreas is extremely rare. Clinical investigations regularly lead to the putative diagnosis of a malignant tumor and only subsequent histological examination can establish the correct tumor classification. We present the case of a 62-year-old woman with IMT of the pancreas. Evidence of lymph node involvement has not yet been reported in this setting.
