Possibilities of magnetic resonance tomography in pancreatic cancer diagnosis. There was conducted examination of 27 patients with pancreatic cancer using clinico-laboratory and instrumental methods: ultrasonic investigation, computeric tomography (CT), magnetic-resonance tomography (MRT). MRT was uninformative when pancreatic tumor was up to 3 cm in diameter. In diagnosis of cystadenocarcinoma, affection of common biliary duct and vessels and in small focal metastatic hepatic affection the results of MRT showed enhanced precision in comparison with CT. Informativity of MRT and CT in diagnosis of metastases in lymph nodes was equal.
