A gastric duplication cyst with an aberrant pancreatic ductal system: report of a case. We report an extremely rare case of a gastric duplication cyst together with an aberrant pancreatic ductal system, which communicated with the stomach rather than the pancreatic ductal system with no evidence of pancreatitis. A 46-year-old woman developed severe abdominal pain after a 10-year history of occasional mild abdominal pain. Upper gastrointestinal barium radiography showed a rigidity of the stomach wall, and gastroscopy revealed a fistula orifice at a greater curvature of the gastric body. Subsequent endoscopic suction of mucous secretion from within the fistula provided immediate pain relief. Abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography showed a cystic mass contiguous with the stomach wall. Surgical exploration revealed an uncommon anomaly of a gastric duplication cyst with the aberrant pancreatic lobe. The patient made an uneventful recovery and remains well 4 years after surgery. We also herein review ten other similar cases of this uncommon congenital anomaly reported in the literature.
