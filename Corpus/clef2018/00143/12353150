Management of pancreatic mass accompanying chronic pancreatitis. We report two patients with focal, chronic pancreatitis that was diagnosed by dynamic computed tomography (CT) combined with intraoperative biopsy. In case 1, serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 level rose to 160 U/ml. Abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass, of 4.5 cm in diameter, in the pancreatic head. On dynamic CT, the mass was enhanced similarly to the normal pancreatic parenchyma. In case 2, dynamic CT demonstrated a mass, of 3.0 cm in diameter, in the pancreatic head, which was enhanced similarly to the normal pancreatic parenchyma. From such characteristics of enhancement, both masses were suspected to be chronic pancreatitis rather than cancer, and the diagnosis was confirmed by intraoperative biopsy. Three years in case 1 and 2 years in case 2 have passed since their operations, and the size of each mass has not changed. With the use of dynamic CT combined with intraoperative biopsy, focal chronic pancreatitis could be diagnosed more accurately, and this may lead to a reduction in unnecessary pancreatic resection.
