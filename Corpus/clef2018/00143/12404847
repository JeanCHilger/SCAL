Surgical treatment of pancreatic metastases from renal carcinoma. Pancreatic metastases from renal carcinoma are poorly known. The aim of this study was to report clinical and radiological manifestations, the treatment performed, and the observed survival in 7 patients with this rare entity.All patients were operated on. One patient had nonresectable tumor. Six patients underwent curative resection. There was one postoperative death. Follow-up after pancreatectomy ranged from 6 months to 3 years. Two patients developed extra-pancreatic metastases one year and 3 years after pancreatectomy respectively.Pancreatic metastases from renal carcinoma are rare and often occur several years after nephrectomy. However their resection is often possible and allows a good long-term survival.From 1988 to 2000, 7 patients (5 men and 2 women, mean age = 66 years) with pancreatic metastases from a renal cell carcinoma were observed in the same center. One patient had synchronous metastasis in the 6 others, metastases were diagnosed 4 to 16 years after nephrectomy, and were revealed by pain (n = 2), gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1), faintness (n = 1) or routine follow-up (n = 2). The diagnosis of metastases was made by contrast-enhanced abdominal CT-scan.
