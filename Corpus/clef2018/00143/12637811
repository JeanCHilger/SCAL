Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation. We report a case of a 57-year-old male with a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The diagnosis was made by CT scan and angiography. In the reported case, bleeding from AVM into the biliary tract caused haemobilia and bleeding into the pancreatic head caused abdominal pain. Pancreatic AVM has been only rarely reported as a cause of haemobilia.
