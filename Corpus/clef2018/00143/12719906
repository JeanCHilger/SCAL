Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) is an uncommon pancreatic neoplasm with characteristic histology and distinctive clinicobiologic behavior. It is characterized by proliferation of ductal epithelium associated with ductal dilatation and variable mucin production. Due to indolent nature of these tumors, IPMTs are frequently missed or misdiagnosed. Prompt recognition and differentiation from other tumors are essential because IPMT has a better prognosis than other pancreatic malignancies. The purpose of this article is to display the radiologic spectrum of IPMT.
