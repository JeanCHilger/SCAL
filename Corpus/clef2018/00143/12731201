Acute necrotizing pancreatitis following abdominal trauma. We present 11 cases of acute necrotizing pancreatitis following abdominal trauma operated in our clinic during the last five years. All patients except one were male. All of them had obvious symptoms of acute diffuse peritonitis when they came to hospital. The diagnosis was established by CT scan in four observations. All operations were performed during 12-36 hours after they came. During surgery, there was complete pancreatic necrosis in seven cases and incomplete in the other four cases. Associated injuries following trauma were represented by: hemothorax--two cases, spleen injury--one case, lesion of mesentery--one case, intestinal lesion--one case. In all cases we performed a wide opening of the lesser sac, pancreatic capsulectomy, necrosectomy and multiple drainage of the pancreatic side (behind the peritoneum) and peritoneal cavity. The postoperative outcome was difficult in all cases. Postoperative morbidity recorded pancreatic leakage (three cases), pseudocysts (two cases) and a perforation of gastric wall. There were 10 cases cured and one patient died.
