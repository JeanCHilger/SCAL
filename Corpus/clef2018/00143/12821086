Unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas: a morphologic variant to be considered. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a benign cystic tumor, which radiological diagnosis is easy in its typical microcystic variant. The macrocystic variant is uncommon and raises diagnostic problems with other macrocystic lesions of the pancreas such as pseudocysts and mucinous cystadenomas. We report the case of a young woman with a unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas which was identified on pathologic examination of the surgical specimen, after unconclusive abdominal ultrasound and CT-scan. This case describes an unusual clinical presentation of this cystic tumor and emphasizes that the diagnosis of such an entity is still based on pathological examination after cyst removal.
