Pancreatic tuberculosis. Report of two cases. We report two cases of pancreatic tuberculosis. The first patient had abdominal pain, jaundice and weight loss. Ultrasonography and CT scan suggested a pancreatic tumor. The second patient presented with abdominal pain without jaundice while CT scan showed a pancreatic mass. Diagnosis of pancreatic tuberculosis was made at laparotomy in the two cases. The two patients underwent hepatico-jejunostomy. The first one received antituberculous chemotherapy and completely recovered while the second died because of post-operative shock related to sepsis. Tuberculosis must be suspected in the presence of a pancreatic mass in endemic countries or in immunocompromised patients. Needle biopsy may in some cases lead to diagnosis and avoid laparotomy.
