Primary hepatic vipoma. Vipoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor most frequently localized in the pancreas. When it is extrapancreatic, it is most often neurogenic. We report a case of primary extrapancreatic vipoma that is non neurogenic localized in the right liver in a patient with severe diarrhea and hypokaliema. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, intraoperative tomography and surgical exploration did not show any other extrahepatic primary lesion. The diagnosis was performed by immunochemistry, tumorous cells were positives with anti-VIP antibody. Forty two months after right hepatectomy, the patient was asymptomatic.
