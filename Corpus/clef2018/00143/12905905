Diagnosis and treatment of one hundred and eighty-nine patients with chronic pancreatitis. To summarize the experience of the diagnosis and therapy of chronic pancreatitis (CP).189 patients with chronic pancreatitis confirmed surgically from 1983 to Aug 1999 admitted in our hospital were retrospectively studied.Of all 189 patients, the average age was forty-eight years old. The ratio of male to female is 2.1:1. The proportion of confirmed diagnosis to CP is 51.3% within one year and 80.4% within the first five years. The positive rate for diagnosis was 71.9% by CT and 76.9% by ERCP respectively. The positive rate of PABA was 69.7%. While 136(72%) patients received operations, the rate of complication was low. One patient died of infection after pancreatic fistula at the seventh day after surgery, and 97.8% of patients suffered less pain.The early diagnosis of CP is difficult. As a delicate operation program set at appropriate time is of vital importance for modifying the course of the disease and improving patients' life quality.
