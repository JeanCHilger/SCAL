A case of insulinoma with frequent hypoglycemic attacks not showing evident hyperinsulinemia. Confirmation of inappropriate hyperinsulinemia is an indispensable requisite for the diagnosis of insulinoma. We report here a case of insulinoma without evident hyperinsulinemia at an early stage. The patient, a 49-year-old woman, had been admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of frequent hypoglycemic attacks. At that time, plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) after an overnight fast ranged from 7 to 16 microU/ml. The ratio of IRI/fasting blood sugar (FBS) (Fajans index normal range, below 0.3) was always between 0.13 and 0.28 even at hypoglycemic states. In addition, because computed tomography and arteriography of the abdomen failed to settle the diagnosis of insulinoma, the patient was discharged and followed up at our outpatient clinic for 2 years. She was admitted to our hospital at 51 years of age for the re-evaluation of hypoglycemic attacks. Laboratory examinations revealed high fasting plasma levels of IRI ranging from 20 to 29 microU/ml. Fajans index also increased to 0.47-0.89. Celiac arteriography was able to confirm the existence of insulinoma. We suggest that insulinoma should be considered in the presence of unexplained hypoglycemic attacks even when there is no evident hyperinsulinemia.
