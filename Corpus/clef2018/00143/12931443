Hereditary pheochromocytoma--a family affected by von Hippel-Lindau disease. The authors present a case of a 37 year old male (proband) with a 13 year history of progressive sight impairment leading to blindness and a 4 year history of a mild hypertension. He was incidentally found to have large adrenal tumors after an ultrasound kidney examination. The tumors were confirmed with CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging. A bilateral pheochromocytoma was biochemically demonstrated and successfully removed. The eye diagnosis of angiomatosis retinae von Hippel-Lindau was ascertained after a search of the patient files in other medical departments, which led to a family screening. Proband's brother, having hypertension and a history of a cerebellar astrocytoma operation, was also diagnosed with CT scan to have a bilateral pheochromocytoma. Unfortunately, at the same time he was found to have a large irremovable neuroendocrine pancreatic carcinoma, which caused complications and his eventual death. Both proband and his brother were affected by the same CGG(Arg167)->CAG(Gln) mutation in the exon 3 of the VHL gene. Other living and examined family members were not affected, which was confirmed by negative genetic testing. One year after the pheochromocytoma operation, proband was diagnosed to have a retroperitoneal tumor left to the aorta, clinically silent, with slightly and non-constantly elevated urine norepinephrine and normetanephrine. Metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed that it was a paraganglioma. The old CT and magnetic resonance picture review demonstrated that the tumor had already been present at the time of the operation. It was surgically removed and histologically verified. It is a pity that proband had not been sent by his ophthalmologist for an endocrine examination when the eye diagnosis was determined. Affection of the family would have been discovered earlier, and proband's brother might have possibly been saved.
