Cystic pancreatic tumours and pseudo-tumoural lesions. Cystic lesions of the pancreas are infrequent, estimated at only some 1% of all pancreatic tumours and at some 10% of all pancreatic cysts. The pre-operational diagnosis is important for a suitable treatment, with valuable radiological techniques available today such as ultrasound, computerised tomography and magnetic resonance. In spite of this we have to accept that we are facing a group of tumours whose diagnosis is difficult, due to the great variety of cellular types existing within them.
