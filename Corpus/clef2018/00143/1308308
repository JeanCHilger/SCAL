Pancreatic resections at general hospitals in Torreon, Coahuila. A retrospective study of nine patients with pancreato-biliary neoplasias were operated in several general hospitals in Torreon, Mexico. Six had pancreatic adenocarcinoma, two ampullary carcinoma and one with common bile duct benign adenoma. We had a morbidity of 55% (5/9) three cases with pancreatic fistula (resolved with nutritional support and general measures) two had obstruction of gastricyeyuno anastomosis (one required surgical management). One patient (11%) died of massive pulmonary embolism. We have now the possibility to perform an earlier diagnosis with update invasive and non invasive diagnostic studies such ERCP, computed tomography and angiography. We are proud to have in our hospitals, intensive care units and well trained surgeons that allow us to perform such kind of specialized surgery.
