MRI of pancreatic gastrinomas. Pancreatic islet cell tumors are often small and multiple, and preoperative diagnosis can be difficult.

Magnetic resonance images, acquired using fat suppression, fast spin echo, and contrast material injection, depicted seven separate lesions, which were surgically confirmed.
