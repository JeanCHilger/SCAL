Treatment of peripancreatic fluid collections in patients with complicated acute pancreatitis. We reviewed an experience with treatment of peripancreatic fluid collections in patients with complicated acute pancreatitis to identify clinical and computed tomography (CT) parameters that are helpful in the selection of patients for treatment and to assess treatment outcome.

From 1985 to 1990, 650 patients were hospitalized with acute pancreatitis a peripancreatic fluid collection was found in 36 patients (5.5 percent). Ten of 11 patients with successful outcome after no invasive treatment (group 1) had a low CT severity score of 1 or 2
