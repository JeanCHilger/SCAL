Abdominal applications of multislice CT. Multislice helical CT has made it possible to obtain thinner images with wider coverage at a higher speed in comparison with single-slice helical CT and has improved temporal and spatial resolution. The higher speed available with multislice CT has enabled double arterial phase imaging of the liver and both arterial and pancreatic phase imaging of the pancreas in a single breath-hold. Just as multislice CT has improved the diagnoses of hepatic tumors and pancreatic tumors, it has also improved the quality of three-dimensional imaging, such as multiplanar reformation and CT angiography, by its thinner images. CT angiography is replacing conventional angiography for presurgical evaluation.
