EUS-guided trucut needle biopsies in patients with solid pancreatic masses: a prospective study. A trucut needle biopsy device that can be used to obtain specimens from the pancreas and other perigastric organs under EUS guidance has been developed and successfully tested in animals. Moreover, EUS-guided trucut needle biopsy has been used safely in humans and appears to provide more accurate results than EUS-guided FNA. This study prospectively assessed the clinical utility of this new device in patients with solid pancreatic masses.Twenty-three consecutive patients with radiologically detected solid pancreatic masses underwent EUS-guided trucut needle biopsy. Pancreatic malignancy detected by EUS-guided trucut needle biopsy was considered a definitive diagnosis. Further diagnostic procedures and clinical course were used to establish or exclude the presence of malignancy in all other patients.Pancreatic tissue was obtained in 17 of the 23 patients (74%), including all patients in whom the transgastric approach was used. No acute or long-term complication was observed. Histopathologic evaluation revealed pancreatic cancer in 12 patients. CT-guided biopsy specimens were obtained in 4 of the 5 patients with a negative EUS-guided trucut needle biopsy result two were positive for adenocarcinoma. Overall diagnostic accuracy was 61%. Subgroup analysis of the 16 patients in whom EUS-guided trucut needle biopsy was successful and who were available for follow-up revealed a diagnostic accuracy of 87.5%.This prospective study demonstrates that EUS-guided trucut needle biopsy, when performed transgastrically, is safe and accurate in the evaluation of patients with solid pancreatic masses.
