Papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas: presentation and natural history in two cases. Two young women, one white and one Chinese, with the rare but increasingly recognised papillary and cystic neoplasm of the pancreas are reported. The initial symptom in both was non-specific abdominal pain which, after investigation, was found to be caused by a pancreatic tumour. One patient did not come to surgery until five years after the initial diagnosis when she developed jaundice. In the five year interval between diagnosis and the development of jaundice computed tomography showed no change in the size (20 cm) of the pancreatic mass. Histology after resection, however, showed signs of lymphatic invasion. Cystic neoplasm of the pancreas can thus be regarded as an indolent, very slow growing tumour with potential for local invasion and hence metastatic spread.
