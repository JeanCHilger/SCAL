Case report: appearance of uterine cervical lymphoma on MRI: a case report and review of the literature. We present the appearances on CT and MRI of a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of uterine cervix. A 41-year-old woman presented with a short history of urinary symptoms and menorrhagia. Previous cervical smears were normal. Clinically, the cervix was replaced by a huge ulcerating mass. Biopsy showed malignant high grade B-cell NHL. T(2) weighted MRI of the pelvis showed a 12 cm intermediate signal mass replacing the cervix, with infiltration of the vagina and left parametrium, and bilateral internal iliac lymphadenopathy. Whole body CT imaging showed lymphoma in the kidneys and pancreas, the latter associated with biliary obstruction. The patient is in complete remission 7 months post chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stenting of biliary stricture. The success of the cervical cancer screening programme has lead to a reduction in the number of cases of advanced cervical carcinoma and the presence of an unusually large homogeneous cervical tumour, with relatively scant necrosis should prompt suspicion of a less common histology such as NHL.
