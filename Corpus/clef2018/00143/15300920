EUS mini probes in diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of duodenal wall in heterotopic pancreas: a case report. Cystic dystrophy of the duodenal wall is a rare condition characterized by the development of cysts in heterotopic pancreatic tissue localized in the duodenal wall. A 38-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and vomiting after food intake. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was initially suspected. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed thickening of the second portion of duodenal wall within which, small cysts (diameter, less than 1 cm) were present in the vicinity of pancreatic head. The head of pancreas appeared enlarged (63 mm x 42 mm) and hypoechoic. Upper endoscopy and barium X-ray series were performed revealing a severe circumferential deformation, as well as 4 cm long stenosis of the second portion of the duodenum. CT examination revealed multiple cysts located in an enlarged, thickened duodenal wall with moderate to strong post-contrast enhancement. We suspected that patient had cystic dystrophy of duodenal wall developed in the heterotopic pancreas and diagnosis was confirmed by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed circular stenosis from the duodenal bulb onwards. A twenty megaHertz mini-probe examination further showed diffuse (intramural) infiltration of duodenal wall limited to the submucosa and muscularis propria of the second portion of duodenum with multiple microcysts within the thickened mucosa and submucosa. Patient was successfully surgically treated and pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The pathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of a heterotopic pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasonography features allow preoperative diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of a heterotopic pancreas in duodenal wall, with intraluminal 20 MHz mini probe sonography being more efficient in cases of luminal stenosis.
