Pancreatic metastases: observations of three cases and review of the literature. The aim of the study is to analyze pancreatic metastases and their clinical, radiological, therapeutic and prognostic features.Three cases of pancreatic metastases observed and a world literature review of 333 cases were recorded.Pancreatic metastases are due more frequently to renal cell carcinoma they are usually metachronous and characterized by a long period of time between the resection of the primary tumor and their detection. The differential diagnosis with other pancreatic masses is difficult, but an accurate anamnesis, some peculiar findings of imaging techniques and percutaneous fine needle aspiration could allow preoperative diagnosis. Pancreatic resections are the treatment of choice allowing the better palliation and improving survival. 150/234 pancreatic metastases underwent pancreatic resections (resectability index = 64.1%)Pancreatic metastases are rare their preoperative diagnosis is difficult but useful and possible. Surgical resection is suggested because the patient still may have a prolonged survival.
