Gastroepiploic veins: CT appearance in pancreatic disease. The frequency with which gastroepiploic vein (GEV) enlargement was seen on CT and its relevance to disease of the portal venous system associated with pancreatic disease were studied. We performed a retrospective study of 50 patients with proved pancreatic disease and another 50 patients without such disease. The CT examinations were done in incremental dynamic fashion after a bolus injection of contrast medium. Scans were evaluated for collateral channel formation, including GEV enlargement, and for involvement of the portal venous system by pancreatic disease. Part of the GEV arcade was visible in 36 patients without pancreatic disease, and on average measured 3.2 mm in diameter (range, 1-5.5 mm). GEV enlargement was visible in 62% of the patients with disease 16% demonstrated a vessel 6 mm or more in diameter. Thirty-four percent of the patients with disease had portal venous complications: 26% had isolated splenic vein involvement, 2% had isolated portal vein involvement, and 6% had a combination of splenic and portal vein involvement. Of the patients with splenic vein disease, 81% had collateral channel formation, 50% of them demonstrating isolated GEV enlargement. Patients with splenic vein disease due to acute pancreatic disease had a much higher instance of GEV enlargement (83.3%). Collateral vessels are commonly seen on CT scans of patients with splenic vein disease and most often occur via enlarged GEVs. Acute pancreatic disease is frequently associated with GEV enlargement, suggesting that the latter represents an early response to splenic vein disease. In contrast, multiple collateral pathways tend to develop in patients with chronic pancreatic disease.
