Diagnosis of nonprimary pancreatic neoplasms by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a proven modality for the diagnosis of primary pancreatic neoplasms. We describe our experience in diagnosing nonprimary pancreatic tumors by EUS-FNA. Cytology files were searched for all EUS-FNA of the pancreas for the period 2000-2002. All cases diagnosed as neoplasms were selected and those diagnosed as nonprimary pancreatic tumors were reviewed and analyzed. One hundred ninety-one of 468 cases were diagnosed as neoplasms. Eleven of these cases were diagnosed as nonprimary pancreatic tumors (2.4% of all diagnoses and 5.7% of all neoplasms). The diagnoses were supported by clinical history (n = 7), cytological findings (n = 11), cell block histology (n = 11), cell block immunohistochemistry (n = 6), and flow cytometry (n = 1). EUS-FNA is a safe and minimally invasive method for the diagnosis of nonprimary pancreatic neoplasms. Evaluation of clinical history, cytomorphology, and ancillary techniques, especially those applied to cell block material, are essential for accurate diagnoses.
