A modified CT severity index for evaluating acute pancreatitis: improved correlation with patient outcome. This study was conducted to assess the correlation with patient outcome and interobserver variability of a modified CT severity index in the evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis compared with the currently accepted CT severity index.Of 266 consecutive patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis during a 1-year period, 66 underwent contrast-enhanced MDCT within 1 week of the onset of symptoms. Three radiologists who were blinded to patient outcome independently scored the severity of the pancreatitis using both the currently accepted and modified CT severity indexes. The modified index included a simplified assessment of pancreatic inflammation and necrosis as well as an assessment of extrapancreatic complications. Outcome parameters included the length of hospital stay the need for surgery or percutaneous interventionWhen applying the modified index, the severity of pancreatitis and the following parameters correlated more closely than when the currently accepted index was applied: the length of the hospital stay (0-34 days) (modified index [p = 0.0054-0.0714] vs current index [p = 0.0052-0.3008]) the need for surgical or percutaneous procedures (10/66 patients) (modified index [p = 0.0112] vs current index [p = 0.0324])The modified CT severity index correlates more closely with patient outcome measures than the currently accepted CT severity index, with similar interobserver variability.
