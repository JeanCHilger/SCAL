Imaging advances in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors. We present two cases of neuroendocrine tumors: insulinoma and glucagonoma. Several diagnostic procedures are analysed including those useful to localize the tumor and its possible metastasis, as ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, endoscopic ultrasonography and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. We suggest that the work up should begin with lesser invasive procedures such as CT and In111-labelled pentetreotide scan.
