Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells of the pancreas. A case report. Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells is a rare pancreatic neoplasm, with a possible cystic pattern, includes an adenocarcinoma component and giant cell mimicking osteoclastic bone tumor. We report the case of a 72-year woman admitted for jaundice and epigastric pain. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan revealed a 6 x 5 cm cystic and solid tumor of the pancreatic head with both bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation. A pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed and pathologic examination revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells of the pancreatic head. The patient was alive and disease-free with a 18-month follow-up.
