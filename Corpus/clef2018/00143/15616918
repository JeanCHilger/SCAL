A rare localization of annular pancreas at the pars horizontalis duodeni--case report. Annular pancreas is a rare congenital malformation of the pancreas. In about 50 % of the cases the malformation is asymptomatic until the second to fifth decade. We report on a 75-year-old male patient with an extremely rare localization of annular pancreas - namely at the pars horicontalis duodeni - who presented with recurrent vomiting and loss of weight. An end-to-side Roux-Y duodenojejunostomy was performed. After that procedure we discharged the patient on day eleven after surgery in good physical health condition. In a patient presenting signs of duodenal obstruction annular pancreas should be taken into account as a possibility.
