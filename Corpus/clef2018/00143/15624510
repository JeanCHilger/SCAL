Diagnosis of splanchnic artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, with special reference to contrast enhanced 3D magnetic resonance angiography: a review. Splanchnic artery aneurysms are rare. In the past, conventional angiography was the only way to detect them, but today non-invasive techniques are available. Breath-hold contrast-enhanced 3D magnetic resonance angiography has become a routine examination for evaluation of the aorta and its visceral branches. In this article, we briefly discuss the technical aspects of 3D contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography and illustrate various splanchnic artery aneurysms-pseudoaneurysms with their main characteristics.
