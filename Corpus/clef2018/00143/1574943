Cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Symptoms, diagnosis and surgical consequences. Seven cases of cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas were presented and the treatment of the cystic tumours of the pancreas was discussed in a surgical point of view. Distinction between true cysts like cystadenomas and pseudocysts following pancreatitis is of paramount importance. The clinical findings are mostly uncharacteristic and determinated by the late symptoms. The diagnosis of cystic tumours can usually be made by radiological imaging technique. Intraoperative examination of the frozen-sections is of paramount importance for the choice of the surgical procedure and hence the prognosis of the patient. Radical surgery is indicated in case of cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Every mucinous cystic neoplasm should be completely examined in carefully lamillated sections in order to identify its malignancy.
