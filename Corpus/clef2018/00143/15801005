Mucinous nonneoplastic cyst of the pancreas: a truly novel pathological entity? Recently, a novel and distinct pancreatic cystic tumor termed "mucinous nonneoplastic" cyst was described in the literature. We report our experience with a 71-year-old female with a cystic tumor in the body of the pancreas demonstrating features suggestive of this diagnosis. We also review the literature regarding this "novel" pathological entity and discuss critically its existence and its differential diagnoses.
