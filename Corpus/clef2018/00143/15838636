Gallstone pancreatitis in children: atypical presentation and review. Pancreatitis in children is less common than in adults and is mostly related to trauma, infection and anatomical anomalies. Gallstone pancreatitis is an even rarer entity in infants and children. We present an unusual case of gallstone pancreatitis in a 17- month-old girl who presented with jaundice of 1 month duration. The laboratory studies showed conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with associated acute pancreatitis and pseudo-hyponatraemia secondary to the markedly elevated lipid profile. Further evaluations revealed obstruction at the Ampulla of Vater with no evidence of a choledochal cyst and no mass lesion seen in the pancreas. The patient initially underwent urgent decompressive cholecystostomy with intraoperative cholecystography. When the biochemical parameters improved, the patient underwent formal cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration, extraction of multiple impacted stones in the ampullary region and Fogarty balloon sphincterotomy. The post-operative course was uneventful.Acute gallstone pancreatitis in children may present as jaundice or abdominal pain. Recognition, early diagnosis and surgical intervention are the mainstay for a good outcome.
