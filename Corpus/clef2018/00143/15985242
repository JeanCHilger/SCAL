Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A 43-year-old male with a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) was admitted to our center with severe abdominal pain and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. CT showed multiple cysts in the liver and both kidneys along with ADPKD and a cystic mass, 4 cm in diameter, in the pancreatic head. The main pancreatic duct was dilated to 1 cm in diameter. The patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis due to intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT), and pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Histologic examination revealed a multiloculated cystic tumor filled with mucin in the head of the pancreas. Microscopically, the tumor was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma and was found to have invaded the main pancreatic duct. Although, in addition to our case, only seven cases with association between ADPKD and malignant neoplasms have been reported, five of these cases had neoplasms arising from the pancreas. Therefore, we suggest that some genetic interactions may exist between ADPKD and pancreatic carcinogenesis.
