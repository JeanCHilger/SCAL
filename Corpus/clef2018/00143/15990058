State-of-the-art computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging of the gastrointestinal system. Among the major innovations in radiology of the gastrointestinal (GI) system are the replacement of classic invasive diagnostic methods with noninvasive ones and the improvement in lesion characterization and staging of pancreatobiliary malignancies. Developments in imaging technology have led to many improvements in the field of diagnostic GI radiology. With its fast and thin-section scanning abilities, multidetector-row CT (MDCT) strengthens the place of CT as the most efficient tool to diagnose, characterize, and preoperatively stage pancreatic neoplasms. MR cholangiopancreatography has widely replaced endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatobiliary malignancies. MR imaging, using phased-array or endorectal coils, demonstrates local tumor invasion accurately in rectal cancers and thus allows an improved surgical planning. Virtual colonoscopy with MDCTs is an efficient screening method for colon cancer, and MDCT enterography is becoming the standard imaging technique for many small bowel disorders. The continuing developments in CT and MR technology will most probably further improve the accuracy of these and other imaging applications in the near future.
