The role of endoscopic ultrasound(EUS) in differential diagnosis of subepithelial oesophago-gastric lesions. Endoscopic ultrasonography(EUS) allows high-resolution demonstration of the entire gut wall. The aim of the study was to clarify the usefulness of the EUS in differential diagnosis of upper gastro-intestinal subepithelail lesions(SEL).From September 1998- March 2005, EUS was performed in 1600 patients. Among them, in 206pts (13%), this examination was carried out due to previous upper endoscopy, which revealed the suspicion to SEL or extraluminal compression. We studied the location, the size, echo pattern and originating layer of SEL. The results were compared with CT, angiography and operation with histology when possible. All EUS examinations were performed using Olympus GIF-130 videoecho-endoscope with 7,5/12MHz switchable radial probe.EUS accuracy in separating intramural masses from extraluminal compression was 96%(44/46). Among 160 pts with true SEL, in 95(59.3%), EUS revealed the existence of a stromal tumor arising from muscularis propria (92) or muscularis mucosae (3). The size of the tumor varied from 5-75mm depth: 8-40mm. 33 patients were operated on. In 14/16(87%), the EUS diagnosis of benign stromal tumor was confirmed on operation. In 18/19(95%), EUS correctly disclosed the malignant tumor. EUS accuracy in predicting malignancy was 91.5%(32/35). Findings suggestive for malignancy were: size 40mmThe EUS appears to be very effective in differential diagnosis of SEL in upper gastro-intestinal tract. Tumour size greater than 40mm, inhomomogenous echo pattern and irregular outer margin are very suggestive for malignancy.
