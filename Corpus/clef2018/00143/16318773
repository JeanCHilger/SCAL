Value of magnetic resonance angiography combined with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography on diagnosis for patients with carcinoma of head of pancreas. To study the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the preoperative diagnosis of patients with carcinoma of head of pancreas.Forty-two patients were examined by MRI, MRCP and MRA. The results were compared with the intraoperative exploration findings and operative procedures.The MRCP and MRA results of 42 cases demonstrated that peripancreatic tissues and blood vessels were not invaded in 24 cases, while portal vein and superior mesenteric vein were invaded by the tumor in 5 cases, and peripancreatic vessels were infiltrated in 10 cases, and 3 cases were detected with organ metastasis. Thirty-five of forty-two cases were consistent with the intraoperative exploration findings, and the accurate rate was 89.7%. Pancraticoduodenectomy was performed in 28 patients, internal drainage in 11 and interventional therapy in 3 cases. The resection rate was 66.7%.The results of MRCP and MRA could definitely demonstrate the preoperative organ metastasis and peripancreatic organization invasion, especially blood vessel infiltration. So the imaging results played an important role in estimating the level of the process and guiding the treatment.
