Nonoperative treatment of traumatic pancreatic duct disruption in children with an endoscopically placed stent. The presence of ductal injury is the main determinant of consequence and a cause of significant mortality and morbidity in children with blunt pancreatic trauma. Proper treatment must be initiated on the basis of accurate anatomic diagnosis of the type and location of the injury. Computed tomography is an insufficient method for the diagnosis of the type and location of pancreatic ductal injury. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is a reliable technique for determining the status of the pancreatic duct in children and may allow for definitive treatment of ductal injury by stenting in selected patients. There is only one study of 2 cases reporting therapeutic ERP with ductal stenting in children after blunt trauma. In this report, we present an 11-year-old child with pancreatic ductal injury who was diagnosed and treated endoscopically by stent placement, during ERP. The patient improved steadily and was discharged uneventfully. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography may be a very useful diagnostic and treatment tool in the management of main ductal disruptions.
