Annular pancreas in the adult: management with laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy. Annular pancreas is an uncommon congenital anomaly associated with duodenal atresia in neonates. Rarely, the condition may manifest later in life. These symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and usually arise due to obstruction to gastric emptying. Abdominal CT scan with high resolution and angiography protocol and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in confirming the presence of annular pancreas. Operative management involves bypassing the obstructed duodenum. Duodenoduodenostomy is routinely performed in neonates with annular pancreas. In adults, the duodenum is less mobile, and duodenojejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy are recommended. We report two cases of annular pancreas in adults treated with laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy.
