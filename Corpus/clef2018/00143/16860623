Therapeutic approach to tumors of the ampulla of Vater. Indications for local resection for tumors of the ampulla of Vater have not been established. The present study evaluated suitable treatments for tumors of the papilla of Vater.Clinicopathological factors were reviewed for 53 patients with tumors of the ampulla of Vater treated between February 1993 and August 2003.Of 53 patients, 41 were treated surgically. Local resection was performed in 7 of these 41 patients, with a histologically involved margin evident in 4 patients. Lymph node metastasis was identified in 20 patients who received radical resection, including 1 patient with pT1 cancer.Given the presence of some positive surgical margins, local resection is indicated as a therapeutic approach to tumors of the papilla of Vater only for benign tumors or some malignant tumors that cannot undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).
