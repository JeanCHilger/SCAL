Percutaneous transarterial embolization of extrahepatic arteroportal fistula. Arteroportal fistula is a rare cause of prehepatic portal hypertension. A 44-year-old male with hepatitis virus C infection was admitted for acute variceal bleeding. Endoscopy showed the presence of large esophageal varices. The ultrasound revealed a mass near the head of pancreas, which was characterized at the color-Doppler by a turbulent flow, and arterialization of portal vein flow. CT scan of abdomen showed a large aneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery communicating into the superior mesenteric vein. The sinusoidal portal pressure measured as hepatic vein pressure gradient was normal, confirming the pre-hepatic origin of portal hypertension. The diagnosis of extrahepatic portal hypertension secondary to arteroportal fistula was established, and the percutaneous embolization was performed. Three months later, the endoscopy showed absence of esophageal varices and ascites. At the moment, the patient is in good clinical condition, without signs of portal hypertension.
