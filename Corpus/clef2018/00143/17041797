Autoimmune pancreatitis with multifocal mass lesions. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is radiologically characterized as diffuse swelling of the pancreatic parenchyma and irregular narrowing of the pancreatic ducts. We present a case of AIP with multiple small nodular lesions in the pancreas. This case suggests that AIP with only small nodular or localized lesions is more difficult to differentiate from pancreatic cancer than typical cases of AIP.
