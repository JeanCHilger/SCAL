Precocious puberty because of a pancreatic neuroectodermal tumor. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are uncommon, representing approximately 1% of all sarcomas. Pancreatic PNETs have been reported only 12 times in the literature. This report presents the first case of a patient with a PNET exhibiting precocious puberty. The clinical presentation, surgical management, and pathology of this rare pancreatic PNET found in a 2-year-old girl with precocious puberty are discussed.
