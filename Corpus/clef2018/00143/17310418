Do MRI agents cause or worsen acute pancreatitis? Acute pancreatitis is still one of the challenging issues in general surgical practice in terms of diagnosis, management and follow-up. CT evaluation of the patients with acute pancreatitis gained popularity in order to document necrosis within the pancreatic tissue which is one of the most important factor linked to the morbidity and even mortality of the disease. Recent studies evidenced that agents used for CT evaluation might also contribute to pancreatic inflammation and cause necrosis. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium has been speculated as a safer mean of providing optimum imaging of the pancreas than contrast enhanced CT. In this article we report an unusual case of acute pancreatitis which might have been initiated and/or worsened by gadolinium.
