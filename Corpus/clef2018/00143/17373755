Lipoma within inverted Meckel's diverticulum as a cause of recurrent partial intestinal obstruction and hemorrhage: a case report and review of literature. Lipoma within an inverted Meckel's diverticulum presenting with hemorrhage and partial intestinal obstruction is an exceptional clinical entity. We report a case of 47-year-old male with a history of recurrent episodes of partial intestinal obstruction and melena due to a subserosal lipoma located in the base of an inverted Meckel's diverticulum. According to our knowledge, this is the first case of a lipoma within a Meckel's diverticulum giving rise to this clinical scenario without the existence of heterotrophic gastric or pancreatic tissues.
