Clinics in diagnostic imaging (115). Extraluminal biliary tree obstruction due to compression by pancreatic head tumour. A 58-year-old Chinese woman presented initially with obstructive jaundice. Initial ultrasonography showed gallstones, calculus in common bile duct, and obstructed biliary system. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed an extrinsic compression at common bile duct, and subsequent computed tomography scan showed a mass in the head of the pancreas. Endoscopical ultrasonography revealed masses in the gallbladder and pancreas. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed gallbladder cancer with spread to pancreas, segment IV of the liver, and regional lymph nodes. The patient was treated palliatively with metallic biliary stent for biliary drainage.
