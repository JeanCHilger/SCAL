Chronic pancreatitis in a child with glycogen storage disease type 1. A case of chronic pancreatitis in an 8-year-old boy with glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD 1a) is presented. This patient had a history of hyperlipidaemia unresponsive to dietary therapy, e.g., a carbohydrate-rich diet, uncooked cornstarch, and nocturnal intragastric tube feedings. He had recently suffered bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Serum amylase and trypsin were elevated, abdominal CT revealed the presence of a pseudocyst of the pancreas. The presence of chronic pancreatitis was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and an infected pseudocyst was removed at laparotomy.
