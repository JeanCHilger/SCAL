Traumatic pancreatic duct injury in children: minimally invasive approach to management. The management of children with main pancreatic duct injuries is controversial. We report a series of patients with pancreatic trauma who were treated using minimally invasive techniques.Retrospective review of children with pancreatic trauma treated at a UK tertiary referral institution between 1999 and 2004.Fifteen children (11 boys) were admitted with pancreatic trauma. Twelve (80%) were less than 50th centile for body weight. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans were used to define organ injury, supplemented by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in 7. Twelve (80%) underwent diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with a median time after injury of 11 (range, 6-29) days. The degree of pancreatic injury was defined by ERCP and CT/MRCP as grade II (n = 2), grade III (n = 4), grade IV (n = 9) (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grades). Nine children had a transductal pancreatic stent inserted endoscopically. Computed tomography/ultrasound-guided drainage was performed in 4 children for acute fluid collections. Two children later underwent endoscopic cyst-gastrostomy, one of whom later required conversion to an open cyst-gastrostomy.Body habitus may predispose to pancreatic duct trauma. Contrast-enhanced CT scan (and MRCP) should dictate the need for ERCP. Transductal pancreatic stenting allows internal drainage of peripancreatic collections and may reestablish duct continuity, although a proportion still requires percutaneous or endoscopic cyst-gastrostomy drainage. Open surgery for pancreatic trauma should now be an exception.
