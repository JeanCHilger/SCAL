Treatment monitoring and thermometry for therapeutic focused ultrasound. Therapeutic ultrasound is currently enjoying increasingly widespread clinical use especially for the treatment of cancer of the prostate, liver, kidney, breast, pancreas and bone, as well as for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The optimum method of treatment delivery varies between anatomical sites, but in all cases monitoring of the treatment is crucial if extensive clinical acceptance is to be achieved. Monitoring not only provides the operating clinician with information relating to the effectiveness of treatment, but can also provide an early alert to the onset of adverse effects in normal tissue. This paper reviews invasive and non-invasive monitoring methods that have been applied to assess the extent of treatment during the delivery of therapeutic ultrasound in the laboratory and clinic (follow-up after treatment is not reviewed in detail). The monitoring of temperature and, importantly, the way in which this measurement can be used to estimate the delivered thermal dose, is dealt with as a separate special case. Already therapeutic ultrasound has reached a stage of development where it is possible to attempt real-time feedback during exposure in order to optimize each and every delivery of ultrasound energy. To date, data from MR imaging have shown better agreement with the size of regions of damage than those from diagnostic ultrasound, but novel ultrasonic techniques may redress this balance. Whilst MR currently offers the best method for non-invasive temperature measurement, the ultrasound techniques under development, which could potentially offer more rapid visualisation of results, are discussed.
