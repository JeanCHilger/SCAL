Amiodarone hepatotoxicity complicating obstructive jaundice due to ampullary cancer. The presence of dual pathology can cause diagnostic dilemmas. We present a case of adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater with concurrent amiodarone hepatotoxicity.Painless jaundice associated with a palpable gallbladder was investigated clinically, radiologically, endoscopically and via liver biopsy.Liver biopsy showed amiodarone hepatotoxicity. Endoscopic biopsy identified an ampullary adenoma. However, the endoscopic ultrasound and intra-operative findings suggested a malignancy, which was confirmed postoperatively.While the classic findings of Courvoisier's Law are borne out in this case, the etiology of jaundice is twofold. Although dual pathology is uncommon it should always be considered.
