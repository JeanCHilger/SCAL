Clinical value of ultrasonography and computerized tomography prior to abdominal interventions. We studied the value of ultrasound and computed tomography in the preoperative diagnosis of abdominal diseases in 100 patients. Reference methods were the reports of surgery and pathology. A computed tomography or ultrasound diagnosis could be correct or false and was considered uncertain, if the main diagnosis was missed but computed tomography or ultrasound suspected pathology, which then could be clarified by other procedures. Overall, computed tomography was superior with 75 correct, 13 false and 12 uncertain diagnoses compared to ultrasound with 58 correct, 31 false and 11 uncertain diagnoses. Ultrasound often failed because obesity or gas impaired visibility. If only cases without technical problems of ultrasound were taken into account, diseases of liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, the adrenal region and other abdominal masses were equally well diagnosed by ultrasound and computed tomography. As expected, the diagnostic value of both modalities was markedly reduced in diseases of the bile duct and the gastrointestinal tract. Because the study design required both, ultrasound and computed tomography, cases already clarified by ultrasound were not included. This fact might have further reduced the sensitivity of ultrasound in comparison to computed tomography. Furthermore, ultrasound was mostly one of the first diagnostic procedures performed right after the patient's admission with little information on anamnestic and clinical data. The information given prior to computed tomography was in general more detailed.
