Surgical treatment of sporadic gastrinoma. Surgical therapy for sporadic gastrinoma profits from innovative pre- and intraoperative diagnostics. Preoperative gastrinoma localization is enhanced by sophisticated endoscopic ultrasonography, scintigraphic and arteriographic studies with hormone sampling. Thereby a concise surgical approach is guided and additional intraoperative control of success may be gained by endoscopic transillumination and measurement of stimulated gastrin levels.
