A case of an isolated gastric variceal bleed secondary to a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. Gastric varices are an important complication of portal hypertension. We present here a case of bleeding gastric varices secondary to a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. To our knowledge, there are no other reports in the literature. Such cases are always a timely and important reminder of the importance in considering causes of portal hypertension other than cirrhosis, particularly in patients with limited risk factors for liver disease.
