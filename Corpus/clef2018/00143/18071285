Primary extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma arising from the pancreas. We report here on a case of primary extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma that arose from the pancreas. A 41-year-old man was evaluated by CT to find the cause of his abdominal pain. The CT scans showed a heterogeneously enhancing necrotic mass with numerous areas of coarse calcification, and this was located in the left side of the retroperitoneal space and involved the body and tail of the pancreas. Portal venography via the celiac axis also showed invasion of the splenic vein. Following excision of the mass, it was pathologically confirmed to be primary extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma that arose from the pancreas.
