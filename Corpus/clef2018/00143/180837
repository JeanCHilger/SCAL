Computed tomography of the body: initial clinical trial with the EMI prototype. A review of the first 400 cases examined on one of three prototype EMI body scanners is presented. During the initial evaluation phases, it became obvious that computed tomography of the body has tremendous potential in the evaluation of various organs and disease states. The technique has been most useful in evaluating patients with known or suspected abdominal neoplasm, particularly lesions of liver, pancreas, retroperitoneum, and kidney. Too few cases have been studied to realistically quantitate its impact on the total field of medical diagnostic imaging.
