Cross sectional imaging findings in ectopic pancreatitis. Two patients with ectopic pancreas, associated with pancreas divisum are presented. In one of these patients MDCT examination showed an island of pancreatic parenchyma, isolated from the pancreatic head and located within the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, where ectopic pancreas could be confirmed by endoscopy. The other patient suffered from acute pancreatitis according to the clinical and laboratory findings. However, MDCT showed a normal pancreas. Here the only abnormality on CT was found in an area of inflamed and infiltrated fatty tissue ventrally to the descending duodenum and the pancreatic head, which was clearly separated from pancreatic head. While these CT findings alone were non-specific, MRT allowed to identify an island of ectopic pancreas within this area of inflammation. Additionally both patient showed pancreas divisum. These two cases nicely demonstrate, that ectopic pancreas may be recognized by MDCT. However, familiarity with the embryology of the pancreas and knowledge about a probable association of pancreas divisum and ectopic pancreas may be helpful for the correct interpretation of imaging findings. Furthermore, in cases of ectopic pancreatitis CT may show only nonspecific extrapancreatic soft tissue inflammation and MRT may become necessary to identify the enclosed island of ectopic pancreatic tissue.
