Role of cystic fluid in diagnosis of the pancreatic cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma. Early and accurate diagnosis of cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is difficult especially for the differentiation of benign or malignancy. In this study, we try to compare EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy combined with measurement of the cyst fluid and serum levels of CEA, and CA19-9 for the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma.Retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 37 patients with pancreatic cystadenoma and 48 patients with cystadenocarcinoma from 1998 to 2005.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA19-9 of the cyst fluid and serum combined with EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was made. Examination of serum CEA, and CA19-9 resulted in 21.0+/-18.0, 2.7+/-1.7 U/L and 18.7+/-17.5, 269.0+/-182.0 U/L for cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma respectively (P<0.05). The sensitivity of cyst fluid combined with biopsy was higher than that of a single marker. However, the sensitivity and specificity of tumor markers of cystic fluid were much higher than that of the serum (P<0.05).EUS-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy combined with examination of cyst fluid level of CEA and CA19-9 will be a credible means for early diagnosis of pancreatic cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma.
