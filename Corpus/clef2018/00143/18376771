Nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas in an 8-year-old girl. We report a case of a nonfunctioning neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor in the pediatric age group. An 8-year-old child complains of vague abdominal pain and radiological investigations detect a tumoral mass in the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasound, contrast enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate a round intrapancreatic solid moderately vascularized lesion of approximately 5 cm in diameter, with a smooth contour and well demarcated from the surrounding tissues. After surgical resection, the diagnosis of a hormonally inactive benign neuroendocrine tumor is histologically diagnosed. Patient's follow-up is uneventful.
