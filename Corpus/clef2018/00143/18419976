Unicentric Castleman's disease in peripancreatic tissue: case report and review of the literature. Castleman's disease is a rare disorder of the lymphoid tissue that usually occurs in the mediastinum even if extrathoracic involvement, including neck, axilla, mesentery and retroperitoneum, has also been described. We report a case of a 69 years old men with peripancreatic localisation, mimicking a pancreatic neoplasm treated with local excision. Only seven cases of pancreatic and peripancreatic localisation are described in the world-wide literature. This particular site of disease may give troublesome differential diagnosis due to non specific clinical signs and radiological features. Often surgical excision is both diagnostic and therapeutic.
