Percutaneous transhepatic x-ray endobiliary interventions in the complex diagnosis of cancer of the hepatopancreatoduodenal area complicated by mechanical jaundice. 58 patients with hepatopancreatoduodenal cancer complicated by mechanical jaundice underwent complex examination including X-ray computed tomography, angiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transhepatic roentgenoendobiliary procedures and puncture biopsy. The diagnostic value of each procedure was assessed, implementation of 6 conventional diagnostic tasks serving as a criterion. The procedure suggested allows to individualize diagnostic work-up to assure maximum reliability. Percutaneous transhepatic roentgenoendobiliary methods are considered a complex of diagnostic and therapeutic manipulations.
