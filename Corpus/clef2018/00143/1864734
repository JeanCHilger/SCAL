Ultrasound controlled aspiration cytology of liver, bile ducts and pancreas. Aspiration cytology is an effective and safe method for diagnosis of intraabdominal malignancies. In a prospective study we analysed the cytology in 84 patients. The results showed a sensitivity of 95% with an accuracy of 96%. No false positive diagnosis was found where open biopsy was possible. The aspiration cytology is a good method to decide whether endoscopic stents or embolization of the liver can be used without explorative laparotomy.
