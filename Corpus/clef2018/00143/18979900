Pancreatic tuberculosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis (TB) is a rare condition in immunocompetent patients and often represents a diagnostic challenge. Pancreatic TB may present with protean manifestations. Imaging with ultrasound, computed tomographic (CT) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) usually reveals multicystic pancreatic masses, most frequently in the head of the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration or percutaneous biopsy guided by CT/ultrasound or EUS can be useful diagnostic tools. We report a case of a 60-year-old HIV-negative man who presented with a pancreatic mass and a pulmonary nodule that were subsequently diagnosed to be tuberculosis.
