Obstructive jaundice in a patient with mycosis fungoides metastatic to the pancreas. EUS findings. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides are uncommon neoplasms with a long and often relatively indolent course. Some eventually metastasize to lymph nodes or visceral organs but there are to our knowledge only two prior reports which describe clinically relevant pancreas involvement.We present the case of a 52-year-old man with mycosis fungoides who developed abdominal pain and jaundice. Endoscopic ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration biopsies of a peculiar infiltrative appearing mass in the head of the pancreas revealed T-cell lymphoma cells.There is an increased incidence of second primaries in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and a biopsy diagnosis of new intra-abdominal masses is essential.
