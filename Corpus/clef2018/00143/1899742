Intraabdominal Mycobacterium tuberculosis vs Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections in patients with AIDS: distinction based on CT findings. Abdominal CT scans of 71 patients with AIDS who had proved disseminated infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (27 patients) or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (44 patients) were reviewed retrospectively to identify radiologic features that can be used to distinguish the two infections. CT findings in patients with disseminated M. tuberculosis included focal lesions in the liver (11%), spleen (30%), kidneys (19%), pancreas (7%), and gastrointestinal tract (15%) and lymph nodes with central or diffuse low attenuation (93%). CT findings in patients with disseminated M. avium-intracellulare included marked hepatomegaly (20%) marked splenomegaly (14%)
