Case of pancreatic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. A 77-year-old woman underwent abdominal ultrasonic diagnosis in a screening test for diabetes mellitus. A 65 x 45 mm tumor with low echo level was revealed and located from the uncinate process of the pancreas to the body. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated the pancreas had a low density area in the arterial phase and a comparable area in the equilibrium phase, compared with the parenchyma of the normal pancreas. Gallium-scintigraphy showed strong accumulation, consistent with the tumor. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma was diagnosed by endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB). Complete remission was achieved after radiation therapy.
