Diagnosis of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a unique disease entity that is characterized by predominant intraductal growth of mucinous cells, copious mucin production, and subsequent cystic dilatation of pancreatic ducts. IPMN shows a spectrum of histologic and imaging findings and possesses as the potential for malignant transformation arising from adenoma to invasive carcinoma. It is important to determine the type, extent of duct involvement, and presence of malignant transformation, and to assess tumor grading prior to surgical resection. Thus, it would be helpful for physicians managing patients with IPMN of the pancreas to have a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of IPMN. In this review, a role of radiological evaluation for diagnosis and preoperative assessment is described as well as presentation of the guideline for patient management.
