Clinical characteristics, recurrence features, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with autoimmune pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics, recurrence features, and treatment results of patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and to determine the clinical predictive factors associated with recurrence.We analyzed the clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and recurrence features. We also evaluated treatment methods and outcomes, and clinical predictive factors associated with recurrence in 55 patients with AIP.AIP may be misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer due to the following characteristic features: (1) clinical findings similar to those of pancreatic cancer including weight loss (60.0%), obstructive jaundice (54.5%), and recent-onset diabetes (29.1%) as the major symptoms (2) a preponderance in elderly men (mean, 57.7 years oldIt is reasonable to understand AIP as a pancreatic lesion reflecting systemic disease, so called 'IgG4-related fibroinflammatory disease'. Steroid trial may be a practical diagnostic tool and a therapeutic one. Recurrence was not uncommon after the steroid treatment and serum IgG4 could be a monitoring marker for the recurrence in clinical practice.
