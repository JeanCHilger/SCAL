Endoscopic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas invading the stomach. Squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas is an unusual tumor due to the absence of squamous cells in the normal pancreas. Its clinical presentation is similar to that of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and is usually diagnosed intraoperatively or at autopsy.We report a 50-year-old male who presented with obstructive jaundice and symptoms suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction. Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography revealed a heterogeneous enhancing mass in the head of pancreas and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulcerated polypoidal lesion in the stomach the endoscopic biopsies taken from this region revealed infiltration of the lamina propria with malignant squamous cells.A rare case of squamous cell carcinoma of the head of the pancreas presenting with obstructive jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction and in which diagnosis was established by endoscopic biopsies of the stomach has been described.
