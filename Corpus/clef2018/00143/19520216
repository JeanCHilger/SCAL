Pancreas transplants. Cadaveric, whole pancreas transplantation has proved an effective therapy in the treatment of long-standing type 1 diabetes mellitus and is capable of achieving an insulin-independent eugyclaemic state.

We present a review of the normal post-transplantation appearance and the features of early and late complications.
