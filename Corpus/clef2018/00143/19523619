Prospective evaluation of EUS versus CT scan for staging of ampullary cancer. Malignancies of the biliary and pancreatic systems are associated with a poor prognosis. However, ampullary cancer carries a better prognosis and is often diagnosed when curative treatment is still possible. Accurate staging is important for the determination of the most appropriate treatment option.(1) To determine the test performance characteristics of EUS and CT in loco-regional staging of ampullary neoplasms, and (2) to determine the impact of CT scan results on the test performance characteristics of EUS.Prospective single-arm intervention study performed in 2 academic hospitals. RESULTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-seven patients were screened and 33 staged with EUS and CT. A total of 27 patients (13 men mean age, 69.5 yearsLow number of T1 tumors.EUS is an accurate diagnostic test and exhibits a high level of agreement with surgical pathology. CT findings do not improve the test performance characteristics of EUS. Therefore, the evaluation for metastatic disease should not be compromised by CT protocols that aim to perform tumor and nodal staging. Further studies to determine the role of specialized CT protocols in patients with ampullary malignancies are needed.
