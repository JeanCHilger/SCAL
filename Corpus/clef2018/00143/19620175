Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with intratumoral cystic lesions on MRI: correlation with histopathological findings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intratumoral cystic lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) depicted on MRI, and to correlate these cystic lesions with their histopathological findings. This study included 12 patients (7 males and 5 females mean age, 59 years) with intratumoral cystic lesions of PDAC detected on a retrospective MRI review. We reviewed the histopathological findings of the cystic lesions within PDACs and analysed the MRI findings, focusing on the appearance of the intratumoral cystic lesions, i.e. the size, number, margin and intratumoral location, and on the ancillary findings of PDAC, i.e. peripancreatic infiltration, upstream pancreatic duct dilatation and distal parenchymal atrophy. Intratumoral cystic lesions were classified as neoplastic mucin cysts (n = 7, 58%) or cystic necrosis (n = 5, 42%) according to the histopathological findings
