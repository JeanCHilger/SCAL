Pancreatic cancer's initial presentation: back pain due to osteoblastic bone metastasis. Pancreatic cancer may cause osteolytic metastases, but the osteoblastic ones are extremely rare. In addition, it almost always presents with symptoms related to the invasion of the structures in the abdomen. Symptoms from bone metastases are rare and, if seen, are in the late phase of the course. We present a case of cancer of the body of the pancreas, which presented with severe back pain due to an osteoblastic lesion to L3 vertebra. Biopsy of the vertebra led to the diagnosis. Radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance and scintigraphic images as well as pathology slices are shown. The present case raises the issue that pancreatic cancer, as a cause of an osteolytic bone lesion, should not be overlooked in an unknown primary investigation.
