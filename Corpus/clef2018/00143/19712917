Pancreatic schwannoma: literature review. Pancreatic schwannoma is a rare neoplasm. Accurate preoperative diagnosis remains difficult, but computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help to establish the diagnosis, and definitive diagnosis requires immunohistochemical examination. Cystic pancreatic schwannomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic neoplasms and pseudocysts. Simple enucleation may be adequate for pancreatic schwannoma. In this report, we examine a case of benign pancreatic schwannoma in a 56-year-old woman. She was being evaluated for an ovarian teratoma, and an 8-cm cystic mass was incidentally found in the head of the pancreas. She underwent a pylorus preserving Whipple procedure with bilateral oopherectomy. Only 37 cases have been reported in the English literature. We present a thorough review with an emphasis on the clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options in the management of this rare clinical entity.
