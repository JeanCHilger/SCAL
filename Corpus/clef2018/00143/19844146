A case of atypical Solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Solid-psudopapillary tumor is an uncommon pancreatic neoplasm of low malignant potential that most frequently affect young woman. Solid-psudopapillary tumor are histologically, clinically, and prognostically quite distinct from the more common ductal adenocarcinoma. Recently, we experienced a 36-year-old male who was suspected to have extrapancreatic tumor based on atypical radiologic imaging study, young age, and male sex, and finally diagnosed as solid-psudopapillary tumor on immunohistochemical stain examination. We report this case with review of the relevant literatures.
