Successful treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with combination chemotherapy regimens. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Current 5-year survival is less than 4%, highlighting the dire need for effective treatment. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced metastatic well-to-moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, involving the liver and peritoneal cavity. She agreed to receive novel combination chemotherapy rather than the standard-of-care treatment. This patient was treated with three unique combination regimens. Complete response of multiple liver and peritoneal metastases and reduction in size with increasing calcification of the pancreatic mass occurred in this patient after 18 months of treatment. This report documents the individual response to effective and well-tolerated treatment regimens integrating available drugs.
