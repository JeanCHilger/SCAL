Efficacy of camostat mesilate against dyspepsia associated with non-alcoholic mild pancreatic disease. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential efficacy of camostat mesilate, a protease inhibitor, against dyspepsia associated with non-alcoholic mild pancreatic disease.Patients with upper abdominal pain suggesting pancreatic disease (persistent over hours, pain aggravated by ingestion of food, epigastric pain radiating to the back), without a history of alcohol consumption and who exhibited no abnormalities regarding serum amylase and lipase, ultrasonography, CT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, were prescribed 200 mg camostat mesilate three times daily for 2 weeks. The patients were subjected to endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) while under treatment and were distributed into those who had 4 or more suggestive findings of chronic pancreatitis (suspected pancreatic disease group), 2 or 3 (equivalent group) and those with 1 or no findings (control group). Symptom severity was recorded before and after treatment using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS).Among 95 patients, 40 were in the suspected pancreatic disease group, 30 were in the equivalent group and 25 served as controls. A significant intra- and intergroup improvement of symptoms was observed not only in the suspected pancreatic disease group but also in the equivalent group.Camostat mesilate may serve as a therapeutic agent for patients with dyspepsia associated with mild pancreatic disease, who do not habitually drink alcohol.
