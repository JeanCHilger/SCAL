Use of three-dimensional ultrasound visualization in differential diagnosis of pancreatic head diseases. Retrospective analysis of 3D-reconstruction of ultrasound images is discussed with reference to the diagnosis of pancreatic disorders, such as pseudotumorous pancreatitis and pancreatic head neoplasm, based on the data extracted from case records collected in the Central Clinical Hospital No 1, OJSC RZhD, for the period of 2004-2008. In addition, comparative analysis is presented of different beam diagnostics methods for the examination of hepatobiliary system (classical ultrasound, 3D-reconstruction of ultrasound images, CT, endoscopic techniques, e.g. retrograde cholangiopancreatography). Control group comprised 20 patients without signs of gastrointestinal pathology, group 2 included 24 patients with pseudotumorous pancreatitis, group 3 54 patients with pancreatic head neoplasm (up to 3 cm). It was shown that 3D-images facilitate detection of pathologic processes in the pancreas. Minimal slice thickness permits to visualize small objects, segmentation of irregularly shaped tumorous foci and their volume. This method gives better idea of the relationship between the tumour and other tissues and vessels than other diagnostic tools and thereby makes easier the choice of treatment strategy and prognosis of its outcome. Also, it improves the quality of information about arterial and venous circulation and permits to differentiate between benign and malignant tumours.
