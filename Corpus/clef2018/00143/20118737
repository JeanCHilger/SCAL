Difficult diagnosis of atypical cystic pancreatic lesions in von Hippel-Lindau disease. von Hippel-Lindau disease is a progressive, autosomal dominant disorder with multiorgan involvement. There are 2 types of pancreatic lesions from von Hippel-Lindau disease: cystic lesions and endocrine pancreatic tumors. Only the latter type is potentially malignant and may justify pancreatic resection. The differential diagnosis between these 2 types of lesions can be difficult. We report 3 patients with atypical cystic pancreatic lesions who underwent surgery for suspected malignant tumors. The pathological-radiological correlations and the diagnostic and management strategies are discussed.
