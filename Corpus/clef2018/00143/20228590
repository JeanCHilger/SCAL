Total pancreatectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma with marked extension into the main pancreatic duct. A 59-year-old man who had undergone left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 14 years previously was admitted for the treatment of obstructive jaundice. Imaging studies showed head-to-tail dilation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and a few ring-shaped enhanced nodules. Main duct-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm was suspected and total pancreatectomy was performed. Pathologically, the entire length of MPD was filled with tumor. It consisted mainly of necrotic material, but included some clear cell carcinoma the final diagnosis was metastatic RCC of the pancreas. This is an extremely rare case of pancreatic metastasis from RCC, with marked extension into MPD.
