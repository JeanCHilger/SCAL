Multifocal extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of pancreas head. A 66-year-old-woman was hospitalized with acute pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice, and tumor of the upper arm in September, 2008. At first, we diagnosed primary pancreatic cancer involving left lung and hilar lymph node, left brachial muscle metastasis and dissemination to the left pleura, but the histological diagnosis of the upper arm tumor was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In addition, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy from the pancreatic tumor showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the same as the upper arm tumor. We experienced a rare case of multifocal extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma and EUS-FNA was useful for the diagnosis pancreatic tumor.
