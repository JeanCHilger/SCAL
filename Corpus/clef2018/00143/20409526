Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) intron 1 polymorphism and clinical outcome in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) intron 1 has a polymorphic region of CA repeats that is believed to be associated with increased EGFR expression, tumor aggressiveness, and worse survival in cancer patients.A large population of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients was investigated to evaluate this polymorphism as a potential prognostic marker of clinical outcome. Deoxyribonucleic acid obtained from 50 resected pancreatic adenocarcinomas and from 85 diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration procedures corresponding to patients with unresectable tumors was included. The correlation between CA repeat length and EGFR messenger ribonucleic acid levels was also examined.Analysis of the 135 patients revealed no correlation between EGFR intron 1 CA repeat length and tumor stage. There was no difference in overall patient survival when stratified by allele length. A correlation between EGFR intron 1 length and EGFR transcript and protein levels could not be established.The length of the EGFR intron 1 CA repeats does not correlate with levels of EGFR expression and cannot be used as marker of clinical prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients.
