Update in acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is a common cause for hospitalization that carries a substantial burden of disease in the United States and worldwide. Recent reports have encompassed a wide array of topics including new insights into the acinar cell pH microenvironment, signal pathways for acinar cell fate, and the innate immune response. Clinical researchers have reported new methods to assess disease severity, innovative techniques for management of local complications, the importance of early recognition of pancreatic or extrapancreatic infection, and prevention of disease recurrence. Recent data also suggest that specialized centers may be of benefit for the management of severe acute pancreatitis. This review summarizes a number of recent advances in basic and clinical science with an emphasis on findings that are relevant to clinicians who manage patients with acute pancreatitis.
