Diagnosis and assessment of pancreatic cancer. A precise, lenient and multidisciplinary pre-therapeutic evaluation is mandatory in order to reach an optimal treatment decision in patients with pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography, laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LAP/LUS) are used in the diagnosis, TNM-staging and resectability assessment of these patients. Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common tumour of the pancreas, and biopsies may be obtained during transabdominal ultrasound, EUS or LUS. However, preoperative confirmation of malignancy is not necessary unless chemo- or chemoradiation therapy is indicated.
