Pancreatic involvement detected with (18)F-FDG PET/CT in disseminated sarcoidosis. La sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. It may mimic malignancy and may affect multiple organs, with a variable clinical course. Pancreatic involvement is very rare. We present the case of a 78-year-old woman with systemic sarcoidosis whose (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan showed a pancreatic lesion and multiple lymphatic (thoracic and non-thoracic) and visceral lesions. The abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake in the pancreas was limited to the tail. A second (18)F-FDG PET/CT study performed 4 months and 3 weeks after the first PET/CT, following corticosteroid therapy during three and a half months, evidenced partial regression of the disease, with persistent (18)F-FDG pathological uptake in the pancreatic lesion.
