Combined duodenal stent placement and endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage for malignant duodenal obstruction with biliary stricture. Patients with malignant pancreatobiliary neoplasm sometimes manifest duodenal obstruction and biliary stricture synchronously or metachronously. In this paper, we reviewed our experience with and technique for combined endoscopic duodenal stent placement and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided biliary drainage. Between May 2007 and September 2009, this combined technique was performed on seven patients with distal biliary strictures and duodenal obstructions. The clinical success rate of the procedure, complications, patency periods of duodenal stents and patency periods of biliary stents were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical success was achieved in all seven cases for both procedures. Complications related to EUS-biliary drainage, namely localized peritonitis due to bile leakage, occurred in two cases. Both patients recovered without additional interventions. Occlusion of a duodenal stent was observed in one patient, but additional intervention could not be performed due to sepsis. Occlusion of both a duodenal stent and a biliary stent was also observed in one patient, and this was resolved with the insertion of an additional duodenal stent and a biliary stent exchange. In conclusion, combined duodenal stent placement and EUS-guided biliary drainage is a therapeutic option in case of failed endoscopic retrograde cannulation of malignant strictures with a malignant duodenal obstruction.
