Cystadenoma of the pancreas. Apropos of a case and review of the literature. With reference to a new case of pancreatic cystadenoma, the authors review the literature on the subject. These tumors are a relatively uncommon form of cystic lesion of the pancreas. They find the origin from pancreatic acinar cells or from ductal epithelium. Histologically, there are two different forms: benign, serous, microcystic adenoma and potentially malignant, mucinous, macrocystic adenoma. The type of the tumor is demonstrated by ultrasonography and computed tomography. but these examinations could not make a difference between benign and malignant form. Treatment of choice is complete tumor resection. Internal or external drainage of these cysts should not be done.
