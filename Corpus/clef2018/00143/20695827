Unusual locations of hydatid disease: diagnostic and surgical management of a case series. Hydatid disease is endemic in many areas of the world, where it is an important public health problem. The aim of this study was to describe a series of patients with atypically located primary hydatid disease, accompanied by a literature review.Six male and four female patients with atypically located hydatid cysts who presented to the Kars State Hospital between September 2004 and March 2008 were evaluated. The mean age was 42.5 years (range 17-72 years). Hydatid cysts were identified by using a combination of serology tests, ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT).Six of the patients underwent surgical treatment. Three patients (two with pericardial hydatid involvement and one with pancreatic involvement) were sent to a tertiary medical center for surgery, and one patient died from cardiac and renal failure two days after diagnosis.Although this disease is seen most often in the liver and lungs, it can be found in any part of the body. Hydatid disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions, especially in patients who have spent time in endemic areas.
