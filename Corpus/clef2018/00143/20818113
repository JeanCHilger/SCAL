Pancreas-preserving duodenal resections with bile and pancreatic duct replantation for duodenal dystrophy. Two case reports. Duodenal dystrophy is a rare disease, characterized by the chronic inflammation of the aberrant pancreatic tissue in the duodenal wall.Two middle-aged men were admitted with upper abdominal pain of several months duration, periodic nausea and vomiting after meals, intermittent jaundice and weight loss. A diagnosis of cystic dystrophy of the vertical part of the duodenum without chronic inflammation of the orthotopic pancreas was established in both cases by multi-detector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and endosonography. Both patients were successfully treated by two modifications of pancreas-preserving duodenal resections with reimplantation of the bile and pancreatic ducts into the neoduodenum.These cases are a good example of a pancreas-preserving approach to duodenal dystrophy treatment and can be an alternative to the Whipple procedure in cases of mild changes of the orthotopic gland.
