Primary pancreatic lymphoma diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy. Although primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is a rare malignant tumor, the correct diagnosis is essential since their therapeutic management differs from other pancreatic tumors. The fine needle aspiration cytology guided by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS-FNA) is currently the preferred technique for the diagnosis of neoplasms of the pancreas, being of particular interest in those pancreatic lesions with atypical characteristics or presentation. However, the usefulness of EUS-FNA in the PPL has been poorly studied because of the rarity of this entity. We report a case of a patient with HIV infection and PPL diagnosed by EUS-FNA.
