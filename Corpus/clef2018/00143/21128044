Right posterior branch draining into intra-pancreatic common duct: the triple duct sign. Simultaneous dilatation of pancreatic duct (PD) and common bile duct (CBD) is often seen on radio imaging in pancreatic head malignancy or chronic pancreatitis. This is called double duct sign. However, dilatation of aberrant bile duct along with PD and CBD resulting in triple duct sign on radio imaging has not been reported in literature till date. We report a case of 45 years old male with surgical jaundice due to pancreatic head mass. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed three dilated ducts in the head of pancreas. Besides PD and biliary duct, the third duct was pre-operatively thought to be long cystic duct with low insertion in common hepatic duct (CHD). Intra-operative findings revealed an unusually long and dilated aberrant right posterior sectoral duct with low insertion into intra-pancreatic CHD. Patient underwent Whipple's procedure with two separate biliary anastomosis besides pancreaticojejunostomy. Histopathology of specimen revealed chronic pancreatitis. Retrospective analysis shows that Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) should have been done for correct pre-operative delineation of this anatomical anomaly. In conclusion, pre-operative detection of triple duct dilatation on CT scan should be further investigated with MRCP for anatomical variations of the biliary tract. This can guide operative planning and prevent inadvertent biliary injuries.
