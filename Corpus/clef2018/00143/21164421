Improvement of endoscopic treatment of the acute cholecystitis. Treatment results of 763 patients with acute cholecystitis were analyzed. Destructive forms of the disease was diagnosed by the ultrasound examination in all cases. Choledocholithiasis was diagnosed in 35 (4.6%), choledocholithiasis with papilla Vatery stricture was in 9 (1.2%) patients and isolated papilla Vatery stricture was registered in 5 (0.7%) patients. All patients were attempted to treat laparoscopically with the use of original "Device for antegrade papillotomy" and "Method of antegrade bipolar papillosphincterotomy". Authors state, that a final decision about the possibility of endoscopic treatment of the acute cholecystitis can be made after detection of anatomical structures of the Calo triangle. By complicated forms of the disease a one-stage laparoscopic treatment should be preferred. Endoscopic papillosphincterotomy should be performed only by the enblocked concrement of the papilla Vatery.
