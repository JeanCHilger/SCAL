Simultaneous double thymic carcinoids: a rare initial manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of two anterior mediastinal tumors. The anterior mediastinal tumors were resected by thymectomy under the probable diagnosis of double thymomas. The final pathological diagnosis was multiple thymic carcinoids. Although 20%-25% of patients with thymic carcinoid have a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), radiographic screening just after the operation did not detect any endocrine tumors. However, the patient had a urinary calculus 4 months 7 months after the operation. Endocrinological examination then revealed mild hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperprolactinemia. Radiologically, a parathyroid tumor and a pancreatic tumor were found. The patient was referred to a university hospital and a mutation of MEN-1 gene was detected. The diagnosis of MEN-1 was confirmed about 1 year after the operation.
