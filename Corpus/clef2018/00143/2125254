Evaluation of non-invasive diagnostic tests in detecting cancer of the pancreas. Monoclonal antibody defined antigen (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), ultrasonography (US) and computerized tomography (CT) were carried out as the tests in 113 patients suspected to have pancreatic cancer. Of 98 patients who underwent operation, 55 were found to have pancreatic cancer, 25 benign pancreatic disease, and 18 cancer of the biliary tract. Follow-up study was carried out for more than 1 year in 15 other patients suffering from pancreatitis without surgical intervention. The accuracy of CA19-9, US, CEA and CT was 87%, 69%, 61% and 56% respectively. The sensitivity of each test was CA19-9, 98% US, 89%
