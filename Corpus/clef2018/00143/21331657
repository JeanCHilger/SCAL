MR imaging of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the liver. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, also known as pseudolymphoma or nodular lymphoid lesion of the liver, is a rare benign lesion. It is mainly detected in the lung, stomach, small intestine, orbit, pancreas, skin, and breast. It remains difficult to distinguish reactive lymphoid hyperplasia from malignant disease clinically when it develops in the liver.We have recently encountered a patient with liver reactive lymphoid hyperplasia who had undergone colon cancer surgery.Preoperative MR imaging showed some useful findings indicating reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.
