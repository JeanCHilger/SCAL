A case of pancreatic mucinous carcinoma with special reference to diagnostic usefulness of contrast enhanced ultrasonography. A 72-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further investigation of pancreatic mass. Ultrasonography revealed hypoechoic mass with hyperechoic and aechoic area. Contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US) revealed a vascular image in the lesion. CT showed some enhanced parts of low density mass in the pancreatic body, which was recognized as low-, high- and relatively high-intensity mass on T1-, T2-WI MRI and MRCP, respectively. The final pathological diagnosis showed mucinous carcinoma. CE-US may be useful for diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma.
