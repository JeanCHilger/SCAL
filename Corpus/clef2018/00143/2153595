Lymphoma in the wall of the bile ducts: radiologic imaging. Extranodal lymphoma is not uncommon however, lymphomatous involvement of the wall of the bile duct is rare, with only a few case reports available. Three cases were imaged with computed tomography (CT) and direct cholangiography at our institution. In one, Hodgkin disease recurred in the duct wall, producing a radiographic pattern indistinguishable from sclerosing cholangitis. In another, central sclerosis on cholangiography was associated with a separate liver mass identified by CT. This presentation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma mimicked cholangiocarcinoma. The third patient had multifocal, diffuse histiocytic lymphoma arising in the gallbladder and cystic duct, as well as in the kidneys and pancreas. Although the condition is unusual, the diagnosis of lymphoma in the bile duct wall should be considered, particularly when the cholangiographic picture of diffuse central sclerosis is associated with little or no observable mass on CT.
