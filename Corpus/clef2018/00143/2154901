Value of tumor localization in patients with insulinoma. Based on our patient material, preoperative localization of insulinoma was correct with sonography in 13 (61.9%) of 21 patients, with computed tomography in 3 (21.4%) of 14 patients, with computed tomography with bolus injection of contrast medium in 11 (73.3%) of 15 patients, with angiography in 20 (66.6%) of 30 patients, and with percutaneous transhepatic portal vein catheterization with selective measurement of insulin in 10 (76.9%) of 13 patients. Intraoperatively, 40 (95.2%) of 42 insulinomas were palpable and 12 of 16 insulinomas were identified during intraoperative sonography. Although 95.2% of the insulinomas can be palpated, we would support additional diagnostic localization since it may improve the reliability of palpation.
