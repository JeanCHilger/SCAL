Duodenal diverticulum associated with annular pancreas: a rare cause of severe cholangitis. Duodenal diverticulum is a common occurrence but most are asymptomatic. However, in some cases, they can cause mechanical biliary compression. We report the case of a duodenal diverticulum in a 64-year-old woman revealed by severe cholangitis with septic shock and a liver abscess. Associated annular pancreas was found. We discuss the various investigations to diagnose these two entities as well as the therapeutic strategy in this unique combination of disease.
