Pseudopapillary tumor in pediatric age: clinical and surgical management. Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are rare exocrine pancreatic tumors. Through a review of pediatric cases in a single Institution, we present the clinical and surgical management of this neoplasm.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts of patients treated at our unit between 1995 and 2009 for SPT. Clinical and surgical management were analyzed and reported.During the study period 11 patients underwent surgery for pseudopapillary tumor. Five patients were treated with duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection and six patients with splenopancreasectomy with a Roux-en-Y pancreatic jejunostomy. Patients did not show recurrence and are currently disease free. Blood tests, Ultrasound, Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging were not useful to preoperatively identify the nature of the pancreatic masses.Solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rare condition that should be taken into account for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses in pediatric age. Due to its favourable prognosis, surgical removal should be planned and done following the intraoperative findings.
