Role of endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in diagnosing metastasis to the pancreas: a tertiary center experience. Metastasis to the pancreas (MP) is a rare entity that is difficult to identify by imaging alone. Few reports have described endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) findings. Herein, we try to describe the EUS and EUS-FNA characteristics of MP.This retrospective study compared 28 patients with MP (13 males mean age: 60.1 Â± 12.6 years) and 60 control patients (30 malesMultivariate logistic regression revealed that the presence of regular borders (p = 0.004 OR: 8.81, 95% CI: 1.97-39.4), the absence of retention cysts (p = 0.045The presence of regular borders, the absence of retention cysts and the presence of nondilated MPD on EUS indicate MP rather than PDAC. This diagnosis can be accurately confirmed by EUS-FNA with immunostaining and/or K-ras analysis.
