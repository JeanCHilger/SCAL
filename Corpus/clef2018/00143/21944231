Elastography in the evaluation of chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an essential tool in the evaluation of pancreatic disease and can be considered the technique of choice for the diagnosis and staging of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and pancreatic cancer (PC). However, EUS has certain limitations, especially in the evaluation of patients with solid pancreatic masses (in the differential diagnosis of CP and PC). Furthermore there is variability in the EUS diagnostic criteria for CP. EUS-guided elastography is emerging as a highly useful tool in this setting. This modality has shown high diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses, including differentiation between CP and PC. EUS-guided elastography has also been found to be useful in the diagnosis of CP, and can even classify patients according to the severity of their disease.
