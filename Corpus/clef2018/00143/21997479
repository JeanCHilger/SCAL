EUS-FNA mutational analysis in differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) may mimic pancreatic cancer (PC). The detection of DNA mutations in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) material may improve discrimination between AIP and PC and is the context for this study.In a retrospective study, archived EUS-FNA material from patients with AIP and PC at two centers was analyzed for KRAS mutations and loss-of-heterozygosity analysis involving 18 microsatellite markers. KRAS status and the fractional allelic loss (number of affected microsatellites divided by informative ones) were compared for AIP and PC.Thirty-two patients with 33 samples were studied. There were 16 patients with AIP (17 samples) and 16 patients with PC. DNA amplification failed in 7 samples. Of 25 patients (26 samples), 14 had AIP (7 male, age 57 ± 17 years mean ± SD) and 11 had PC (7 male, age 65 ± 14 yearsA KRAS mutation in EUS/FNA material from a pancreatic mass is associated with malignancy and may help discriminate from benign conditions such as AIP.
