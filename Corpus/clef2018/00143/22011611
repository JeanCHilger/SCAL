Pancreatic ectopia. Pancreatic ectopia (PE) consists in the existence of pancreatic tissue outside its usual location in the normal pancreas. This rare condition, with an uncertain incidence, occurs most often in the stomach, duodenum and jejunum. The ectopic pancreas is usually asymptomatic but it may become clinically significant when it becomes affected with the same kind of complications which affect the normal pancreas - inflammation, bleeding, obstruction of the anatomic structure where it is located and malignant transformation. As the most common site of this kind of lesion is the submucosa, endoscopic ultrasonography is the most useful exam in its characterization the final diagnosis is, however, histological. Surgical resection is indicated in symptomatic cases and when there is malignant transformation of the lesion. In this article the author presents a clinical case of gastric PE and makes a theoretical review about this entity, its etiopathogenesis, semiology, method of diagnosis and therapy, noting the indications and surgical options to treat this rare condition.
