Current therapy of the pancreato-pleural fistula. This case report summarizes therapeutic options for the management of pancreato-pleural fistula (PPF) following a successful conservative treatment of one of our patients. PPF is a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. The main aetiological factor is alcohol, which causes relapse of chronic pancreatitis associated with dyspnoea. Diagnosis is confirmed by physical examinations, laboratory tests of pleural fluid as well as ERCP being the most important diagnostic procedure. Conservative treatment of PPF consists of endoscopic therapy (endoscopic sphincterotomy with stenting of the pancreatic duct), octreotid combined with continuous enteral nutrition (jejunal feeding). If the above complex therapy fails, surgical treatment of PPF is advised.
