Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas in a pregnant woman. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm of low malignant potential that mostly affects young women in the second or third decade of life. The number of such patients reported in the literature has increased in recent years, while SPT in pregnancy is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of SPT in pregnancy has been reported in the English-language literature. We herein report a case of asymptomatic SPT in a 26-year-old Chinese female in the 14th week of pregnancy, and present our experience of the surgical management of SPT in pregnancy.
