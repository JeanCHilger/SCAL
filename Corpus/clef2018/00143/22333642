A case of pancreatic cancer with celiac trunk and common hepatic artery invasion successfully resected after gemcitabine+S-1therapy. We present a case of a 59-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital for upper abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with pancreatic body carcinoma by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We started gemcitabine+S-1 chemotherapy because the tumor had invaded the celiac trunk, common hepatic artery, superior mesenteric vein, and splenic vein. We reduced the S-1 to 100mg/body after the third course of gemcitabine(1, 000mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, every 21 days)+S-1(120mg/body on days 1-14, every 21 days)because of side effects. The tumor became smaller, and the celiac trunk and common hepatic artery were released. Thus, we conducted a distal pancreatectomy with a D2 lymph node dissection.
