Pancreatic arteriovenous malformation: a case report and literature review. Most pancreatic arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) present due to gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal pain, but these patients may be asymptomatic. Increased portal vein flow from these malformations can lead to portal hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis is often made by imaging, and early diagnosis has led to successful surgical resection or percutaneous embolization. We report a patient with PAVM, diagnosed by CT and angiography, who has remained asymptomatic for 2 years without treatment.
