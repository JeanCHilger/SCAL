Solid pseudopapillary tumours of the pancreas: spectrum of imaging findings with histopathological correlation. Solid pseudopapillary tumour (SPT) is an uncommon cystic exocrine pancreatic neoplasm. The typical patient is a female in the third decade of life presenting with pain and/or palpable mass. Classic imaging characteristics include large size, mixed solid and cystic nature, encapsulation and haemorrhage. A pancreatic mass with these features in a young adult female should raise suspicion for an SPT. Although typically a non-aggressive neoplasm with surgery curative in most cases, SPT may exhibit more aggressive features such as local invasion, metastases or recurrence in up to 20% of cases.
