F-18 FDG uptake in borderline intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPN-B) has been recently proposed as the biliary counterpart of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas. Histologically, IPN-B can be classified into adenoma, borderline, carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma. Two patients with suspected intraductal tumor underwent fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. One patient showed an FDG-avid tumor in the right liver with SUV(max) of 9.4 in early images and 11.3 in delayed images. The patient underwent complete tumor resection. Adenoma with high-grade dysplasia was confirmed by pathology. The other patient showed an FDG-avid polypoid lesion at the distal common bile duct with SUV(max) of 5.4. The lesion was endoscopically resected. Histopathologic findings showed adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. These two cases highlight that IPN-B should be included in the differential diagnosis of abnormal biliary intraductal FDG accumulation along with carcinoma, and inflammatory and infectious processes.
