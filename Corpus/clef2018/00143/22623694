Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: variability of diffusion-weighted MR imaging findings. To compare the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of pancreatic adenocarcinomas that appear hyperintense with clearly defined borders (clear hyperintense) with those that do not show clear hyperintense borders on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived. Eighty patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mean tumor size, 32 mm) underwent fat-suppressed single-shot echo-planar 3.0-T diffusion-weighted MR imaging with diffusion gradients (b = 1000 sec/mm(2)). ADC values of the pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n = 80) and proximal (n = 51) and distal (n = 70) pancreas were compared by using the Friedman test, followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the difference in serum amylase levels between pancreatic adenocarcinomas with and without clear hyperintensity was evaluated by using the x(2) test.In 38 of 80 patients, pancreatic adenocarcinomas showed clear hyperintensity relative to the surrounding pancreas 26 were hyperintense with unclear distal bordersDiffusion-weighted MR imaging was not useful for delineating 47% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, because of hyperintensity of the pancreatic parenchyma distal to the cancer.
