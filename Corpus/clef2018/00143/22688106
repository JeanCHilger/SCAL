Malignant phyllodes tumor metastatic to the pancreas: a case report. A woman in her 50s was admitted with obstructive jaundice due to a pancreatic mass. She had a history of a right breast phyllodes tumor treated with mastectomy 3 years previously. Diagnostic imaging (endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), CT, and MRI) demonstrated a well-demarcated mass in the pancreatic head. EUS-FNA showed spindle shaped tumor cells. The pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen showed a malignant spindle cell tumor consistent with a metastatic malignant phyllodes tumor. In addition, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the staining pattern of pancreatic tumor was similar to that of the breast phyllodes tumor. Pancreatic metastases from breast phyllodes tumors have rarely been reported in the literature.
