A case of spontaneous mesenteric hematoma and a review of 17 cases in Japan. A 47 year-old male was admitted to Miyazaki Medical college Hospital for further evaluation of an abdominal mass in the left upper quadrant. Abdominal ultrasound (US) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed two cystic masses in the mesenterium, which were suspected to be hematomas, but were not related to the pancreas, kidney or spleen. Superior mesenteric artery angiography and gallium (GA)-scintigraphy showed no definite findings. The patient underwent laparotomy on a suspicion of mesenteric hematoma. Two 4 x 3 x 3 cm soft tumors were found in the small intestinal mesenterium. These masses were histopathologically hematomas and surrounded by thick collagenous granulation tissue. The patient had no recent history of abdominal trauma, taking drugs capable of producing bleeding tendency, and/or vascular disease. The case was diagnosed as spontaneous mesenteric hematoma.
