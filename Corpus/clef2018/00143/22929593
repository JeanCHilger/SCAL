Charcot neuroarthropathy after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant. Immunosuppressive regimen is associated with several metabolic adverse effects. Bone loss and fractures are frequent after transplantation and involve multifactorial mechanisms.A retrospective analysis of 130 patients submitted to simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) and an identification of risk factors involved in de novo Charcot neuroarthropathy by multivariate analysis were used P<0.05 was considered significant.Charcot neuroarthropathy was diagnosed in 4.6% of SPKT recipients during the first year. Cumulative glucocorticoid doses (daily dose plus methylprednisolone pulse) during the first 6 months both adjusted to body weight (>78 mg/kg) and not adjusted to body weight were associated with Charcot neuroarthropathy (P=0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively). Age, gender, race, time on dialysis, time of diabetes history, and posttransplantation hyperparathyroidism were not related to Charcot neuroarthropathy after SPKT.Glucocorticoids are the main risk factors for de novo Charcot neuroarthropathy after SPKT. Protocols including glucocorticoid avoidance or minimization should be considered.
