Eosinophilic pancreatitis: report of a case. A case of relapsing pancreatitis in a young man is presented. Stenosis of the main duct and cystic lesions of the tail of the pancreas were shown by ultrasonography, CT scan, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). After a wrong diagnosis of cancer, the pathological examination demonstrated an eosinophilic infiltration of the pancreatic tail, spleen, lymph nodes, and spleen flexure of the colon. After treatment with oral cromoglycate, the previously increased rate of polynuclear eosinophils in blood returned to normal. Similar observations were found in the medical literature.
