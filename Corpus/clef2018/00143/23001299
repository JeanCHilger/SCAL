Composite paraganglioma and ganglioneuroma in the retroperitoneum: a case report. Reports of a composite paraganglioma (PG) and ganglioneuroma (GN) in the retroperitoneum are rare. In the present case, dynamic computed tomographic (CT) findings showed a 30 × 22 × 20 mm tumor that was located in the retroperitoneum and which was dissociated from pancreatic tissue and the left adrenal gland. The markedly reddish tumor showed a clear margin and central multicystic changes on the cut surface. The tumor was composed of two major components, the PG and the GN. The paraganglionic cells in the PG component, which were arranged in a nested pattern, occupied the main and central part of the tumor. Both ganglionic cells and Schwann cells in the GN were located in a unorganized pattern in the periphery. The paraganglionic cells exhibited a Zellballen pattern, which consisted of an association of edematous vascular-rich stroma and focal hemorrhage, resulting in multicystic changes. These centrally located tumor cells were pleomorphic in part and did not have mitotic figures. In the periphery, Schwann cells, which were arranged in an obscure and fascicular pattern that was intermingled with large ganglionic cells, were located adjacent to the PG component with a mostly sharp margin. With higher magnification, the border was not as sharp, as revealed especially with chromogranin-A immunostain, in which both the PG and GN components were focally intermingled with each other. The histogenesis of the composite PG and GN was thought to be extraadrenal neural crest cells in the retroperitoneum because the tumor was not located in the adrenal gland or the Zuckerkandl organ, according to the CT findings. The immunohistochemical findings of this rare case of a composite PG and GN in the retroperitoneum are reported with a focus on the peculiar arrangement of these two components.
