Peripancreatic schwannoma. The extrapancreatic nerve plexus may give rise to schwannomas. The aim of this study was to define the clinicopathologic features of peripancreatic schwannoma and to allow improved diagnosis and treatment for this condition.A retrospective analysis was performed on 17 patients with pathologically proven peripancreatic schwannoma (defined as schwannoma in anatomic proximity to the pancreas) treated at our hospital between 1995 and 2011.The patient group included 9 men and 8 women between the ages of 26 and 67 years. The tumor size ranged from 2.5 to 13 cm. Tumor locations were the pancreatic head plexus in 5 patients, the superior mesenteric plexus in 3, the pancreatic head and superior mesenteric plexus in 2, the celiac plexus in 4, and the splenic plexus in 3. The main symptoms were vague abdominal pain (n = 5 29.4%) and abdominal mass (n = 2Most peripancreatic schwannomas are benign. Peripancreatic schwannoma may often be accurately diagnosed before surgery by its typical location and CT or MRI findings. Total resection is important for treatment, and no recurrences are seen when resection is complete. Prognosis after total resection is extremely good.
