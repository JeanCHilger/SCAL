The clinical application of new methods of magnetic resonance tomography. MR-tomography was used for investigation of 129 patients with various diseases of the kidneys, liver, pancreas, organs of the small pelvis, brain and spinal marrow. Possibilities of the use and practical value of new MRT methods--MR-urography and MR-myelography (MRu and MRm) were studied. They made it possible to detect within a short period of time (40-60 sec.) the presence of fluid in an examined volume. MRu was the most informative method in cystic lesions of various organs looking like round-shaped formations with a high intensity signal. MRm was highly informative in the diagnosis of syringomyelia, informative for the determination of the state of the brain ventricular system. MRm performed in different planes and their summation with images of common MR-sections makes the interpretation of the obtained data much easier. MRm is desirable in suspected fluid in an examined volume or in order to specify the state of the cerebral liquor system.
