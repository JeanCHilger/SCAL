Hydatid cyst of the pancreas. About 12 cases. Pancreatic localization of hydatid disease is atypical and extremely rare it accounts for less than 1% of cases. Preoperative diagnosis may be difficult regarding the absence of clinical or radiological signs.We report a retrospective study of twelve cases of hydatid cyst of the pancreas over a period of 30 years (1980 to 2010). By means of our study we try to clarify clinical manifestation, radiological features and therapeutic modalities.The twelve patients consisted on eight men and four women with an average age of 25.8 years. Abdominal pain was the most frequent clinical signs. Jaundice was noted in 4 cases and abdominal mass in 2 cases. Hydatid serology, practiced in 7 cases was positive in 6 cases. Abdominal ultrasound, practiced in 11 cases, completed in 7 cases by abdominal computed tomography (CT), showed cystic lesions in 10 cases, in 7 cases the cystic lesion was dependent of the pancreas. All patients were operated by median laparotomy. Partial cystectomy was performed in six cases, cystic punture in one case, pancreaticoduodenectomy one case, distal spleno pancreatectomy in 2 cases, distal pancreatectomy in one case and trans-duodenal puncture of the cyst in 2 cases with pancreatico-duodenal anastomosis in one case.Hydatid cyst of the pancreas is extremely rare even in endemic countries, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of the pancreas. Ultrasound and CT coupled with hydatid serology could be helpful for the diagnosis. Surgery remains the treatment of choice in pancreatic hydatid cysts.
