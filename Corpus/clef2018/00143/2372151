X-ray computed tomography and percutaneous drainage change the indications for reoperation after digestive surgery. In order to assess the major clinical biological and radiological signs of an intra-abdominal abscess following digestive surgery as well as the place of automatic reoperation, this retrospective study analysed 79 patients requiring intensive therapy for such a complication since 1982. Surgery consisted in oesophagectomy (n = 38), hepatectomy or cholecystectomy (n = 12), pancreatic surgery (n = 17) and colectomy (n = 12). A postoperative abdominal abscess was recognized in 75 patients consisting in intrathoracic or intra-abdominal oesophageal fistulas (n = 31), pancreatic abscesses and fistulas (n = 17), peri- or intrahepatic abscesses (n = 11), colonic fistulas (n = 12) and acalculous cholecystitis. With regard to the intensity of symptomatology the patients have been allocated into 2 groups. In group I, including 12 patients, the infectious syndrome occurred early (3 first postoperative days), was severe and associated with positive blood cultures in 60% of cases. The patients were reoperated without previous CT-scanography. Four died postoperatively. In group II, including 67 patients, the symptomatology was more discrete. CT-scanography was highly beneficial, with discovery of an abscess in 90% of cases. In 20 patients, the abscess has been punctured and drained successfully by percutaneous route. In 6 patients with negative CT-scanography, an automatic reoperation resulted in the discovery of an abscess in 2 cases. Five out of 6 of these patients died postoperatively. It is concluded that in case of intraabdominal complication following digestive surgery: a) in case of early and severe symptomatology, a rapid reoperation is mandatory b) CT-scanography has a high diagnostic value for abscess recognition in patients with discrete and delayed symptomatology
