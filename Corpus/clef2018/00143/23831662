A case of intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma found with acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis and liver abscess, and associated with a pancreatobiliary fistula. We report a rare case of intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma (IPMC) with acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis (AOSPD), liver abscess, and pancreatobiliary fistula formation. A man in his sixties was admitted to our hospital with a chief complain of high grade fever and anorexia. CT and MRI revealed a multilocular cystic lesion in the pancreatic head, fistula formation between the common bile duct and this cystic lesion, and multiple liver abscess. We performed endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage for the AOSPD, endoscopic biliary drainage for the biliary flow obstruction, and percutaneous transhepatic drainage for the liver abscess. Klebsiella pneumoniae was detected in the culture of pancreatic juice and liver abscess, but not in the bile and blood culture. These culture studies revealed that the liver abscess was caused by AOSPD. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for the IPMC. The pathological diagnosis was IPMC.
