Management of blunt pancreatic trauma in children. Blunt trauma to the abdomen accounts for the majority of abdominal injuries in children. Pancreatic injury is the fourth most common solid organ injury, following injuries to the spleen, liver and kidneys. The most common complications are the formation of pancreatic fistulae, pancreatitis and the development of pancreatic pseudocysts, which usually present several weeks after injury. The nonoperative management of minor pancreatic injury is well accepted however, the treatment of more serious pancreatic injuries with capsular, ductal or parenchymal disruption in pediatric patients remains controversial. Based on the data presented in this literature review, although children with pancreatic injuries (without ductal disruption) do not appear to suffer increased morbidity following conservative management, patients with ductal disruption may benefit from operative intervention.
