Contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT and MRI findings of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas. The objective was to retrospectively study computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas (PASC).Twelve patients (six women and six men mean age, 61.3 yearsMasses were distributed throughout the pancreas (head, n=6 body, n=1PASC typically presented as an ill-defined, hypovascular mass with a poorly enhanced area, exophytic tendency, and peripancreatic tissue invasion. Lack of pancreatic atrophy and mild MPD dilatation were also distinct from common duct pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
