Abdominal catastrophes and other unusual events in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. Primary bacterial peritonitis and catheter-associated infections compose the large majority of abdominal events in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Yet occasionally primary pathology involving the abdominal viscera develops, and surgery is frequently considered. The early manifestations of intraabdominal inflammation or bleeding in patients undergoing CAPD depend on the pathological process, its access to the peritoneal cavity, and whether generalized bacterial peritonitis supervenes to obscure helpful physical findings. Clear dialysate is not a reliable sign that major pathology is absent, nor does initial stabilization of the clinical course with antibiotic therapy uniformly indicate that surgery will not be necessary. Polymicrobial peritonitis may develop in cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or from a colonic source, the latter featuring more bacterial species and more gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. A history directed at progression of symptoms and sites of abdominal discomfort and an examination for deep local tenderness and bowel incarcerated in an abdominal wall hernia are essential. Measurement of dialysate amylase and Gram stain of dialysate for food fibers may be helpful. Imaging techniques such as abdominal radiographs for dilated bowel or free subdiaphragmatic air, ultrasonography of the gallbladder or pancreas, computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the lower abdomen, and water-soluble contrast colonic studies may help identify the pathologic process. Special studies such as these should be considered early in the course of suspected unusual abdominal events in patients on CAPD.
