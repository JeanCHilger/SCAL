Radiologic resectability assessment in pancreatic cancer. Complete tumor resection is still the only potentially curative therapy option for patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Surgical exploration is the gold standard for the determination of tumor resectability. Radiological resectability assessment is of great importance because many clearly unresectable cases can be identified preoperatively and it became essential for surgical planning. The evolving surgical and radiological techniques demand a continuous reappraisal of radiological criteria in resectability assessment. In the following, the criteria for resection planning are described along with surgical management and the role of radiology in some innovative surgical concepts is explained.
