Conservative management of a ruptured inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm associated with celiac artery occlusion. A 45-year-old female presented at our hospital with a one-day history of upper abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed that the root of the celiac artery was obstructed and that a large hematoma was present in the retroperitoneum. The patient was diagnosed with retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with the rupture of an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, which was caused by increased blood flow in the pancreaticoduodenal arterial arcade. Because the patient's general condition was stable, she was managed conservatively and discharged on achieving remission after a month. Follow-up CT revealed spontaneous resolution of the celiac artery obstruction and aneurysm. The celiac artery obstruction in this case was assumed to be caused by segmental arterial mediolysis.
