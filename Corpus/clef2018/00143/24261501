Case 200: Gastric enterochromaffinlike cell tumors in a patient with type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia. History A 55-year-old man presented with chronic epigastric pain lasting for about 1 year and without fever or vomiting. The abdomen was soft and tender at physical examination. Laboratory tests revealed unremarkable liver function, normal hemoglobin level, and normal amylase level. White blood cell count was normal, and there was no inflammatory syndrome. The patient's medical history included pancreatic gastrinoma resected by means of left pancreatectomy 31 years before, hyperparathyroidism treated with subtotal parathyroidectomy 24 years before, and a slowly growing lung mass known for 9 years. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed because of a suspected gastroduodenal ulcer. The results showed numerous small (<10 mm) gastric and duodenal ulcers and multiple 10-15-mm polypoid gastric masses. Contrast material-enhanced dual-phase multidetector row computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen was performed with a 64-section CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis). Technical parameters for CT were as follows: pitch, 0.98
