Differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma using dual-phase computed tomography. This article aimed to study features on dual-phase computed tomography (CT) that help differentiate autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) from pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA).The CTs of 32 patients with AIP were matched with equal number of PA and were independently evaluated by 3 radiologists who assigned a diagnosis of AIP, PA, or unsure. Interobserver agreement between radiologists was evaluated using κ statistics.The mean accuracies for diagnosing AIP and PA were 68% and 83%, respectively. There was moderate agreement between radiologists (κ, 0.58 P < 0.0001). The most common findings for AIP were common bile duct (CBD) stricture (63%), bile duct wall hyperenhancement (47%), and diffuse parenchymal enlargement (41%). The most common findings for PA were focal mass (78%Diffuse enlargement, hypoenhancement, and characteristic peripancreatic halo are strong indicators for a diagnosis of AIP. Radiologists demonstrated moderate agreement in distinguishing AIP from PA on the basis of CT imaging.
