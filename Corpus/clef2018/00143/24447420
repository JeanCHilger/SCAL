Single-energy low-voltage arterial phase MDCT scanning increases conspicuity of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. To test a single-energy low-voltage CT protocol for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.A total of 30 patients with pathology-proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent 64-row MDCT with arterial phase at 80 kV and were compared to a similar group of 30 patients scanned with a 120 kV protocol. Scans were compared for quantitative image parameters (attenuation and standard deviation in the pancreas, tumor, aorta), CTDI and DLP using an unpaired t-test. Image noise values for each protocol (SD of the psoas) were compared using an unpaired t-test. Effective dose was calculated for each protocol. CNR (=conspicuity/SDnoise) and FOM (CNR2/ED) were calculated. The Catphan600 phantom was used to evaluate image non-uniformity, noise, spatial resolution, and low contrast detectability.Mean patient weight was 68 kg in the study group and 73 kg in the control group (p=0.0355), while patient diameters at the celiac axis were not significantly different. Mean attenuation was significantly higher at 80 kV in the aorta (517.5±116.4 vs 290.3±76.4 HU) and normal pancreas (154.0±39.95 vs 90.02±19.01 HU) (all p<0.0001), while no significant difference was observed for adenocarcinoma (61.43±35.61 vs 47.45±18.95 p=n.s.). CTDI and DLP were significantly lower at 80 kV (6.00±0.90 mGy vs 10.24±2.93 mGy, and 180.4±35.49 mGy cm vs 383.8±117 mGy cm, respectivelySingle-source 80 kV pancreatic phase scanning results in higher conspicuity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and FOM and in significant dose reduction while maintaining acceptable image quality.
