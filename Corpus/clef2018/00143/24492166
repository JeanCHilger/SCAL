Pleomorphic carcinoma showing rapid growth, multiple metastases, and intestinal perforation. Pleomorphic carcinoma is a rare and very aggressive subtype of lung cancer that tends to grow rapidly and invade adjacent structures. Here we report a case of pleomorphic carcinoma with rapid growth, multiple metastases, and intestinal perforation. A 46-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of lung abscess. Several antibiotics were administered for 2 weeks, but his condition did not improve. F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed high uptake in the right lung, stomach, and pancreas. CT-fluoroscopic lung biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of pleomorphic carcinoma was made. His performance status worsened each day, and the lung tumor grew within 1 month. In addition, sudden severe abdominal pain and tenderness developed 10 days after lung biopsy. He was diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation, and he underwent surgery. However, he died 2 weeks after the surgery. Autopsy revealed the presence of an enormous tumor in the right lung and multiple metastases in the stomach, duodenum, intestine, bilateral kidneys, pancreas, gallbladder, right adrenal gland and thyroid.
