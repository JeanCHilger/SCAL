Radiologic evaluation of pancreatic ascites. Two cases of pancreatic ascites are presented in which preoperative endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) precisely identified the exact location of the leakage of pancreatic juice into the peritoneal cavity. Computed tomography was not helpful in either case. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography is the most valuable imaging examination to confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic ascites and to direct surgical management.
