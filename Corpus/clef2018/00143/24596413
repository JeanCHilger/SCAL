Metachronous biliary carcinoma with intraductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma 13 years after curative resection of hilar bile duct cancer. We report a case of a 68-year-old woman with metachronous bile duct cancer and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She had undergone extended left hepatic lobectomy for hilar bile duct carcinoma. However, when she was admitted to our hospital 13 years later for an annual follow-up, abdominal CT revealed a mass in the dilated remnant of her lower bile duct. This was diagnosed as a second primary tumour, a pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed and 15 months after the second operation, she remains recurrence-free. Nineteen cases of patients with metachronous bile duct carcinomas were identified in the literature and have been reviewed.
