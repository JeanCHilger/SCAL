Endoscopic ultrasonography allowing expectant management of pancreatic haemangioma. Pancreatic haemangiomas are rare benign tumours that can affect both adults and children. They have an unknown incidence and only 15 adult cases have been reported, all from histological examination. Patients present with vague symptoms relating to tumour mass or they are detected incidentally. Cross-sectional imaging is the mainstay of investigation and may reveal arterially enhancing cystic lesions but in the case presented here, it was non-diagnostic. The use of endoscopic ultrasonography confirmed the nature of the benign lesion, allowing a conservative approach as opposed to operative resection.
