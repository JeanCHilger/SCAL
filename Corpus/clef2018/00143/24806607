18F-FDG PET imaging in a patient with late omental infarction after treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We report a case of late omental infarction visualized by F-FDG PET/CT during follow-up for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The 65-year-old patient was referred for imaging 8 months after pancreaticoduodenectomy and 2 months after completion of a course of chemotherapy. PET/CT showed an FDG-avid omental lesion that suggested peritoneal carcinomatosis. The appearance and evolution at follow-up studies confirmed the diagnosis of omental infarction, a rare complication of pancreatic surgery. This case revealed the possibility of late FDG uptake in omental infarction.
