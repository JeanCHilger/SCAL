Optimal Pancreatic Phase Delay with 64-Detector CT Scanner and Bolus-tracking Technique. To assess the optimal pancreatic phase delay in terms of parenchymal enhancement and tumor-to-pancreas contrast with a bolus-tracking method.Patients referred for suspicion of pancreatic tumor and undergoing 64-detector computed tomography scanner were randomized to an individualized scan delay of 10, 20, or 30 seconds of nonionic contrast material (370 mg I/mL) after aortic enhancement above 150 Hounsfield units. The volume of contrast was adjusted to patient weight. Pancreatic and tumor enhancements were measured. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests.One hundred and fifty patients were randomized to individualized scan delays of 10, 20, or 30 seconds. Pancreatic parenchymal enhancement in all patients (n = 150) was significantly higher with a delay of 20 or 30 seconds than that with 10 seconds (P < .001 for both). Tumor-to-pancreas contrast for solid tumors (n = 59) was significantly higher with a delay of 30 seconds than that with 10 seconds (P = .015). Adenocarcinoma-to-pancreas contrast during pancreatic phase was significantly higher for a 20- or 30-second delay than for a 10-second delay (P = .027 and .011, respectively) for one reader.With a flow rate of 4 mL/s and weight-adjusted contrast volume, an individualized scan delay of 30 seconds after aortic transit time revealed higher pancreatic enhancement and tumor-to-pancreas contrast than that with a delay of 10 seconds.
