Is EUS-FNA of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas as a preoperative procedure really necessary and free of acceptable risks? Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas are infrequent tumors since, as of 2014, only 2744 patients have been described. Its rarity, unclear histogenesis, pleomorphic aspect on radiology (cystic, solid or mixed) and unpredictable biological behavior with an insidious high-grade malignant potential make SPN difficult to recognize preoperatively even in its target patient population which is predominantly composed of young women (about 87% of cases).Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) showed to improve the preoperative diagnostic yield for this tumor and obviate the risks formerly given by percutaneous biopsy.In light of our experience, such a procedure could not be so innocuous as generally acknowledged.We report the first case of rupture of pancreatic SPN following EUS-FNA and entertain both the actual and potential complications ensuing from this type of mishap.
