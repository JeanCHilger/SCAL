Ectopic pancreas: a rare cause of abdominal pain. We present a case of recurrent abdominal pain due to an ectopic or heterotopic pancreas. Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is the presence of histologic pancreatic tissue outside its normal location without any anatomic or vascular continuity with the pancreas. The frequency of HP has been estimated as 0.6-13.7%. Most are found in the duodenum, stomach, andjejunum. The exact mechanism remains controversial but it has been theorized that it most likely arises congenitally during embryonic development. The elevations of amylase and lipase levels are modest due to the small volume of pancreatic tissue in the HP. Therefore, diagnostic modalities including barium swallow, upper-gastrointestinal series, CT, EUS, and MRCP can be used when suspecting HP. The need for treatment is based on symptoms and definitive diagnosis, especially when the possibility of malignancy exists. Asymptomatic causes need not require treatment.
