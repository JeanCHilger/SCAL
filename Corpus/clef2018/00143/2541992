Gestagen receptor-positive, solid-cystic acinar-cell tumor of the pancreas. In a 16-year-old girl with left upper abdominal pain of two months' duration fine-needle biopsy (guided by computed tomography) revealed a solid-cystic acinar-cell tumour of the pancreas. The tail of the pancreas was resected and the spleen removed. On inspection, the tumour--about 9 cm in diameter--was encapsulated and consisted of soft, brownish, partly haemorrhagic tissue. Histologically and immunohistochemically the diagnosis of an acinar-cell tumour was confirmed. Analysis of steroid hormone receptors revealed a high progestogen content. Since the operation the patient has remained symptom-free without any sign of tumour recurrence.
