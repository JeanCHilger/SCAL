Diagnostic strategy in liver and pancreatic tumors: imaging diagnosis using MRT. Because of distinct motion artifacts MR examinations of the upper abdomen are not performed routinely. The development of rapid imaging methods (gradient echoes) makes it possible to obtain an MR image in a few seconds, hence breath-holding is possible. Consequently, images can be obtained without respiratory artifacts. Experiences with 73 patients with liver lesions are reported, using gradient echoes. The MR investigations included T2 weighted images, T1 weighted without and with contrast agent (Gd-DTPA). MR of the liver can differentiate between metastasis and haemangiomas and can help in difficult cases before resection of liver metastases. Development and improvements of artifact-reducing methods, shortening of examination times and development of oral contrast agents and further intravenous contrast agents will extend the range of MR examinations of the upper abdomen.
