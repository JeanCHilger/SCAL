Accuracy of 68Ga DOTANOC PET/CT Imaging in Patients With Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ⁶⁸Ga DOTANOC PET/CT imaging in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.Data of 33 patients (age, 33.5 [13.8] years male 14/female 19) with MEN syndromes (MEN 1, 9Of the total 41 ⁶⁸Ga DOTANOC PET/CTs, 34 were interpreted as positive for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and 7 as negative. The patientwise sensitivity of PET/CT was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80-99), specificity was 71% (95% CI, 29-96), positive predictive value was 94% (95% CI, 80-99), negative predictive value was 71% (95% CI, 29-96), and accuracy was 90%. A total of 74 disease sites were demonstrated on PET/CT, including 41 primary NETs (pancreas, 10 stomach, 2⁶⁸Ga DOTANOC PET/CT shows high diagnostic accuracy in MEN syndrome and can demonstrate both primary and metastatic NETs in these patients.
