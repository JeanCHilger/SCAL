Detailed analysis of extra-pancreatic nerve plexus invasion in pancreatic body carcinoma analyzed by 50 consecutive series of distal pancreatectomy with en-bloc celiac axis resection. Advanced pancreatic body carcinoma frequently accompany extra-pancreatic nerve plexus (PL) invasion, one of the poor indicator of patient prognosis. The present study aimed to reveal the progress of the PL invasion from cancer of the pancreas body toward the root of the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) followed by investigation of the relevance of diagnostic accuracy.Resected specimens from 50 consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) were pathologically analyzed for the direction of PL invasion. Diagnostic accuracy on CT imaging were also investigated.Thirty seven of the 50 patients (74%) were positive for PL invasion around the CHA, SPA, CA and SMA. In terms of the diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive values for the PL invasion were 35%, 36%, 43% and 81% for the SPA, CHA, CA and SMA, respectively. Among 21 patients and 23 patients with PL invasion around CHA and SPA, 13 and 6 patients also accompanied PL invasion around CA, respectively.Carcinoma of the pancreatic body is found to frequently accompany PL invasion around CA. Under the limitation of low diagnostic accuracy, DP-CAR might be feasible operation that increases the possibility of R0 resection.
