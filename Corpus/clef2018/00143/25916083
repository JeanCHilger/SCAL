Diffusion-weighted whole body imaging with background body signal suppression/T2 image fusion is negative for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. One major problem with Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the appearance of pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma. Diffusion-weighted whole body imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) provides hyperintense signals in cases of cancer. DWIBS and T2 image fusion (DWIBS/T2) provides functional information in anatomical settings, and is useful for the detection of cancer with strong contrast against surrounding tissues. DWIBS/T2 signals were analyzed in patients with IPMN to investigate positive or negative results.Patient records were analyzed retrospectively regarding IPMN. None showed high-risk stigmata or worrisome features. To rule out T2 shine-through or differentiate malignant lesions from non-malignant causes of restricted diffusion, positive ADC maps were produced from the recorded ADC values.None of the patients with IPMN had features of malignant progression. No mural nodules were detected by endoscopic ultrasonography. IPMN was hyperintense with DWIBS/T2 and the ADC map. This finding suggested that the hyperintense values of IPMN were T2 shine-through. These results showed that none of the IPMNs were positive with DWIBS/T2.DWIBS/T2 was negative for patients with IPMN. DWIBS/T2 might be useful for the evaluation of malignant progression, in addition to observation.
