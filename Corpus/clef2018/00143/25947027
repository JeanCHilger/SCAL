Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis after pancreatoduodenectomy with rapid progression of hepatic fibrosis: a case report. A 64-year-old woman who had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy for intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma 10 months previously was referred to our department complaining of ascites and general malaise. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a markedly decreased hepatic CT value. Liver biopsy revealed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Treatment with nutritional control and pancreatic enzyme supplements improved liver function. Exocrine pancreatic enzyme insufficiency from chronic pancreatitis is considered to be a cause of rapid progression of hepatic steatosis.
