Biliary complications of pancreatitis. The biliary complications of pancreatitis include cholestasis, secondary biliary cirrhosis, cholangitis, and pseudocyst or fistula affecting the hepatobiliary system. Of these, the most relevant for radiologists is cholestasis caused by biliary duct stenosis in an inflamed pancreatic head. Radiologic assessment of these complications is based on judicious use of ultrasound, computed tomography, and direct cholangiography. The typical imaging finding of common bile duct stenosis due to chronic pancreatitis is gradual tapered narrowing of the intrapancreatic common bile duct, which can be portrayed by carefully accomplished computed tomography, and ultrasound as well as cholangiography. When combined with clinical assessment, imaging tests can help determine strategies for treatment, which include traditional operations as well as transhepatic, endoscopic, or percutaneous interventions.
