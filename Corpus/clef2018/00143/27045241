The state of the art of imaging in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are neoplasms presenting unpredictable and unusual biologic behavior that causes many clinical challenges. NETs can produce a variety of metabolically active substances (hormones and amines) leading to distinct clinical syndromes. This review will discuss the imaging techniques for the diagnosis of GEP-NETs including ultrasonography, CT, MRI and ultrasound endoscope. In this article, Gallium-68 labeled peptide binding to G protein coupled receptor including SSTR, CCKR1 and GLP1R is addressed, and the application of Gallium-68 labeled somatostin analogues and PET-CT for diagnosis of GEP-NETs is evaluated. In conclusion, Gallium-68 labeled peptide and molecular imaging will play important roles in diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategy development of GEP-NETs.
