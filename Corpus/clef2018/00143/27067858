A Case of Primary Cancer of the Pancreas and Colon Treated with the Combination of Gemcitabine and TS-1. The patient was a 74-year-old man. A medical examination for diabetes revealed a hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic head. A heterogeneously enhanced tumor in the ascending colon with wall thickening was observed on enhanced CT of the abdomen. He was diagnosed with multiple primary cancers of the pancreas and colon. He received 12 courses of chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m 2) and TS-1 (60 mg/m2). After 12 courses of chemotherapy, the size of the pancreatic tumor was slightly decreased and the size of the tumor in the colon was significantly decreased. The tumor marker level was also significantly decreased. The combination of gemcitabine and TS-1 is a promising treatment regimen for patients with primary cancer of the pancreas and colon.
