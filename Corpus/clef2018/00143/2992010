Serial computed tomography. Value of densitometric measurements in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions of the liver, pancreas and kidney. By means of serial computer tomography it is possible to show changes in normal and abnormal tissues in the liver, pancreas, and kidney with characteristic contrast kinetics. Diagnosis can be improved by evaluating intra-vascular parenchymal contrast within the first minute after an intravenous bolus injection. A tissue diagnosis is not possible in the majority of lesions in the liver, but can usually be made in lesions of the pancreas and kidneys.
