CT evaluation of pancreatic cancer. Analysis of resected tumours. Preoperative CT examination including dynamic scan was performed in 25 patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Dynamic scans, which clearly demonstrated the attenuation difference between the normal and neoplastic pancreatic tissue in 92% of cases, were superior to high dose contrast enhancement scans that failed to display the relatively hypodense component of tumours in 40%. Detailed comparison of CT interpretation and surgical or pathological findings revealed the usefulness of CT examination in the evaluation of tumour size and local invasion. However, low sensitivity in detection of metastatic lesions (range: 20-38%) indicates limitations of CT diagnosis.
