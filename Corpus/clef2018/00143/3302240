Pancreatic cystadenomas. Pitfalls and limitations of radiologic diagnosis. Pancreatic cystadenoma (CA) are rare tumors. According to the classification described by Compagno and Oertel, microcystic and macrocystic CA are differentiated. The former is a benign tumor with slow growth, but the latter has a malignant potential. According to the literature, these tumors may be differentiated on the basis of US and CT findings in a high percentage of cases. We report a series of 11 cases (5 microcystic CA, 4 mucinous CA, 1 leiomyoblastoma and 1 adrenal cyst) representing all cases of radiologically suspected CA and all cases of histologically proved CA. A correct diagnosis of microcystic CA was possible in 2 out of 5 cases, and in 3 out of 4 cases of mucinous CA. The 2 extra-pancreatic tumors were misinterpreted as mucinous CA. No patient had a false positive diagnosis of microcystic CA. The diagnosis of mucinous CA was made in 7 cases, but only 3 were true positives. There was 1 false negative of mucinous CA. In other cases, laparotomy and resection are mandatory as sonography and CT cannot accurately detect malignancy or differentiate pancreatic CA from adjacent sites tumors.
