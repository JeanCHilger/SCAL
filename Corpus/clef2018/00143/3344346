Leiomyosarcoma of the splenic vein. The differential diagnosis of disease processes of the pancreatic tail involves considerable difficulty, despite the use of sonography, computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography. In most cases, morphological changes are due to pancreatic tumors, inflammatory disease or lymphoma. We report on a case of leiomyosarcoma of the splenic vein with local invasion of the pancreatic tail simulating a pancreatic tumor.
