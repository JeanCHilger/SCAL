False-positive secretin-KABI provocation test associated with achlorhydria. Two patients with chronic abdominal pain and fasting hypergastrinemia had increases in serum gastrin of 440 and 300 pg/ml after injection of 2 U/kg Secretin-KABI. Both subsequently proved to have pentagastrin-fast achlorhydria. Intragastric instillation of 0.1 N HCl suppressed serum gastrin concentration by greater than 60%. In both, the pancreas was normal by sonography or computed tomography (CT) scan and at laparotomy in one. Both are currently asymptomatic 12 and 18 months later. We conclude that achlorhydria may be associated after injection of Secretin-KABI with a false-positive rise in fasting serum gastrin concentration of greater than 200 pg/ml and that gastric analysis for hypochlorhydria should be performed before secretin provocation testing.
