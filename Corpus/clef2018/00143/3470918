Operative treatment of complications of pancreatitis. Fifteen patients who developed serious complications from pancreatitis, were treated operatively with one post-operative (cardiac) death. Pancreatic tail resection and cyst exstirpation were used in 6 patients, and pancreatic resection and pancreatic jejunostomy in four. An aggressive diagnostic approach using early ERCP and CT, as well as a persistent operative treatment are highly recommended.
