Esophageal obstruction secondary to a mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. The authors report a rare complication of pancreatic pseudocyst. A 47-year-old man suffered rapidly progressing dysphagia and complete esophageal obstruction secondary to extrinsic compression by mediastinal extension of a pancreatic pseudocyst. Ultrasonography and especially computerized tomography were instrumental in diagnosis and in the planning of the operation. A posterior cystogastrostomy successfully drained the pseudocyst and relieved the esophageal obstruction.
