Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas. Percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreas allows to obtain without surgery a tissue proven diagnosis of focal lesions of the pancreas. Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), or fluoroscopy are used to guide the positioning of the needle in the lesion. Various benign and malignant lesions can be diagnosed and the cytologic features of them are presented. The average sensitivity of the technique in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma is 80.5% in the literature. The use of percutaneous fine needle biopsy of the pancreas decreases the number of investigations to be done in a patient with pancreatic disease.
