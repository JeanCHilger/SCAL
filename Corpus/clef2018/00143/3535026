Endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas. Technical aspects. Endoscopic ultrasonography was mainly developed to improve the diagnostic possibilities in pancreatic diseases. To standardize the technique and to evaluate the diagnostic possibilities of endoscopic ultrasonography, 76 examinations were performed in patients with suspected pancreatic disorders, using two types of ultrasonic device, a sector scanner and a linear array. The pancreatic region was visualized with good resolution, and a definite diagnosis was possible in most patients. Up to now endoscopic sonography has been used specially to supplement upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and external ultrasonography.
