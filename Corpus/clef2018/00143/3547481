Ultrasound and computed tomography in the evaluation of pancreatic transplantation. Both ultrasound and computed tomography are useful imaging modalities in the evaluation of pancreatic transplants and their complications. Ultrasound and computed tomography are most valuable in the detection of peripancreatic fluid collections, although some parenchymal abnormalities can occasionally be detected. Directed diagnostic aspiration is useful in determining the etiology of peripancreatic and other peritoneal fluid collections. The role of percutaneous catheter drainage in the management of these complex patients is not yet clearly defined.
