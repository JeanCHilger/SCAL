A comparative study of computed tomography and ERCP in pancreaticobiliary disease. Fifty-seven patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary pathology constituting a clinical subset in whom the diagnosis was problematic or nonspecific were evaluated with computed tomography and ERCP. The relative sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies of the two tests were compared. Computed tomography was successful in obtaining a diagnostic examination in 100% and ERCP was technically successful in 75%. Both tests were equally accurate in detecting an abnormality (computed tomography 95.7% ERCP 95.3%) and offering a correct diagnosis (computed tomography 72%
