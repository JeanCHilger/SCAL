Pancreatic morphology and function in relationship to pain in chronic pancreatitis. The correlation of pancreatic pain and the degree of morphological and functional changes was prospectively investigated in 64 patients (45 males, 19 females) with chronic pancreatitis. All patients underwent clinical examination and diagnostic investigations by means of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP), computed tomography (CT) and exocrine pancreatic function test (secretin-ceruletide SC). The individual tests were performed within 4 weeks in all patients. No significant correlation was found between the degree of pain and the severity of ERP and CT findings. Severe pain was found in 62% of patients with advanced ductal changes, and in 41% of patients with advanced parenchymal lesions. 58% of patients with severe pain had marked exocrine insufficiency. Ductal changes characterized by obstruction of the main pancreatic duct were most frequently associated with severe pain (58%). Less often, severe pain was associated with duct dilatation (34%) or with slight duct changes (26%). Among parenchymal lesions as revealed in CT, large cysts were most frequently related to severe pain (62%). A notable finding was that 89% of patients presenting with calcifications in CT still experienced pain and 39% of them had severe pain. The combined diagnostic approach is useful for the individual therapeutic management, but does not provide insight into the mechanisms of pain in chronic pancreatitis.
