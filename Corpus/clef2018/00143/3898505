An endoscopic Doppler probe: preliminary clinical evaluation. A new pulsed Doppler catheter has been developed for use during gastrointestinal fiberendoscopy. Modern gastrointestinal endoscopy allows inspection of the wall of the entire esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon. Diagnosis is performed by inspecting the surface of the mucosa, biopsy, and cytology. However, it is not possible to determine the characteristics of the blood vessels of the wall beneath the mucosa with available techniques. We have developed a Doppler system which is miniature and can be passed down the biopsy channel of standard fiberendoscopes. This 8 MHz device incorporates range limiting to select the depth of interrogation by Doppler. The length of the probe is 2 m, and the diameter is 1.8 mm. This device has been tested in animal studies for efficacy and safety and is now being tested clinically in patients. The probe has been tested for two indications: the detection of the retroduodenal artery prior to endoscopic papillotomy for retained bile duct stones (90 patients) and the detection of flow in esophageal varices before and after endoscopic sclerotherapy (33 patients). Preliminary results are encouraging and suggest that this device can give information about submucosal blood vessels which cannot be detected using other methods.
