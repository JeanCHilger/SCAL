An amylase-containing subdiaphragmatic bronchopulmonary sequestration. A single case of a subdiaphragmatic bronchopulmonary sequestrated cyst removed at laparotomy is reported. Needle aspiration of the cyst prior to removal revealed a high amylase although the serum amylase was normal. A review of the literature failed to reveal a similar case. The ultrasound, computed tomography and histopathology of this case are described.
