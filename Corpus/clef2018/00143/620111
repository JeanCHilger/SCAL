Computed tomography in pancreatic disease. Computed tomography (CT) of the pancreas has been evaluated in 50 patients with established exocrine pancreatic disease and 20 patients without pancreatic disease. Increase in size, irregularity in outline and heterogeneity of composition of the pancreas implied disease but were in no way specific to any particular disease entity. In acute pancreatitis, following complete resolution, the pancreas appeared normal whereas incomplete resolution was associated with non-specific swelling and heterogeneity of density. The extent and location of pseudocysts could be accurately delineated. In chronic pancreatitis, duct calculi, duct dilatation and large intrapancreatic cysts aided the differentiation between focal enlargement due to chronic pancreatitis and expansion due to cancer. Hepatic metastases and abnormalities of the biliary system seen in association with cancer further aided this differentiation.
