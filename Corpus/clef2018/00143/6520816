Hemorrhagic pseudocyst of pancreas. A case of X-ray computed tomography diagnosis. Arteriography failed to detect a pancreatic pseudocyst complicated by hemorrhage, a positive diagnosis being established only after CT scanning. Identification of this rare lesion by angioscan imaging illustrates. The value of this technique, which provides data on vascular dynamics, rapidly, in the selected plane of the section. Results in this case demonstrate the very close correlation between Ct scan images and pathological findings.
