Pancreatic carcinoma in a neonate. The clinical and radiographic findings in a neonate with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas are presented. CT revealed the mass to be well defined, with an inhomogeneous density before and after intravenous contrast enhancement. Ultrasound revealed the mass to be mainly densely echogenic with small, irregular echo-free areas. The portal vein was intimately applied to the posterior aspect of the mass. The literature concerning adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in the pediatric age group is reviewed.
