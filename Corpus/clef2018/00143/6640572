Pancreas tail pseudotumor--CT for the detection of position variants of the pancreas tail as a cause for pathologic findings in conventional radiographic and ultrasound studies. Four cases are presented, in whom conventional radiography of the abdomen including tomography and ultrasound raised high suspicion of a left suprarenal tumor. Abdominal CT explained the finding in each case as being produced by a normal anatomic variation of the pancreatic tail, which was found in a paraspinal and suprarenal location. The statistical incidence of such a variation is discussed.
