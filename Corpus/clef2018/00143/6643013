Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Seven cases of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas (5 cystadenomata and 2 cystadenocarcinomata) are reported. While cystadenomata were localized in the tail of pancreas, cystadenocarcinomata were localized in the head. Only one case was asymptomatic and evidenced in the course of other type of surgery. Preoperative diagnosis of cystadenoma was assessed only in one case. All benign forms were treated with radical resection. Only palliation was possible for malignant forms. The moderate malignancy of cystic tumors as compared to the more common pancreatic adenocarcinoma is underlined. A more careful intraoperative diagnosis and surgical resection are therefore advocated, whenever possible.
