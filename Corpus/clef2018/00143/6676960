Migrations of fluid of pancreatic origin: ultrasonic and CT study of 28 cases. Efficacious management of migratory collections of pancreatic origin requires precise topographic diagnosis. Such collections can be multiple, atypical and ubiquitous, extending from the mediastinum down to the pelvis, within peritoneal recesses and retroperitoneal spaces, and even within viscera such as the liver, spleen or kidney. Sonography and CT are complementary in the diagnosis and management of such collections.
