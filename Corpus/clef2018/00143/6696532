Patterns of severe pancreatic injury following cardiopulmonary bypass. Severe pancreatic complications following cardiac surgery are rare, but 14 patients with severe pancreatitis have been encountered since 1971. Six of these developed acute fulminating pancreatitis following cardiac surgery and each of these died within 21 days following operation. Seven patients had less severe pancreatitis, resulting in pancreatic abscess formation and five in this group expired. One patient developed a pancreatic pseudocyst following mild acute pancreatitis and expired 4 months later. Although the etiologic mechanisms are unclear, possible factors include: prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, "the low cardiac output syndrome," and inadequately treated or unrecognized postoperative pancreatitis. The diagnosis is based on physical examination, upper gastrointestinal series, and the abdominal CT scan. Despite aggressive surgical therapy, pancreatitis following cardiopulmonary bypass is an extremely serious condition.
