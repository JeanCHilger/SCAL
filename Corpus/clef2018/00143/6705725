Pancreatic calcinosis as shown on the computer tomogram and its general image. The abdominal roentgenograms of 20 patients with pancreatic calcifications, demonstrated by CT, were evaluated retrospectively. The calcifications of 15 patients could be seen. In 2 patients with ERCP and in 1 patient with pneumocolon only, the calcifications could not be observed. In the remaining 2 patients with negative abdominal roentgenograms the calcifications were prevertebral and of small size. Possibly they could have been found with special projections.
