Utility of CT-guided abdominal aspiration procedures. Over 200 consecutive diagnostic needle aspiration procedures of the abdomen were performed under computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Biopsies were done of the liver in 88 patients, the pancreas in 28, the kidney in 20, and the retroperitoneum in 32 30 underwent an aspiration procedure for characterization of an intraabdominal fluid collection. Accuracy of diagnosis was very high for hepatic (99%) and renal (100%) biopsies and in characterization of fluid collections (100%). Accuracy for retroperitoneal biopsy was 87.5% and for pancreatic biopsy 82%. Overall accuracy for all sites was 95%. There were one false-negative diagnosis for the liver and five false-negative diagnoses for the pancreas. Insufficient material was obtained for diagnosis in four instances of retroperitoneal biopsy. There were no false positives. The technique is facilitated by rapid CT scan time, large aperture gantry, and rapid CT image reconstruction. Twenty gauge needles were used more frequently than 22 gauge needles because of their greater rigidity and ease of control. CT-guided diagnostic aspiration procedures are particularly useful for diagnosis of small, deep-seated lesions and in evaluation of lesions found in severely ill patients. An experienced cytologist is essential to the success of the technique.
