Pancreatic pseudocysts. Actual diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Surgical treatment (author's transl). The development of modern diagnostic technics (ultrasound and CT) has facilitated diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts. The subsequent demonstration of spontaneous resolution (in 25-50%) has however produced new controversies on the optimal therapeutic strategy. In spite of the progress in the area of diagnosis important questions regarding the evaluation of the percutaneous fine needle puncture, the indication for surgical treatment in relationship to the size of the pseudocysts and the optimal timing of surgical measures are still be open to discussion. To clarify these problems a prospective controlled study should be begun. According to most reports operative intervention is indicated if after a period of 6 weeks no spontaneous resolution has been observed. The optimal surgical treatment is thought to be internal drainage, for instance a cystojejunostomy.
