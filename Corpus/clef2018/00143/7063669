Diagnostic and therapeutic results of angiography of blunt abdominal trauma (author's transl). Angiographic findings in blunt abdominal trauma are reviewed. 693 posttraumatic angiograms were performed at the University of Freiburg from 1971-1980. 24% of these patients suffered from blunt abdominal trauma. It could be shown that recently ultrasonography and computerized tomography have replace angiography as screening method. Remaining indications for angiography are primary vascular lesions, uncertain findings of US-and/or CT-examination and documentation of hemorrhage with the possibility of therapeutic intervention.
