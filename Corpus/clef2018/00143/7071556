Current approach to gastrointestinal diagnosis. With special reference to sonography and whole-body computer tomography. In the last 10 years the diagnostic approach to gastrointestinal diseases has changed markedly. A new tactic, based upon modern diagnostic methods, is outlined. 1. Endoscopy has won a dominant position in diagnostic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract and the colon, while routine x-ray plays a much reduced role. 2. In the diagnosis of liver, pancreatic and bile tract disease ultrasonography has largely replaced many of the previous procedures, particularly cholangiography, laparoscopy, scintigraphy, angiography and ERCP. 3. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography appears to be equivalent to computer tomography in diseases of liver, pancreas and bile tract, and is less costly. 4. Ultrasonography has, however, its limits, which relate in part to the technic and still more to the technician. Its diagnostic accuracy is particularly limited in diffuse parenchymatous diseases of liver and pancreas.
