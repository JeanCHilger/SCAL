The value of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with suspected carcinoma of the pancreas and indeterminate computed tomographic results. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used to evaluate 26 patients with clinically suspected pancreatic malignant growths and indeterminate compute tomographic result. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography benefited preoperative diagnosis or clinical management in 25 of 26 patients by diagnosing carcinoma in six, chronic pancreatitis in ten or normal pancreas in nine. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography missed one carcinoma in a chronically inflamed pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is useful in evaluating patients with indeterminate pancreatic computed tomographic results prior to exploratory laparotomy.
