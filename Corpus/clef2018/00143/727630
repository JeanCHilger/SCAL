Unusual tumor of the iris: a rare initial clinical manifestation of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas. The occurrence of an iris tumor with secondary glaucoma as the initial manifestation of an occult pancreatic carcinoma is a rare clinical entity. The subsequent appearance of a testicular mass due to metastatic pancreatic disease also is rare. The use of new advanced diagnostic techniques, such as radioisotope studies and computerized axial tomography, may reveal occult carcinoma of the tail of the pancreas before the inevitable autopsy.
