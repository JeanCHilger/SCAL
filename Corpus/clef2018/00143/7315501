Angiography in pancreatic disease reevaluated. A prospective and blind evaluation. Eighty-six consecutive pancreatic angiographies were reviewed prospectively. Ater more than one year 79 of them were "blindly" and independently reviewed by three radiologists. The results concerning accuracy, value three radiologists. The results concerning accuracy, value of superselective technique at malignancy and prediction of extirpability at malignancy were compared. The accuracy was similar, i.e. at malignancy 92 and 86 per cent (mean), respectively, as the prediction of extirpability 88 and 80 per cent (mean), respectively. The value of superselective technique differed considerably, 55 and 14 per cent (mean), respectively, and this is discussed. Pancreatic angiography in relation to CT, ultrasound and ERCP is discussed and considered to be of value late in the diagnostic program.
