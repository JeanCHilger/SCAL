Cross-sectional imaging of the pancreas. CT is the primary modality for the evaluation of patients with pancreatic disease. A number of pitfalls can occur in interpretation of the scans, but most can be avoided by using state-of-the-art scanners and dynamic contrast enhancement techniques and by recognizing normal anatomic variants. However, in other cases, CT may show only nonspecific findings and a correct diagnosis can be reached only by utilization of additional imaging techniques or guided FNAB.
