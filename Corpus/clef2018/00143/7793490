A comprehensive characterization of lymphoepithelial cyst associated with the pancreas. Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas is a rare but distinctive cystic lesion lined by a mature, keratinizing squamous epithelium and surrounded by lymphoid tissue.To gain more insights into this entity, we describe 5 examples of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas (2 of which were briefly described before) and compare them with similar cases in the literature for a total of 19 cases.The male:female ratio was 16:3 patients' ages ranged from 32 to 73 years (mean and median 51). The lymphoepithelial cyst was incidentally found at autopsy in 4 patients (21%) or during evaluation for unrelated diseases in another 4 patients (21%). In the remaining 11 patients, the cyst was associated with abdominal pain in 9 (47% of all patients), nausea/vomiting in 3 (16%), diarrhea in 1 (5%), and nonspecific systemic symptoms in 6 (32%) (some patients had more than 1 associated symptom). Computed axial tomography scan, with or without ultrasonographic study, was done in 16 cases and uniformly displayed a single, well-circumscribed, cystic mass protruding beyond the surface of the pancreasThis rare cyst of the pancreas has a uniform and characteristic clinicopathologic profile, enabling easy and accurate diagnosis. Although the histogenesis of lymphoepithelial cysts is not known, they are benign and can be cured by local excision.
