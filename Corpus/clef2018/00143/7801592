Ultrasonic endoscopic examination of the upper portion of the gastrointestinal tract. Thirty-two patients with various diseases of the esophagus, stomach, and the adjacent organs (pancreas, liver and spleen) were examined to assess the potentialities of transesophageal ultrasonic endoscopy. The results were compared with the findings of fiber gastroscopy, x-ray and ultrasonic transabdominal examinations. Nineteen patients were examined for a malignant involvement of the esophageal and gastric wall and tumor progress at the site of anastomosis after combined treatment of gastric cancer. Ultrasonic endoscopy data were confirmed during subsequent surgical interventions and histologic examinations of the resected tumors.
