Bronchial epidermoid carcinoma with unusual disclosure. Dissemination has often occurred before the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary cancer. Pancreatic metastases are exceptional and are very rarely the revealing manifestation. The authors report a case of a tumour of the pancreas which led to the discover of an bronchogenic epidermoid carcinoma. The relationship between these two tumours lead to the proposed hypothesis of pancreatic metastasis of a bronchogenic carcinoma. Although this situation is rare, the preoperative work-up for bronchogenic carcinoma should include computed tomography of the pancreas if the abdominal echography does not allow complete visualization of the pancreas in cases with suggestive digestive disorders. If a tumour is observed in the pancreas, scan-guided needle biopsy should be performed to enable the histological examination.
