Diagnosis of traumatic pancreatic duct rupture by on-table endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. We report on two children who sustained blunt abdominal trauma with pancreatic duct rupture diagnosed by ERP (endoscopic retrograde pancreatography). Examinations were done with patients on the operating table anesthetized for laparotomy (on-table ERP). In both patients, duct laceration remained undiagnosed by computerized tomography and ultrasonography. Operative strategy depends on whether the pancreatic duct is lacerated or not. Findings during on-table ERP allow decisions on operative strategy in patients with pancreatic trauma.
