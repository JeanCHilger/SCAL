Endoscopic drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst. Pancreatic pseudocyst following trauma is usually caused by a major duct injury and may present late. The outcome of endoscopic treatment in five patients with post-traumatic pseudocyst is described. Diagnosis was made from 3 weeks to 1 year after injury by ultrasonography and computed tomography. A distinct bulge was visible in the stomach or duodenum using endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, and a cyst enterostomy was established with a knife or standard papillotome. Successful drainage was achieved without complications. One patient developed a recurrence, which was redrained endoscopically, but surgical intervention was required for persistent pain. Early results suggest that endoscopic drainage for selected pancreatic pseudocysts is feasible and safe.
