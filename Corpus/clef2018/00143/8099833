Complete transection of common bile duct due to blunt abdominal trauma: a case report and literature review. A case of complete transection of the common bile duct due to abdominal blunt injury in a 49-year-old man is presented. The rarity of this injury and its initial presentation as a pancreatic pseudocyst warrant its description. This patient was diagnosed as having bile duct injury following ascites aspiration. Common bile duct transection was documented and a choledochostomy was done. However, bile leaked into the peritoneal cavity one week after the operation. A Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy was done successfully in a second operation. Delayed diagnosis is common in these kinds of injuries, but it should be considered when a patient has bile ascites, abdominal distention and jaundice after a blunt abdominal injury. A review of the literature, methods of diagnosis and the technique of surgical repair are described.
