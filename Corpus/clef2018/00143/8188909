MR findings of secondary hemochromatosis: transfusional vs erythropoietic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the MR characteristics of secondary hemochromatosis (transfusional versus erythropoietic).Magnetic resonance images of five patients with transfusional (n = 3) or erythropoietic (n = 2) hemochromatosis were reviewed.The liver of all patients had low signal intensity in all pulse sequences. The spleen had low signal intensity in all patients with transfusional iron overload, but normal signal intensity in erythropoietic hemochromatosis, which had similar MR findings to idiopathic hemochromatosis. However, the pancreas had variable signal intensity.On MRI the signal intensity of the spleen may allow distinction between transfusional and erythropoietic hemochromatosis.
