Insulinoma in childhood--report of a case. A 14-year-old boy was having recurrent hypoglycemia over the past 6 months, so he was brought to our hospital for further evaluation. During the episodes of hypoglycemia, his serum insulin level was inappropriately high and the symptoms of hypoglycemia were dramatically ameliorated by intravenously administering glucose bolus. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 1 x 1 cm mass located at the tail of the pancreas. Under the impression of an insulinoma, enucleation of the tumor was performed smoothly, and the pathological finding confirmed the diagnosis. The postoperative course was smooth and no episodes of hypoglycemia were noted after treatment. In children with hypoglycemic attacks, adequate blood sampling before correction to determine plasma insulin levels is essential.
