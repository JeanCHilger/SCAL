Case report: emphysematous tuberculous pancreatitis diagnosis by ultrasound and computed tomography. We describe a case of simultaneous tuberculous and pyogenic infection of the pancreas in a 58-year-old Asian man who presented with a pyrexia of unknown origin. There was no evidence of disseminated tuberculosis or immuno-deficiency. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound-guided percutaneous pancreatic aspiration and subsequent progress assessed by sequential computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography. Complete recovery was achieved on anti-tuberculous chemotherapy without surgical intervention.
