The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of benign lesions of the upper GI tract. The contribution of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the diagnosis of benign lesions of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract was studied in 46 patients with polypoid lesions which were not thought to have invaded adjacent tissues or organs. Precise visualization of the five layers of the UGI tract was possible with EUS. The site of origin of the tumour was also determined. The diameter of the hypochoic lesions ranged between 1-4 cm, with well-defined margins, and were demarcated precisely from adjacent tissues. Lesions included: (1) leiomyoma of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum (n = 7) (2) ectopic pancreatic tissues (n = 3)
