CT- and US-guided biopsy of the pancreas. A retrospective review of 211 computed tomographic (CT)-guided and 58 ultrasound (US)-guided biopsies of pancreatic lesions performed between 1985 and 1989 was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis and the number of complications. Combined CT and US accuracy in the diagnosis of malignancy was 93%. CT-guided biopsies had an accuracy of 86%, and US-guided biopsies had an accuracy of 95%. Accuracy was higher with larger masses (> 3.0 cm, 92% < or = 3 cm, 81%) and larger needle sizes (16-19 gauge, 92%
