A radiological study of abdominal tuberculosis in a Saudi population, with special reference to ultrasound and computed tomography. The radiological appearances of abdominal tuberculosis are presented, which includes peritoneal, liver, spleen and pancreatic disease, but excludes renal and musculoskeletal involvement. Twenty-three patients were studied, 12 of whom had TB peritonitis. Barium studies remain valuable in gastrointestinal tract disease but for peritoneal, splenic, hepatic and pancreatic disease, ultrasound and computed tomography are indicated. Their diagnostic value is further enhanced by guided aspiration and biopsy techniques.
