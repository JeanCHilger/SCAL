Duodenojejunal intussusception with biliary obstruction and atrophy of the pancreas. Enteroenteric intussusceptions in adults are rare events caused by tumors in most cases. A case of duodenojejunal intussusception is presented which became manifest because of marked biliary obstruction and extensive pancreatic atrophy. As lead point, a large duodenal polypous hamartoma could be identified. The role of ultrasound and CT as diagnostic imaging of choice in this entity are discussed.
