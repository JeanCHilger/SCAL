Pancreatic somatostatinoma and MEN 1. Apropos of a case. Review of the literature. The pancreatic somatostatinoma belongs to the type of rare endocrine tumors of the pancreas. We report the observation of a 54 year old woman. Previously she was suffering from diabetes mellitus. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed an endocrine tumor of the pancreatic tail. There was no specific symptomatology, with the exception for the hyperglycaemia. The diagnosis of somatostatinoma was certified post operatively by the immunocytochemistry of the tumor. Then, the patient developed a hypercalcaemia associated with an increase of parathyroid hormone. The surgery of the neck revealed three hyperplastic parathyroids, inducing this association as a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). The patient did not develop pituitary tumor. Afterwards, scintigraphy with 111 Indium- octreotide showed a residual tumor at the head of pancreas. Basal levels of somatostatine and calcium, pentagastrine test, computed tomography scan, arteriography were negative. The presence of a second somatostatinoma was confirmed by surgery and immunohistology. One year after the surgery, the patient remains clinically well. The pancreatic localization of the somatostatinoma in a MEN 1 is poorly documented. Its malignant nature can only be assured by the presence of metastases. The genetic detection of the MEN 1 becomes possible. Above all, the treatment is based on surgery and/or chemotherapy (Fluoro-Uracile Streptozotocine). In our case, 111 In-octreotide scintigraphy was the only method demonstrating a residual focus, suggesting it could be an element of reference for the diagnosis and survey of somatostatinoma the watch of patients having a treatment for somatostatinoma.
