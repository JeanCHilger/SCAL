Labeled granulocyte scanning for the diagnosis of infected necrosis in acute pancreatitis: what kind of labeling should be used? Clinical and laboratory data or imaging results cannot provide a positive diagnosis of septic complications of pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis in patients with acute pancreatitis. Confirmation can be obtained only after percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the necrotic tissues or fluid collection although the important role of 99Tc(m)-HMPAO-labeled granulocyte scintigraphy has been recently emphasized. The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 99m-technetium-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99Tc(m)-HMPAO)- or 111In-oxine-labeled granulocyte scintigraphy for the diagnosis of infection in pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis to define the ideal label for diagnosis. Thirty-six scintigraphic examinations were performed in 34 consecutive patients (mean age, 58 +/- 2 years) 20 +/- 2 days after the onset of acute pancreatitis (Balthazar classes A-C, n = 7
