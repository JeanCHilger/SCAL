Cystic tumors of the pancreas. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are rare but in the last years more frequently detected. Within a 10-year-period we treated 30 patients, including 8 serous cystadenomas, 6 mucinous cystadenomas, 12 mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 2 cystic neuro-endocrine tumors and 1 papillary cystic tumor respectively acinar cell cyst-adenocarcinoma. 80% of the patients had symptoms, experienced abdominal pain, weight loss, weakness or abdominal mass. In eight patients the tumors had been misdiagnosed as a pancreatic pseudocyst. The correct type of cystic tumor was diagnosed by preoperative investigations only a few cases. All patients with serous or mucinous cystadenomas are well and without evident recurrence after resection of the tumor. However the survival time of malignant cystic tumors varied strongly. The curative resection of these tumors give patients the chance of long-term survival.
