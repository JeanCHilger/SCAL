Scanning of polypoid gallbladder lesions by ultrasonic microprobes using transpapillary catheterization. Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder can be diagnosed by transabdominal ultrasonography and endoscopic ultrasonography. However, the image resolution is limited, and the histopathology of these lesions is difficult to determine. We report here on our preliminary results in four patients using a high-frequency (20 MHz) ultrasonic microprobe introduced into the gallbladder via the transpapillary approach.Insertion of the microprobe into the gallbladder through the papilla of Vater was attempted in four patients with gallbladder diseases without preceding endoscopic sphincterotomy.The lesions in the gallbladder were clearly visualized in three of the four patients. We tried to correlate the characteristic ultrasound findings with the histopathology of the lesions, which were found to be early cancer, adenoma, and adenomyomatosis on histopathology of the specimens after cholecystectomy. No complications occurred.High-resolution endoscopic transpapillary ultrasonography of the gallbladder is feasible and safe, and may contribute to the diagnosis of gallbladder diseases, particularly of small polypoid lesions.
