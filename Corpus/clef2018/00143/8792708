Radiology of pancreatic tuberculosis: a report of three cases. We report three cases of biopsy proven pancreatic tuberculosis. The patients presented with abdominal pain and intermittent fever. Ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a diffusely enlarged pancreas with focal hypoechoic/hypodense lesions in all three patients. In addition, one patient had a large pancreatic cyst with internal echoes. Associated findings included peripancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes, bowel wall thickening of ileocecal junction, focal hepatic or splenic lesions, splenic vein thrombosis, and ascites. Pancreatic tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic lesions, especially if associated with ancillary findings such as enlarged hypodense nodes in the peripancreatic region or in the mesentery in patients presenting with longstanding fever and abdominal pain.
