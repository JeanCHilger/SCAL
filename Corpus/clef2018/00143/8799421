A difficult early diagnosis of pancreatic body neoplasia. The Authors report the case of a 60-year-old man, V.A., a smoker with type II diabetes and cholelithiasis. One month after the onset of symptoms in March 1995, his clinical picture led us to suspect a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Only 110 days after the initial discovery of a high CA 19-9, following the failure of numerous techniques and the solution of various problems of differential diagnosis, the first unclear X-ray image of a suspected pancreatic neoplasia was obtained. A new computed tomography scan and a further increase in CA 19-9 later confirmed the diagnosis. Duodenopancreatectomy with splenectomy for adenocarcinoma was performed. The thread connecting 150 days of clinical history is CA 19-9, which acted as an ideal marker. It enabled a clinical "rarity" (pancreatic neoplasia in its initial stages) to be diagnosed and it increased as the neoplasia developed. After surgical removal of the tumor, the marker is now returning to normal levels and will be used to monitor the post-operative phase, when any increase in level could mean a recrudescence of the disease.
