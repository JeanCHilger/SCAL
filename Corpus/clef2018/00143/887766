Definitive role of CT scanning of the pancreas. The second year's experience. In a group of 188 patients, 192 computed tomographic (CT) scans of the pancreas were done, and the diagnostic accuracy of CT determined relative to other modalities. CT was the most effective method of detecting neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. The full extent of the disease process, including involvement of the retroperitoneum and metastasis to the liver, was visualized with one examination. Calcification and cystic collections associated with pancreatitis were also clearly seen.
