MR angiography and MR cholangiopancreatography. MR angiography is an adjunctive for noninvasive evaluation of blood vessels and MR cholangiopancreatography is for bile duct and pancreatic duct. Clinical applications of MR angiography has been focused mainly on head and neck and its applications to the abdomen are still limited. However, this technique has the good potential for the evaluation of portal vein system. MR cholangiopancreatography can depict bile ducts and pancreatic duct simultaneously and three-dimensionally. This technique can evaluate the causes of the lesion and its extent noninvasively. In this article the practical uses of MR angiography and MR cholangiography in the abdomen are discussed.
