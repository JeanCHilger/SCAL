Detection of embryologic ventral pancreatic parenchyma with endoscopic ultrasound. The prevalence of detecting the embryologic ventral pancreas (ventral anlage) with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is unknown.To determine the frequency of, and factors associated with, EUS findings consistent with the ventral anlage.One hundred patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal EUS for any indication were prospectively evaluated for the presence of a focal, hypoechoic area in the pancreatic head using a radial scanning echoendoscope. Multiple clinical and EUS variables were tested against the ability to detect the ventral anlage.The overall detection rate of the ventral anlage was 59%. The ventral anlage was detected in 75% of patients undergoing EUS for nonpancreatic indications, compared to 40% of patients undergoing EUS to evaluate suspected pancreatic disease (p< 0.001). EUS detected the ventral anlage in 72% of patients with a normal EUS-appearing pancreatic head, compared to 29% of patients who had abnormal pancreatic head parenchyma (mass or chronic pancreatitis) on EUS (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed the only variable associated with detecting the ventral anlage was abnormal pancreatic head parenchyma on EUS.The ventral anlage is frequently detected during pancreatic EUS, with a significantly lower rate of detection in patients with EUS findings of a pancreatic head mass or diffuse chronic pancreatitis.
