Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas: clinicopathologic features, outcome, and nomenclature. Members of the Pancreas Clinic, and Pancreatic Surgeons of Mayo Clinic. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreatic ducts is increasingly recognized. This study investigated if clinical, imaging, or, histological features predicated outcome, formulated a treatment algorithm, and clarified relationships among IPMT, mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas (MCN), and chronic pancreatitis.The medical records, radiographs, and pathological specimens of 15 patients with IPMT (dilated main pancreatic duct or branch ducts with mucin overproduction) who were evaluated between October 1983 and January 1994 were reviewed.One patient had hepatic metastases. Fourteen underwent an operation (6 distal pancreatectomy, 4 total pancreatectomy, and 4 pancreaticoduodenectomy) all had dysplastic intraductal epithelium and chronic pancreatitis, whereas 3 had invasive adenocarcinoma. After a median of 25 months, 10 patients were aliveIPMT is a dysplastic and likely precancerous lesion that is frequently diagnosed as chronic pancreatitis and is separate from MCN. Because it is not possible to distinguish noninvasive from invasive IPMT preoperatively, complete surgical excision of the dysplastic process is our treatment of choice whenever appropriate.
