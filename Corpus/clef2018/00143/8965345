Clinical application of helical CT and thin slice CT. Image data of helical CT is continuous data and helical CT is able to take whole organ scan during one breath hold. We applied helical CT to mass survey of lung cancer. The mass survey could detect 19 cases of lung cancers and 10 cases of these could be detected by only helical CT. Helical CT is useful for diagnosis of hepatic and pancreatic cancer also. Helical CT is able to take image of arterial, portal and venous phase of whole liver and these image were valuable to detect small hyper vascular hepatic neoplasma. CT image of arterial phase of pancreas revealed small pancreatic cancer as a comparative low attenuation area.
