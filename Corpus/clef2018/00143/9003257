Pancreatic trauma in children: mechanisms of injury. Pancreatic trauma occurs in up to 10% of all cases of blunt pediatric trauma. Here we attempted to identify markers of pancreatic injury in children and to assess our current diagnostic approach to pancreatic injury.We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a pancreatic injury admitted to a Level I pediatric trauma center between January of 1980 and September of 1994.In all, 26 children were included. All pancreatic injuries were due to blunt trauma. Handlebar injuries were the most common mechanism of injury and resulted in a unique pattern of isolated pancreatic trauma, often complicated by the development of a pseudocyst. Computed tomographic scans, performed with intravenous and oral contrast and done in the acute setting, were 85% sensitive for diagnosing a pancreatic injury.Double contrast computed tomographic scan is a more sensitive test than ultrasound in diagnosing pancreatic injury. The constellation of abdominal pain, an elevated serum amylase and a handlebar mechanism of injury warrants hospitalization and a double contrast abdominal computed tomographic scan.
