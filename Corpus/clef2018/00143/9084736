Mucinous ductal ectasia of the pancreas. We report a new case of mucinous ductal extasia of the pancreas observed in a 64-year-old man with a history of chronic exocrine failure. Diagnosis was obtained by CT, duodenal endoscopy and retrograde cholangio-pancreatography. Risk of malignant degeneration and increased CA 19-9 led to duodenopancreatectomy. Histology confirmed the diagnosis but revealed no malignant lesion. After a 3-year follow-up, the patient is in excellent health. Based on this observation and a review of the literature, we present the characteristic features of mucinous ductal ectasia of the pancreas.
