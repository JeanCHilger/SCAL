Abdominal computed tomography in systemic lupus erythematosus. Sixty-five abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans of 54 systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE) patients were retrospectively evaluated together with their clinical records. This was to assess the spectrum of CT findings and to determine the value of abdominal CT in this group of patients. Over a 3.5-year period, abdominal CT scans had been requested for suspected renal vein or inferior vena cava thrombosis (n = 52, 80%), sepsis, mesenteric ischaemia, Conn's syndrome, evaluation of hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension and hydronephrosis. The most frequent indication for CT was suspected renal vein thrombosis (RVT). An SLE patient with previously stable renal function who rapidly develops nephrotic syndrome with deteriorating renal function has an increased risk of thromboembolic phenomenon. Also, renal vein thrombosis is difficult to diagnose clinically and prompt anticoagulation can help preserve remaining renal function. Of these with suspected RVT, two had RVT only and five had thrombosis in both renal veins and inferior vena cava. Two patients had CT features strongly suggestive of mesenteric ischaemia, one had bilateral hydronephrosis thought to be secondary to lupus cystitis and CT confirmed two abdominal abscesses. Other incidental CT findings were: subscapular renal haematoma, overall enlargement or diminution of renal size, serositis, bowel wall thickening, splenic, hepatic and pancreatic enlargement and mild para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Abdominal CT revealed many diverse findings and aided the management of these SLE patients.
