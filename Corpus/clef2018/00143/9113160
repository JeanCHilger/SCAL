Intrapancreatic accessory spleen. X-ray computed tomographic and MRI imaging. We report MRI and CT findings of an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. The lesion was hypervascular on CT and isointense to the spleen on MRI. This uncommon localisation may simulate a pancreatic mass. If the diagnosis is suspected, it can be confirmed by scintigraphy.
