Pancreatitis due to cystic duodenal duplication in a 12-year-old child. Duodenal duplications are rare congenital anomalies which can present with pancreatitis. A precise preoperative diagnosis is rarely possible. We present a 12-year-old girl with relapsing pancreatitis in whom the diagnostic survey was initially inconclusive. Two years later abdominal ultrasound revealed a cyst near the head of pancreas. At laparotomy a cysto-duodenostomy was performed. The histology of the cyst wall was diagnostic.
