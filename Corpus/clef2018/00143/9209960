Groove pancreatitis with recurrent duodenal obstruction. Report of a case successfully treated with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Groove pancreatitis is a rare subtype of chronic pancreatitis that is difficult to distinguish from pancreatic carcinoma. Most reported patients have undergone a Whipple procedure because pancreatic cancer was not ruled out. We report a case of groove pancreatitis in a patient who presented with recurrent duodenal obstruction without biliary stricture. The diagnosis of groove pancreatitis was based on characteristic episodes of repeated duodenal obstruction and the absence of radiographic evidence of cancer. Subsequently, our patient underwent a successful pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). PPPD is a favorable alternative to the Whipple operation for duodenal obstruction resulting from this disease.
