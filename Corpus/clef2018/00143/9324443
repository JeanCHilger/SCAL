Injuries to the pancreas. Injuries of the pancreas seldom occur in connection with abdominal trauma (12%), but they are difficult to diagnose. There is a high complication rate (35%) after such injuries. Ultrasound, CT and other means of diagnosis are only helpful in making the diagnose only in 60-80%. A clinical examination is difficult in such patients, as they often have multiple injuries. We discuss 10 cases with different grades of pancreatic injuries (Lucas), their therapy with special attention to the diagnosis, time of laparotomy, exploration of the pancreas during operative intervention, the extent of treatment and the management of complications.
