Selective intra-arterial calcium injection in the investigation of adult nesidioblastosis: a case report. A 69-year-old man with recurrent hypoglycaemia had inappropriately elevated plasma insulin level during a symptomatic hypoglycaemia, but had a negative prolonged fast. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a nodular lesion over the body of pancreas, whereas pancreatic arteriography failed to show tumour blush. Hence, arterial stimulation (with calcium) and venous sampling (ASVS) was performed and a brisk response of plasma insulin level was found when calcium was injected both into the splenic and the superior mesenteric arteries. Since no tumour was found during the operation, the patient received subtotal distal pancreatectomy. Pathological examination of the resected tissue disclosed a typical finding of nesidioblastosis. We suggest that selective intra-arterial calcium injection with hepatic venous sampling for insulin gradients is useful for the diagnosis of adult nesidioblastosis.
