Huge non-functioning pancreatic cystic neuroendocrine tumour: a case report. A case of an 18-cm large cystic, non-functioning endocrine (islet cell) tumour located at the tail of the pancreas in a 29-year-old Caucasian female is reported here. Pre-operative radioimmunoassays for pancreatic peptides were negative, while immunohistochemistry confirmed the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour. This is the largest cystic non-functioning islet-cell tumour so far described.
