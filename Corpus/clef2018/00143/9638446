Solid cystic tumor of the head of the pancreas in a young woman. This a case report of a solid papillary tumor of the pancreas in a young woman of 18 years, who was referred to after having suffered for a period of 8 months with a rather vague symptomatology, characterized by dyspepsia, fatigue and, towards the end of the 8 month period, weight loss (approximately 2 kg). In the last week, as a consequence of a modest abdominal trauma, the patient was submitted to abdominal CT that showed a burden at the head of the pancreas, demonstrating a round neoformation about 6 cm in diameter with solid echogenicity slightly hypodense. Subsequently, she underwent an operation with the diagnosis of pseudocystis of the pancreas. During surgery, a big cystic formation of the head of the pancreas, into which a drain was introduced, was revealed. The histological postoperative examination was compatible with pancreatic tumor with a low grade of malignancy, cystic papillary or solid papillary type. Therefore, the patient came under our observation and underwent an operation of pancreatoduodenectomy. Two years after the operation, the patient had completely recovered. In this case, we discussed the problem of performing certain preoperative diagnoses despite the aid of modern diagnostic imaging, this being a very rare illness that almost exclusively plagues young women (median age 19 years). This diagnosis has an uncertain histological origin and is generally accompanied by a modest and vague symptomatology. The surgical procedure, given the low grade of malignancy of the neoplasm and the excellent long-term prognosis, must be, with respect to the oncological radicality, as conservative as possible.
