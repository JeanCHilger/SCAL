Cystic degeneration of heterotopic pancreas. The case of a large cyst arising from heterotopically-situated pancreatic tissue in an 11-month-old girl is reported. This is the first published report of childhood pancreatic cyst that developed in heterotopic pancreatic tissue. There is strong evidence to suggest that the cyst became symptomatic as a result of secondary infection, an additional unreported phenomenon. This case serves to underscore the fact that pancreatic cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intestinal duplication cysts of childhood.
