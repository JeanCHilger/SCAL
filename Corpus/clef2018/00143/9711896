Advanced pancreatic cancer successfully treated with continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil and low-dose cisplatin. Due to pyloric stenosis in a 59-year-old male with the diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic head cancer, gastro-jejunostomy and cholecysto-jejunostomy were performed. Following the operation, the patient underwent a combination chemotherapy with cisplatin 10 mg/day x 5/week and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/day for 4 weeks. After three courses, the tumor size decreased and the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level decreased from 89.6 to 4.2 ng/ml without significant adverse effects. During the follow-up, the CEA increased and the patient is now receiving the same treatment, surviving for more than one year.
