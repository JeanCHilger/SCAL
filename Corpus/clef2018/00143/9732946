Insulinoma associated with liver lesions: value of MR imaging. We report on a middle-aged woman who presented with clinical and biochemical findings of insulinoma. Preoperative evaluation by ultrasound, CT, and angiography located the pancreatic lesion but also revealed two focal liver lesions. The latter were interpreted as metastases. MR imaging with injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles not only localized the insulinoma but proved to be the only noninvasive technique capable to exclude presence of liver metastases preoperatively. This reversed management to minimal laparoscopic surgery. Recent literature of preoperative imaging evaluation of insulinoma and focal liver lesions is discussed.
