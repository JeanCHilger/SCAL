Pancreatic metastasis from a lung cancer. Preoperative diagnosis and management. A case of a surgically resectable solitary metastasis to the pancreas from a lung cancer, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining (PE-10), is reported. ERCP revealed meniscoid interruption of the main pancreatic duct, which is uncommon in patients with primary pancreatic cancers of the pancreas in our hospital. This patient lived for 29 mo after the surgical resection of the pancreatic lesion. Therefore when metastasis limited to the pancreas is evident on clinical imaging, surgical management may be more optimal than other treatment approaches.
