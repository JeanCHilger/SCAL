Pancreatitis associated with pleural-mediastinal pseudocyst, panniculitis and polyarthritis. We describe two patients with pancreatitis. One patient had acute pancreatitis of biliary origin and presented with small joint polyarthritis and panniculitis lesions. The other patient was originally hospitalised for dyspnoea with bilateral pleural effusion, and subsequently developed migratory polyarthritis. During his hospital stay he developed panniculitis lesions and a monoclonal IgG disorder of unknown significance. Very few patients with pancreatitis develop polyarthritis and panniculitis. The appearance of pseudocysts in the pleural and mediastinal cavity in the course of pancreatitis is an infrequent complication.
