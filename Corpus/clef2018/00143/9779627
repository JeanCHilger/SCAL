Laparoscopic evaluation in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer continues to carry a poor overall prognosis. The majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Dynamic, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the radiographic study of choice in the pre-operative staging of patients with pancreatic cancer. While it has been shown to be highly sensitive in determining unresectability of peri-ampullary tumors, the ability of CT to predict accurately which tumors can be safely resected is still limited. Laparoscopic staging of peri-ampullary tumors is superior to dynamic CT in visualizing small liver and peritoneal metastases. The addition of laparoscopic ultrasound during laparoscopic staging enhances the ability of laparoscopy to determine resectability of these tumors and approaches the accuracy of open exploration without increasing significant morbidity or mortality. Patients who are deemed unresectable at the time of laparoscopy can undergo palliative biliary and/or gastric bypass procedures laparoscopically and further minimize the morbidity of laparotomy.
