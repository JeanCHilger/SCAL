Review article: current practice and future perspectives in detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most prevalent malignancy and the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the developed world. Less than 10% of patients survive for more than 1 year following diagnosis and the 5-year survival rate (0.4%) is the lowest of any cancer. The poor prognosis associated with this diagnosis led in the past to therapeutic nihilism on the part of clinicians who were all too aware of the limitations of their available therapeutic strategies. Breaking this therapeutic impasse requires a significant expansion in the knowledge of clinicians concerning the pathogenesis and behaviour of pancreatic cancer. Recent advances in the scientific understanding of the aetiology of pancreatic cancer has facilitated progress towards the development of promising and innovative approaches to the early detection and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. While acknowledging that pancreatic cancer will continue to present significant challenges to both scientists and clinicians in the foreseeable future, it is becoming increasingly clear that recent advances in our scientific knowledge base holds the potential to significantly improve prognosis for patients. The challenge facing both scientists and clinicians is how best to translate such promising scientific advances into survival and quality of life benefits to patients.
