Leptin regulation of islet amyloid polypeptide secretion from mouse pancreatic islets. Leptin receptors are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells. However, leptin's role in islet hormone secretion is essentially unknown. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate leptin's effect on isolated pancreatic NMRI mouse islets by examining islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and insulin secretion in acute experiments and after 48-hr exposure to leptin (1-100 nM). It was also examined whether a putative effect of leptin was affected by the glucose concentration. Islets were cultured in medium RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal calf serum, and the effects of leptin on islet cell replication, glucose metabolism, and hormone content were subsequently examined. Glucose-stimulated IAPP secretion was reduced both acutely and after 48-hr exposure to leptin, whereas only minor effects were found on insulin release, i.e. an inhibition in islets cultured with 1 nM leptin. An acute inhibitory effect by 10 nM leptin was observed on the ratio of IAPP/insulin release at 5.6-11.1 mM glucose, but this was overcome by 16.7 mM glucose. The islet glucose oxidation rate was enhanced by 1 nM leptin, but decreased at higher concentrations of leptin in acute experiments. In contrast, glucose metabolism was not affected in long-term experiments. Moreover, leptin did not influence islet (pro)insulin synthesis or the cell replication rate after culture. In conclusion, we show that islet IAPP release seems to be more sensitive to leptin than is insulin release. The effect of leptin on islet hormone secretion is dependent on the glucose concentration. The regulation of hormone secretion seems to be dissociated from glucose metabolism, an effect previously described in islets after exposure to certain cytokines. Our data necessarily suggest that a previously proposed negative feedback loop between leptin and insulin can be counteracted by IAPP.
