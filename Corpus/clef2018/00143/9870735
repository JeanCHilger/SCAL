Necrolytic migratory erythema, first symptom of a malignant glucagonoma: treatment by long-acting somatostatin and surgical resection. Report of three cases. We report three cases of malignant glucagonoma with necrolytic migratory erythema as the first clinical symptom. Long-acting somatostatin analogue was the first step of a multimodal therapeutic strategy which included surgical resection of the primary tumour in every case. Liver metastases which were present in two patients were treated by hepatic arterial chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy in one case and by liver resection for cytoreduction and hepatic arterial chemoembolization in another case. Skin lesions resolved in all three patients.
