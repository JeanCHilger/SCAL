Ductectatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a rare variant. A rare case of the ductectatic variant of mucinous pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma in a 64 year-old man, presenting with painless obstructive jaundice, is reported. CT scan revealed a multicystic lesion of the pancreatic head, which caused biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) revealed the characteristic grapelike cluster pattern of pancreatic ductectatic neoplasms. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was then successfully performed. Pancreatic ductectatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma is a rare entity, presenting, usually, with obstructive pancreatitis, and is histologically indistinguishable from the classic malignant mucinous cystic neoplasm. ERP is the diagnostic method of choice and should be performed in any case of susceptible pancreatic lesions.
