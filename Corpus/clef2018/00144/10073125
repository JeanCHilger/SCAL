Periampullary carcinomas: a special entity of duodenal tumors. Periampullary carcinomas are rare and constitute a special entity, as diagnosed earlier and having a better prognosis than other duodenal tumors.In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 16 patients with periampullary carcinomas over 10 years.16 patients, 10 men and 6 women (median age 66.7 years, range 42-80) had a malignant periampullary tumor. Initial symptoms were jaundice (88%), weight loss (69%), nausea and vomiting (50%) and abdominal pain (38%). Gastro-duodenoscopy, ERCP, ultrasound and CT scan were the most useful diagnostic tools. Histologically all the tumors were adenocarcinomas and solitary tumors. 91% were stage pT1 or pT2 tumors, localized in the duodenal wall without any infiltration of the pancreas. 36% of the tumors had metastasized either in lymph nodes or distant organs at diagnosis (18% pN1, 18% pM1). Resectability rate was 81%, curative resection was achieved in 62%. The operations performed were pancreatico-duodenectomy (n = 8), local tumor resection (n = 5) and palliative bypass (n = 3). Morbidity and reoperation rate were 37.5% and 18.8%, respectively 30-day mortality was 0%. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were 58.3% and 33.3%, respectively.Compared to carcinomas of the small bowel or the exocrine pancreas periampullary carcinomas have a far better 5-year survival rate of more than 30%. Aggressive diagnostic workup in case of the leading symptom jaundice and radical operative therapy are key factors to achieve this goal.
