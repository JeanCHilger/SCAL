Time-resolved MR angiography of the upper abdomen: initial clinical experience. In this study, thirty-eight patients with a variety of upper abdominal diseases were examined with three-dimensional time-resolved MR angiography (7 sec/data set). Visualisation of arterial and venous anatomy was excellent in the majority of patients. Moreover, subtraction images could be calculated and organ perfusion could be assessed. It is concluded that this technique opens new perspectives for a comprehensive evaluation of vascular and parenchymal disease.
