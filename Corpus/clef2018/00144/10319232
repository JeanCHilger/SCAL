Microcystic adenoma of the pancreas: cytologic appearance on percutaneous and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration: report of a case. Microcystic adenoma is an uncommon neoplasm of the pancreas usually affecting older people. Its histologic features have been well characterized. The cytologic appearance of this tumor has been described only rarely, however, Microcystic adenomas may enlarge considerably and often produce symptoms related to their compression to adjacent anatomic structures. The fact that this neoplasm is almost always benign indicates the need for accurate preoperative diagnosis to differentiate it from other, more common, malignant or potentially malignant tumors of the pancreas. We present a case of pancreatic microcystic adenoma initially diagnosed by percutaneous image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination and core biopsy and further evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration on follow-up. This case report illustrates that microcystic adenoma of the pancreas can be accurately diagnosed by aspiration cytology. Fine-needle aspiration--percutaneous, guided by computerized tomography, or endoscopically guided by ultrasonography--constitutes a reliable and cost-efficient diagnostic tool associated with minimal trauma to the patient.
