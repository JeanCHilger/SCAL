The choice of treatment in multiple pancreatic pseudocysts. The authors present their own experience in the treatment of 4 patients (3F, IM) with multiple pancreatic pseudocysts. The diagnosis was based on ultrasound and CT. In 4 patients 2, 2, 3, and 3 pseudocysts were found respectively. One patients was cured using two pig-tail catheters within 3-5 days. Two patients had internal drainage. One of them had 3 pseudocysts, two were anastomosed with the stomach (Jurasz operation) and the third one with jejuneum. The other patient had cystocystostomy and so created cyst was then anastomosed with the stomach applying Jurasz's method. In the 3rd patient with 3 pseudocysts pancreatectomy was done. This case was complicated by pancreatic fistula, but finally good result was achieved. In the follow up time (2, 3, 5 years and 5 months) there was no recurrence of the pseudocysts and the patient's condition was good.
