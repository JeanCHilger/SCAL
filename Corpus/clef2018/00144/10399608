Fast MR imaging for evaluating the pancreaticobiliary system. Due to physiological movement clinical MR applications for abdominal organs got off to a very slow start compared to MR imaging of other organs. However, with recent cutting-edge hardware technologies such as high performance gradient systems and phased-array capability, as well as software innovations including short TR fast spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), snapshot imaging such as single shot fast spin echo sequence (SSFSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI), scan times have been further reduced to make breath-hold imaging clinically viable and to enable semi-fluoroscopic, kinematic imaging recognition. The elimination of physiological motion has contributed to the significant improvement in image quality, or more specifically, the physiological motion that had long been problematic has been turned into a source of physiological information about pancreaticobiliary pathologies. In this article, the author reviewed the current status of fast MR technologies for examining pancreaticobiliary pathologies, stressing the functional and physiological aspects of the corresponding anatomy. The technologies included secretin MRCP, which became a powerful tool when combined with kinematic imaging.
