Islet cell tumor of the pancreas associated with tumor thrombus in the portal vein. We report the MR findings of a 70-year-old man with an islet cell tumor that diffusely involved the body of the pancreas associated with enhancing portal vein tumor thrombus and cavernous transformation. The diffusely infiltrative tumor mass was best shown on early post gadolinium spoiled gradient echo. The tumor thrombus enhanced intensely on early post gadolinium images and was also well shown on true FISP (Fast Imaging with Steady State Precession) images. The extent of liver metastases was best shown on fat suppressed T2-weighted images. The most unusual finding was tumor thrombus involving the SMV and portal vein.
