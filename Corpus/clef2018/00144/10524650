Ileal aberrant pancreas induces intussusception and gastrointestinal bleeding in an adult woman--case report. Aberrant pancreas is a congenital anomaly. In surgical series, its incidence varied from 0.2 to 0.8%. About 70% of aberrant pancreas occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Eighty percent of them locate in the stomach and duodenum, and only 0.2% in the ileum. We report on a 25-year-old woman with ileal aberrant pancreas who suffered from ileal intussusception and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery and histology. She is symptom-free after surgery.
