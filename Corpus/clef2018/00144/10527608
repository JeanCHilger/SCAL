Organ-preserving surgery for multicentric carcinoma of the pancreas. Multicentric ductal carcinoma of the pancreas is usually treated by total pancreatectomy if surgically resectable. We present a case of metachrone, multicentric ductal carcinoma of the pancreas which was treated using an organ-preserving method. The reasons for doing so and the oncological and functional outcomes are discussed.
