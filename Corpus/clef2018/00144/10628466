Imaging features of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder in pancreas transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to describe the imaging features of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in pancreas transplant recipients.The prominent image finding of PTLD in pancreas transplant recipients is diffuse allograft enlargement, an appearance that may be indistinguishable from the image findings of acute pancreatitis or transplant rejection. However, failure of response to immunosuppressive therapy, presence of intraallograft or extraallograft focal masses, or organomegaly may suggest the diagnosis of PTLD.
