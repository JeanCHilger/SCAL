Pancreaticobiliary ductal system: value of half-Fourier rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement MR cholangiopancreatography for postoperative evaluation. To assess the usefulness of half-Fourier rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for evaluation of postoperative changes in the pancreaticobiliary ductal system.The study included 34 patients (20 men, 14 women mean age, 65.5 years) who underwent surgery of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. Half-Fourier RARE MRCP images were obtained after surgery. Qualitative evaluation included ratings by two observers for depiction of postoperative anatomy and for artifacts, as well as analysis of postoperative complications. Direct cholangiographic, computed tomographic, and ultrasonographic findings and 6-month follow-up results were the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for the evaluation of postsurgical complications seen at half-Fourier RARE MRCP.The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRCP for the evaluation of postsurgical complications were each 100% for ductal dilatation 100%, 87%, and 89%, respectively, for choledochoenteric anastomotic strictureHalf-Fourier RARE MRCP is a reliable imaging technique for the evaluation of anatomy and of complications associated with a surgically altered pancreaticobiliary ductal system.
