Pancreas and peripancreatic vessels: effect of imaging delay on gadolinium enhancement at dynamic gradient-recalled-echo MR imaging. To investigate the effect of imaging delay on gadolinium enhancement of the pancreas and peripancreatic vessels at dynamic gradient-recalled-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pancreas.Dynamic MR images were obtained after intravenous bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine in 75 patients with no pancreatic malignancies. Test-bolus imaging was performed to determine aortic transit time in individual patients. Patients were randomly assigned so that the middle of k space was acquired at 5, 15, 25, 35, or 45 seconds after arrival of contrast material in the abdominal aorta. Mean signal intensities of pancreas, liver, and peripancreatic vessels were measured, and images were qualitatively assessed by two radiologists.The best pancreatic enhancement occurred at a delay of 15 seconds (P <.05). The best enhancement of the liver and peripancreatic vessels occurred at 25 seconds or later (P <.05). Qualitatively, the best images of the pancreas were obtained at 15 seconds, and the best images of the liver and peripancreatic vessels were obtained at 25 seconds or later.Biphasic imaging at 15 and 45 seconds or later after arrival of contrast material in the abdominal aorta is a practical method for acquisition of high-quality dynamic gradient-recalled-echo MR images of the pancreas.
