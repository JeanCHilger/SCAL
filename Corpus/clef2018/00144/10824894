Pancreatic vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-oma as a cause of secretory diarrhoea. A 42-year-old woman presented with a 4-year history of worsening diarrhoea that was watery, profuse and confirmed to be secretory in nature. She had tested positive for phenolphthalein on urinary laxative screening but continued to deny laxative usage. Her vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) level was subsequently found to be markedly elevated. Despite a normal abdominal ultrasound, a computed tomography scan revealed a 5-cm pancreatic tail mass. Octreotide scanning was used to exclude metastatic disease and she went on to have surgical removal of a localized pancreatic vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-oma which resulted in the complete resolution of her diarrhoea.
