Autoimmune pancreatitis detected as a mass in the tail of the pancreas. A mass in the tail of the pancreas was detected in a 62-year-old male patient who had hypergammaglobulinaemia, and was positive for antinuclear antigen and anti-SS-A antibody. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed focal irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct in the tail of the pancreas. Dynamic computed tomography showed swelling of the pancreatic tail, which was enhanced on delayed phase. Autoimmune pancreatitis was suspected and corticosteroid therapy was commenced. This led to significant resolution of the pancreatic stricture. It is important to recognize this clinical entity as corticosteroid therapy may avoid unnecessary surgery.
