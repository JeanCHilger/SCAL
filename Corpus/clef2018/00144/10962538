Primary pancreatic lymphoma: a case report, literature review, and proposal for nomenclature. Primary neoplasms of the pancreas are most often adenocarcinoma. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) involving the pancreas is less common but well documented the pancreas as the primary site of NHL is rare. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, whether it is adenocarcinoma or lymphoma, present with a mass in the head of the gland. Pancreatic lymphoma is often described as a large homogeneous mass with extra-pancreatic extension, with or without associated lymphadenopathy. Less common presentations are masses in the body or tail, or more rarely diffuse involvement of the pancreas. We present a case of diffuse pancreatic lymphoma with extra-pancreatic dissemination to the spleen and lymph nodes, and review the literature on pancreatic lymphoma. Because the definition of pancreatic lymphoma and primary pancreatic lymphoma varies, we also propose a nomenclature system to make future studies of pancreatic lymphoma more comparable.
