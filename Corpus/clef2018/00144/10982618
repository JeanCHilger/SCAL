Large acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas in a patient with elevated serum AFP level. A pancreatic carcinoma, associated with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level, was resected from a 67-year-old man. The tumor was strongly suggested to be an acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, based on the histological findings of the resected specimen. The tumor measured 12 x 10 x 9 cm, and the cut surface was soft, whitish-yellow, focally necrotic, and hemorrhagic. Under a light microscope, the tumor cells were not arranged in a tubular and trabecular pattern, but rather, showed a tendency toward an acinar structure. Immunohistochemically, alpha 1-antitrypsin- and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin-positive reactions were diffusely positive in most of the tumor cells, while staining for chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, Grimelius, glucagon, insulin, and alpha-fetoprotein was negative in the tumor cells. We report a large acinar cell carcinoma (associated with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level), which had been misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma preoperatively.
