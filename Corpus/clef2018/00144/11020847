A new case of congenital cyst of the pancreas. A new case of congenital cyst of the pancreas is reported. A 34-year-old woman was admitted with a painless, large, epigastric mass. Ultrasonography revealed an anechogenic retrogastric tumor. Computed tomography scan described a liquid cyst of the pancreas which was 15 cm in diameter. During surgery, a well-delimited translucent cyst was found and no local malignancy was observed. Extensive distal pancreatic resection with preservation of the spleen was performed and a thin part of cephalic pancreas was preserved. The liquid of the cyst did not contain any mucus. Microscopic study of the cyst wall described normal cuboidal cells and congenital cyst of the pancreas was diagnosed. Several diagnoses including hydatid cyst, pseudocyst and cystic tumors of the pancreas are discussed. Before surgery, lack of acute pancreatitis in recent medical history rules out pseudocyst and hydatid cyst. During the operation, if cystadenocarcinoma is easily ruled out, macrocystic serous cystadenoma is more difficult to exclude. Only histological examination of the cystic wall confirms the difference between cystadenoma and congenital cyst which remains an exceptional entity.
