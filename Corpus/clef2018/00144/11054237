Complicated chronic pancreatitis causing mycotic aortic aneurysm: in situ replacement with a cryopreserved aortic allograft. Mycotic aortic aneurysm, which resulted from infected pancreatic pseudocysts with retroperitoneal abscess, developed in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. The aorta was approached through median laparotomy. Necrotic material was debrided from the pancreatic pseudocysts, and the mycotic aneurysm was resected. The aorta was replaced in situ with a cryopreserved aortic allograft. This report discusses the rare complication of pancreatic pseudocysts, which affect the infrarenal abdominal aorta and cause a large mycotic aneurysm. This case suggests that the use of cryopreserved allografts is promising for in situ reconstruction, even in a grossly infected field.
