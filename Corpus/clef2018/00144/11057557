Relapsing pancreatitis in a child duplication in an aberrant pancreatic lobe. An aberrant pancreatic lobe associated with an enteric duplication cyst is a rare cause of relapsing pancreatitis in childhood. We present an 8-year-old boy with relapsing pancreatitis caused by this rare congenital foregut anomaly. The computed tomography (CT) findings revealed an unusually long segment of aberrant pancreatic lobe arising from the pancreatic neck, projecting anteriorly at a distance to a cystic duodenal duplication and appearing as an inflammatory mass. There has been no previous report of this unusual appearance on CT. Appreciation of the relevant anatomy provided by CT led to the successful management of this surgically-treatable cause of relapsing pancreatitis.
