Diagnostic possibilities of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Studies for 39 patients have been done with the use of a new non-invasive method of observation--MR cholangiopancreatography,--that enables to get a high contrast-enhanced image of the intrahepatic, extrahepatic and pancreatic ducts without administration of the contrast agents and invasive interventions. High diagnostic efficiency of the method has been proved in patients with diseases of bile ducts and pancreas. The observation technique has been optimized and semiotics has been clarified in cases of various diseases that cause on obstruction of the biliferous tracts. The advantages of this method has been showed as compared to invasive roentgenologic methods of examinations.
