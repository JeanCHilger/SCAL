A new computed tomographic sign of pancreatitis. Computed body tomography has become useful in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease. Pancreatitis frequently results in lateral and posterior extension of inflammatory tissue into the pararenal fat planes, which can be visualized by CT. In our series it was associated with clinically diagnosed pancreatitis. Of 100 cases studied for abdominal pathology where pancreatic visualization was optimum, 10 had enlargement of the pancreas with destruction of soft tissue planes extending into the left pararenal space and clinical findings of pancreatitis. Carcinoma of the pancreas was identified in 12 no abnormality was identified in 49
