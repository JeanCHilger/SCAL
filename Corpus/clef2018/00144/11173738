Diagnosis and treatment of spleen rupture during pancreatitis. A 31-year old man was admitted for acute pancreatitis. His condition deteriorated progressively and he developed an acute anemia followed five days after admission by an hemorrhagic shock consecutive to splenic rupture. A 45-year old woman was admitted because of an acute episode of chronic pancreatitis. She improved progressively but developed eleven days after admission an hemorrhagic shock consecutive to the rupture of a subcapsular haematoma of the spleen. Splenic rupture, an infrequent complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, is responsible for anemia and hemorrhagic shock. Abdominal ultrasonography and CT scan are necessary to make the diagnosis of splenic rupture and to look for risk factors of splenic rupture, i.e. necrosis in the spleen hilium, left pancreatic pseudocyst, splenic vein thrombosis, segmental portal hypertension, splenomegaly and intrasplenic collection. When possible, embolization of the splenic artery can stop bleeding. Splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy seems to be the appropriate treatment of splenic rupture.
