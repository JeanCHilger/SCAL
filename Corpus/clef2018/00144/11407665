Digestive neuroendocrine tumours: diagnosis and treatment in Italy. A survey by the Oncology Study Section of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE). New insights in the diagnosis and treatment of digestive neuroendocrine tumours have prompted a renewed interest in these rare and complex diseases.To establish how many new cases of digestive neuroendocrine tumours were diagnosed, and how they were treated, at gastroenterological centres across Italy during a two-year period (1997-1998).The 12 centres taking part filled in a data collection form reporting type of tumour, methods of diagnosis and therapeutic strategies adopted in each case. Data were collected and analysed by the authors of the present report.Data refer to 98 patients, 22 with functioning and 76 with non-functioning digestive neuroendocrine tumours [50 carcinoids, 48 pancreatic endocrine tumour syndromes]. Primary tumours were localised in 96% (38% with metastases) of non-functioning and 81% (50% with metastases) of functioning tumours. These were surgically removed in >80% of patients in both groups. Somatostatin analogue treatment, with or without interferon, was administered in 35% of patients, while chemotherapy was used in 9% and 23% of functioning and non-functioning tumours, respectively. The imaging study always included a computed tomography scan (20% helical computed tomography). Magnetic resonance and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy were also performed, the former in 41% and 21% of the two (functioning and non-functioning tumour) groups, the latter in 45% and 30%.The number of functioning digestive neuroendocrine tumours reported was lower than expected. Surgery plays a major role in the treatment of these tumours in all centres. Overall, in only a small number of patients was a multidisciplinary approach applied.
