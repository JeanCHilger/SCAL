Multi--detector row helical CT of the pancreas: effect of contrast-enhanced multiphasic imaging on enhancement of the pancreas, peripancreatic vasculature, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To determine the optimal phase for enhancement of the normal pancreas and peripancreatic vasculature and the maximal tumor-to-pancreatic parenchymal enhancement difference by using multiphase, contrast material-enhanced, multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT).Forty-nine patients with a normal-appearing pancreas but suspected of having pancreatic abnormality and 28 patients with proved pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent multiphase, contrast-enhanced, multi-detector row CT during the arterial phase (AP), pancreatic parenchymal phase (PPP), and portal venous phase (PVP). Attenuation values of the normal pancreas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, and superior mesenteric and portal veins were measured during all three imaging phases. Quantitative analysis of these measurements and subjective qualitative analysis of tumor conspicuity were performed.Maximal enhancement of the normal pancreatic parenchyma occurred during the PPP. Maximal tumor-to-parenchyma attenuation differences during the PPP and PVP were equivalent but greater than that during the AP. Subjective analysis revealed that tumor conspicuity during the PPP and PVP was equivalent but superior to that during the AP. Maximal arterial enhancement was seen during the PPP, and maximal venous enhancement was seen during the PVP.A combination of PPP and PVP imaging is sufficient for detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, because it provides maximal pancreatic parenchymal and peripancreatic vascular enhancement. AP imaging can be reserved for patients in whom CT angiography is required.
