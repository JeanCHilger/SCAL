Pancreatic tuberculosis presenting with recurrent acute pancreatitis. Tuberculosis, in its extrapulmonary form, though emerging as a common clinical problem, rarely affects the pancreas. Its indolent course, vague symptomatology along with its non-specific laboratory and radiographic findings call for greater vigilance. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis, previously managed as recurrent alcohol related pancreatitis which showed symptomatic improvement following commencement of antituberculosis drugs. The diagnosis of pancreatic tuberculosis in this case was based on the abdominal CT scan findings, response to anti-tubeculous chemotherapy and overall laboratory and radiological work-up.
