Efficacy of ultrasonography in pancreatic disorders compared to endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography (author's transl). To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonography in pancreatic disorders the results were compared with endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography in 140 II resection-retrograde cannulation of Vater's papilla was unsuccessful, examination of the pancreas was not possible in 20 patients with ultrasonography because of meteorism of severe adipositas. In 15 subjects the sonographic findings were equivocal. Out of 105 ultrasonic findings three were false-negative and 5 false-positive, whereas retrograde Wirsungography resulted in 9 false-negative and 2 false-positive interpretations. In 50 out of 67 cases of pancreatic disorders diagnosed by ultrasonography a further differentiation between malignant tumours and benign pseudotumours (pancreatitis or cyst) was possible. With respect to the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts ultrasonography was superior by 23 of 27 to retrograde pancreaticography (12 out of 27) since many cysts do not communicate with the ductal system. In comparison with the endoscopic method the risklessness and the low expenses have to be stressed. Both methods supplement each other, so that a high diagnostic accuracy is reached (more than 95 per cent).
