Transcatheter endovascular therapy of a traumatic common hepatic artery aneurysm. Dilemma was encountered regarding diagnosis and treatment when a farmer presented with a progressively increasing pulsatile abdominal mass and signs of obstructive jaundice. A computerized tomographic scan reported it to be a pancreatic pathology, but angiographically it was found to be a large aneurysm arising from the common hepatic artery. Surgery was thought to be highly risky therefore, a transcatheter technique was successfully applied to tackle this life-threatening situation.
