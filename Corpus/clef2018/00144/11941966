Hepatectomy for liver metastasis from ampullary cancer after pancreatoduodenectomy. A 51-year-old Japanese woman with a solitary liver metastasis originating from a carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater was successfully treated by partial hepatectomy 19 months after curative pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy. Histologic examination revealed a stage III well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (pT2, pN1, and pM0). Postoperative serum concentrations of carcinoembryonic antigen increased exponentially to 133 ng/mL. The carcinoembryonic antigen doubling time was 63 days. Computed tomography and ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a solitary metastasis in segment VI of the liver. Since neither local recurrences nor other distant metastases were detected, the patient underwent partial hepatectomy. Histologic study confirmed the presence of a metastatic liver tumor from the ampullary carcinoma. The carcinoembryonic antigen levels returned to normal immediately after the partial hepatectomy. She was well without signs of recurrence 18 months after partial hepatectomy.
