Preliminary experience with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in Ethiopia. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcome of diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and to increase the awareness of physicians practicing in Ethiopia about the procedure. Between April 1993 and October 1997, 47 patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa. Cholestasis, postcholecystectomy syndrome and abdominal pain with intermittent jaundice accounted for 91% of the indications. The success rate of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was 81%. Cholestasis provided the highest diagnostic yield followed by postcholecystectomy syndrome and abdominal pain with intermittent jaundice. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography finding was normal in 18% of cases. The commonest abnormal findings were gall stones (45%), biliary strictures (16%) and pancreatic carcinomas (11%). Using ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, choledocholithiasis was diagnosed in three (21%) and 13 (93%) cases, respectively. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was confirmed at surgery in all but one patient. Acute cholangitis and asymptomatic elevation of serum amylase and/or lipase were noted in three (6%) and four (9%) cases, respectively. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is generally a safe diagnostic modality and should be used more frequently for the diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic diseases.
