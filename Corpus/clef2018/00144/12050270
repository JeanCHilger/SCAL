Comparison of insulin sensitivity, clearance, and secretion estimates using euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps in children. The euglycemic clamp is the gold standard for estimating insulin sensitivity. The hyperglycemic clamp is easier to perform and is the gold standard for estimating beta-cell secretion. Reports in adults suggest that hyperglycemic clamps can estimate insulin sensitivity with results equivalent to euglycemic clamps. We investigated whether insulin sensitivity measures from both clamps are equivalent in children. Thirty-one lean and obese children (mean body mass index, 25.1 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2) mean age, 8.7 +/- 1.4 yr
