MR imaging of pancreatic lesions with Mn-DPDP. A histopathologic correlation. To examine the diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic lesions using mangafodipir-trisodium (Mn-DPDP) enhanced MR imaging. The imaging results were correlated with the histopathological results.40 patients with suspicion of pancreatic carcinoma were examined with MRI before and after i. v. administration of Mn-DPDP (Philips Gyroscan ACS NT 1.5 T, phased array body-coil: TSE T 2 with and without SPIR, TR 2000 ms, TE 120ms FFE T 1 breathhold, TR 115 ms, TE 4.6 msThe following lesions were found: adenocarcinoma (19), pancreatitis (8), adenocarcinoma within pancreatitis (3), insulinoma (2), hematoma (1), papillitis stenosans (1), signet ring cell carcinoma (1), metastasis of rectal carcinoma (1), papillary mesothelioma (1). In three patients there was no pathological finding. Mn-DPDP enhanced MRI showed a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 56 %.Mn-DPDP enhanced MRI in conjunction with MRCP showed a high sensitivity for the detection of pancreatic lesions. However, the specificity is low, thus recommending Mn-DPDP enhanced MRI only as a complementary imaging method.
