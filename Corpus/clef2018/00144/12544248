Lithiasis in a heterotopic pancreas of the stomach. A heterotopic pancreas is a relatively uncommon abnormality and usually of no clinical importance. A heterotopic pancreas is subject to various pathologic changes occurring in the pancreas, however, such as acute pancreatitis, cyst or abscess formation, pancreatic cancer, and islet cell tumor. We describe a rare case of a heterotopic pancreas presenting as a gastric submucosal mass with punctate calcifications occurring in a 43-year-old man.
