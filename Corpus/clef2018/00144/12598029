Multislice helical CT of the pancreas and spleen. Multislice helical CT (MSCT) with its multidetector technology and faster rotation times, has led to new dimensions in spatial and temporal resolution in CT imaging. In contrast to single-slice CT, smaller slice collimations can be applied that lead to almost isotropic voxels and allow high quality multiplanar and 3-D image reconstructions. The high speed of multislice CT can be used to reduce the time needed to cover a given volume, to increase the spatial resolution along the z-axis by applying thinner slice collimations, and to cover longer anatomic volumes. The speed of MSCT allows organ imaging in clearly defined perfusion phases, e.g. the arterial, parenchymal, and portal venous perfusion phases. Contrast agents with higher iodine concentrations (400 mg iodine per ml compared with 300 mg iodine per ml) lead to higher contrast enhancement of the pancreas (arterial+portal venous phases), the kidneys (arterial+portal venous phases), the spleen (arterial phase), the wall of the small intestine (arterial+portal venous phases), the larger and smaller arteries (arterial phase), and the portal vein (portal venous phase). All of these advancements lead to improved visualization of small structures and of various pathologies, such as pancreatic tumors, liver metastases, vessel infiltration, and vascular diseases.
