Cystic pancreatic neoplasms evaluation by CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. CT provides limited assistance in the differentiation between serous and mucinous neoplasms. Because of the variability in the radiographic appearance of serous cystadenomas and overlap in CT characteristics with mucinous neoplasms, most serous neoplasms still require ancillary testing such as biopsy to reach a definitive diagnosis. MRCP is useful in differentiating benign and malignant mucinous tumors including IPMT of the pancreas. The presence of mural nodules is suggestive of malignancy however, the absence of mural nodules does not indicate that the tumor is benign. A maximum main pancreatic duct diameter of greater than 15 mm and diffuse dilatation of the main pancreatic duct are suggestive of malignancy in main duct-type tumors. Among branch duct-type tumors, malignant tumors tend to be larger than benign tumors
