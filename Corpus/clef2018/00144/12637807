Retroperitoneal bronchogenic cyst as a differential diagnosis of pancreatic mucinous cystic tumor. Cystic tumors of the pancreas where a pseudocyst has not been able to be excluded has been considered potentially proliferative and pre-malignant or malignant and thus aggressive surgical approach has been advocated. Retroperitoneal cystic tumors are rare and among these bronchogenic cysts are extremely infrequent. The present paper describes a case of bronchogenic cyst in association with the pancreas in which diagnostic work-up was not able to exclude a proliferative pancreatic cystic tumor.
