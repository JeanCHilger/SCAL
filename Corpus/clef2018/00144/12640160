Mesenteric neoplasms: CT appearances of primary and secondary tumors and differential diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) remains the optimal imaging modality for diagnosing tumors in the mesentery. Although primary neoplasms arising from the mesenchymal tissues of the mesentery are rare, the small bowel mesentery is a major avenue for the dissemination of tumor within the peritoneal cavity. Tumors spread to the mesentery by four major routes: (a) direct extension, commonly seen with carcinoid tumor of the small intestine as well as intraabdominal cancers such as pancreatic and colon cancer (b) lymphatic dissemination of lymphoma and some epithelial malignancies
