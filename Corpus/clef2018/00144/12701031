Clinical value of intraductal ultrasonography for clarification of confusing ERCP results. This study assesses the value of intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) when the findings of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) are unclear.IDUS was performed over a two-year period in cases of bile duct or pancreatic duct stenosis of unknown origin found during ERCP or if cholelithiasis was suspected but ERC was seemingly normal. Duct stenoses were classified,before and after IDUS, as benign or malignant ductal or malignant extraductal, the findings then being checked by clinical follow-up,histology or, if bile duct stones had been suspected, by instrumental bile duct exploration.Among 1303 ERCP investigations IDUS was attempted in 125 patients (9.6% average age 60+/-14 yearsWith minor expenditure of time and an acceptable failure rate, additional IDUS after ERCP increases the diagnostic accuracy in cases where ductal stenosis or bile duct stones have not been clearly demonstrated.
