Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas associated with obstructive jaundice. We herein report a case of pancreatic serous cystadenoma in a patient who presented with jaundice, and we provide a review of the literature. A 53-year-old man was admitted with complaints of jaundice and weight loss. With a preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic serous cystadenoma with obstructive jaundice, he underwent pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. A cystic tumor partially protruding into the bile duct was observed in the pancreatic head. Histology verified serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Histologically, no atypia was proven in the epithelium. There have been only eight case reports dealing with serous cystadenoma of the pancreas with obstructive jaundice. Although serous cystadenoma of the pancreas has essentially a benign nature, pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy is the treatment of choice when available to avoid the recurrence of obstructive jaundice.
