Laparoscopic treatment of pancreatic insulinoma. Laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) have been proposed for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic insulinoma. We present for cases of pancreatic insulinoma approached by laparoscopy guided by LUS. In three cases, insulinomas were in the pancreatic body and in one case in the pancreatic head. All lesions were detected preoperatively by abdominal US and confirmed by computed tomography. Laparoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. LUS was performed using a 10-mm flexible probe. In two cases the adenoma was enucleated using scissors and electrocoagulation, major vessels were controlled using clips, and enucleation was completed using a 30-mm endo-GIA. In one case a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation was performed. In one case the adenoma was deep in the pancreatic head minilaparotomy was performed and the adenoma enucleated. Patients were discharged in good health 5-7 days after surgery. The postoperative course was complicated in one case of enucleation by peripancreatic fluid collection that was treated percutaneously. Our experience confirms that accurate localization followed by excision of tumors via the laparoscopic approach constitute a significant advance in the management of insulinoma.
