Retroperitoneal Castleman's tumors of hyaline vascular type: imaging study. Case report. We report two retroperitoneal Castleman's tumors (giant lymph node hyperplasia) of hyaline vascular type. One was a large tumor situated in the pararenal region, the other was located in the pancreas head. On computed tomography (CT), both tumors were solid and moderately enhanced after administration of contrast material. On angiography, both tumors were hypervascular with dilated feeding arteries, and showed capillary blush. In an appropriate clinical setting, a retroperitoneal tumor showing these findings should include Castleman's tumor in the differential diagnosis.
