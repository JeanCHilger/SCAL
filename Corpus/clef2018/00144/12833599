Preoperative chemoradiation and pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection for localized advanced pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a common disease that is rarely cured. Surgical resection remains the only treatment modality that has a curative potential, although the majority of patients are unsuitable for resection at the time of diagnosis. Chemoradiation therapy prior to a pancreaticoduodenectomy ensures that a patient who undergoes a complete resection multimodality therapy, avoids a resection in patients who have a rapidly progressive disease, and allows radiation therapy to be given to well oxygenated cells before, surgical devasculation. This permits the chance of resection of an unresectable pancreatic cancer by downstaging. A patient with cytologic proof of localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head received an intravenously chemoradiation (Taxol, 50 mg/m2 intravenously for 3 hours week on 5 cycles, of Gemcytabine 1000 mg/m2/day intravenously for 3 days week on 2 cycles, of 4500 cGy) with the intention of proceeding to a resection operation, restaging was performed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging from 5 weeks every months due to ongoing decreasing of tumor size after the chemoradiation. At laparotomy, the patient didn't have suspected metastatic disease, the tumor size was 2 X 3 cm on the pancreas head and was infiltrating into the portal vein for about 3 cm length on right side. A pancreaticoduodenectomy along with a portal vein and superior mesenteric vein resection was done and then reconstruction of a vascular anastomosis by using the right side of the internal jugular vein. Perioperative complications didn't occur. In conclusion, preoperative chemoradiation of a localized advanced pancreatic tumor has no added risk to the operative complications and the prospects for resectability are enhanced.
