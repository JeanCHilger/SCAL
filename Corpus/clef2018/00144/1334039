Mucin-producing cystic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, a case report, 7-year follow-up period. Mucinous ductal ectasia is recognized as a premalignant disease. Recently, we have encountered a patient with a mucin-producing neoplasm of the pancreas, who had been under periodic observation for chronic pancreatitis for 7 years prior to diagnosis of carcinoma and surgery. A 54-year-old male who had been investigated with US, CT and ERCP for chronic pancreatitis developed a mucin-producing ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. In this case a series of US and ERCP images obtained during the 7-year period had demonstrated insidious growth of the tumor. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was carried out, and the histopathological diagnosis was mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The patient has been well and has suffered no recurrence for 2 years after surgery.
