The results and problems of surgical treatment of cancer of the duodenal papilla of Vater. Twenty six of 28 cases (92.9%) of cancer of duodenal papilla of Vater were resected from 1981 to 1990. Twenty five pancreatoduodenectomy and one total pancreatectomy were performed. Operative death and hospital death were not observed. Three year and five year cumulative survival rates of resected cases were 58% and 52% respectively. There was relatively good correlation between pathological cancer extension and postoperative prognosis. Postoperative prognosis of the cases which had cancer extension to the pancreas was extremely poor. But the prognosis of the cases of cancer within Oddi muscle was extremely good. Immunohistochemical staining using anti CEA, anti CA19-9 and anti DUPAN 2 was studied and Grade III staining pattern was observed only in the cases which had cancer invasion to the pancreas. Preoperative diagnosis of cancer extension using endoscopic ultrasonography and appropriate choice of the operative procedure are important. Extended operation and effective adjuvant therapy are necessary for advanced cases of cancer of the duodenal papilla.
