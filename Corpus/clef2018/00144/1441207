The role of x-ray computed tomography in the topical diagnosis of insulinomas of the pancreatic gland. Pancreatic insulinomas were intraoperatively revealed in 15 patients. X-ray computed tomography (CAT) revealed the tumor in only 6 (40 %) patients. The mean size of detectable insulinomas was 2.4 cm, that of undetectable ones 1.2 cm. X-ray CAT diagnosis is facilitated in case of a superficial localization of the tumor on the body or tail of the gland .
