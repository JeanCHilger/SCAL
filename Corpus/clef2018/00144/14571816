Cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas: anatomoclinical, diagnostic and therapeutic considerations regarding three personal observations and review of the literature. Cystic lymphangioma is a very rare pathology and the pancreatic ones represent an exceptional report that must be considered in the differential diagnosis with others and more frequent cystic lesions of the pancreas. In this paper we describe three cases of cystic lymphangiomas of the pancreas observed in our Institute and we report on the literature review. Anatomopathological, clinical and therapeutics aspects of pancreatic cystic lymphangioma were analyzed for a better knowledge of this cystic lesion and to recognize some specific findings that could allow a preoperative diagnosis and, subsequently, a proper treatment.
