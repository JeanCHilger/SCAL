A pancreatic-induced intramural duodenal hematoma: a case report and literature review. Spontaneous intramural duodenal hematomas are not frequent and generally are related with an anticoagulant treatment. Pancreatic origin has seldom been described and the treatment is always controversial. We report a new case of a pancreatitis-induced intramural duodenal hematoma that was conservatively managed and we review the literature.
