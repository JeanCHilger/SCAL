Solitary true cyst of the pancreas in an adult. A 35-yr-old woman was presented to the hospital because of nausea 20-30 min after eating, associated with weight loss. A CT scan revealed a cystic lesion in the neck of the pancreas. At operation, a 3-cm diameter cyst was excised from the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) was used intraoperatively to identify the transected pancreatic duct, after which a Roux-Y pancreaticojejunostomy was performed. Histologically, the cyst proved to be unilocular and was lined with cuboidal epithelium. The natural history of this lesion is unknown as only four previous case reports of unilocular true cysts in adults have been reported in the English literature. These are reviewed.
