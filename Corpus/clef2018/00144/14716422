Endoscopic and endosonographic management of pancreatic pseudocyst: a long-term follow-up. The cause of pancreatic cyst were in 72 % due to alcoholism. A drainage to pancreatic cyst is very critical for patient with the stomach varices patient. The endoscopic ultrasonography(EUS) is a valuable supplement to the diagnostic procedure to localise the optimal spot for puncture and to avoid haemorrhage due to damage of intra or extra-mural blood vessels.The drainage was reached by transpapillary endoscopic retrograde pancreatic drainage (ERPD), endoscopic cystogastrostomy (ECG) or endoscopic cystoduodenostomy (ECD). The case that varices is doubted and If the identification of the cyst is difficult the transmural drainage should be carried out under endosonographic control.Between 1987 and 2002, 47 patients had been treated for panceatic pseudocysts by transmural or transductal drainage EUS-guided drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst or pancreatc abscess was carried out in 5 cases. In 42patients pancreatic pseudocysts disappeared completely. Six patients suffered a relapse 7 to 38 months after removal of the drainage. No more recurrences were observed in 22 patients within followed up 5-11 years. In another 6 patients the prostheses were renewed because of occlusion or dislocation. Overall 6 patients had to undergo surgery, 3 patients due to relapsing cyst, 2 patients because of insufficient drainage and one patient because of severe bleeding. There was no case of death related to the endoscopic treatment.The EUS is a valuable supplementation to the diagnostic procedure to localize the optimal spot for puncture and to avoid haemorrhage because of damage of intra or extramural bloodvessels. Advantages of the endoscopic drainage are minimal invasiveness, short period of hospitalization and low costs. These aspects make the endoscopic therapy the first choice of treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.
