Tumors of the gallbladder, bile ducts, and ampulla. Neoplasms arising in the gallbladder, bile ducts, and ampulla of Vater pose a significant clinical challenge. Although benign neoplasms may be encountered, the majority of these tumors are malignant. There are a number of similarities among tumors at these sites including their clinical presentation which may include biliary obstruction. Furthermore, these tumors are often asymptomatic early in their course and frequently present at an advanced stage of disease, precluding potentially curative resection. This article focuses on the diagnosis, staging, and operative management of gallbladder, bile duct, and ampullary tumors, with a specific focus on malignant disease.
