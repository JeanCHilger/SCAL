Common hepatic artery aneurysm branching from the superior mesenteric artery. Report of a case. A 58-year-old man was notified as having a mass in the head of the pancreas at medical checkup on September 26, 2000. He was admitted to our department after being diagnosed as having an aneurysm in the common hepatic artery, branching from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), based on selective SMA angiography. From an abdominal midline incision, we were able to reach his common hepatic artery aneurysm (CHAA) by mobilizing the pancreas through the route lateral to the greater curvature of the stomach. This aneurysm arose in the common hepatic artery immediately after branching from the SMA. After proximal and distal control of the SMA and common hepatic artery, the aneurysm was incised and the distal hepatic artery was anastomosed end to side to the SMA. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course.
