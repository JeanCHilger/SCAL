Multi-detector row CT imaging of blunt abdominal trauma. CT is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate hemodynamically stable patients suffering blunt abdominal trauma. During the past five years, single-slice helical CT has been replaced by multidetector row CT (MDCT). This development has revolutionized cross-sectional imaging for blunt trauma patients. Volumetric imaging with helical CT has been a major factor supporting the nonoperative management of solid organ injury. Trauma centers in the United States are replacing single-slice helical CT scanners with state-of-the-art MDCT in suites proximate to the patient receiving area and with facilities for monitoring and maintaining physiologic support. The ability to obtain high-resolution images with MDCT during optimal contrast enhancement at unparalleled speed helps detect the presence and define the extent of injuries, and crucially, to diagnose hemorrhage and vascular injuries. This article describes our current imaging protocol with MDCT-16 (i.e., 16 detector MDCT), the spectrum of diagnostic findings seen in blunt abdominal injury, and the role of MDCT in the characterization of hemorrhage and planning injury management.
