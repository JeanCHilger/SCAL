Coexistence of annular pancreas with carcinoma in the dorsal part of pancreas divisum: diagnostic value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. We report on the incidental observation of a pancreas divisum coexistent with an annular pancreas in a 88-year-old woman presenting with jaundice due to a pancreatic carcinoma. This case report discusses the embryologic hypotheses underlying this peculiar association, highlights the capacities of imaging techniques to depict them, and enhances the performance of magnetic resonance imaging.
