An initial experience: using helical CT imaging to detect obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common but frustrating disease for clinicians because of its elusive nature despite extensive work-up. We evaluate the role of helical computed tomography (CT) imaging using rapid infusion of intravenous contrast and water as oral contrast in the work-up of patients who are actively bleeding. Helical CT may be a useful noninvasive, alternative study to consider when routine work-up fails to determine the cause of active GI bleeding. Our preliminary study shows that helical CT was able to identify a wide variety of causes of obscure GI bleeding.
