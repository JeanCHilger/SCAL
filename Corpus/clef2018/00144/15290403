Emergency pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy followed by second-stage pancreatojejunostomy for a gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the duodenum with an intratumoral gas figure: report of a case. We report a case of a duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) necessitating urgent surgery because of a gas figure on computed tomography (CT). A 46-year-old woman, complaining chiefly of upper abdominal pain and tarry stools, consulted a local doctor. A gastrointestinal fiberscopy revealed an ulcer in the second part of the duodenum, and the patient was admitted to our hospital where a dynamic CT scan showed a hypervascular solid tumor in the pancreatic head. A repeat CT scan done 4 days later showed a gas figure in the tumor, necessitating an emergency pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PpPD). First, we performed a tube pancreatostomy for complete external drainage of the pancreatic juice, and planned a second-stage pancreatojejunostomy for the near future. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a GIST originating in the duodenum. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 23 after an uneventful postoperative recovery. Her local doctor completed the second-stage pancreatojejunostomy.
