The "duct-ectatic" variant of mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas: clinical and radiologic studies of seven cases. Seven cases of the "duct-ectatic" variant of mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas are presented. This new entity, the duct-ectatic variant of mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, probably masquerades as pancreatic pseudocyst clinically and radiologically. However, it has the characteristic pathologic findings of the classic "megacystic" type of mucinous cystic neoplasm. If there are cysts visualized on pancreaticogram which are in a diffusely duct-ectatic configuration and are in communication with the main pancreatic duct, the duct-ectatic variant of mucinous cystic neoplasm should be strongly suspected rather than the pancreatic pseudocyst.
