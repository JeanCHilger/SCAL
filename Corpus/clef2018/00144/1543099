Jaundice. Jaundice is a disorder of bilirubin metabolism and has many causes. History and physical examination help establish the diagnosis in 70 to 80 percent of patients. Elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase suggests cholestasis, either intrahepatic (e.g., medication reactions) or extrahepatic (e.g., choledocholithiasis), whereas markedly elevated serum aminotransferases are indicative of hepatocellular damage from infection, toxins or ischemia. Ultrasound examination is a useful initial procedure when extrahepatic obstruction is suspected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography may be better used to diagnose obstruction at the level of the pancreas or distal common bile duct. The treatment is based on the etiology of jaundice and includes removal of offending medications or toxins, therapy for underlying liver disease or surgery for extrahepatic obstruction.
