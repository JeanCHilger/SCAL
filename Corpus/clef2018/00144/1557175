An autopsy case of cerebral embolism caused by atrial myxoma. We reported an autopsy case of a 14-year-old girl with cardiac myxoma, presenting sudden onset of consciousness disturbance and right hemiplegia while running in an 800 meter race. Though CT scan showed no abnormal findings, cerebral angiogram revealed an embolic stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery, and abdominal aortogram showed complete obstruction of the bilateral common iliac artery. Histological study of emboli taken from obstructed femoral arteries showed systemic embolization of the cardiac myxoma. She died three days after admission. Autopsy was performed. Myxoma tissue was not found, but its stalk was left in the left atrial septum. The brain was very edematous, and a myxoma emboli was found in the left middle cerebral artery. Systemic embolization of myxoma to spleen, kidneys, liver, pancreas, etc. was found histologically. Left atrial myxoma is a rare but potentially treatable cause of stroke, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of cerebral vascular disease, especially in young patients.
