Hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas. Extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma differentiation has been demonstrated in primary malignancies of the stomach. To date, only five cases of hepatocellular differentiation of the pancreas have been reported in the literature. An example of hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas is reported in this study. A single case of hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas is presented with long-term follow-up and review of the literature. This rare malignancy of the pancreas represents a hepatocytic transdifferentiation of pancreatic cells to form a combination of both primary ductal adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular differentiation.
