The use of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for investigation of submucosal and extrinsic masses of the colon and rectum. Ensdoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been reported as a useful technique for histological diagnosis of submucosal or extrinsic gastrointestinal and pancreatic lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of lesions either within or adjacent to the wall of the colon and rectum.A total of 22 patients with a lesion within the wall of, or adjacent to, the colon or rectum underwent EUS-FNA. They were divided into two groups: patients who had previously had a malignancy (the "previous +ve" group, n = 11), and patients who had not previously had a malignancy (the "previous -ve" group, n = 11). In the four patients who had lesions located proximal to the sigmoid colon, EUS-FNA was performed using a guide wire and overtube. The success rates for adequate tissue sampling and for detecting malignant and benign masses by EUS-FNA were evaluated and the success rate for detection was compared with the success rate of EUS and computed tomography.Sufficient tissue for evaluation was obtained from 21 of the 22 patients (95.5 %). The overall rate of detection of malignant and benign masses was 95.5 % (21/22) for EUS-FNA and 81.8 % (18/22) for pre-EUS-FNA imaging investigations. Of the 11 patients in the previous +ve group, ten were diagnosed with recurrences of primary malignancies of the 11 patients in the previous -ve group, four were diagnosed with primary malignancies and seven were diagnosed with benign lesions. There were no complications related to the EUS-FNA procedure.EUS-FNA is a safe technique which is useful in the planning of treatment for patients who have a mass within the wall or adjacent to the wall of the entire length of the colon or rectum.
