Clear cell carcinoma of exocrine pancreas: a rare tumor with an unusual presentation. Metastatic clear cell carcinomas are relatively common from primary tumors arising in the kidney, female genital tract, adrenal cortex, and lung, but they rarely occur from primary tumors of the pancreas. We report a case of metastatic pancreatic tumor with marked clear cell changes in a 46-year-old white man presenting with a pseudocyst of the pancreas. At laparotomy, there was a hard area in the head of the pancreas and another hard nodule was present in the omentum. The histologic and immunohistochemical test of the excised omental nodule exhibited features consistent with clear cell carcinoma from pancreatic primary. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a metastatic clear cell pancreatic tumor with such an unusual presentation.
