Excision of a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum causing biliary obstruction: report of three cases. We report three cases of biliary obstruction caused by a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum that were treated by excision of the diverticulum. A 72-year-old man, a 77-year-old woman, and an 81-year-old woman each presented with recurrent obstructive jaundice. Diagnostic imaging revealed a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum compressing the common bile duct (CBD). Following cholecystectomy, the diverticulum between the intrapancreatic CBD and pancreatic parenchyma was isolated and excised successfully in each case. The patients have been followed up for 34, 31, and 22 months, respectively. In one patient, choledocholithiasis developed 33 months after the surgery, necessitating endoscopic sphincterotomy. Duodenal diverticulectomy is a useful procedure to relieve biliary obstruction caused by a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. However, it remains unclear whether excision of the diverticulum is preferred to biliodigestive anastomosis from the point of view of long-term prognosis. Subsequent surveillance is necessary.
