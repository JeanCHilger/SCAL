Duodenal somatostatinoma: clinical and immunohistochemical patterns--difficult differential diagnosis in regard to gangliocytic paraganglioma: report of a case. The authors report a large duodenal somatostatinoma, a very rare tumor entity. A 8.5 cm globular mass in the area of the unicate process of the pancreas was detected in a 45 year old caucasian female by computerized tomography. The patient had only mild complaints. Initial treatment consisted of right pancreatectomy with preservation of the pylorus. Histological evaluation rendered a diagnosis of low-grade malignant neuroendocrine carcinoma with expression of somatostatin, respectively of somatostatinoma arising in the duodenum and infiltrating into the pancreas. 26 months after the initial surgery liver and lymph node metastases were detected and surgically removed. This case confirms that duodenal somatostatinomas are very difficult to diagnose preoperatively because of unspecific symptoms. Most duodenal somatostatinomas are found incidentally. Treatment of choice is radical surgical resection with a possible cure in early stages of the disease. Even a large tumor as ours is resectable with negative surgical margins. Management of recurrent or metastatic disease is also surgical. Additional chemotherapy and supportive care may be beneficial for the patient.
