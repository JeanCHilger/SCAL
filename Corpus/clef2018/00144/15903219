Computer tomography from the point of view of standards in diagnosis and treatment of an acute pancreatitis. Results of pancreatic computer tomography (CT) were studied in 162 patients, suffering an acute pancreatitis (AP). There were conducted 293 investigations in total. Basing on the obtained results analysis there were established the optimal terms of the CT conduction, the indications were-substantiated for performance of the investigation in dynamics in patients, who were or were not operated on. After the first AP attack the CT performance was indicated on the 7-10th day, after reattack--on 2-3d day of the disease. There was substantiated the necessity to conduct CT at the end of the disease first month and in the absence of pathological changes in pancreas--reinvestigation at the end of the 6th month. In revealing pathological changes of the pancreatic gland structure, it is expedient to perform dynamical observation using ultrasonographic investigation. The standard protocol for monitoring of the pancreatic gland state was elaborated, taking into account the CT role and significance.
