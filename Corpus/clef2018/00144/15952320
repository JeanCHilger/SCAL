Metastatic somatostatinoma of the chest wall. A 72-year-old male was diagnosed as having a thoracic tumor in the left chest wall five years after resection of primary pancreatic somatostatinoma. The tumor was suggestive of metastasis to the chest wall or to the left lung from the previously resected somatostatinoma based on the abnormally elevated serum somatostatin level. Percutaneous biopsy confirmed that the lesion was an islet cell tumor and thoracotomy demonstrated metastasis to the left third rib without involvement of the left lung. Our case represents a rare documentation of somatostatinoma metastatic to the chest wall for which complete resection was performed.
