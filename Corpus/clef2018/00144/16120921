Suspected pancreatic cancer: evaluation by dynamic gadolinium-enhanced 3D gradient-echo MRI. The objective of our study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of gadolinium-enhanced 3D gradient-echo (GRE) MR images in the detection of pancreatic cancer.Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced 3D GRE images are both sensitive and specific in the detection of pancreatic cancer. Our study shows that the identification of pancreatic cancer using these images can be performed with a high degree of confidence and accuracy, making them very useful in the detection of pancreatic cancer.
