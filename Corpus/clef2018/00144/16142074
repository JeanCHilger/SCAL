Imaging of the pediatric pancreas: state of the art. The use of high frequency (7-12 MHz) transducers on state of the art US units equipped with Doppler imaging provides excellent evaluation of the pediatric pancreas that compares to other cross-sectional imaging techniques. The availability of multidetector CT imaging reduces the need for sedation but requires additional review of the indications and protocols to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. Evaluation of pancreatitis and tumors remains the main indication. Advances in MR imaging and MRCP has lead to very good results in children. Storage diseases of the pancreas can be diagnosed at MRI. The length of the examinations, the need for sedation and the limited spatial resolution remain the main pitfalls of MR imaging of the pancreas in pediatric patients.
