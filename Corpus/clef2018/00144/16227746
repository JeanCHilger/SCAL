A Case of advanced gastric cancer successfully treated with TS-1/low-dose CDDP as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. TS-1 was introduced into the treatment of advanced or recurrent gastric cancer cases. Along with independent administration of TS-1, a high antitumor effect has been reported in combination with various anticancer agents. We report a patient with gastric cancer successfully treated with TS-1 and low-dose CDDP as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patient was a 46-year-old man who was diagnosed as type 3 gastric cancer with suspected invasion of the pancreas. Histopathological findings demonstrated the degeneration of cancer cells and fibrosis in the primary tumor. The changes against neoadjuvant chemotherapy were judged to be Grade 3. The treatment was completed without adverse events. TS-1 and low-dose CDDP therapy can be one of the effective methods as neoadjuvant chemotherapy without remarkable toxicity.
