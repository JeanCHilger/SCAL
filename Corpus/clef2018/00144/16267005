High correlation of whole-body red fluorescent protein imaging and magnetic resonance imaging on an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. We have developed genetically fluorescent orthotopic models of human pancreatic cancer. In these models, noninvasive fluorescent protein imaging (FPI) of internal primary tumors and metastatic deposits has been carried out. Whole-body tumor images are easily and inexpensively obtained using FPI, permitting both detection and quantification of tumor load. In this study, we simultaneously compared single mice with a highly fluorescent, red fluorescent protein-expressing orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenografts with both FPI and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Images were acquired at multiple time points after tumor implantation in the pancreas. Indwelling pancreatic primary tumors and metastatic foci were detected by both FPI and MRI. Moreover, a strong correlation existed between images taken with these two technologies. FPI permitted rapid, high-throughput imaging without the need for either anesthesia or contrast agents. Both FPI and MRI enabled accurate imaging of tumor growth and metastasis, although MRI enabled tissue structure to be visualized as well. FPI has high resolution and is exceedingly rapid with instant image capture. We suggest a complimentary role for these two imaging modalities.
