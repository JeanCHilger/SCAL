Correlation between findings of echosonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examination in chronic pancreatitis patients. Chronic pancreatitis is defined as an amount of chronic inflammatory lesions that lead to the destruction of pancreatic tissue and fibrosis development, whereas the later stages of the illness are characterized by the destruction of the endocrine portion of the organ. Although the results of different studies are abundant, chronic pancreatitis still remains enigmatic, both in its diagnostic and therapeutic aspect. To test the correlation between the findings of echosonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examination in chronic pancreatitis patients. The observed degree of correlation may serve for the validation of echosonography as a diagnostic tool in chronic pancreatitis patients.We collected and analyzed data on morphological features in chronic pancreatitis patients revealed by echosonography as well as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.35 patients 34-73 years of age were included in this study. In 60% (21 subject) history was subjective for alcohol abuse. Significant correaltion has been found between alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis (chi2 = 6.896 p < 0.05). Correaltion between groups of chronic pancreatitis patients diagnosed by echosonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was highly significant (p = 0.799Echosonography was proved to be a suitable first choice imaging method for the examination of patients when chronic pancreatitis was suspected. Echosonography might provide conclusive information on the morphology of pancreatic canalicular system, as well as on the state of pancreatic parenchyma.
