The role of endoscopic ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although spiral CT is the best noninvasive method for detecting pancreatic cancer, the sensitivity for small masses remains low. It is this group of patients with small masses who may most benefit from surgical resection. Endoscopic ultrasound employs the use of flexible endoscopic devices to perform diagnostic ultrasound imaging and is a more accurate means of detecting pancreatic tumors. The ability to perform cytological aspiration of pancreatic masses via EUS is also a major step in the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This review article will summarize the role of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer as well as looking at its impact on the management of these malignancies. Additionally, we will discuss the utility of screening high-risk patients for pancreatic cancer using the tools that are currently available.
