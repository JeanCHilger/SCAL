Report of three cases of chronic pancreatic fistulas treated with prolamine as a sclerosing substance following pancreatic resection. Pancreatic fistulas are one of the most common and important complications after pancreatic resection and their consequences are a life-threatening event. Thus, they must be treated in the best way and resolved as soon as possible to avoid their morbidity.Three cases of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic resection were reported. They were treated with percutaneous embolization using a sclerosing substance, prolamine, injected into the Wirsung duct via drainage catheter.No complications of the technique were revealed and closure of the pancreatic fistula was obtained shortly thereafter.The technique is safe and simple and can be repeated several times. It allows good results without complications. Finally, it avoids additional surgery allowing a shorter recovery time and a lower risk of morbidity.
