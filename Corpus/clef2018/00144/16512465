Isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas diagnosed with needle aspiration: a case report and review of the literature. Pancreatic tuberculosis is very rare, especially in immunocompetent patients, and represents a diagnostic challenge. The clinical features in patients with pancreatic tuberculosis are usually non-specific. The radiological features mimic pancreatic malignancy or pancreatitis. We describe a case of pancreatic tuberculosis mimicking carcinoma on Computed tomography scan. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed caseating granulomatous inflammation. The diagnosis of pancreatic tuberculosis was made and the patient was put on anti-tubercular therapy. Five months later, a repeat CT scan of the abdomen revealed resolution of the pancreatic lesion. We emphasize that tuberculosis should now be included in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass. Diagnostic indicators include the association of a pancreatic mass with fever, the presence of abdominal pain and a cystic pancreatic mass in a younger patient coming from a region where tuberculosis is endemic.
