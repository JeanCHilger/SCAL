Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts in children. Mediastinal pseudocyst is an unusual complication of pancreatitis, with only four cases previously reported in children. The extent of the pseudocyst can be defined by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan and preoperative aspiration of cyst fluid for amylase level can establish the diagnosis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to define ductal anatomy can help plan the appropriate drainage procedure. Although exceedingly rare, the diagnosis of pseudocyst should be considered for any cystic mass in the abdomen or thorax, even in the absence of elevated amylase or history suggesting pancreatitis.
