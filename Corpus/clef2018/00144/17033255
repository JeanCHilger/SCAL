Endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: diagnostic strategies, predictive features of malignancy and long-term survival. Diagnostic strategies, malignancy predictors and long-term survival were retrospectively evaluated in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (64 insulinomas). Lower median glycemia was 30 (range 20-53) mg/dl [1.6 (1.1-2.9) mmol/l] with concurrent insulin of 48 (13.2-217) microU/ml and 15 (2-46) microU/ml measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunofluorimetric assay (IFMA), respectively. All patients with insulinomas had a positive prolonged fast within 48 h. Sensitivity of localization methods was: ultrasonography (US) 23%, computed tomography (CT) 28%, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 65%, endoscopic US 75%, arteriography 38%, portal venous sampling 67%, selective arterial calcium stimulation 67%, intraoperative US 94% and palpation 92%. Nine patients (14%) had malignant insulinomas. Age at diagnosis (mean+/-SD, 53.8+/-19 vs 39.4+/-16.3 yr p=0.03), insulin (1372+/-730 vs 785+/-659% (percentage of the method's diagnostic cut-off
