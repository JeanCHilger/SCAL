CT differentiation of distal pancreas fat replacement and distal pancreas agenesis. We aimed to describe CT signs useful for differentiation of distal agenesis from distal or dorsal pancreas lipomatosis. Multidetector CT (MDCT) studies of five patients with distal pancreas agenesis (n = 2), distal lipomatosis (n = 1), distal short pancreas (n = 1), and distal pancreatectomy (n = 1) were retrospectively reviewed. Agenesis of dorsal pancreas can be diagnosed by the absence of body and tail of pancreas. In the absence of distal pancreas, distal pancreatic bed can be filled by stomach or intestine (dependent stomach or dependent intestine signs), which abut splenic vein. Same findings can be seen in patients with distal pancreatectomy, however, splenic vein is absent in these patients. In case of distal lipomatosis abundant fat tissue is observed anterior to splenic vein. Dependent stomach and/or dependent intestine signs on MDCT imaging can allow differentiation of distal pancreas agenesis from distal lipomatosis obviating further diagnostic studies.
