Periportal lymphadenopathy in patients without identifiable pancreatobiliary or hepatic malignancy. Enlarged periportal lymph nodes often are noticed during imaging of the upper abdomen. Malignant infiltration and enlargement of periportal nodes occur in patients with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, and pancreas and lymphoma. However, there are no published data on the significance and differential diagnosis of enlarged periportal lymph nodes in patients without the above mentioned cancers.We searched our database for patients who (1) underwent endoscopic ultrasound for evaluation of enlarged periportal nodes or (2) were found to have enlarged periportal lymph nodes (> or =10 mm) during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examination. Patients with identifiable pancreatic, biliary, gallbladder, or liver cancers were excluded. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of one or more nodes was performed.Sixty-four patients with periportal lymph nodes 10-40 mm in size met the inclusion criteria. In 24 patients, enlarged periportal nodes were noted in the computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fifty-one patients had multiple enlarged periportal nodes. Concomitantly, enlargement was seen in peripancreatic nodes (n = 14), celiac nodes (n = 14), and mediastinal nodes (n = 11). Twelve of the 64 patients (18.8% 95% confidence interval, 9.2%-28.4%) had a malignant cause of enlarged periportal lymph nodes: 5 with metastatic carcinoma and 7 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Significant cytologic findings in benign nodes included granulomas (n = 4) and lipogranulomatosis (n = 8).A significant number of patients with enlarged periportal lymph nodes without identifiable pancreatobiliary and liver cancer harbor malignancy and other identifiable pathologic processes. We recommend that these nodes be sampled with fine-needle aspiration at the time of EUS examination.
