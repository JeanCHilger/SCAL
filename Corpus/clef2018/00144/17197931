Hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas: a case report and literature review of a heterogeneous group of tumors. Hepatoid carcinomas are tumors that display, at least focally, cytologic and/or architectural features of hepatocellular carcinoma. They have been described in several organs, most notably in the stomach and ovary. We report a case of hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas that developed in a 41-year-old woman in association with a pancreatic endocrine carcinoma. The fine needle aspiration material was characterized by the presence of monotonous, small-to-medium sized tumor cells with round nuclei and finely granular chromatin, intermixed with more atypical tumor cells displaying larger nuclei with coarse clumped chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of foamy cytoplasm. The excised specimen displayed a poorly differentiated pancreatic endocrine carcinoma associated with well-defined islands of larger tumor cells growing in a perisinusoidal pattern which, based on their immunohistochemical profile and the demonstration of bile, proved to represent a hepatoid component. This case and prior examples in the literature suggest that hepatoid carcinomas of the pancreas appear to be a heterogeneous group of tumors (pure or associated with another histologic component) that are often associated with early liver metastasis and a short survival, although those arising as a component of endocrine tumors seem to fare slightly better. Hepatoid carcinoma of the pancreas should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors composed of large eosinophilic cells.
