Fatigue, loss of appetite and anuria due to retroperitoneal fibrosis. Two men aged 58 and 76, respectively, presented with fatigue and loss of appetite followed by anuria. Laboratory tests showed anaemia, elevated ESR and renal failure. CT of the abdomen revealed obstruction of the ureters by retroperitoneal fibrosis. The first patient had retroperitoneal fibrosis in combination with an aneurysm of the aorta in the second patient, the image was suggestive of pancreatic carcinoma with secondary fibrosis, but eventually the retroperitoneal fibrosis proved to be idiopathic. Both patients were successfully treated with prednisone and temporary placement ofnephrostomy catheters. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is an often idiopathic disease that can cause compression of retroperitoneal structures such as the ureters. The clinical picture is aspecific so that the diagnosis is often delayed. Treatment with prednisone is preferable, followed by immunosuppressive therapy or tamoxifen in case of resistance to steroids. Relief of the obstruction by means of temporary nephrostomy catheters often makes surgery unnecessary. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is an uncommon disease that deserves more attention in view ofthe favourable therapeutic options following timely diagnosis.
