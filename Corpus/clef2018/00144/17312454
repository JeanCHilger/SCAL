Clinical impact of multidetector row computed tomography on patients with pancreatic cancer. This study was designed to compare multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and CT-assisted hepatic arteriography (CTHA)/CT during arterial portography (CTAP)/angiography/contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) findings prospectively for accuracy in the detection of liver metastasis and vascular involvement of the tumor.The study included 43 patients with pancreatic cancer who were evaluated from September 2002 to December 2003. These patients underwent preoperative evaluation by angiography/CTHA/CTAP/CECT (7-mm thickness) and by MDCT (1.25-mm thickness).The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of liver metastasis diagnosis were all superior using MDCT relative to CTHA/CTAP. The diagnostic accuracy of liver metastasis for patients with tumors less than 10 mm in diameter was particularly superior with MDCT relative to CTHA/CTAP. The surgical and pathological findings of vascular involvement were more accurately diagnosed by MDCT than by CTHA/CTAP/angiography/CECT. Although MDCT findings were generally similar to surgical findings of vascular involvement, MDCT overestimated the incidence of pathological vascular involvement.Multidetector row CT imaging can potentially offer more accurate staging of pancreatic cancer and may be useful to surgeons both in preoperative planning and for intraoperative guidance.
