Results of a prospective strategy to diagnose, localize, and resect insulinomas. Since 1982, 25 consecutive patients with benign sporadic (non-multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) insulinomas have been studied. Most were referred because either the tumor was not identified at the referring institution or the diagnosis was unclear. Each patient suffered severe neuroglycopenic symptoms for a median of 24 months before diagnosis of insulinoma, and 32% had hypoglycemic seizures. Eighteen patients (72%) had a confirmed weight gain. Each patient underwent a supervised fast until 72 hours or the onset of significant neuroglycopenic symptoms (median duration 16 hours), with serum levels of glucose (median 35 mg/dl range 24 to 46 mg/dl), insulin (median 21 microU/ml
