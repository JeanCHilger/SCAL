Pancreas. Congenital changes, acute and chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas develops from ventral and dorsal buds, which undergo fusion. Failure to fuse results in pancreas divisum, which is defined by separate pancreatic ductal systems draining into the duodenum. Risk of developing pancreatitis is increased in pancreas divisum. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is the technique of choice for detecting it non-invasively. Annular pancreas is the result of incomplete rotation of the pancreatic bud around the duodenum with the persistence of parenchyma or a fibrous band encircling (stenosing) the duodenum. Acute pancreatitis is usually caused by bile duct stones or alcohol abuse. Contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT is the method of choice to assess the extent of this disease. In acute pancreatitis, the role of MRCP is mainly limited to finding bile duct stones in patients with suspected biliary pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis results in relentless and irreversible loss of exocrine (and sometimes endocrine) function of the pancreas. MDCT even shows subtle calcifications. MRCP is the method of choice for non-invasive assessment of the duct. Inflammatory pseudotumor in chronic pancreatitis and groove pancreatitis are difficult to differentiate from pancreatic cancer. In these cases, multiple imaging methods such as MDCT, MRI and endosonography including biopsy may be used to make a diagnosis.
