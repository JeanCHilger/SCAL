Acute cholangitis revealing a primary pancreatic hydatid cyst in a child. Pancreatic hydatid cysts represent 0.1 to 1% of all hydatidoses. A 12 year-old-boy, with a previous history of abdominal pain, was admitted for acute cholangitis. Laboratory investigations showed cholestasis, cytolysis and eosinophilia. Serum amylase levels were normal. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan revealed a 100 mm hydatid cyst, located in the head of the pancreas. The biliary and pancreatic ducts were markedly dilated. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis. A pancreatic fistula was discovered. Subtotal excision of the cyst and external drainage of the pancreatic fistula were performed. Laboratory tests were normal post-operatively. The pancreatic fistulae persisted for two months. Hypercaloric and hyperprotidic feeding resulted in occlusion in three weeks. The rest of the postoperative course was uneventful and the size of the biliary and pancreatic ducts was normal. The authors discuss the diagnostic features of pancreatic hydatid cyst and discuss therapeutic modalities.
