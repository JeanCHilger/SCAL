A resected case of effective treatment with gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer with peritoneal metastasis. We report a resected case of advanced pancreatic cancer after successful chemotherapy. A 69-year-old man with abdominal pain was diagnosed as locally advanced pancreatic tail cancer with peritoneal metastasis based on computed tomography (CT). Preoperative serum CA 19-9 was 5,046 U/mL. In the outpatient setting, gemcitabine (GEM) at a dose of 1,000 mg/m(2)was administered once a week for 3 weeks with a 1-week rest as 1 cycle. Abdominal CT scan after 5 cycles of chemotherapy revealed that ascites disappeared and the tumor dramatically shrank. Serum CA 19-9 also dropped to 12 U/mL. Thus, we considered the patient had a partial response, and performed distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with D 3 lymph node dissection. Peritoneal seeding was not found and peritoneal washing cytology was negative. Histological examination of the primary lesion revealed a small amount of residual cancer cells. However, he died of peritoneal metastasis only 3 months after the operation. Surgical resection following chemotherapy should be performed carefully after close evaluation of the antitumor efficacy including residual isolated tumor cell for patients with previously distant metastases.
