Recurrent flares of pancreatitis predict development of exocrine insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis. The natural history of specific morphologic stages of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is not well defined. The aim of this study was to determine if worsening morphologic stages of CP are associated with poorer clinical outcomes.A retrospective analysis of 159 subjects with CP was performed. The baseline stage of CP was categorized according to the Cambridge classification. Pain was categorized as type A (intermittent acute), B (continuous), or combined. Exocrine failure was defined by steatorrhea endocrine failure was characterized as diabetes mellitus. Complications were defined clinically.Pancreatic duct (PD) morphology was equivocal in 37.1%, minimal in 12.6%, moderate in 7.5%, and severe in 42.8% of the patients. Over a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, the risk of developing exocrine insufficiency and diabetes was 28% and 19%, respectively. Recurrent acute flares of pancreatitis predicted the development of exocrine insufficiency (P = .004). Severe PD morphology predicted the likelihood of having persistent pain (P = .008). Patients with concurrent type A and B pain and older age at diagnosis had a greater likelihood of having persistent pain (P = .021). The risk of developing bile duct stricture was higher in the advanced morphologic stages of CP (P = .005).Recurrent flares of pancreatitis predispose to the development of exocrine insufficiency in CP. Patients with complex-type pain, older age at diagnosis, and advanced morphologic stage are more likely to have persistent pain. PD morphology does not correlate with the risk of developing exocrine failure and/or diabetes. Pain does not necessarily decrease or disappear with the onset of exocrine insufficiency and diabetes.
