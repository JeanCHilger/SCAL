Congenital choledocal cyst of adult: report of two cases. Congenital choledochal cyst is a congenital dilatation of the biliary tract often associated with a long common bilio-pancreatic duct without obstruction.We report the case of two women who presented a congenital choledochal cyst.For the first patient, the diagnosis was effected during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for a gall bladder lithiasis. The second one presented repeted access of angiocholitis. Echography and abdominal tomodensitometry found the congenital choledochal cyst. Percutaneous opacification of the cyst found a long common biliopancreatic duct in the second patient. A complete resection of the cyst with a cholangiojejunal anastomosis was performed for both patients. The treatment was successfull for the first one and the second one was deceased three days after the operation.This case report underlines the clinical polymorphysm, the morphologic anomaly and the treatment of congenital choledochal cyst which require total resection.
