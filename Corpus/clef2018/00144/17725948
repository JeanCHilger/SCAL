Small-caliber endobronchial ultrasonic videoscope: successful transesophageal and transgastric FNA after failed passage of a standard ultrasonic endoscope. EUS-guided tissue acquisition is a valuable technique. Obstructing lesions of the oropharynx or esophagus may preclude passage of a standard echoendoscope. In the past this has prevented EUS-guided tissue sampling. The recently introduced small-caliber ultrasonic bronchovideoscope (developed for endobronchial ultrasound) may allow EUS-guided FNA in this setting.Our purpose was to assess the possible use of the ultrasonic bronchovideoscope to perform upper GI EUS in patients where passage of standard EUS scope was unsuccessful.A descriptive case series.A tertiary referral center.Two patients were evaluated after failure of passage of a standard echoendoscope (1 with congenital narrowing of the esophageal inlet, 1 with postoperative deformity). In both cases, sonographic visualization of the lesion of concern was achieved and FNA was performed successfully.The ultrasonic bronchovideoscope may be a valuable tool to perform FNA of mediastinal and GI lesions in situations when a standard ultrasonic endoscope cannot be passed because of luminal narrowing.
