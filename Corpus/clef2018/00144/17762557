Endoscopic evaluation and palliation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: current and future options. To analyze the role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. New developments, including molecular analysis of endoscopic tissue samples and injection of antitumor agents, are discussed.Endoscopic ultrasound is superior to multidetector computed tomography for detection of smaller than 3-cm pancreatic tumors, and for T staging, while they are equivalent for nodal staging and assessment of resectability. Molecular analysis of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration samples has the potential to improve cancer detection. Placement of biliary self-expanding metal stents prior to Whipple resection appears to be an option to reduce stent obstruction and allow neo-adjuvant therapy. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage is a new approach to patients who failed to have a biliary stent placed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound may be useful to differentiate focal inflammation from pancreatic carcinoma. Optical coherence tomography was shown to distinguish nonneoplastic from neoplastic main pancreatic duct tissue. Finally, endoscopic ultrasound-guided interstitial brachytherapy and injection of therapeutic agents into tumors have shown exciting preliminary results.Endoscopic approaches for diagnosis and palliation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are rapidly expanding. These new techniques show promise in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of pancreatic malignancy.
