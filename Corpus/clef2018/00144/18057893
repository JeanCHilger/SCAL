Strategy for the surgical management of insulinomas: analysis of 52 cases. The goal of this retrospective study was to analyze the strategy for the surgical management of insulinomas.From May 2000 to October 2006, the medical records of 52 patients with insulinomas were retrospectively studied.All tumors were localized precisely by imaging techniques combined with intraoperative palpation. Forty-eight patients with benign lesions underwent surgical treatment: 41 patients open and 7 patients laparoscopic procedures. Four patients with malignant insulinomas underwent tumor resection 3 of them underwent metastatic lesion and/or lymph node dissection. There were no discrepancies regarding operation time, blood loss, and complication rate between open enucleation and laparoscopic surgery. The mean hospital stay was 11.8 +/- 3.4 days after laparoscopic surgery, shorter than the 17.0 +/- 6.0 days after the open approach. Twenty-two complications occurred in 17 patients (32%) following resection. On follow-up, 86% of the patients were free from symptoms, and surgical cure was achieved in 95% of the patients with benign insulinomas.The choice of the surgical strategy for the treatment of pancreatic insulinomas depends on size and location of the tumor and the risk of malignancy. The optimal surgical procedure is key to prevent postoperative complications. The laparoscopic approach is safe and feasible for patients with benign tumors located in body or tail of the pancreas.
