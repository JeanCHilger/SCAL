Cystic and solid lesions of the pancreas. More than 95% of malignant tumours of the pancreas are exocrine carcinomas. The exocrine carcinomas have to be distinguished from benign serous cystadenomas and tumours, the latter including mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cysts, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms. Cystic lesions have to be separated from pseudocysts, which are the most common cysts. Pseudocysts are due to extensive confluent autodigestive tissue necrosis caused by alcoholic, biliary, or traumatic acute pancreatitis. This review focuses on the classification of the different types of solid and cystic lesions based on histological criteria. The various imaging procedures are also discussed, along with their strengths and limitations.
