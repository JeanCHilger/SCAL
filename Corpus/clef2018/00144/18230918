Aberrant hepatic artery in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. It is very important to keep the integrity of the hepatic artery blood supply in patients treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. Knowing and identifying hepatic artery anomalies is helpful to avoid injuring them during the procedure of pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with ampullary tumors (including cancer in the pancreatic head).Aberrant hepatic artery in patients with ampullary tumors was identified by multislice computed tomography (CT) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in our institute between April 2002 and June 2006. Clinical data of patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy were reviewed. Hepatic artery anomalies were classified by the Michels method.15 patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy had hepatic artery anomalies (9 males, 6 females mean age 58.3 years, range 25-72 years). Patients were given preoperative examination consisting of contrast-enhanced CT (n = 15) and celiomesenteric angiography (n = 10). Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) was performed in 7 patients, and radical pancreaticoduodenectomy in the other 8 cases. Hepatic artery anomalies were diagnosed as Michels type II (n = 3), with a replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric arteryIt is inferredthat hepatic artery anomalies are not rare in patients with ampullary tumors. Preoperative CT and angiography should play a critical part in the preoperative evaluation of hepatic artery anomalies whenever and wherever available. and IAP.
