Marked effect of combination chemotherapy with tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium and gemcitabine on a suspected case of pancreas cancer or gallbladder cancer metastasis to bone: further diagnosis of disseminated carcinomatosa of bone marrow recurrence after the 23 years of gastric cancer operation by autopsy findings. A 70-year-old woman who underwent proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer (poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma) of Stage IIIB at age 46 visited our hospital April 2004 because of exacerbated pain by movement in the buttocks since November 2003. She showed multiple bone metastasis by CT (computerized tomography). Pancreas cancer or gallbladder cancer was suspected by CT, and a high tumor marker score (CA19-9 18,625 U/mL, DUPAN-II 15,000 U/ mL elevations were acknowledged). Although her symptoms were severe with performance status (PS) 4, she was administered combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. After 2 cycle therapy, her PS was improved to 2, but the tumor markers had elevated. So we changed the chemotherapy menu to S-1 and gemcitabine. Her tumor markers lowered and PS was improved to 1. There was a remarkable response to this chemotherapy, and the result of CT and bone scintigraphy suggested that her bone metastasis was improved. Because of hematologic relapse due to DIC at 1 year after the first treatment, she was readmitted to our hospital and later died. The autopsical result revealed recurrence of gastric cancer 23 years post-operatively.
