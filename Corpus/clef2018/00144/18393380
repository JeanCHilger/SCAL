Duodenal duplication cyst: a rare cause of acute pancreatitis in children. Duodenal duplication is a rare cause of acute pancreatitis in children. We report a case of acute pancreatitis in which abdominal sonography revealed an enlarged hypoechoic edematous pancreas with mildly dilated main pancreatic duct and a cystic structure with layered wall in the second part of duodenum. Abdominal CT yielded similar findings. The diagnosis of duodenal duplication was confirmed at surgery and subsequent histopathologic examination.
