Clear cell renal carcinoma presenting as a bleeding cyst in pregnancy: inaugural manifestation of a von Hippel-Lindau disease. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominant autosomal disorder inducing the development of many tumors, such as hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and retina, cysts or tumors (benign or malignant) in the kidneys and/or the pancreas. We report the case of a pregnant woman who presented with a voluminous hemorrhagic cyst of the right kidney with an exophytic lesion detected in the lower median part of the cyst wall. As an anamnestic inquiry resulted in a familial history of VHL disease, a screening imaging was performed and detected three medullary hemangioblastomas. Considering the active bleeding of the renal cyst and its potential malignancy, a unilateral nephrectomy was carried out after pregnancy interruption. Histological analysis confirmed a multilocular clear cell renal carcinoma. This case underlines the importance of screening procedures such as abdominal ultrasonography and medullary magnetic resonance imaging in all pregnant women with a familial history of VHL disease.
