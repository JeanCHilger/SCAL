Development of a sensitive and quantitative assay for spring viremia of carp virus based on real-time RT-PCR. A one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a TaqMan probe to quantitatively detect spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) is described. In this assay, a pair of primers amplifying an 81-bp DNA fragment and a TaqMan probe was designed targeting the conserved region at the SVCV glycoprotein (G) gene. To avoid the disadvantages arising from plasmids, an extension adding a T7 phage polymerase promoter to the 5' end of the antisense primer was carried out to obtain viral cRNA. Standardized cycle threshold (Ct) values for 10-fold serial dilutions of SVCV cRNA were achieved by real-time RT-PCR and used to create standard curves. A regression line between the mean Ct values and viral template concentrations over a 1:10(7) dilution range with an r(2) value (0.9916) and a slope (-3.36) and the coefficient of variation (intra- or inter-assay is <2% and <4%, respectively) indicated that the assay was highly reproducible. The assay was specific to SVCV and there was no cross-reactivity with other fish viruses (viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, VHSV infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, IPNV
