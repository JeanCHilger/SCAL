Insulinoma: reversal of brain magnetic resonance imaging changes following resection. Insulinoma presents with myriad manifestations and severe neurological deficit may develop due to delay in diagnosis. We report a lady who presented with Glasgow coma scale of E1 M2 V1, which did not improve after correction of hypoglycemia. There was complete reversal of neurological deficit and brain magnetic resonance imaging changes of hypoglycemia on follow-up after resection of pancreatic insulinoma. This is the first report which shows reversal of hypoglycemic changes in MRI after resection of insulinoma. Insulinoma, pre and post surgery provides a model for study of the effect of hypoglycemia and its improvement after euglycemia.
