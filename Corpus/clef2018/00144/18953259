Magnetic resonance imaging monitors physiological changes with antihedgehog therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenograft model. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway has an established role in pancreatic cancer (pancreatic adenocarcinoma [PDAC]). We tested whether magnetic resonance imaging measures of vascular volume fraction (VVF) using magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are sensitive to the antiangiogenic effect of targeted Shh therapies in a PDAC xenograft model.Pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenograft lines were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice (n = 19 samples within 4 groups). Therapies were targeted to 3 loci of the Shh signaling pathway (anti-Shh antibody, cyclopamine, or forskolin). Magnetic resonance imaging (4.7-T Bruker Pharmascan) was performed (after 1 week of intraperitoneal therapy) before and after intravenous injection of MION-47. Vascular volume fraction was quantified as DeltaR2 (from multicontrast T2 sequences) and normalized to an assumed VVF in muscle of 3%. Linear regression compared VVF to histological indices including microvessel density (MVD), viable gland density (VGD), and proliferative index (PI).In response to anti-Hh treatment, tumors showed a decrease in VGD, PI, MVD, and VVF compared with controls (P < 0.001). Vascular volume fraction was compared with histological indicators of response: PI (R2 = 0.88 P < 0.05), VGD (R2 = 0.87Magnetic resonance imaging VVF using magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles may serve as a noninvasive measure of biological response to Shh PDAC therapy with easy translation to the clinic.
