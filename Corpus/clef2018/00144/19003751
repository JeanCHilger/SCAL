Septic course of chronic pancreatitis caused by infected visceral pseudoaneurysm content. Visceral pseudoaneurysms occur in approximately 4-10% of all patients with chronic pancreatitis and in untreated cases the mortality rate can reach 90% of cases. The septic course of visceral pseudoaneurysm formation adds major problems to the complex treatment of these patients: Namely the removal of infected material and the occlusion of the ruptured visceral artery significantly complicate treatment strategy. The aim of this report is to present the case of a patient with severe sepsis due to chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudoaneurysm formation of the gastroduodenal artery in the head of the pancreas. A 32-year-old man underwent semi-urgent surgery after initial haemodynamic stabilization and urgent diagnostic processing including color-coded abdominal duplex sonography, angio-CT, angiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography. The removal of infected pseudoaneurysm content was performed and preceded by the extra-pancreatic ligatures of the gastroduodenal and right-sided gastro-epiploic arteries. Blood transfusions could be avoided and the postoperative outcome was uneventful. The rare septic course of visceral pseudoaneurysm complicating chronic pancreatitis may be treated successfully by open surgical technique, with consecutive elimination of the septic focus and the occlusion of ruptured and feeding arteries performed as a one-step procedure.
