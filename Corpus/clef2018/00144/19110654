Biliopancreatic reflux-pathophysiology and clinical implications. The common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct open into the duodenum, where they frequently form a common channel. The sphincter of Oddi is located at the distal end of the pancreatic and bile ducts it regulates the outflow of bile and pancreatic juice. In patients with a pancreaticobiliary maljunction, the action of the sphincter does not functionally affect the junction. Therefore, in these patients, two-way regurgitation (pancreatobiliary and biliopancreatic reflux) occurs. This results in various pathological conditions of the biliary tract and the pancreas. Biliopancreatic reflux could be confirmed by: operative or postoperative T-tube cholangiography
