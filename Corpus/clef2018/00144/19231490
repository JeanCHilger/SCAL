Yield of EUS-guided FNA on the diagnosis of pancreatic/peripancreatic tuberculosis. Pancreatic/peripancreatic tuberculosis (TB) is a very rare clinical entity, even in countries with high incidences of TB. The diagnosis of pancreatic/peripancreatic TB with EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) remains a diagnostic challenge because of limitations of the endoscopists' expertise on this condition.This study evaluated the yield and usefulness of EUS-FNA in patients with pancreatic/peripancreatic TB.A retrospective analysis was performed.A tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul, Korea.Baseline demographic and clinical features were evaluated in 21 consecutive patients with pancreatic/peripancreatic TB who underwent EUS-FNA between September 2003 and April 2007.The mean lesion diameter was 31.3 +/- 14.6 mm. Thirteen patients (61.9%) showed granulomatous inflammation on histopathologic examination, and 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) were positive on a TB polymerase chain reaction assay. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was positive in 4 of 15 patients (26.7%), and 3 of 8 patients (37.5%) had cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. EUS-FNA correctly diagnosed pancreatic/peripancreatic TB in 16 patients (76.2%). Therefore, unnecessary surgery was avoided for these patients.A retrospective study.EUS-FNA is a safe and promising method for the diagnosis of pancreatic/peripancreatic TB. Use of this method may help us to avoid the use of surgery and provide timely and accurate diagnosis.
