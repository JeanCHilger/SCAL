Preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology of a microcystic adenoma of the pancreas. The preoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy diagnosis of a microcystic adenoma of the pancreas is reported. Ultrasound examination and computed tomography showed a solid tumor in the pancreatic tail in a 68-year-old woman with abdominal discomfort. FNA biopsy of the lesion yielded a sample that contained only a few clusters of flattened ductal cells without criteria of malignancy. The presence of a considerable amount of watery fluid in the FNA sample was the main feature that suggested the diagnosis of a microcystic adenoma. This was confirmed by histologic study of the resected lesion. The differential diagnosis of microcystic adenoma is briefly discussed.
