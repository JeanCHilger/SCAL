Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: differentiation of malignant and benign tumors by endoscopic ultrasound findings of mural nodules. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs)have a wide pathologic spectrum and it is difficult to differentiate malignant from benign tumors. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of malignancy using contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS).In our institute, main duct type and mixed type IPMNs, branch duct type IPMNs with mural nodules, and IPMNs with coexistent invasive ductal cancer were indications for surgery. Eighty-seven IPMNs (14 main duct, 25 mixed, and 48 branch duct type) were resected and CE-EUS findings were compared with pathologic findings. Twelve clinicopathological variables and CE-EUS morphologic findings were assessed.Mural nodules defined as blood flow supplied protrusions were classified into 4 types: type I: low papillary nodule, type II: polypoid nodule, type III:papillary nodule, and type IV: invasive nodule.Forty-two, 26, 16, and 3 were pathologically diagnosed as adenoma,noninvasive carcinoma, invasive IPMNs, and coexistent invasive ductal cancer, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that types III/IV mural nodule (odds ratio = 10.8 95% confidential intervals = 2.75-56.1) and symptomatic IPMNs (odds ratio = 4.31In conclusion, new morphologic criteria were useful to identify the malignant potentials of IPMNs.
