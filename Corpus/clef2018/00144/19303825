Secretin-stimulated multi-detector CT versus mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MR imaging plus MRCP in characterization of non-metastatic solid pancreatic lesions. Our study was aimed to compare multiphasic multi-detector computed tomography after secretin stimulation and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging plus MR cholangiopancreatography in the characterization of solid pancreatic lesions.Forty patients with ultrasound diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesion prospectively underwent both multi-detector computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Three minutes after intravenous administration of secretin, post-contrast computed tomography scans were performed 40, 80, and 180 s after contrast medium injection. MR protocol included axial/coronal, thin/thick-slab, single-shot T2 w sequences and axial/coronal T1 w breath-hold spoiled gradient-echo images before and 30-40 min after intravenous infusion of manganese dipyri-doxal diphosphate. Different observers blindly evaluated the ability of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to characterize focal pancreatic lesions. Surgery, biopsy, and/or follow-up were considered as our diagnostic gold standard.Thirty-five focal pancreatic lesions (adenocarcinoma, n=18 focal chronic pancreatitis, n=4Both imaging techniques well correlate to final diagnosis of non-metastatic solid pancreatic lesions and particularly of adenocarcinomas with a slight advantage for mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging plus MR cholangiopancreatography.
