Visualizing immune system complexity. The European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) meeting Visualizing Immune System Complexity, held in January 2009, covered multiple scales, from imaging single molecules to imaging whole animals. In addition to experimental details, there was an emphasis on modeling both for data analysis and as a predictive tool to support experimental design. Imaging technologies discussed included total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, two-photon laser scanning microscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging. The biological systems included basic aspects of adaptive and innate immunity. The type 1 diabetes model was used to illustrate how a human disease was dissected at all the scales, from single-molecule analysis of the interactions of T cell receptors with peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes to dynamics of immune cell infiltrates by intravital microscopy, as well as the application of imaging diagnostics in humans.
