Relationship between patient symptoms and endosonographic findings in chronic pancreatitis. The endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) relies on the presence of up to nine distinct pancreatic parenchymal and ductal abnormalities, without considering other factors such as age, duration of disease or clinical symptoms. Our goal was to examine the impact of patient symptoms on EUS findings in patients with CP.All patients with previously suspected CP who had symptomatic disease referred to our medical center for pancreatic EUS were identified. Patients were stratified into two groups based on their clinical symptoms--pain only and steatorrhea +/- pain. Groups were compared using two-tailed comparative testing.53 patients (group 1) with pain only and 27 patients with steatorrhea +/- pain (group 2) were identified. Patients in group 1 were younger and more likely female. Compared to group 1 (pain only), group 2 (steatorrhea +/- pain) had more total (5.37 vs. 3.28, p < 0.01) and ductal abnormalities (2.56 vs. 0.83, p < 0.01), although the number of parenchymal abnormalities between groups 1 and 2 (2.45 vs. 2.88, p = 0.07) was not different.The presence of steatorrhea +/- pain in patients with CP undergoing pancreatic EUS examination is associated with more total and ductal abnormalities. Stratification based on underlying patient symptoms may be valuable as an adjunct to endosonographic findings in making or excluding the diagnosis of CP.
