Tree-in-bud pattern on thoracic CT due to pulmonary intravascular metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We report a case of pulmonary intravascular metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma manifesting as tree-in-bud pattern on thoracic computed tomography. Although infectious bronchiolitis is the most common cause of tree-in-bud pattern, this case emphasizes that the differential diagnoses include pulmonary intravascular metastases, particularly in patients with extrapulmonary adenocarcinomas.
