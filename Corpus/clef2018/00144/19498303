Insulinoma with basal ganglion involvement detected by magnetic resonance imaging in a dog. A West Highland White Terrier was brought to our veterinary hospital with the chief complaints of seizures and staggering gait. When cephalic Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, a symmetrical lesion was found in the basal ganglion. Suspecting a metabolic disorder, an abdominal ultrasonography was performed, and a tumor was found in the pancreas. The pancreatic tumor was surgically removed based on suspicion that it had induced the brain damage. The resected tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as an insulinoma. After removal, recurrence of neurological symptoms was not observed. MRI 3 months post-operation showed a reduction in the size of the brain lesion. Consequently, the tumor was thought to have induced the lesion in the basal ganglion, and this was verified by MRI. This case was considered to be extremely rare.
