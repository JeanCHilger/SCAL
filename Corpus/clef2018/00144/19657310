Histopathologic correlation of endoscopic ultrasound findings of chronic pancreatitis in human autopsies. To provide histologic correlation of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings believed to represent chronic pancreatitis (CP).Eighteen postmortem pancreatic specimens in patients dying of all causes were examined in vitro by EUS for features of CP: (1) echogenic foci, (2) hypoechoic foci, (3) echogenic main pancreatic duct (MPD), (4) accentuated lobular pattern, (5) cysts, (6) irregular MPD, (7) dilated MPD, (8) side branch dilation, and (9) calculi. The pancreata were then examined by 2 pathologists (blinded to the EUS/clinical findings) for histopathologic features of CP.Six specimens were autolyzed, and in 1 specimen, MPD could not be seen by EUS. In the other 11 patients, 10 had evidence of CP by EUS (> or =3 features) and by histopathologic examination (> or =2 features). One patient did not have CP by both EUS and histologic examination.Endoscopic ultrasound accurately detected CP, when compared with histopathologic examination. The presence of 3 or more features of CP correlates with the histologic diagnosis of CP, however, up to 3 features are frequently present in elderly patients dying of all causes. Future studies should address the clinical relevance and the specificity of EUS findings of CP in the older population.
