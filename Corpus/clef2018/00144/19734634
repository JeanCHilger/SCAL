Solid appearance of pancreatic serous cystadenoma diagnosed as cystic at ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse imaging. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is an emerging imaging modality. The study of the pancreas is a new and promising application of ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse imaging.We present the first case of pancreatic serous cystadenoma which mimics a solid neoplasm at conventional imaging (US and CT), correctly diagnosed as cystic at ultrasound acoustic radiation force impulse imaging.The "XXXX" values always measured at Virtual Touch tissue quantification allow the diagnosis of a pancreatic cystic lesion with simple fluid content suggesting the diagnosis of serous cystadenoma.
