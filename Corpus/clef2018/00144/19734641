Ascaris lumbricoides-induced acute pancreatitis: diagnosis during EUS for a suspected small pancreatic tumor. Ascaris lumbricoides is the second most common intestinal parasite world-wide and, although the infection can be asymptomatic, in some cases it can present with complications, such as acute pancreatitis.We describe the case of a 37-year-old man, with a history of travelling in Eastern countries who presented with Ascaris lumbricoides-induced acute pancreatitis mimicking a small pancreatic cancer, diagnosed during an upper EUS. The endoscopy revealeda roundworm floating in the duodenum its endoultrasonographic appearance showed a diffuse inhomogeneous pattern, with hypoechoic echotexture, such as in acute pancreatitis. Microbiological examination of the worm revealed a 20 cm long Ascaris lumbricoides.In non endemic countries, acute pancreatitis induced by Ascaris lumbricoides is an unusual diagnosis, and should be suspected especially in patients with history of traveling in endemic areas.
