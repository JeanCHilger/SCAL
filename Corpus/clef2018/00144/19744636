Intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) for the diagnosis of biliopancreatic diseases. Intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) is an imaging modality having unique characteristics and suitable for imaging of a narrow ductal cavity, its wall and the neighbouring structures. As IDUS uses high-frequency ultrasound (12-30MHz), its image quality is very high within approximately 2-cm range of radius. The bile duct and the pancreatic duct, therefore, are good targets for the assessment by IDUS. Biliopancreatic IDUS is mainly performed through the papilla of Vater in the same session as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Biliary IDUS is possible through the percutaneous transhepatic route as well. Not many comparative studies on biliopancreatic IDUS have been published. Gallbladder IDUS as well as most pancreatic IDUS are still at the level of clinical research. Constant delineation of Oddi's sphincter with the improvement of instruments will expand the use of IDUS for the assessment of the papilla of Vater lesions.
