Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound and elastosonoendoscopy. Until recently, there was no contrast harmonic imaging technique available for EUS examination. Second-generation US contrast agents produce harmonic signals at lower acoustic powers and, therefore, are suitable for EUS imaging at low acoustic powers. CE-EUS could provide a contribution to the differential diagnosis between a primary pancreatic carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic metastasis, and therefore can have a decisive influence on the selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies (follow-up, chemotherapy or surgery, for example). However, histology remains the standard in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumours. Regarding lymph nodes, CE-EUS cannot replace EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration. Elastography examines the elastic properties of tissues by applying a slight compression to the tissue and comparing an image obtained before and after this compression. EUS elastography is a new application in the field of endosonography and seems to be able to differentiate fibrous and benign tissue from malignant lesions. While our results are very encouraging, further research will be needed to further define the place of this new technique and should be aimed at further defining criteria for accurate elastography as well as subsequently assessing the technique using multiple operators in a blinded setting. EUS-guided sonoelastography has the potential for further guiding the diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal-related tumours.
