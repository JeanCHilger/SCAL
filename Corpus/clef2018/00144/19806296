Carbon dioxide-enhanced virtual MDCT cholangiopancreatography. We investigated the feasibility of new carbon dioxide-enhanced virtual multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) cholangiopancreatography (CMCP) for intraluminal exploration in 73 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease.CMCP was performed via a percutaneous or transpapillary drainage tube, and, synchronously, intravenous contrast material was employed for virtual angiography three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality was incorporated using OsiriX and Fovia applications. The capability of carbon dioxide to delineate the biliary and pancreatic system was evaluated.All CMCPs showed complete technical success complications including pancreatitis or pain never occurred. The incidences of visible third- and fourth-order biliary branches were 100 and 86.0%. The capability of carbon dioxide to pass an obstruction through an occluded hilar bile duct malignancy was 80.0%To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of carbon dioxide MDCT cholangiopancreatography and the use of this modality for depicting biliary, pancreatic, and fusion blood vessels simultaneously. Carbon dioxide possesses many advantages over conventional iodinated contrast agents, and it might replace more invasive diagnostic measures in the near future.
