Prenatal three-dimensional sonographic findings associated with annular pancreas. Annular pancreas is a rare developmental anomaly that accounts for 1% of neonatal intestinal obstructions. For the first time, we describe 3D sonographic findings associated with this condition. In addition to stringent diagnostic criteria based on 2D ultrasound, this case suggests the possible contribution of 3D ultrasound in rare cases of suspected annular pancreas. Verification of prenatal findings was performed during the postnatal surgery.
