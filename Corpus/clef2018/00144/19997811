Laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection: our own experience in the treatment of solid tumors. A laparoscopic resection is a new treatment for pancreatic tumors. Articles by surgeons who are writing about their first experience in carrying out this treatment have appeared in the literature, reporting that laparoscopic surgery can be used for the treatment of pancreatitis, benign lesions, and solid tumors. This is a study of three patients with pancreatic tumors who were treated by means of a laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection with preservation of the spleen and splenic vessels. In three cases a laparoscopic distal resection was performed for the tumor. The histologic examinations showed one insulinoma and two mucinous cystadenomas. No patient suffered from intra- or postoperative complications. A laparoscopic resection of the distal pancreas is a new alternative for the treatment of pancreatic tumors. This method takes advantage of the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
