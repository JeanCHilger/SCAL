Successful endoscopic sclerotherapy for cholecystojejunostomy variceal bleeding in a patient with pancreatic head cancer. Variceal bleeding outside the esophagus and stomach is rare but important because of its difficult diagnosis and treatment. Bleeding from cholecystojejunostomy varices has been reported to be a late complication of palliative biliary surgery for chronic pancreatitis. Such ectopic variceal bleeding has never been reported after palliative surgery for pancreatic cancer, probably because of the limited lifespan of these patients. Herein, we report our successful experience using endoscopic cyanoacrylate sclerotherapy to treat bleeding from cholecystojejunostomy varices in a 57-year-old man with pancreatic head cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature of this rare complication.
