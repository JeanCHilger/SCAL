The ultrasonographic diagnosis of bleeding into a pancreatic pseudocyst. Bleeding into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare but life-threatening entity. Early diagnosis is crucial in its management. There are reports suggesting that computed tomography (CT), scintigraphy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and angiography could be the diagnostic maneuvers. In this report, we present a case of arterial bleeding into a pancreatic pseudocyst, which was diagnosed by the turbulent echo-currents seen in real-time ultrasonography.
