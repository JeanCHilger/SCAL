Simultaneous emphysematous cholecystitis and emphysematous pancreatitis: a case report. Emphysematous infections of the abdomen and pelvis are potentially life-threatening conditions that require aggressive medical and surgical management. Therefore, early radiographic detection of emphysematous infections is important in management. Emphysematous cholecystitis is a rare and severe form of acute cholecystitis caused by gas-forming organisms. Emphysematous pancreatitis is a rare form of pancreatitis with gas in pancreatic parenchyma. We report a rare case of simultaneous occurrence of emphysematous cholecystitis and emphysematous pancreatitis.
