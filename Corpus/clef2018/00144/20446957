Chemotherapy-induced reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome. Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome is a neurological condition seen in various areas of acute medicine, including the administration of antineoplastic therapies used in haemato-oncology patients. It is a rare complication that has been increasingly recognized. It is characterized by altered mental status, visual disturbance, headache and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging typically shows vasogenic oedema in the posterior regions of the brain. Although its name suggests reversibility, it may result in an irreversible brain injury without prompt treatment. Therefore, it is vital for treating clinicians to recognize this syndrome. We describe the case of a 55-year-old woman with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who developed clinical and radiological manifestations consistent with this syndrome as a complication of gemcitabine monotherapy.
