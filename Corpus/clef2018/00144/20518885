Diagnostic approach to pancreatic tumors with the specimens of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has enabled clinicians to histologically diagnose pancreatic tumors. However, EUS-FNA specimens often result in tiny fragmented tissues, so auxiliary utilities are necessary. Using immunostaining of CK7, CDX2, neuroendocrine markers and KRAS mutation analysis, we examined 57 FNA cell block sections and 61 surgically-resected specimens (25 invasive ductal carcinomas, 25 endocrine tumors, and 11 acinar cell tumors). In the majority of the matched pairs, the diagnoses between EUS-FNA and surgical specimens were concordant using the following criteria: neuroendocrine markers negative, CK7 positive, and mutated KRAS gene for invasive ductal carcinomas neuroendocrine markers diffusely positive, CK7 and CDX2 negative, and wild-type KRAS gene for well-differentiated endocrine tumors
