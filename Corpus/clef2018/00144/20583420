Neuroendocrine tumours--analysis of own material--a nine--year retrospective study. Neuroendocrine tumours are fairly rare neoplasms that require different treatments and have various prognoses. The aim of this study was to present the author's observations of the histological tumor types, occurrence and its surgical treatment.Thirty-five cases of neuroendocrine tumours were studied retrospectively in a 9-year period. All cases were investigated for haematological and biochemical parameters. Ultrasonography, scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of abdominal cavity, pelvis, thorax or neck--depend on the tumor localization--were done in every individual. All cases were subjected to surgical procedure with an aim to resect the tumour completely.In the present study were observed 6 cases of carcinoids localized in ileum, cecum and sigmoid colon, 1 case of gastrinoma in pancreatic head localization, 1 case of insulinoma localized in pancreatic tail, 1 case of vipoma localised in pancreatic head, 2 cases of nesidioblastoma and 1 case of microcystic adenoma with neuroendocrine differentiation in pancreatic tail localization and 1 case of nonspecific apudoma observed in ileum. There were 6 cases of neuroendocrine tumours localized in pancreas. In the study we have also 11 cases of medullary thyroid carcinomas. In adrenal glands we observed 10 benign and 1 malignant pheochromocytoma (one bilateral female case with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2A).Neuroendocrine tumours occur very rare. Their clinical course makes recognition difficulties and as a result they are usually quite extensive when first detected. The clinical manifestations of some neuroendocrine tumours are not specific, so it causes a lot of difficulties in early diagnosis and treatment.
