Actinomycosis of the pancreas: a case report and review of the literature. Actinomycosis is a chronic suppurative and granulomatous disease usually caused by Actinomyces israelii. The pathogen produces a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory fibrosis and mass lesion. Abdominal actinomycosis is often difficult to diagnose before operation because of its rarity and chronic disease progression without any characteristic clinical features. In particular, pancreas is very rare location of actinomycosis. The present paper is a report of a case of 55-year-old man with pancreatic actinomycosis presenting as symptoms of pancreatitis. The patient was confirmed by pancreatoduodenectomy for impression of pancreatolith and mass-like lesion of head portion of pancreas. Treatment with operation followed by additional oral penicillin therapy for 3 months was successful. We report a case of pancreatic actinomycosis with a brief review of literature.
