Contribution of endoscopic ultrasonography to the diagnosis of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors. Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors (NEPT) are relatively infrequent tumors, with an incidence of approximately 1 case per 100.000 inhabitants, representing only 1-2% of pancreatic neoplasms. Localization and staging of NEPT prior to surgery is essential to allow treatment optimization. However, localizing these tumors is often difficult, mainly because of their small size. On ultrasound, NEPT usually appear as rounded, hypoechoic and homogeneous lesions, with precise limits and peripheral enhancement due to their significant vascularization. The most precise technique for the diagnosis and localization of NEPT is endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), with a sensitivity and specificity as high as 95%, clearly superior to those of other imaging procedures. Overall diagnostic accuracy may even be increased by associating EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration.
