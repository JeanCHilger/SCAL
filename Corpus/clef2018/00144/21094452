Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography of benign disorders of the biliary system. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an elegant MR technique for noninvasively delineating the biliary system. Technologic advances in MRCP acquisition and processing and the routine availability of three-dimensional sequences have facilitated detailed assessment of biliary anatomy and pathologic or congenital processes therefore, invasive endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is rarely needed for establishing a diagnosis. MRCP can be combined with contrast-enhanced MR imaging to enable concurrent evaluation of organs such as the liver and pancreas in addition to functional biliary imaging. This review focuses on the current use of MRCP to evaluate nonmalignant processes affecting the biliary system.
