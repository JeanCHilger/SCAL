Impact of CT-based diagnostic imaging on management and outcome of nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors. Sporadic malignant non-functioning pancreatic endocrine tumors (NF-PETs) are an important subset of pancreatic neoplasms. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of improved imaging on these features in a tertiary referral centre within a 20-year follow-up.From 1988 to 2009, 51 patients were treated for sporadic malignant NF-PETs. Forty-one patients who underwent tumor resection were retrospectively attributed according to the date of the initial diagnosis, group 1: 1988-1999 vs. group 2: 2000-2009.Cross-sectional imaging led to positive prediction of NF-PETs in all patients. Curative resection was achieved in 76%. Synchronous metastases were present in 56% with a positive prediction of 43%. In group 1, the mean reported CT-determined tumor size was 56 vs. 54 mm in group 2 (p = 0.89). Synchronous metastases were present in 61% in group 1 vs. 57% (p = 0.99) in group 2. Metachronous metastases were recorded in 39% in group 1 vs. 43% (p = 0.84) in group 2. The mean interval from initial resection to diagnosis of metastatic disease was significantly shorter (p = 0.01) in patients from group 1 (14 vs. 61 months). Cumulative 5- and 10-year survival rates were 77% and 72% in group 1 vs. a 5-year survival rate of 66% in group 2.So far, improved CT-based imaging has no impact on earlier detection of initial synchronous metastases in sporadic malignant NF-PETs, while metachronous metastases are detected earlier.
