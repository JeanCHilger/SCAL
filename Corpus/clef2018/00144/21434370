Endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. In this article presented results of examination and treatment of 30 patients with suspected neuroendocrine tumors (NEO) of the pancreas during the period from 2007 to 2010. In the 22 cases were identified solitary pancreatic tumor, and 4 observations--multiple. Functioning NEO were detected in 19 observations, dysfunctional--7. The main objective of endosonography was a differential diagnosis of NEO with adenocarcinoma and chronic pancreatitis, as well as the topical diagnosis of small tumors that are inaccessible by other imaging beam method. Among the 27 patients operated on NEO confirmed in 26. In 1 case was revealed adenocarcinoma. Endosonography in NEO-functioning method of diagnosis is a priority, having the highest sensitivity, specificity and accuracy among all modern radiological methods of diagnosis.
