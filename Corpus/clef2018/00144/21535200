Genetic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using specimens obtained by EUS-FNA. We review the current situation concerning molecular biological analysis in respect of pancreatic cancer, using specimens obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). K-ras, p53, p16, DPC4/SMAD4, telomerase activity are used for discrimination between tumor-forming pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Examination of heat shock protein (HSP) 27, ribonucleotide reductase, and other factors are examined in order to test the sensitivity to Gemcitabin. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis for pancreatic cancer specimens obtained by EUS-FNA was reported to be useful for evaluate the biological characteristics of pancreatic cancer before treatment. It is expected that the genetic diagnosis using EUS-FNA specimens will not only positively contribute to improving the diagnostic performance, but it will also provide valuable information for carrying out tailor-made treatment.
