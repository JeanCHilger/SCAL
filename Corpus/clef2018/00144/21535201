New techniques and future perspective of EUS for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies: contrast harmonic imaging. Although endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has the advantage over other imaging methods in that it is possible to obtain high resolution images of the pancreas, it is limited in its ability to characterize pancreatic masses. Contrast-enhanced power Doppler ultrasonography suffers from several limitations such as blooming artifacts, poor spatial resolution, low sensitivity to slow flow and high sensitivity to motion artifacts. Recently, EUS system specific for contrast harmonic imaging has been developed. The use of this EUS system enabled us to observe images of microcirculation and parenchymal perfusion without Doppler-related artifacts in the pancreas. Contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS could diagnose pancreatic carcinomas as hypovascular masses with a high sensitivity (89-96%) and specificity (64-88%). Contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS also discriminates mural nodules from mucous clots in the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
