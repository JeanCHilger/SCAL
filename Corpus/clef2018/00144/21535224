Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided drainage for tuberculous liver abscess drainage. Traditionally, either surgical or percutaneous drainage is recommended for liver abscess. Recently, several endoscopists have reported the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided liver abscess drainage. Herein, we report a case of tuberculous liver abscess in which endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was useful for the diagnosis and therapy. A 78-year-old woman suffered from continuous epigastric pain and fever up. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 70 mm multilocular and multiseptate cystic lesion around the head of pancreas and caudate lobe of the liver. After confirming liver abscess by EUS-FNA, EUS-guided liver abscess drainage was carried out. Finally, a 7 Fr straight stent and a 5 Fr nasocystic catheter were inserted into the cyst. Four weeks later, we found that cultured microorganism obtained using drainage catheter was Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although he was doing well during 5 days after the procedure, CT showed the size of another abscess increased. Then, additional EUS-guided abscess drainage was carried out at the body of the stomach into the abscess of the left lobe. Two weeks later, CT showed disappearance of abscesses. Then, she discharged with the internal stent still in place.
