Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy in a patient with prior Billroth II gastrectomy. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) is a safe and accurate procedure for the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. However, in general, surgically altered anatomy excluding Billroth I gastrectomy is considered a relative contraindication to EUS-FNA. Herein, we described a successful case of EUS-FNA in a patient with prior Billroth II gastrectomy. A 78-year-old man, who had previously undergone Billroth II gastrectomy for duodenal ulcer, undertook EUS-FNA using a curved linear echoendoscope. An echoendoscope was advanced into the duodenum and EUS-FNA could be carried out using a 22-gauge needle without procedure-related adverse event.
