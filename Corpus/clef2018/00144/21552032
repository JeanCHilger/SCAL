Pancreatic metastasis detected by F-18 FDG PET/CT in a patient with breast cancer. Pancreatic involvement by metastasis from other primaries is rare and accounts for approximately 2% to 4% of pancreatic tumors. In this article, we describe FDG-avid pancreatic involvement in a patient with diagnosis of breast cancer. We conclude that FDG PET can be a convenient noninvasive method of early detection of recurrence and in monitoring metastatic disease during follow-up in such patients. A positive FDG PET warrants histopathologic correlation for appropriate treatment.
