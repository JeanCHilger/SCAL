Pain caused by chronic pancreatitis. Pain is a predominant symptom in chronic pancreatitis. When diagnosing chronic pancreatitis it is important to exclude other causes of abdominal pain. Diagnostic evaluation can be started with upper abdominal ultrasound examination and fecal elastase-1 assay. Treatment of pancreatic pain should be actively carried out in order to prevent the pain to become chronic. If the pain cannot be managed with anti-inflammatory drugs and modifications of lifestyle, endoscopic, radiologic and surgical treatments have to be contemplated.
