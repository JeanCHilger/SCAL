Computed tomographic-guided fine-needle biopsy of the pancreas for histology determination. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle biopsies of the pancreas were performed in 54 patients. In 46/54 biopsies, the material obtained permitted a histological diagnosis despite the small external needle diameter of only 0.95 mm. The only complication was due to laceration of an artery of the transverse mesocolon. The prevalence of malignant tumors was 67%. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in more than 80% of all biopsies rare findings were malignant carcinoid or centroblastic lymphoma. Benign tumors included mucinous adenocystoma and serous microcystic adenoma. Within the group of patients where pathologic-anatomic evaluation was possible, the sensitivity of fine-needle biopsy for malignant tumors was 87% and the specificity 100%. A positive needle biopsy diagnosis for a malignant tumor reduces the number of exploratory laparotomies needed and is helpful in the planning of surgery.
