Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas: case report and review of the literature. Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas (LCP) is a rare, benign cyst mimicking pseudocyst or cystic neoplasm. Literature describing LCP is limited to case or brief series reports, and the natural history of this condition is largely unknown. A literature review was carried out in order to elucidate the clinical, pathological and biochemical features of LCP. The aim of this study was to define diagnostic criteria and treatment.A Medline and Pubmed search was conducted by using the key-words "lymphoepithelial cyst" and "pancreas". The articles found were accurately examined and all details regarding clinical and pathological features were included in a data-base. Furthermore, a case recently observed in our unit was added to the review.Ninety-two cases of LCP were found in the worldwide literature, including the case that we observed. LCP occurs more frequently in males (M:F=5.5:1), its preferred site is the tail of the pancreas, and its size ranges between 2 and 10centimetres. Histologically, it is a true cyst delineated by a keratinizing squamous epithelium surrounded by lymphoid tissue. LCP is asymptomatic in the majority of cases and preoperative diagnosis is complicated by a lack of specific radiological features of the disease. An accurate preoperative diagnosis can only be made by obtaining cytological specimens and placing them in the hands of a pathologist who is familiar with the cytological appearances of the disease.LCP is a rare lesion worldwide, without any prevalence in different countries or in different ethnic groups. Understanding the features of LCP, making an accurate diagnosis and differentiating it from cystic neoplasm preoperatively is vital, as when it is diagnosed certainly, a conservative treatment is justified. Otherwise, radical surgery in the form of pancreatic resection is required to exclude the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasm.
