Upper gastrointestinal tract heterotopic pancreas: findings from CT and endoscopic imaging with histopathologic correlation. To evaluate and describe computed tomographic (CT) and endoscopic (ES) imaging findings in patients with pathologically confirmed upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract heterotopic pancreas (HP).Findings from imaging examinations in 11 patients with pathologically confirmed HP were retrospectively reviewed (CT images obtained from 11 patients and ES images from 6 patients were available for review). Two radiologists evaluated lesion location, size, shape and border as well as growth pattern, enhancement pattern, enhancement grade and number of tumors. The presence of surface dimpling, prominent enhancement of overlying mucosa, and low intralesional attenuation were also evaluated.HP in the upper GI tract showed typical features in CT imaging: submucosal masses, ill-defined borders, endoluminal growth patterns, bright enhancement similar to the normal pancreas, surface dimpling and low intralesional attenuation. Endoscopic photographs manifested an endoluminal, ill-defined, submucosal mass in the upper GI tract wall, typically with central umbilication. The LD (long diameter)/SD (short diameter) ratios were found to be significantly different between HP in the stomach and HP in the duodenum (P<.05 for each finding). In addition, HP in the duodenum tended to be small and round.HP exhibits typical pancreatic pathologic features. Images showed characteristic features in CT imaging: submucosal masses, ill-defined lesions with an endoluminal growth pattern, bright enhancement similar to the normal pancreas, surface dimpling and low intralesional attenuation. ES imaging showed an endoluminal, ill-defined, submucosal mass, typically with central umbilication.
