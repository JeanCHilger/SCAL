Solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm of the pancreas: clinical findings of a rare tumor. A young woman presented with a large pancreatic mass that was found to be a solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm. The endoscopic, radiologic, and gross appearance of this tumor is described. The origin of the tumor is probably from a multipotential stem cell of the pancreas. Surgical resection is usually curative, although radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been successfully used. This unusual tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a young female with a pancreatic mass.
