Unusual presentation of biliary atresia splenic malformation syndrome with autosomal dominant hypospadias. Biliary atresia is associated with polysplenia in 2-10% of cases and is defined as Biliary Atresia Splenic Malformation syndrome (BASM). The main features of BASM syndrome include extrahepatic biliary atresia and polysplenia besides the characteristic findings of laterality anomalies, cardiac anomalies, intraabdominal vascular anomalies, pancreatic anomalies and malrotation. Here we present a 6-month-old male patient with BASM having atrial septal defect, umblical hernia, inguinal hernia, and hypospadias. Clinical history revealed that his father also had hypospadias which showed a rare form of autosomal dominant inheritance. The karyotype was normal and the molecular analysis of CFC1 gene revealed no mutation. We emphasize the importance of a detailed physical examination in cases with BASM.
