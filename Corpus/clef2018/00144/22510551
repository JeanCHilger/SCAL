Enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma mimicking an ACTH producing neuroendocrine tumour. We present a case of enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma mimicking an ACTH producing neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas and duodenum on PET/CT because of symmetrical FDG avidity in the bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Functional imaging with 18F-FDG PET depicts tumour metabolism, but may also visualise secondary endocrine hypersecretion. Therefore, as always, it is mandatory to perform a biopsy to ascertain the final diagnosis. The cause of FDG avidity in the adrenal hyperplasia was not found, but believed to be caused by a ''non-ACTH-mediated stimulant'' as reported earlier.
