Pancreatic metastasis from osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma: literature review. Pancreatic metastasis from osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma is extremely rare. Differential diagnosis with primary pancreatic carcinoma is crucial before any treatment, but may be very difficult.We searched for and reviewed the cases reported in the English literature.Twelve cases were identified, including nine osteosarcoma patients and three Ewing sarcoma cases. The median time between the sarcoma diagnosis and that of pancreatic metastasis was 3 years. In most of the cases, the pancreatic relapse followed or was associated with relapse(s) in one or more sites. Two out of eight patients with available follow-up were alive without disease 6+ and 11+ months after complete surgical removal, whereas five patients died from disease. Histological diagnosis was obtained before surgery in only five cases using percutaneous Tru-Cut biopsy in three cases and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) in the two most recent ones.Osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma metastasis should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic solid lesion, particularly in patients with a primary tumor. In this context, EUS and EUS-FNAB are reliable methods for the pre-operative diagnosis and should thus be discussed before any therapeutic decision.
