Duodenal adenocarcinoma masked by acute cholecystitis and peptic ulcer disease. We report a case of duodenal adenocarcinoma, who presented to the emergency ward, with features of acute cholecystitis and peptic ulcer disease. Ultrasonography and upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy failed to pick up duodenal pathology, previously two times. Only third time endoscopy showed circumferential thickening of first and second part of the duodenum. On diagnosis laparoscopy mass at the D1/2 junction with apparent involvement of head of pancreas was noted. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Histopathological examination showed it to be primary duodenal adenocarcinoma with extension in to head of pancreas. His postoperative course was uneventful. After 4-month follow-up the patient remained well.
