Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas and concomitant urogenital malformations in a young woman. Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare pancreatic tumor with low malignant potential. It occurs characteristically more often in young women. SPT associated with extra- and pancreatic anomalies are occasionally reported. Here we report a case of pancreatic SPT with concomitant urogenital malformations including solitary kidney and uterus didelphys in a 25-year-old woman. The patient underwent central pancreatectomy, and SPT was confirmed with pathological results. Recurrence or metastasis was not found after 14 months of follow-up.
