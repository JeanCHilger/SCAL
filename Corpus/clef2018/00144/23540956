Pre-ERCP imaging of the bile duct and gallbladder. Advances in biliary imaging have improved making accurate diagnoses of the presence and causes of biliary obstruction. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful screening tool because it is highly specific for choledocholithiasis. New developments in CT and MRI have also been useful in the diagnosis of biliary disease. Although diagnosis of biliary disease can be achieved in a noninvasive manner, there are limitations to modern MRI and CT cholangiographic techniques their use may not be necessary or cost effective. MRI and CT imaging of the biliary tract provides opportunities for less-invasive diagnostic techniques but should be used judiciously before interventional endoscopy.
