A case of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with excessively-advanced liver metastasis treated with S-1/GEM combination chemotherapy plus the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide. A 41-year-old woman who had a pancreatic tail tumor and multiple liver tumors was referred to our hospital. The results of abdominal US, CT and MRI, and histopathological and immunohistochemical findings of the liver tumor biopsy revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with excessively-advanced liver metastasis. We treated her with S-1/gemcitabine combination chemotherapy plus long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide, which produced tumor stabilization and good quality of life for 7 months, and survival time of 15 months. Although the tumor was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma, this therapy was suggested to be effective in this case.
