Direct endoscopic necrosectomy: a minimally invasive endoscopic technique for the treatment of infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis and infected pseudocysts with solid debris. Endoscopic transenteric stenting is the standard treatment for pseudocysts, but it may be inadequate for treating infected collections with solid debris. Surgical necrosectomy results in significant morbidity. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN), a minimally invasive treatment, may be a viable option. This study examined the efficacy and safety of DEN for the treatment of infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis and infected pseudocysts with solid debris.This study was a retrospective analysis of data collected from a prospective database of patients who underwent DEN in the presence of infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis or infected pseudocysts with solid debris from April 2007 to October 2011. DEN was performed as a staged procedure. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided transgastric stenting was performed during the first session for initial drainage and to establish endoscopic access to the infected collection. In the second session, the drainage tract was dilated endoscopically to allow transgastric passage of an endoscope for endoscopic necrosectomy. Outcome data included technical success, clinical success and complication rates.Eight patients with infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis or infected pseudocysts with solid debris (mean size 12.5 cm range 7.8-17.2 cm) underwent DEN. Underlying aetiologies included severe acute pancreatitis (n = 6) and post-pancreatic surgery (n = 2). DEN was technically successful in all patients. Clinical resolution was achieved in seven patients. One patient with recurrent collection opted for surgery instead of repeat endotherapy. No procedural complications were encountered.DEN is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis and infected pseudocysts.
