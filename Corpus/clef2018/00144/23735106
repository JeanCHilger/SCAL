Advanced EUS imaging for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-fine needle aspiration remains the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic malignancy. However, in a subset of patients, limitations remain in regards to image quality and diagnostic yield of biopsies. Several new devices and processors have been developed that allow for enhancement of the EUS image. Initial studies of these modalities do show promise. However, cost, availability, and overall incremental benefit to EUS-fine needle aspiration have yet to be determined.
