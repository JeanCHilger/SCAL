Spectroscopic MRI: a tool for the evaluation of systemic lipid storage disease. Spectroscopic MR imaging allows to measure the lipid content of a region inside the human body. This technique has been applied to the case of a woman with a severe multisystemic triglyceride storage disease. Lipid contents of liver, pancreas, kidneys, left ventricle, skeletal muscles (calves, thighs, arms) were measured by using the Dixon spectroscopic imaging sequence. In some heterogeneous muscles, localized proton spectra were recorded. Results agreed with clinical findings (muscle weakness, normal renal and cardiac function, diabetes). These techniques could help to quantify the severity of the disease and to follow up its evolution under therapy.
