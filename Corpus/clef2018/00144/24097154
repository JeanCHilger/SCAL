Two cases of lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas confirmed by contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound. We report our experience with two cases of lymphoepithelial cysts (LECs) of the pancreas. Both patients were in their sixties. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed masses in the pancreas with multilocular cystic lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings presented highly echo-dense structures in the cystic masses however, contrast-enhanced EUS revealed only the septum inside each mass without enhancing the dense structures. Contrast-enhanced EUS was useful for defining the contents in the cystic lesions
