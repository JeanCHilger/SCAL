A case of amylase-producing ovarian tumor. A 51-year-old woman with ovarian carcinoma with hyperamylasemia is reported. She was admitted to Osaka General (JNR) Hospital in July 1982. A cystic tumor was palpated in the pelvis. Serum amylase, mainly the salivary type, in electrophoresis, had increased to 1583 Smith-Roe units/dL, while the pancreas was normal on ultrasonography and CT. Chemotherapy (MFC) was performed, and laparotomy revealed bilateral ovarian tumors. Histologically, they were serous cystadenocarcinoma. Serum and urinary amylase values dropped to the normal range after chemotherapy and surgery, and varied directly with the clinical course. Immunohistochemically, amylase was demonstrated in the tumor tissue by the PAP method. In conclusion, amylase was a useful marker in the diagnosis and follow-up of the present patient.
