Quantification of pancreatic exocrine function of chronic pancreatitis with secretin-enhanced MRCP. To obtain reference values for pancreatic flow output rate (PFR) and peak time (PT) in healthy volunteers and chronic pancreatitis (CP) to correlate quantification of secretin enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (SMRCP) of pancreatic fluid output following secretin with fecal elastase-1 (FE-1) tests.The present study includes 53 subjects comprised of 17 healthy individuals and 36 patients with CP from April 2011 to January 2013. The 36 patients with CP were divided into three groups of mild CP (n = 14), moderate CP (n = 19) and advanced CP (n = 3) by M-ANNHEIM classification for CP.. Fifty-three cases underwent FE-1 test and magnetic resonance imaging using 3.0 T-device (Signa EXCITE, GE Healthcare). Coronal T2-weighted single-shot turbo spin-echo, spiratory triggered, covering the papillae, duodenum and small bowel. MRCP was performed with a heavily T2-weighted fat-suppressed long TE HASTE sequence (thick slab 2D MRCP sequence), repeated every 2 min up to 11 min after 0.1 mL/kg secretin injection (Secrelux, Sanochemia(®), Germany). FE-1 test used sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (ScheBo. Tech(®), Germany).A good linear correlation showed between the calculated volume and the actual volume by Phantom experiments. Fifty-three paired Quantification of secretin enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCPQ) and FE-1 data sets were analyzed. The mean FE-1 of 53 cases was 525.41 ± 94.44 μg/g for 17 healthy volunteers, 464.95 ± 136.13 μg/g for mild CP, 301.55 ± 181.55 μg/g for moderate CP, 229.30 ± 146.60 μg/g for advanced CP. Also, there was statistically significant difference in FE-1 (P = 0.0001) between health and CP. The mean values of PFR and PT were 8.18 ± 1.11 mL/min, 5.76 ± 1.71 min for normal 7.27 ± 2.04 mL/min, 7.71 ± 2.55 min for mild CPSMRCP can provide a safe, non-invasive and efficient method to evaluate the exocrine function of the pancreas.
