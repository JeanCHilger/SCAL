Magnetic resonance imaging of cystic pancreatic lesions in adults: an update in current diagnostic features and management. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has become a widespread diagnostic solving tool for the detection and characterization of a large range of pancreatic cystic lesions. Benign and malignant cystic lesions of the pancreas including serous microcystic adenoma, mucinous cystic tumor, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, solid pseudopapillary tumor, and also the less common lesions such as cystic endocrine tumors, cystic metastases, and lymphangiomas have suggestive MR imaging presentation that allows them to be differentiated from each other. Knowledge of MR imaging findings of cystic pancreatic lesions is critical to help suggest the diagnosis and chose the best therapeutic approach. The purpose of this review is to discuss and illustrate MR imaging features that are helpful for pancreatic cystic lesion detection and characterization and to provide an update in current MR imaging diagnostic features and management.
