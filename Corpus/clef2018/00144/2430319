Magnetic resonance tomographic studies at 2.0 Tesla. Evaluation of clinically relevant parameters. After having used a 2 Tesla prototype whole body scanner for about one and a half years, it is now possible to comment on the clinical value of high field strengths. The methods and techniques employed are described. The problems arising from high field strengths are discussed and their effect on clinical diagnosis is indicated.
