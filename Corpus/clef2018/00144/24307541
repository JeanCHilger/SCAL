Diagnostic criteria for pancreaticobiliary maljunction 2013. Pancreaticobiliary maljunction is a congenital malformation in which the pancreatic and bile ducts join anatomically outside the duodenal wall. The diagnostic criteria for pancreaticobiliary maljunction were proposed in 1987. The committee of The Japanese Study Group on Pancreaticobiliary Maljunction (JSGPM) for diagnostic criteria for pancreaticobiliary maljunction began to revise the diagnostic criteria from 2011 taking recently advanced diagnostic imaging techniques into consideration, and the final revised version was approved in the 36(th) Annual Meeting of JSPBM. For diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary maljunction, an abnormally long common channel and/or an abnormal union between the pancreatic and bile ducts must be evident on direct cholangiography, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transpehatic cholangiography, or intraoperative cholangiography magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
