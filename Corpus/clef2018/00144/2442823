Patient selection and complications of transhepatic cholangiography. The most common diagnoses of transhepatic cholangiography (THC) among 58 surgical patients were pancreatic adenocarcinoma, choledocholithiasis and cholangiocarcinoma. THC was complicated in 17 of 58 patients or 18 of 68 attempts due to bacteremia or fever in four, subcapsular hematoma in two and Ring catheter shearing and apical pneumothorax in one each. THC related deaths occurred in four patients. In uncomplicated THC, the mean hematocrit value decreased from 35.9 +/- 5.8 (n = 39) to 34.1 +/- 4.8 (n = 39) (p less than 0.02). Of THC attempts, 8.8 per cent failed before THC, ultrasonography (UTZ) in most of these showed no dilation of the bile ducts. THC showing dilated ducts had a significantly higher (p less than 0.01) bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels (14.8 +/- 8.7 milligrams per cent, n = 46 and 414 +/- 283.9 units, n = 46) compared with the THC showing no dilation (5.29 +/- 5.45 milligrams per cent, n = 13 and 235 +/- 294.1 units, n = 13). Of the 30 patients given ampicillin and gentamicin before THC, only three had bacteremia develop
