Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in pancreatic trauma. The sensitivity and specificity of ERCP for the diagnosis of suspected pancreatic ductal rupture was prospectively studied. Fourteen consecutive patients who were referred for abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia subsequent to abdominal trauma underwent ERCP, the majority within 24 hours of admission. Twelve of these also underwent abdominal CT, and 7 had peritoneal lavage. Four patients were found to have ductal rupture at ERCP. This was confirmed at laparotomy. Three additional patients who underwent laparotomy were found not to have a ductal rupture, although one had a pancreatic capsular laceration. The remaining 7 had clinical resolution. ERCP was 100% sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal rupture, whereas no combination of serum amylase, CT scan, and peritoneal lavage was equally effective.
