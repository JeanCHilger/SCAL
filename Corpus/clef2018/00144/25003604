Diagnostic approach to pancreatic cysts. Diagnosis of pancreatic cysts remains challenging due to limitations of currently available radiologic and endoscopic tools. The diagnostic approach should focus on identifying mucinous and malignant cysts. Mucinous cysts require further differentiation to allow appropriate management.Although the overall rate of malignant pancreatic cysts is low, it remains higher than the general population. MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is the preferred imaging modality for pancreatic cysts. Attempts to improve diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration include performing cyst wall cytology and DNA analysis. The 2012 international consensus guidelines for mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are superior to the original 2006 guidelines, although issues include the relatively poor ability to diagnose malignant cysts leading to unnecessary surgeries and the de-emphasis of cyst size. Cyst size remains an important predictor of malignancy. Translational research involving genomics, microRNA, proteomics, and metabolomics holds promise for improved biomarkers. Endoscopic innovations may safely aid in cyst diagnosis.Incremental improvements in pancreatic cyst diagnosis have occurred with new biomarkers and endoscopic tools requiring validation in large-scale studies.
