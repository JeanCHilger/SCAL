Established EUS-guided therapeutic interventions. Over the three last decades, endosonography ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a diagnostic tool to an interventional modality through cumulative advances in experience, knowledge, equipment, and devices. EUS-guided therapeutic procedures appear feasible and safe when performed in highly-experienced centers. This review covers the technical aspects, indications, and results of the most commonly performed procedures. Celiac plexus neurolysis and collection drainages are now well-established techniques and considered to be first-line treatments. Biliary and pancreatic EUS-guided drainages are, conversely, more challenging, and there is currently insufficient clinical evidence documenting their superiority over established practice. Well-designed prospective trials are thus needed in order to accurately assess this modality's risks and long-term outcomes compared to radiological or surgical techniques.
