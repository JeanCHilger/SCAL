Trans-organ versus trans-mesenteric computed tomography-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of pancreatic masses: feasibility and safety. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of pancreatic masses that traverses the gastrointestinal tract or solid viscera.From January 2002 to December 2012, 144 patients underwent 165 CT-guided biopsies of pancreatic masses. Biopsies were performed using a 21 or 22 G needle. Cytology reports, medical records, and procedure details for all patients were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the biopsy route, complications, and diagnostic accuracy.Trans-organ biopsies of pancreatic masses were safely performed via a direct pathway traversing the stomach (n = 45), colon (n = 14), jejunum (n = 4), or liver (n = 5). There were five self-limiting mesenteric haematomas along the biopsy route on immediate post-procedure CT and all patients remained asymptomatic. All haematomas occurred after a trans-mesenteric approach rather than passage through abdominal organs. Three patients had acute pancreatitis. There was no significant difference in complications and diagnostic yields between the groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of final FNAB cytology for malignancy were 98.3%, 100%, 100% and 71.4%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 98.4%.Percutaneous FNAB using the trans-organ approach is a safe and effective technique to diagnose pancreatic malignancy.
