FDG PET/CT in the detection of pancreatic metastasis in a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma and negative I-131 whole body scan findings. We identified a rare follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) metastasis to the pancreas in a patient of FTC. A 65-year-old woman presented at our hospital for evaluation of a pancreatic mass. She had a history of FTC. After total thyroidectomy, I-131 whole body scan showed increased I-131 uptake in the thyroid bed, but there was no evidence of distant metastasis. However, F-18 FDG PET/CT showed a mass with FDG uptake in the pancreatic head. Follow-up PET/CT showed FDG uptake in the pancreatic head and thyroid bed. Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histopathological examination supported the diagnosis of metastatic FTC to pancreas.
