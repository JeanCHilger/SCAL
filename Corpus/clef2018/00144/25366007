A synchronous pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor. We recently encountered the case of a patient with a synchronous duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). This is the first report of this specific combination of multiple primary tumors, although three cases involving both PNET and gastric GIST have previously been reported. Since the duodenal GIST developed close to the pancreatic uncus in this case, we considered the possibility of multiple PNETs in the differential diagnosis. However, a histopathological examination using endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration confirmed the diagnosis of multiple primary lesions, involving PNET and duodenal GIST.
