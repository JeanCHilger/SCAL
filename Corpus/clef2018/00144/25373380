A case of definitive type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis diagnosed using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy. A 29-year-old man with ulcerative colitis presented to the hospital complaining of persistent back pain. Pancreatic enzymes and tumor markers were elevated imaging showed diffuse narrowing of the main pancreatic duct associated with diffuse pancreatic enlargement. We therefore performed an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) biopsy of the pancreas using a 19-gauge needle. Histopathology revealed interlobular fibrosis, neutrophil infiltration in the intralobular ducts and acini, and very few immunoglobulin G4-positive cells. The patient was diagnosed with type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis and started on oral steroids
