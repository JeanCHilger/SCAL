Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatic duct drainage. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a purely diagnostic procedure to one with therapeutic capabilities. One of the most challenging therapeutic intervention for endosonographers is EUS-guided pancreatic drainage. The development of this technique has allowed access and drainage of the main pancreatic duct after failed endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and can avoid invasive procedures such as surgical and percutaneous interventions. This review discusses the indications, technique, challenges, and an algorithmic approach to EUS-guided pancreatic drainage.
