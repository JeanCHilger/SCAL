Branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: clinically and patient-reported outcomes. The majority of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are branch duct (BD) IPMNs, and these neoplasms are being diagnosed with increasing frequency no data are also available on the well-being (quality of life [QoL]) of these patients. We aimed to evaluate the 2-year follow-up results in consecutive patients with BD-IPMNs to assess symptoms at presentation and their morphological progressionOne hundred one patients with BD-IPMN of the pancreas were enrolled in the study (37.6% men and 62.4% women mean [SD] age, 66.3 [10.4] years). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the modification of the cystic lesions at baseline as well as in the follow-up. The SF-12 Health Survey, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Y-1 and Y-2, the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire, as well as the Beck Depression Inventory-II were used to evaluate the QoL once a year.The mean (SD) basal size of the major lesion was 15.5 (8.9) mm, and in the follow-up period, the size remained stable. The QoL did not change during the follow-up period.Branch duct IPMNs are very slow-growing neoplasms, and they do not affect the QoL of affected patients.
