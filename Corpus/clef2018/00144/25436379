Surgical outcomes for solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a rare exocrine tumor of the pancreas with low malignant potential. This study was designed to evaluate surgical outcome of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN).From Between January 1994 to November 2013, 41 patients were diagnosed with SPN of the pancreas at Ajou University Medical Center and underwent surgical resection.Of the 41 patients, 33(80.5%) were female and 8(19.5%) were male with a mean age of 34.5 years (range, 12-63 years). The most common location of SPN was the tail (43.9%). Mean diameters of SPN was 5.5 cm (range, 1.2- 14.5 cm). Nineteen patients (46.3%) had non-specific abdominal symptoms that had been investigated. Surgical treatment included distal pancreatectomy in 21, pancreaticoduodenectomy in 11, segmental resection of pancreas in 4, enucleation in 2, excision in 2 and surgical biopsy in 1. Thirty-nine of the 41 patients were disease-free at a median follow-up of 59 months (range, 1-125 months).Patients diagnosed as SPN should receive surgical resection because of the excellent prognosis. Closed follow-up is recommended after surgery, even in patients without pathological malignant potential. For metastasis or recurrence, an aggressive surgical treatment is necessary because of the good possibility of long-term survival.
