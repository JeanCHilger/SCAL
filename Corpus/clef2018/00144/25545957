New fully covered large-bore wide-flare removable metal stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid collections: results of a multicenter study. Endoscopic transmural drainage (ETMD) of peripancreatic fluid collections (PFC) is an effective alternative to surgical drainage. Conventional drainage using plastic stents has its limitations. A wide-bore short-length wide flange fully covered self-expandable metallic stent (FCSEMS) has recently been developed. The present study evaluates the efficacy of this new FCSEMS for ETMD of PFC.This was a retrospective, multicenter study. Patients with PFC undergoing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided drainage of PFC using specially designed FCSEMS were included. Parameters evaluated were technical success of stent placement, clinical success as defined by resolution of PFC without any further surgical intervention, ability to carry out endoscopic necrosectomy, complications and feasibility of endoscopic stent removal.Twenty-one PFC in 19 patients were drained using FCSEMS. Technical and clinical success for drainage was seen in all patients (100%). Endoscopic necrosectomy was carried out in seven (33%) PFC. Complications occurred in two patients (10.5%). Stents could be endoscopically removed in all patients (100%).The new specially designed FCSEMS is safe and effective for drainage of PFC. Necrosectomy can be carried out through the stent. Stent can be removed endoscopically at the end of the treatment period.
