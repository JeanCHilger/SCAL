Localization of pancreatic insulinomas by combined radiographic methods. Seventeen cases with a total of eighteen insulinomas were examined by ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), angiography, percutaneous transhepatic portal and pancreatic venous sampling (PTPS) and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS). We discussed about diagnostic accuracy of insulinomas on these diagnostic modalities. Tumor localization was achieved by US in 39%, CT in 72% and angiography in 81%. Although total 15 tumors (83%) can be correctly detected, multiple lesions were not completely ruled out. We recommended the criteria in PTPS as follows: Insulin concentration level above 200 mu U/ml. Or, both of insulin concentration ratio (step-up site/control) above three and elevation of the CPR concentration level on the PTPS. According to these criteria, the accuracy rate was 91%. Overall preoperative diagnostic accuracy was 100%. IOUS allowed us to detect the localization of the tumors completely.
