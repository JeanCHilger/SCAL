CT pleurogram for diagnosing an occult diaphragmatic tear. A 27-year-old man road traffic accident victim, in his initial CT, showed fractures in left lower ribs, pleural effusion and splenic and pancreatic lacerations. The left pleural effusion, drained with an intercostal tube, did not show any significant reduction in size and pleural fluid amylase was abnormally high. A diaphragmatic tear was suspected. Contrast was injected through the intercostal tube and a CT was performed, which revealed a small diaphragmatic tear and communication of the pleural space with peritoneum and the pancreatic laceration site.
