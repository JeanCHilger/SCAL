Laparoscopic fenestration of pancreatic serous cystadenoma: Minimally invasive approach for symptomatic benign disease. Serous cystadenoma (SC) is a benign pancreatic cystic tumor. Surgical resection is recommended for symptomatic forms, but laparoscopic fenestration of large symptomatic macrocystic SC was not yet described in the literature. In this study, 3 female patients underwent laparoscopic fenestration for macrocystic SC (12-14 cm). Diagnosis was established via magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, with intra-cystic dosage of tumors markers (ACE and CA19-9) in 2 patients. All patients were symptomatic and operated on 15-60 mo after diagnosis. Radiological evaluation showed constant cyst growth. Patients were informed about this new surgical modality that can avoid pancreatic resection. The mean operative time was 103 min (70-150 min) with one conversion. The post-operative course was marked by a grade A pancreatic fistula in one patient and was uneventful in the other two. The hospital stay was 3, 10, and 18 d, respectively. The diagnosis of macrocystic SC was histologically-confirmed in all cases. At the last follow-up (13-26 mo), all patients were symptom-free, and radiological evaluation showed complete disappearance of the cyst. Laparoscopic fenestration, as opposed to resection, should be considered for large symptomatic macrocystic SC, thereby avoiding pancreatic resection morbidity and mortality.
