The Correlation Between Diffusion-Weighted Imaging at 3.0-T Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Histopathology for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to discuss the correlation between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at 3.0-T magnetic resonance and histopathology for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).Twenty-eight patients with histopathologically proven PDA were included in this study after 108 cases of suspected pancreatic tumors had been performed with DWI. The sequences of DWI included respiratory-triggered DWI and breath-hold DWI, which were performed with 2 b values (0 and 500 s/mm 0 and 1000 s/mm), respectively. According to magnetic resonance images, wax blocks and slices were selected and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), anti-CD34, and anti-Ki-67 (Mib-1). The relationship between tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and tumor fibrosis, as well as the expression of tumor VEGF, Ki-67, and multivessel density (MVD), were studied.The ADC values of PDA of different grades of differentiation and fibrosis grade did not show statistically significant difference. The ADC values of PDA did not show the statistically significant correlation with the grades of differentiation, fibrosis grade, Ki-67 expression, and expression of VEGF and MVD.The ADC of PDA cannot be used to reflect grades of differentiation, degree of tumor fibrosis, the expression of VEGF, the expression of Ki-67, and the tumor MVD.
