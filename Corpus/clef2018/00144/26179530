Multiple Intraglandular Metastases in a Patient with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Pancreas. A 56-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for an evaluation of pancreatic lesions. Computed tomography revealed a hypoattenuating tumor in the head of the pancreas, with three other tumors detected in the body and tail. Magnetic resonance imaging showed similar enhancement patterns and signal intensities in all four lesions. The patient underwent total pancreatectomy based on a preoperative diagnosis of multiple invasive ductal carcinomas. Histopathologically, the lesion in the pancreatic head was considered to be the primary lesion, while the others were diagnosed as metastases. This is a rare case of pancreatic cancer with intraglandular metastases. The possibility of this differential diagnosis should thus be considered when imaging shows multiple hypovascular lesions in the pancreas.
