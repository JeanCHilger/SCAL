Early diagnosis and classification in acute pancreatitis. A comparison of clinical outcome with findings at computed tomography and Ranson's prognostic signs. The clinical outcome in 52 consecutive episodes of suspected acute pancreatitis was compared with Ranson's prognostic signs and findings on noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans performed within 24 h of patient admission. The predictive value of CT scan for diagnosis was 95% for positive results and 53% for negative results. In providing an accurate prognosis of a single attack, scoring of extrapancreatic signs was as good as that of Ranson's prognostic signs. CT with contrast medium revealed pancreatic ischaemia in 3 cases of 4 with clinically severe disease. The risk of developing severe pancreatitis was 23% in first attacks and 6% in relapses. Early CT scan is recommended in most patients with suspected pancreatitis to confirm diagnosis and to predict the severity of an attack.
