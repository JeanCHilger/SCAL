Ultrasonographic diagnosis of the retroperitoneal space. A case history series and some selected clinical cases. A personal series and some clinical cases of pathology of the retroperitoneal space observed by ultrasonography during routine and emergency investigations are reported. Although the limitations of this diagnosis compared to the more recent image techniques (CT and NMR) are recognised, it is still considered an indispensable first level diagnosis in this extensive pathology (in terms of site, type and extent) of retroperitoneally located organs, tissues and systems.
