High Grade Penetrating Pancreatic Trauma - Case Report and Review of the Literature. The pancreatic injuries have fortunately a low frequency, but when present associate multiple intraabdominal lesions, and carry a significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to underline the significant morbidity associated with high grade pancreatic injuries.Female patient, 36 years old, with penetrating abdominal trauma due to domestic violence was referred to our center from a regional county hospital, after multiple laparotomies, hemodynamically unstable, with multiple organ failure. Abdominal clinical exam revealed evisceration, with massive pancreatic leakage at the level of the median laparotomy and through the stabbing wounds from the right flank. Emergency Computed Tomography showed multiple intraabdominal collections, with laceration of the liver, right kidney and pancreatic head. Abdominal exploration was decided. After a thorough abdominal debridement was revealed a deep laceration of the pancreatic head, with active extravasation of pancreatic secretion, correlating with a grade IV injury. Peritoneal lavage and large drainage of the lesser and greater peritoneal cavity was performed. The postoperative recovery was uneventful, with progressive decrease in pancreatic fistula output and discharge after 35 days.High grade pancreatic traumas associate a significant morbidity. Efficient drainage of the pancreatic head injuries and patients management in high volume centers for pancreatic surgery maximize the survival rate.
