Angiography and intervention in tumors of the pancreas, liver and bile ducts. The importance of angiography and of interventional radiology in tumours of the pancreas, liver and bile ducts is discussed. Angiography is performed prior to surgical intervention to assess tumour resectability, for a preoperative visualisation of vascular anatomy, as well as in non-diagnostic findings in ultrasound and computerised tomography. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventional techniques in the liver (fine needle puncture, perfusion, embolisation) and the bile ducts (PTC, ERCP, PTCD, endoprosthesis, stents) are performed selectively in tumour patients in close co-operation with surgeons, radiologists and gastroenterologists.
