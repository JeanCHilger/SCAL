Isolated complete transection of the common bile duct due to blunt trauma in a child, and review of the literature. A case of isolated complete transection of the common bile duct due to blunt abdominal trauma in a 3-year-old child is presented. The rarity of this injury and its initial presentation as a pancreatic pseudocyst warrant its description. This patient, the fifteenth child to be reported in the literature, was diagnosed as having a biliary injury following ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. Choledochal transection was documented at laparotomy and was successfully treated by proximal cholecystostomy and choledochojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Delayed diagnosis is common, but this injury should always be kept in mind. Early diagnosis is feasible with the use of the HIDA scan. A review of the literature, modes of diagnosis, and techniques for surgical repair are described.
