Successful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. We reported the case of hemorrhage in the pancreatic pseudocyst and gastrointestinal tract caused by gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. Transcatheter embolization was done with stainless steel coils and pseudoaneurysm was successfully occluded. We recommend the embolization therapy as the alternative to surgery for high-risk patients.
