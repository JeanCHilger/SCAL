Presurgical Evaluation of Pancreatic Cancer: A Comprehensive Imaging Comparison of CT Versus MRI. The purpose of this study was to compare comprehensive CT and MRI in the presurgical evaluation of pancreatic cancer.Thirty-eight patients with pathologically proven pancreatic cancer were included in a retrospective study. CT with negative-contrast CT cholangiopancreatography and CT angiography (CTA) (CT image set) versus MRI with MRCP and MR angiography (MRI image set) were analyzed independently by two reviewers for tumor detection, extension, metastasis, vascular invasion, and resectability. These results were compared with the surgical and pathologic findings.The rate of detection of tumors was higher with MRI than with CT but not significantly so (reviewer 1, p = 1.000 reviewer 2, p = 0.500). In the evaluation of vessel involvement, nodal status, and resectability, although CT had higher ROC AUC values than did MRI (reviewer 1, 0.913 vs 0.858, 0.613 vs 0.503, and 0.866 vs 0.774MRI and CT had similar performance in the presurgical evaluation of pancreatic cancer.
