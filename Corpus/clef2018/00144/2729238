Ectopic pancreas in the stomach presenting as an inflammatory abdominal mass. A case of 29-yr-old woman with an ectopic pancreas in the stomach, presenting as an inflammatory mass, is presented. Physical examination revealed a tender mass in the upper abdomen. Laboratory data showed leukocytosis and an increase of ESR and CRP. A computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated a solid mass adjacent to the gastric antrum. Endoscopy disclosed a submucosal mass at the antrum. With a diagnosis of inflammatory mass lying near the gastric antrum, laparotomy was done. A mass 3 cm in diameter was found at the gastric antrum, and partial gastrectomy was performed. Surgical specimen showed a submucosal mass with a central umbilication. Histological examination revealed an ectopic pancreas with an abscess formation. The white cell count, ESR, and CRP returned to normal within 1 wk after surgery. From a review of the English and Japanese literature, we believe that ours is the first report of an ectopic pancreas, presenting as an inflammatory abdominal mass.
