Metastatic brain tumor originating from the cardiac sarcoma. A 39-year-old woman had suddenly onset of headache, aphasia and right hemiparesis. CT scan revealed a mass lesion in the left parieto-temporal lobe. The brain tumor was resected twice. But, heart tumor could not be resected because congestive heart failure progressed rapidly. At last, she succumbed to systemic metastasis at 4 months after the onset of symptoms. At autopsy, tumors were found to be localized in left atrium of the heart, left parietal lobe, bilateral occipital lobe of the brain, pancreas, liver and stomach. Histological examination was diagnosed as a malignant-fibrous-histiocytoma. Review of the literature reveals no other case with cerebral metastasis of malignant-fibrous-histiocytoma.
