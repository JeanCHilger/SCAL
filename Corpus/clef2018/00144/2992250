Magnetic resonance imaging of cavernous hemangioma of the liver: tissue-specific characterization. Twenty-one patients with hepatic hemangioma, five with hepatic cysts, and 25 with primary or metastatic cancer involving the liver were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Benign lesions (hemangiomas, cysts) were diagnosed noninvasively by CT, radionuclide studies, and/or sonography and confirmed by follow-up examinations more than 1 year later. Malignant lesions were confirmed by liver biopsy in every case. Identical multisection/multiecho techniques were used in all patients to obtain T1-and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) and inversion-recovery (IR) images. MRI detected more hemangiomas than any other imaging technique. Of 30 hemangiomas, 25 were spherical or ovoid with a homogeneous appearance and smooth, well defined margins. Cancer tended to have a heterogeneous appearance and poorly defined margins. On T2-weighted SE images obtained with 2000 msec TR and 60, 120, or 180 msec TE, hemangiomas had significantly greater contrast-to-noise ratios (C/N) than liver cancer (p less than 0.001). The SE 2000/120 sequence provided the single most useful image for distinguishing hemangiomas from cancers. When morphologic criteria are used in conjunction with measured C/N, MRI correctly distinguished cavernous hemangiomas from liver cancer with 90% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and an overall accuracy of 90%. Cysts had a low signal intensity on SE 500/30 images and could often be distinguished from hemangiomas and cancers that were nearly isointense relative to liver. IR images were sensitive for lesion detection but provided no tissue-specific information. The data indicate that T2-weighted SE imaging may become the procedure of choice for distinguishing cavernous hemangioma from liver cancer.
