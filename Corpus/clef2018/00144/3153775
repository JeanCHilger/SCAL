ERCP in evaluating the mode of therapy in pancreatic pseudocyst. Twenty patients with ultrasonographic or computed tomographic diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst were referred for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Two of these were found at laparotomy not to have pseudocysts and were excluded. Pancreatography was successful in 15 out of 18 cases (83%) and cholangiography in 12 out of 18 cases (67%). Three types of pseudocysts were noticed according to the communication of the pseudocyst to the main pancreatic duct and the presence of pancreatic duct stenosis. Successful treatment included two spontaneous resolutions, two internal drainages and three left pancreatic resections. In the eight percutaneous external drainages four recurrences (50%) occurred, one after closure of temporary pancreatocutaneous fistula. All the recurrences occurred in Type III pseudocysts with communication of the pseudocysts to stenotic main pancreatic duct. In these cases internal drainage would have been the preferable treatment method. We believe that by ERCP one can identify pseudocysts not suitable for external drainage.
