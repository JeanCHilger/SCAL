Blunt abdominal trauma. Serious intraabdominal injury due to intraabdominal hemorrhage, gastro-intestinal laceration with peritonitis or incarceration of abdominal organs. The most important question in the management is to ascertain a laparotomy or the diagnostic of a specific organ injury is needed. The peritoneal lavage is a great help in making this decision. The x-ray examinations of thorax, abdomen and bones are required. Adjunctive diagnostic modalities for subtile examination of organs are ultrasound, computed tomography and angiography. These examinations have a limited application. Exploratory laparotomy should be done if there are signs of peritoneal irritation with an increased tendency. 168 patients with blunt abdominal trauma where treated in Charity-hospital of Berlin. The laparotomy was necessary in 78 patients. In 70 cases we found organ injuries. It was pointed to splenic repair, the management of liver injury especially the packing of the laceration and the treatment of the injuries of gastro-intestinal tract, pancreas- and diaphragmatic rupture.
