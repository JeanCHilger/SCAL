Fine needle aspiration of pleomorphic giant-cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Case report with ultrastructural observations. The fine needle aspirate in a case of pleomorphic giant-cell carcinoma of the pancreas, an unusual but highly malignant variant of ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, was characterized by bizarre tumor giant cells, "osteoclastlike" giant cells and abundant mitoses. The differential diagnostic possibilities include sarcoma (rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and liposarcoma), melanoma, choriocarcinoma, metastatic giant-cell carcinoma of the lung and giant-cell tumor of the pancreas. A combination of clinical history, imaging findings and fine needle aspiration biopsy with transmission electron microscopy could lead to the appropriate diagnosis and help differentiate this entity from the other possible considerations.
