Choledochal cyst type I: successful endoscopic balloon dilatation of the distal common bile duct and sphincter of Oddi: a case report. A 12-year-old boy with a choledochal cyst type I is reported with clinical features of abdominal pain, postprandial vomiting, weight loss and fatigue since 3 months. Diagnosis was made by ultrasound and confirmed by computer-assisted tomography (CAT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). Instead of the usual surgical treatment balloon dilatation of the sphincter of Oddi and the distal common bile duct was performed by endoscopic means. The patient was relieved from his complaints, gained weight and felt healthy again. Sonographic and endoscopic reexamination had proven that the diameter of the common bile duct had diminished from 3,0 to 2,6 cm. Endoscopic balloon dilatation of choledochal cysts type I may be a valuable alternative to surgical treatment.
