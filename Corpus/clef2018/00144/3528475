Muscular metastases. Uncommon manifestation of cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The authors report the detection of a cystadenocarcinoma of the caudal pancreas developed by muscular metastasis. They insist on the rarity of that type of localization to distinguish from the lesions of steatonecrosis. In the check-up of the developing metastasis, this observation bears out the interest of the C.T. of first meaning which allows an approach of lesional characterization owing to the analogies of structure existing between the causal pancreatic lesion and its muscular and hepatic metastasis.
