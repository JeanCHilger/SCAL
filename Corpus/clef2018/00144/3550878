Perfluorochemicals as US contrast agents for tumor imaging and hepatosplenography: preliminary clinical results. In animals, perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are effective ultrasound (US) contrast agents that produce hepatic, splenic, and tumor enhancement. The use of Fluosol-DA 20%, an emulsion of perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine, was studied in nine non-critically ill patients with cancer who had liver lesions. US studies without Fluosol were compared with studies obtained 24, 48, and 72 hours after Fluosol infusion. Vital signs and extensive laboratory analyses are performed before and after Fluosol infusion. Liver metastases from colonic, pancreatic, and gastric carcinoma exhibited rim or diffuse enhancement after a Fluosol dose of 1.6 g/kg or greater. Fluosol produced echogenic enhancement of the liver and spleen relative to kidney at a dose of 2.4 g/kg, allowing the detection of nonenhancing lesions. In addition, Fluosol at a dose of 1.6 g/kg or greater allowed detection of lesions not seen before contrast medium was administered in three of the seven patients studied. There was a mild increase in the level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in two patients, one given 2.4 and the other 3.2 g/kg of Fluosol. Mild and transient allergic reactions without change in vital signs were experienced by two patients.
