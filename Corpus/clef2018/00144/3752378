Computerized tomography in the evaluation of the late complications of acute pancreatitis. The role of computerized tomography in the diagnosis and treatment of late complications of acute pancreatitis was evaluated in 25 patients with acute pancreatitis. The clinical severity of the pancreatitis was assessed by Ranson's criteria. In each patient. the scan showed abnormalities of the pancreatic and at least one intraabdominal extrapancreatic extension of the disease. The scan precisely locates the intraabdominal extensions secondary to acute pancreatitis, and thus can guide surgical drainage, but it is less accurate in differentiating solid infiltration of fat planes from necrotic collections. However, in most of our patients, the association of general signs of sepsis with a collection shown on computerized tomographic scan indicated necrosis requiring surgical drainage.
