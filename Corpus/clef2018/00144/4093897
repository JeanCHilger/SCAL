Neuroblastoma of the tail of the pancreas. Apropos of a case. We describe the case of a four-year-old child who presented a neuroblastoma of the tail of the pancreas. Diagnosis was evoked on computer tomography and confirmed thanks to the pathological examination of the resected tumour. Malignant tumours of the pancreas are rare in children and most of the cases are carcinoma. Three cases of pancreatic neuroblastoma have been described. Evolution and prognosis depend on the staging once the diagnosis is established.
