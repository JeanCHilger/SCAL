Imaging of the pancreas with computed tomography. In this paper we present our experience with computerized tomographic imaging of the pancreas, both in normal and abnormal conditions. Eighty patients were studied for evaluation of pancreatic disease. A further 50 patients, all with a normal pancreas, were studied for abnormalities of other abdominal organs and served as the control group. Helpful signs in establishing the diagnosis of carcinoma of the pancreas were mass effect within the pancreas, alteration of organ contour and obliteration of retroperitoneal fat planes. We found that differentiation from pancreatitis or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy may at times be difficult. Our results showed that in 22 out of 23 patients with proven normal pancreas, the pancreas size on the CT display was within the adopted normal range. In 30 patients with proven carcinoma of the pancreas, a pancreatic mass was seen in 24 (83%). Computerized tomography is clearly a valuable method for viewing both normal pancreatic anatomy and anatomical variations and pathologies.
