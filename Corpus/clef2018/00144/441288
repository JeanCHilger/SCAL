Computed tomography of the pancreas: a new roentgenographic examination. Lesions of the pancreas are considered to be among the most difficult lesions to visualize roentgenographically. The capability of computed tomography to record accurately the attenuation coefficients of human body tissue in cross section has enabled detailed images of the pancreas to be obtained for the first time. Computed tomography is proving to be one of the most reliable imaging modalities for demonstrating some of the many complex lesions of the pancreas.
