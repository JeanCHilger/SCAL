Hyperselective arteriography value in pancreatic pathology. A retrospective study of 47 cases by 3 different investigations without any clinical information (author's transl). Between January 1965 and February 2978, this 47 arteriographies of pancreas retrospective study has been achieved by three investigators expounding each case without clinical information. The authors observe that arteriography is a sensitive and specific investigation for pancreatic cancer (more than 90% correct diagnosis). They insist on its real interest into the cancer extension balance. So the achieved arterial mapping is also very useful to the surgeons before surgical intervention. In return, its interest is more limited for investigation of non tumorous pancreas and especially the chronical pancreatitis. Through the late data of the literature concerning the different technics especially echotomography and total body scanner, a strategy is revealed by the pancreatic cancers exploration.
