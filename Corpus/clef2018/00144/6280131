The Verner-Morrison syndrome: endocrine cholera or vipoma? (author's transl). This syndrome, also known under the initials W.D.H.A., is due to a single or multiple pancreatic tumour or to micropolyadenomatosis consisting of non-beta islet cells. Malignancy is found in about two-thirds of the cases. The other endocrine glands are rarely involved. The syndrome is more frequent in women than in men. It is characterized by liquid diarrhoea, marked hypokalaemia and absence of gastric hyperacidity. The tumour is mainly diagnosed by echotomography, computerized tomography and arteriography. It can also be located by staged collections of blood along the portal system for hormonal assays. The nature of the tumour can only be ascertained by demonstrating the presence of the responsible hormone, usually the "vaso-intestinal peptide". Treatment is primarily surgical. Adjuvant treatments include streptozotocine and embolization by superselective catherization in cases of hepatic matastases. The prognosis is sombre since in spite of the various treatments cure can only be achieved in 50% of the patients.
