Sonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography in the diagnosis of diseases of the pancreas and biliary system (author's transl). The value of sonography and ERCP was studied in a retrospective series of 128 patients with pancreatic and biliary disease. Sonography and ERCP employed singly provided a correct diagnosis in 68% and 75.5% respectively combined diagnostic accuracy rose to 85%. The inclusion of other diagnostic information produced almost identical figures for sonography and ERCP of 82% and 86% respectively. Consequently, sonography must be recommended in the first place as a non-invasive method for the diagnosis of pancreatic and biliary disease. The indications for ERCP are for the elucidation of chronic pancreatitis without pseudo-cysts and for other pancreatic abnormalities not clearly shown by sonography, and also for the demonstration of the biliary system in non-obstructive jaundice.
