Computed tomorgraphy and ultrasound comparative study in diseases of the upper abdomen and retroperitoneal space (author's transl). In a comparative study with 242 patients (90 renal, 152 pancreatic and abdominal diseases) ultrasound and computed tomography were compared. With an overall accuracy quota of 92.56% for CT and 85.53 for US, we get the following quotas for the organs: kidney (95.5% Ct, 91.1% US), pancreas and abdominal disease (90.78% CT, 82.23% US). CT has the same specificity (CT: 100, US: 97.7) but a greater sensitivity II (making the final diagnosis) than US (CT: 88.15, US: 78.28). The grading scale of diagnostic efficiency and therapy planning shows a higher value for CT (3.12) than for US (2.89). US is often handicapped by sonic shadows behind calcifications and air, CT by motion artifacts and by the lack of far between the organs. Both methods show the same result for differentiation of the enlarged head of the pancreas.
