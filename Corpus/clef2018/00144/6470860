Magnetic resonance imaging in cystic fibrosis. A clinical dilemma in patients with cystic fibrosis is the determination of the nature of linear areas of decreased aeration in the lungs. It is difficult using chest roentgenograms or even computed tomography to differentiate atelectasis, mucoid impacted bronchi, or peribronchial inflammatory disease from normal pulmonary vascularity. Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive sensitive means that provides the distinction. Pulmonary vessels are easily identified, because with the spin-echo sequence that we use, the rapidly flowing blood within the vessels has no signal intensity. In contradistinction, mucoid-impacted bronchi appear as high-intensity linear branching structures. Peribronchial inflammatory disease appears as curvilinear areas of high intensity, representing inflammatory edema, around central lucencies representing bronchi.
