Limits of conventional abdominal sonography and features of endoscopic sonography. The reasons for the sometimes poor imaging of different organs and structures are mainly to be explained by limiting factors in conventional ultrasound tomography (UT). It is the aim of endoscopic UT ( EUT ) to omit the limiting factors and to overcome the ultrasound barriers like ribs and gas. High frequencies enable a better discrimination of details. Preliminary indications of EUT will be: tumors of the pancreas, of the spleen kidney angle, of biliary ducts, of the stomach, of the liver and the gallbladder, choledocholithiasis, adrenal disorders, and cardiac diseases.
