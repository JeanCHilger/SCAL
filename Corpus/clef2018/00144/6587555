Pancreatic pseudocysts and tumors in endosonography. In endoscopic ultrasound tomography (UT), the ultrasound probe positioned in the stomach has direct access to the pancreatic region. In first experiences, 62 patients were investigated by EUT . 22 of them had a pancreatic infection. EUT seems to be a new method being a valuable complement to conventional UT with a high diagnostic potential and with broad possibilities of application. The increased resolution of structural details of pathological alterations could be of diagnostic value.
