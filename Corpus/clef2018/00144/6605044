The role of percutaneous aspiration in the diagnosis of pancreatic abscess. Percutaneous aspiration should be performed on pancreatic/peripancreatic fluid collections when an abscess is suspected. Thirty-one percutaneous aspirations were performed on 21 such patients and seven (33%) proved to have an abscess. A Gram stain after the aspiration is important, as it can make an immediate diagnosis of an abscess. By helping make an early diagnosis, percutaneous aspiration might reduce the high mortality rate associated with a pancreatic abscess while avoiding surgery in those who have sterile fluid collections. Two complications (6%) occurred: superinfection of a pseudocyst and a hemoperitoneum.
