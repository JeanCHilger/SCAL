Computed tomography demonstration of pancreatic microcystic adenoma. Microcystic adenoma is an uncommon pancreatic neoplasm that is generally thought to be a benign tumor. Herein, we review the literature related to microcystic adenomas and discuss the use of computed tomography in the differential diagnosis of the tumor. The controversy in pathology regarding the presence or absence of a potential for malignant degeneration in microcystic adenomas is presented along with the therapeutic controversy regarding the necessity for total surgical excision. Two new cases of pathologically proven microcystic adenoma of the pancreas are reported. In one case there was evidence of metastasis by computed tomography, sonography, and scintigraphy.
