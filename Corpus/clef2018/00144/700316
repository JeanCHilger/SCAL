Detection of pancreatic pathology by ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Retrospective evaluation of the results of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and pancreatic ultrasonography in identifying those patients with a normal pancreas and those with a pancreatic abnormality revealed ultrasonography to have an overall accuracy of approximately 73%, whereas ERCP had an 85% accuracy, and both modalities had a combined accuracy of 92%. Both procedures were most accurate in the identification of patients with no disease, and both were least accurate in the identification of patients with chronic pancreatitis.
