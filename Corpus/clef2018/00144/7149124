Percutaneous catheter drainage in intraabdominal fluid collections including infected biliary ducts and gallbladders. Sixty-five abscesses, including 6 infected biliary systems and 15 sterile fluid collections, were treated by percutaneous catheter drainage in 77 febrile patients who were evaluated by computerized tomography or ultrasonography of intraabdominal infection. Percutaneous catheter drainage and systemic antibiotic administration without surgery provided satisfactory control of infection in 52 of 65 abscesses (80 percent). Catheter drainage followed by surgical exploration for abscess control was performed in an additional 5 of 65 abscesses (7 percent). Nine death (14 percent) occurred in the abscess group of 64 patients. In 15 patients, aspirations, Gram stain, and culture of the abnormal fluid collection revealed sterile fluid. Drainage with a single catheter allowed complete resolution in 14 of 15 sterile collections. Surgery was performed electively in one patient with a fistula from a pancreatic pseudocyst in the small bowel. No deaths occurred in the noninfected group of 15 patients, 2 of whom underwent drainage of coexisting abscesses.
