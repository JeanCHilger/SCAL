CT evaluation of mediastinal pseudocyst. Rarely do pancreatic pseudocysts extend into the mediastinum. We recently evaluated a case exemplifying this phenomenon. Although ultrasonography demonstrated the nature of the mass, computed tomography (CT) allowed better definition of various anatomic relationships and afforded improved definition of the superior aspect of the pancreatic pseudocyst. The role of CT and its advantages over ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic pseudocyst are discussed.
