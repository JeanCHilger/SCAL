Ultrasonic tomography by means of an ultrasonic fiberendoscope. The diagnositc value of ultrasonic tomography of the upper abdominal organs is sometimes limited by bones and gas. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUST) combines the advantages of the direct visualization of the upper GI tube and the ultrasonic imaging of adjacent organs. The ultrasonic probe consists of a 5 MHz array that generates a good resolution at the acustical focus, the endoscope is a conventional Olympus gastroscope type GFB3. The ultrasonic transducer is firmly attached to the distal end of the endoscope. Combined examinations are performed in 18 patients with biliary, pancreatic and hepatic disorders or postoperative changes. EUST may be of value not only for gastrointestinal but also for retroperitoneal, cardiac, and mediastinal diseases.
