Splenic vein aneurysm: diagnosis with color-coded duplex ultrasound. This is a report on a 67-year-old woman who was admitted to our department with a suspected pseudocyst of the pancreas as diagnosed by ultrasonography performed elsewhere. A percutaneous US study revealed an echo-free space-consuming process measuring 3 cm in diameter and located cranially to the pancreas. On the basis of colour Doppler sonography, a splenic vein aneurysm was diagnosed. An endosonographic examination clearly visualized the aneurysm. Colour Doppler sonographic examination is a valuable diagnostic procedure for the differential diagnosis of "cystic" space-consuming processes in the region of the pancreas.
