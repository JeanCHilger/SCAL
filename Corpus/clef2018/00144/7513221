Lymphoma-associated pancreatitis as a presenting manifestation of immunoblastic lymphoma. A 55 year old man presented with clinical signs and symptoms of subacute pancreatitis of unknown aetiology. Two weeks later, inguinal lymphadenopathy developed and a lymph node biopsy revealed a B cell immunoblastic lymphoma. Computerized tomography showed enlargement of the pancreas and imaging features consistent with pancreatitis. Administration of VACOP-B combination chemotherapy achieved complete resolution of the pancreatic mass and the enlarged lymph nodes. We consider this patient to have had lymphoma associated pancreatitis. This case represents a rare clinical presentation of lymphoma suggesting an alternative aetiology of subacute pancreatitis in some cases.
