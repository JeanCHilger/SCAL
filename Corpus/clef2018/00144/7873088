Imaging variants of the liver, pancreas, and spleen. The liver, spleen, and pancreas are three of the most frequently imaged intra-abdominal organs. Each organ is a complex structure affected by multiple pathologic processes. However, in order to recognize the pathologic changes that affect each organ, one must have a detailed knowledge of the broad spectrum of normal variants that can be seen when imaging the upper abdomen. This review explores the wide variability in appearance of the normal liver, spleen, and pancreas during cross-sectional imaging (CT, US, and MRI), stressing a thorough understanding of normal anatomy and the affect of physiologic variants.
