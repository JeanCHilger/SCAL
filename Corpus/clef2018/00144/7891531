Breath-hold projection magnetic resonance-cholangio-pancreaticography (MRCP): a new method for the examination of the bile and pancreatic ducts. Breath-hold MR cholangio-pancreaticography using the RARE method was evaluated as a noninvasive alternative to direct cholangio-pancreaticography in 30 healthy volunteers and in 30 patients with various diseases of the respective duct systems. In contrast to 3D MR cholangiography, RARE MRCP generates projection images requiring a 4-s acquisition time and no postprocessing. Diagnostic information gained from the cholangio-pancreaticograms was fully equivalent to that of conventional x-ray imaging by invasive procedures. Additional information was gained whenever endoscopic access was impossible and/or cystic malformations were present.
