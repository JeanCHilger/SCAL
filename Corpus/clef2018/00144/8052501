Annular pancreas in an adult. Annular pancreas is a rare congenital anomaly which can remain symptom free for a long time and be manifested mainly in adults. 1130 endoscopic retrograde pancreatographies were performed in the author's laboratory during 3.5 years, and annular pancreas was seen in 2 cases. Duodenal obstruction with consecutive ulcers was the clinical manifestation in a young woman requiring duodeno-jejunostomy. Annular pancreas was an accidental finding in an other old woman presenting obstructive jaundice caused by several big stones in the main bile duct. A short review of the literature is given concerning the diagnostic possibilities, eventual complications and treatment modalities of this rare anomaly. It is emphasised that the diagnosis became possible due to the modern radiologic and endoscopic methods.
