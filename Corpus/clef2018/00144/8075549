MR imaging of annular pancreas. The appearance of annular pancreas on magnetic resonance (MR) images is described in a 14-year-old with pancreatitis and incomplete pancreas divisum. The presence of the coexisting abnormalities complicated the interpretation of an upper gastrointestinal series and computed tomographic (CT) study. MR imaging was useful as a problem-solving technique to supplement the conventional imaging tests.
