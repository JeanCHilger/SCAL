MR cholangiography: clinical evaluation in 40 cases. To determine the reliability and efficacy of magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography in demonstrating the site and extent of stricture.In 40 patients with obstructive jaundice, three-dimensional MR cholangiography was performed with a sequence of mirrored fast imaging with steady-state precession and was compared with conventional cholangiography in 39 cases. The level of obstruction was determined by examining all imaging data available.Diagnostic MR cholangiograms were acquired in 39 patients absence of obstruction was confirmed in three, and obstruction was seen in 36. The level of obstruction or absence of obstruction was accurately shown in 36 of 40 patients with MR cholangiography and in 37 of 39 patients with conventional cholangiography. The peripheral biliary tree was shown more completely with MR cholangiography than with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in all 32 patients undergoing diagnostic studies with both modalities.Three-dimensional MR cholangiography shows particular promise for the assessment of complex strictures, in which conventional cholangiography carries a higher risk of sepsis, for planning optimal drainage before intervention.
