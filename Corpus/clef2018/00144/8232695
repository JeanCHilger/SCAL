Quantitative assessment of pancreatic function by magnetic resonance in cystic fibrosis. To determine the value of magnetic resonance imaging in the analysis of pancreatic function in cystic fibrosis, 11 adult cystic fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency were studied by magnetic resonance and a set of non-invasive tests of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. Magnetic resonance imaging, comprising the calculation of intensity ratios (pancreas/liver) of the pancreas on T1 ([SE] TR/TE = 300/20) and T2 weighted ([SE] TR/TE = 2000/50-100)images and the measurement of several dimensions of the pancreas, was compared with the results of the indirect pancreatic function tests. Although magnetic resonance showed the typical morphology of the insufficient pancreas in cystic fibrosis, including atrophy, lobular fatty enlargement and infiltration, it was not related to the quantitative exocrine and endocrine function assessed by indirect pancreatic function tests.
