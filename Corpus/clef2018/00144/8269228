Laparoscopic fenestration of a lymphocele following combined pancreas-kidney transplantation. The development of a lymphocele is an uncommon but well-known complication following a kidney transplantation. In case of recurrence after puncture and aspiration, a laparoscopic procedure seems to be the treatment of choice. For the preoperative workup ultrasound is essential CT scan is to be favored if available. A large fenestration is easy to perform laparoscopically and thus the lymphocele is drained into the abdominal cavity. Because of the immunosuppressive treatment, adhesions hindering a laparoscopic approach are unusual. The conclusion is that surgeons trained in laparoscopic techniques have an important role in these infrequent abdominal problems.
