Diagnostic and therapeutic integration in ductal carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Preliminary note. The diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic ductal carcinoma are managed, in our hospital, by a team of radiologist, surgeons, radiotherapists and pathologists. In periodic meetings they discuss the clinical cases before and after clinico-radiologic staging. Patients are entered one of three different treatment routes, based on their general status, on disease stage, tumor size and its arrangement around common bile duct and main pancreatic duct. Thirty-eight patients were studied: 23 of them, considered as resectable on the basis of imaging (CT, US) findings, were submitted to radical surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy (route I) of 11 unresectable cases, 8 had a bilio-digestive bypass and interstitial brachitherapy with 125I seeds (tumor size < 3 cm). Eleven patients unresectable by imaging and 1 by surgery followed treatment route II, characterized by radio-chemotherapy followed by intraluminal radiotherapy with 192Ir wires, relative to residual tumor size and to lesion arrangement around access ways. Four patients with metastases and "adequate" tumor size entered treatment route III-i.e., merely palliative luminal radiotherapy. This preliminary note stresses the importance of polyspecialistic team work in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic ductal carcinomas.
