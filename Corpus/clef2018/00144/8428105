Chronic pancreatitis: MR imaging features before and after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed in patients with a history (> 1 year) of inflammatory pancreatic disease. Calcification was seen at recent computed tomographic examinations in 13 patients and was not seen in nine patients. On fat-suppressed spin-echo images, the signal-to-noise ratio of the pancreas was significantly lower (P < .001) in patients with pancreatic calcification (18.2 +/- 2.5 vs 38.1 +/- 6.1). On fast low-angle shot images, the percentage of contrast enhancement was also significantly lower (P < .001) in patients with calcification (26.1% +/- 5.8 vs 78.7% +/- 15.9). The results suggest that MR imaging may be useful in evaluating patients with a long history of pancreatic disease for the presence of irreversible disease.
