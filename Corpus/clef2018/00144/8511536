Transabdominal ultrasonography in pancreatic diseases. Transabdominal ultrasound renders complete imaging of the pancreas possible in 90% of cases. Ultrasound is very sensitive in diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Peripancreatic edema and fatty necrosis are both hypoechoic and cannot be differentiated by ultrasound but by dynamic computed tomography. Complications of pancreatitis and biliary obstruction in the case of biliary acute pancreatitis are well detectable. Focal dense parenchymal echoes and an irregularly dilated pancreatic duct are characteristic of chronic pancreatitis. Biliary and duodenal obstruction, portal vein thrombosis and pseudocysts as complications of chronic pancreatitis are clearly demonstrable by ultrasound. Pancreatic ductal carcinomas of more than 10 mm in diameter can be detected with a high degree of accuracy. Resectability can be judged reliably.
