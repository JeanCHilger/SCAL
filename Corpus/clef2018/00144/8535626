Endoscopic ultrasonography in pancreatobiliary disease using radial instruments. A review is made of clinical studies evaluating the performances of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in pancreatobiliary disease using radial instruments. EUS is more accurate than conventional ultrasonography and CT scans for the diagnosis of solid pancreatic tumors, chronic pancreatitis, and causes of obstruction of the common bile duct. EUS is a promising technique for both idiopathic pancreatitis and cystic lesions of the pancreas.
