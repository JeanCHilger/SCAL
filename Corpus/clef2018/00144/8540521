Early detection of pancreatic glucagonoma. Glucagonoma is a rare islet cell tumor of pancreas. Only 122 proven cases have been reported in the English literature so far. Diagnosis of glucagonoma has usually been delayed. The average size of clinically detected glucagonomas was 5.8 cm, and 54.7% of them exhibited metastasis. We describe the case of a 0.7-cm asymptomatic pancreatic glucagonoma. A 45-yr-old female was demonstrated to have a demarcated, small, low echoic mass in the pancreatic head by routine ultrasonography. Table incremental dynamic computed tomography showed a small well-enhanced mass recognized only in an early phase. A 0.7 x 0.7 cm firm nodule on the pancreatic head was excised at operation. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed that this tumor was a glucagon-producing adenoma. This may be the smallest glucagonoma detected by image diagnostics that has been reported in the English literature. Possible early detection of glucagonoma was discussed in this report.
