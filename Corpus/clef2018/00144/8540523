Isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas masquerading as a pancreatic mass. A 65-yr-old woman presented for evaluation of a pancreatic mass. She had been suffering from severe constitutional symptoms for 18 months those symptoms included weight loss, increasing fatigue, night sweats, and recurrent fever attacks up to 40 degrees C. Later, bluish subcutaneous nodules developed on her lower limbs. Laboratory tests yielded signs of chronic inflammation and impaired glucose tolerance with elevated serum insulin and glucagon concentrations. Skin biopsy revealed lobular panniculitis. Ultrasonography and a CT scan demonstrated enlargement of the pancreas, and endoscopic retrograde pancreaticography disclosed displacement and stenosis of the main pancreatic duct. The patient was referred for explorative laparotomy, which was highly suggestive of a malignant pancreatic tumor. However, histological examination of the resected pancreatic and peripancreatic mass revealed tuberculous pancreatitis. This form of isolated tuberculous pancreatitis, associated with lobular panniculitis and laboratory features consistent with a tumor of the endocrine pancreas, has not been reported previously. Active tuberculosis should be a leading differential diagnosis in a patient with an enlarged pancreas when the usual diagnostic reasoning does not yield conclusive results.
