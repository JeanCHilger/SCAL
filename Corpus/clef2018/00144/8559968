Carcinoma of the pancreatic head area. Diagnostic imaging: computed tomography. CT is at present considered the most accurate procedure in the staging of tumors of the pancreatic head area. Accuracy is based on a rigorous exam performed either with a conventional equipment or with spiral CT. Basic signs and symptoms and staging criteria according to TNM classification are analyzed. Comparison with other imaging methods is made based on a review of the literature. The role of a high resolution procedure is stressed especially in case of vascular infiltration, the determining factor to indicate resectability. In this respect CT is still to be considered the most reliable method.
