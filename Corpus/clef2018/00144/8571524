X-ray diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. Modern means and methods including ultrasonic scanning, computer-aided tomography and magnetic imaging, retrograde endoscopic cholangiopancreaticography give objective information about the type of changes in the pancreas in the majority of cases and help recognize diseases of this organ at comparatively early stages of their development, permit assessment of the extent of involvement, detection of complications, monitoring of the disease course, and prediction of its course and outcome. Today ultrasonic examination and x-ray computer-aided tomography are methods of choice in the diagnosis of pancreatitis. These methods help assess the depth and extent of the involvement, assess the type of changes, detect complications, monitor the disease course and treatment efficacy, carry out purposeful drainage, and predict the disease course. The potentialities of these two methods in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors are virtually equal. When ultrasonic scanning is ineffective, computer-aided tomography should be resorted to. In mechanical jaundice, if both the above methods fail to reveal the caise of gall duct obstruction, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography or transcutaneous transhepatic puncture of the biliferous duct is recommended.
