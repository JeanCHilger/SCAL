Computed tomography diagnosis of extranodal manifestations in malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The data of computed tomography (CT) were used to study the semiotics of extranodal manifestations in 78 patients with varying malignancy non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The most common lesions were found in the viscera: liver, spleen, peritoneum, omentum, pancreas, adrenals, mesentery. The CT pattern of these lesions is diverse, each site has its own specific features. Combining the clinical manifestations and CT signs of lesions to individual organs, recording the extent of lymphadenopathy will aid in establishing the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A lesion detected in some organs located both above and below the diaphragm is a typical feature of high-grade malignancy.
