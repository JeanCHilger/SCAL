Imaging methods in intensive care. Imaging procedures are important for diagnosis and surveillance of patients in intensive care units. Radiologic examination, ultrasound and echocardiography are of paramount importance because they can be done bedside. Portable chest x-ray examination is the procedure of choice for documentation of tubes, lines and devices, estimation of cardiopulmonary function, demonstration of pulmonary edema, ARDS pneumonia, atelectasis and pneumothorax Plainfilm radiologic imaging of the abdomen is indicated when perforation ileus or acute intestinal pseudoobstruction is suspected Echocardiography can give information about ventricular function, pericardial effusion, cardiac valves, functional importance and complications of myocardial infarction, and hemodynamic changes of pulmonary embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the method of choice when endocarditis, aortic dissection or cardiac thromboembolism is considered. Ultrasound can show many pathologic changes important for the management of intensive care patients concerning liver, gallbladder, bile duct, pancreas, kidney, spleen, pleural space and vessels. Other imaging procedures such as CT, methods of nuclear medicine, MRT, angiography etc. are done outside the intensive care unit and therefore need a more restricted indication.
