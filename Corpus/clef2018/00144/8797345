Dynamic MR and fat suppression imaging of pancreatic carcinoma. The usefulness of dynamic MR and fat suppression imaging was investigated in 19 patients with pancreatic duct cell carcinoma. In addition to conventional spin echo imaging, dynamic MR and fat suppression imaging were performed. These images were evaluated for the detectability of lesions. The detectability of lesions was classified as good, fair or poor. On T1 weighted images, 26% of cases were evaluated as "good" and 32% as "fair". On dynamic MRI, 69% of cases were evaluated as "good" and 26% of cases as "fair". On pre- and postcontrast fat suppression images, 32% and 28%, respectively, were evaluated as "good", and 47% and 39% as "fair". Neither T2 weighted images nor enhanced T1 weighted images were useful. Direct comparison between dynamic MR and fat suppression images was also done. In 42% of cases, dynamic MR was superior to fat suppression images and in 42%, dynamic MRI was equal to fat suppression. In 16% of cases, fat suppression was superior to dynamic MRI. It was concluded that dynamic MR and fat suppression imaging were more useful than conventional spin echo imaging for the detection of pancreatic carcinoma.
