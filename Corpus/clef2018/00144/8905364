Endosonographic features of pancreatic metastases. Pancreatic metastasis is a rare event. Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases. The aim of this study was to describe the endosonographic features of pancreatic metastases.Among the 7000 endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examinations of the pancreas performed between 1989 and 1993, 7 were performed in patients with pancreatic metastases that were histologically confirmed (6 by surgery, 1 by CT biopsy). Videotapes of the EUS procedures were re-examined. Metastases were from four renal cell carcinomas, one ovary carcinoma, one chondrosarcoma, and one neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder.A solitary lesion was imaged by EUS in six cases and 10 lesions were seen in one case. Fifteen of 16 lesions were slightly hypoechoic or isoechoic in comparison with the adjacent pancreas. They were homogeneous, round, well circumscribed and were associated with an enhancement of the ultrasonic beam. The association of these ultrasonographic patterns was different from that usually observed in cases of primary pancreatic carcinoma. In one case (ovary carcinoma), the lesion was hypoechoic, with heterogeneous infiltration and indistinct margins and with the marked attenuation of the ultrasonic beam that is commonly noticed in primary pancreatic carcinoma or in focal chronic pancreatitis.Endosonographic features of pancreatic metastasis are usually different from those observed in cases of pancreatic carcinoma.
