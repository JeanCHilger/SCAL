Paraplegia following coeliac plexus block by anterior approach under direct vision. We report here a case of paraplegia following coeliac plexus block by anterior approach under direct vision. Laparotomy was performed in a 62-year-old male patient with pancreatic cancer. Coeliac plexus block was undertaken in order to control his back pain, since the tumor was unresectable. The patient complained of numbness and weakness of his legs 14 hours later. The consequence of neurological events was diagnosed as ischemic infarct of the spinal cord by myelo-CT and MRI. He died of pancreatic cancer without recovery of neurological disturbances 4 months after the surgery. As demonstrated in this case, even when coeliac plexus block was performed by open anterior approach under direct vision, paraplegia might be a possible complication due to the anatomical proximity of coeliac plexus to the Adamkiewicz's artery.
