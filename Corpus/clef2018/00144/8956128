Small bowel neoplastic disease: demonstration by MRI. This study demonstrates the appearance of small bowel tumors on MR images. Sixteen patients with tumors involving small bowel were studied by MRI. All tumors were proven with histopathology. Eleven patients had primary tumors of the small bowel, which included the following: four carcinoid tumors, three adenocarcinomas, two lymphomas, one leiomyosarcoma, and one leiomyoma. Five patients had recurrent or metastatic disease to small bowel: two patients had colon cancer, one patient had pancreatic cancer, one patient had uterine leiomyosarcoma, and one patient had chloroma (leukemia). MR examination included breath-hold T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (all patients), immediate postgadolinium-spoiled gradient echo (10 patients), and 2 to 4 minutes postgadolinium T1-weighted, fat-suppressed images (all patients). Tumor size, local extent, signal intensity, and enhancement features of tumor and adjacent tissue were determined. Tumor ranged in diameter from 1 to 9 cm (mean, 4.0 cm). Tumors had similar signal intensity to normal small bowel on precontrast images. Fourteen malignant tumors showed heterogeneous enhancement greater than adjacent bowel on gadolinium-enhanced images. Tumor local extent was best shown on precontrast-spoiled gradient-echo images and postgadolinium T1-weighted fat-suppressed images. Image quality was most consistent on breath-hold images. The results of this study show that small bowel tumors are demonstrable on MR images. Precontrast breath-hold T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo images and gadolinium-enhanced fat suppressed images demonstrate tumor extent most reliably.
