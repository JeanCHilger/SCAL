Omental caking in Hodgkin's disease. Computed tomography findings. Neoplastic infiltration of the greater omentum is most commonly caused by metastatic ovarian, gastric, colonic, or pancreatic carcinoma. Because the omentum lacks lymphoid elements, lymphomatous infiltration is uncommon. To date, omental involvement by lymphoma has been reported exclusively in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In this report, the computed tomography findings of omental caking caused by Hodgkin's lymphoma are described. Although rare, both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas should be included in the differential diagnosis of omental caking.
