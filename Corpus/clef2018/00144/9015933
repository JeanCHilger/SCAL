Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumours of the pancreas. Clinical and radiological aspects. Intraductal papillary-mucinous tumours are rare epithelial tumours with all intermediate types occurring from papillary to mucin-hypersecreting forms. They affects generally old men and recurring pancreatitis is the main clinical feature. Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatography is the best diagnostic method, showing large dilatation of the ducts and filling defects due to mucin's plugs or papillary tumour. IPMT are slow-growing and have low malignant potential as to far, surgical resection is considered mandatory, however, better distinction between benign and malignant evolution will probably select cases in which conservative follow-up may be proposed.
