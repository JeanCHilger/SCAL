Splenic hamartoma associated with thrombocytopenia. A case of splenic hamartoma associated with thrombocytopenia is reported. A 70-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of carcinoma of the body of the pancreas. Hematological examination disclosed thrombocytopenia and elevated serum CA19-9 and Span-1 levels. In addition to typical findings of pancreatic carcinoma, a solid mass was observed in the spleen by imaging procedures. On ultrasonography, the splenic mass was well demarcated and slightly hypoechoic. Computed tomography demonstrated a homogeneous low-density mass 5 cm in diameter. On T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, the splenic mass was demonstrated as low intensity and high intensity, respectively. On selective angiography, the tumor was hypervascular. Distal pancreatectomy plus splenectomy was performed. Microscopically, the splenic tumor consisted of red pulp tissue and was diagnosed as splenic hamartoma.
