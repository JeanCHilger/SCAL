Traumatic pancreatic duct rupture in a child diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. We report on a child who sustained blunt abdominal trauma with pancreatic duct rupture diagnosed by preoperative endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). Duct laceration remained undiagnosed by computerized tomography or ultrasonography. Preoperative ERP is the only known method for the accurate diagnosis of injury to main pancreatic duct. Even in children with pancreatic trauma we recommend ERP before any surgery is attempted to help in decisions on operative strategy.
