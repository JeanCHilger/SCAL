Selective embolization of ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the duodeno-pancreatic arcade disclosing infectious endocarditis. The authors report a case of rupture of a mycotic aneurysm of the duodenal pancreatic arcade in a 68 year old man presenting with shock, abdominal pain and rigidity, complicating a case of infectious endocarditis. Emergency treatment consisted of selective embolisation with a coil. This treatment, proposed in view of the clinical condition of the patient and the anatomical particularity of the regional arterial vascularisation, may be a valuable alternative to classical surgery in this type of pathology.
