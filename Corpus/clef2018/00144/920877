Pancreatic cancer screening. Analysis of the problem and the role of radionuclide imaging. The clinical, surgical, and pathologic findings in a five year prospective study of 192 patients referred with a high probability of pancreatic cancer are reported. We have defined the requirements of any pancreatic imaging procedure as its ability to distinguish a normal pancreas from pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis and the capability of detecting tumors less than 5 cm in diameter. There was a 47 percent incidence of pancreatic disease (27 percent pancreatic cancer and 20 percent chronic pancreatitis). Prospective radionuclide imaging as routinely performed was found to be of little clinical value in this patient population it was neither specific nor sensitive to pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis. Preliminary data with longitudinal multiplane emission tomography show an improved diagnostic accuracy and the ability to detect resectable tumors, but its efficacy needs to be prospectively compared with other screening tests on a carefully defined patient population.
