Papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas: a description of two clinical cases. Papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is a rare neoplasm principally effecting women in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life. It is considered a low grade malignancy due to it's favourable prognosis and the rarity of metastatic diffusion. Pre-operative diagnosis is rare due to the similarity with other cystic pancreatic lesions. It is for this reason that definitive diagnosis is made at histologic examination of the surgical specimen and total surgical excision represents the therapy of choice. The authors herein describe 2 cases of papillary-cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, thus bringing the total number of cases reported in the world literature to 294.
