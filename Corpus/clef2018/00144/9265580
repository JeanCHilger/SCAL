Macrocystic serous cystadenoma of the pancreas. Diagnostic, therapeutic and pathological considerations of three cases. Macrocystic serous cystadenoma (MSC) of the pancreas is a new entity that has recently been well recognised. This tumour is quite similar in aspect to the mucinous cystic tumours (MCT) but its prognosis is much better, so that a correct diagnosis before surgery is important.Three patients undergoing surgery in the 1st Surgical Clinic of the University of Bologna for suspected cystic lesions were found to have macrocystic serous cystadenoma (MSC) of the pancreas. In two cases a biopsy was performed during surgery, but in only one was a correct diagnosis of MSC made in the other the diagnosis was lymphangioma. In the remaining case a biopsy was not performed because the high 19/9 CA level in the blood suggested a diagnosis of MCT of the pancreas. In all 3 cases the tumour was successfully removed by surgery.Macrocystic serous cystadenoma (MSC) of the pancreas represents a variant of the serous cystic tumors, which encompass microcystic adenoma and serous cystadenocarcinoma. MSC must be distinguished from MCT because it exhibits a different biological pattern and requires a different surgical approach. Therefore, we would underline the importance of a biopsy in making the differential diagnosis.
