Embolization for massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage from adrenal pheochromocytoma: a case report. A 68-year-old woman was found crouching in the kitchen with severe upper abdominal pain. She entered a state of shock at our emergency clinic. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a 3 cm cystic mass dorsal to the pancreas tail accompanied with a hematoma. On angiography, a bleeding from the left middle adrenal artery was identified and embolized for hemostasis. An operation was performed 3.5 months after embolization. Preoperative evaluation showed the tumor to be endocrinologically inactive. Metoclopramide stimulation test was negative, too. Left adrenalectomy was performed uneventfully without intraoperative increase in blood pressure. However, histopathological diagnosis was pheochromocytoma. Transarterial embolization is an effective treatment for adrenal bleeding. In our case, however, embolization might have caused the tumor to be falsely "endocrinologically inactive".
