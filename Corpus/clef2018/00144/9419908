Pancreatic cancer and tumor markers: role of the newly identified CAR-3 antigen. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical usefulness of the serum assay for CAR-3 in the diagnosis and follow-up of pancreatic cancer.Serum levels of tumor markers (CAR-3, Ca 19.9, Ca 195 and CEA) were measured in a total of 238 patients with various diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including 61 pancreatic cancers. Cut-off levels were calculated on the basis of a non-parametric estimate of 90% specificity. After surgery, patients with pancreatic cancer underwent a combined serological and radiological (CT-scan) follow-up.At the cut-off level of 6.15 U/L, the sensitivity of CAR-3 was 62.3% (CA 19.9: 77% Ca 195: 75.4%CAR-3 is shed in the circulating stream in a much lower proportion of cases than that observed for antigen expression at immunohistochemistry. During the follow-up CT-scan was the most accurate diagnostic tool. However, the meagre therapeutical options for recurrent pancreatic cancer, do not justify such an aggressive follow-up.Ca 19.9 remains the tumor marker of choice for either the pre-operative work-up or the post-surgical follow-up of patients with pancreatic cancer.
