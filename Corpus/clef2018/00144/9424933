Comparison of the usefulness of ultrasonography and computed tomography in diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound and computed tomography imaging in necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Since 01'95 till 12'96 we treated 36 patients with acute pancreatitis. They were diagnosed by US and contrast enhanced CT. 15 patients were intraoperatively classified as necrotizing pancreatitis. US done several times before operations positively predicted only 8 cases as having necrosis (sensitivity 53.3%) and in 7 patients the extension of its spread (specificity 87.5%). Preoperative CT positively predicted 13 cases of necrosis (sensitivity 86.6%) and the extension of its spread was properly stated in 7 patients (sensitivity 46.6%). 4 times preoperative CT was done twice. Contrast enhanced CT is better than US in predicting of the existence of pancreatic necrosis but it is not in evaluation of the extension of necrosis spread.
