Magnetic resonance imaging in evaluation of the common bile duct. The ideal method for evaluation of the common bile duct (CBD) before or during cholecystectomy remains controversial. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is a new, promising technique. A prospective evaluation is reported.Sixty-one patients (45 women) were studied by MRC. There were 29 patients with symptomatic gallstone disease and without clinical, biochemical or ultrasonographic evidence of CBD stones (group 1) 28 of them also underwent intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). In addition, there were 21 patients with symptomatic gallstone disease, with mild biochemical and ultrasonographic signs of CBD involvement (group 2), of whom 19 underwent IOC, and 11 patients with symptomatic CBD stones (group 3), nine of whom had preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) following MRC.MRC showed that no patient in group 1 and three patients in group 2 had CBD stones. Three patients (one in group 1, two in group 2) did not undergo IOC because of technical or clinical problems. In group 3, ERCP confirmed the results of MRC in nine patients. Two patients underwent open surgery because of ultrasonographic, MRC and radiographic signs of pancreatic malignancy.MRC could replace IOC and ERCP for identification of asymptomatic CBD stones. In symptomatic patients MRC combined with other non-invasive imaging techniques can direct the surgeon to appropriate management.
