Primary pancreatic lymphoma. Primary pancreatic lymphoma is a rare neoplasm that may be confused with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We reviewed retrospectively our contemporary experience with this disease to define more clearly the clinical presentation of this disease and the proper role for percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy and surgery.From 1980 to 1995, 11 patients with primary pancreatic lymphoma were treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Patient demographics, radiographic studies, fine-needle aspiration biopsy findings, operative procedures, and other treatment data were reviewed.The median age of the 11 patients was 64 years (range, 37 to 74 years). Abdominal pain was the most common symptom at presentation. Five patients had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and only two patients had hyperbilirubinemia. Computed tomography scan demonstrated encasement of the superior mesenteric artery or superior mesenteric-portal vein confluence in six patients. Seven patients underwent computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration five had findings of lymphoma. Two patients underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and one underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. All patients were treated with combination chemotherapy, and seven received radiotherapy. Only two patients have died of disease (12 and 16 months after diagnosis) at a median follow-up time of 67 months.In the majority of patients, pancreatic lymphoma can be distinguished from pancreatic adenocarcinoma on the basis of symptoms, laboratory and radiographic findings, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy results. Once the diagnosis is established, all patients should undergo systemic chemotherapy followed by involved-field radiotherapy if the tumor has not been resected.
