Diagnosis of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction: value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (a long common channel), with or without congenital choledochal cyst, is frequently associated with biliary tract carcinoma. We assessed the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for patients with anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (PBJ).In 159 adult patients with pancreatobiliary disease, breath-hold (1 to 18 seconds) MRCP was performed according to a half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence. In all patients the length of the common channel demonstrated by MRCP was compared with that demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. In 11 patients with anomalous PBJ (the common channel > or = 15 mm on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography), the diagnostic accuracy of MRCP for associated biliary diseases was evaluated.No complications were encountered in performing MRCP. On MRCP, the length of the common channel was calculated to be 15 mm or longer in nine (82%) of 11 patients with anomalous PBJ. In patients with normal PBJ, MRCP identified PBJ with the channel measuring 0 mm in length. MRCP allowed detailed visualization of congenital choledochal cyst (all seven patients) but failed to depict carcinoma (one patient) and mucosal hyperplasia (five patients) of the gallbladder.MRCP is a noninvasive and accurate imaging method for diagnosing anomalous PBJ and congenital choledochal cyst.
