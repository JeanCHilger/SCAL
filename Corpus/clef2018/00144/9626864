Can MRCP replace ERCP? Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has replaced direct cholangiography and pancreatography in many instances. Its complete noninvasiveness and flexibility are less onerous for patients. For the use of screening as well as scrutiny, MRCP has played an important role in diagnosing various pathologies in this field. The usefulness of MRCP is not limited to anatomical evaluations it can also yield physiologic and functional information. From a cost-performance basis, MRCP is undoubtedly superior to direct methods. Coupled with a cutting-edge MR system, MRCP has the potential to limit the use of invasive transpapillary and percutaneous methods merely to interventional purposes. In the near future, the emergence of interventional MR scanners will make MRCP even more competitive, and the replacement will be accelerated.
