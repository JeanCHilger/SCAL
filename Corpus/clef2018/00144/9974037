Laparoscopy and laparoscopic echography in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. The potentials of laparoscopy (LS) and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) in diagnosing pancreatic diseases are assayed. The study covers forty-five patients of which 36 presenting carcinoma of the pancreas, and nine-acute peritonitis. APUD (VIP) is documented in one case. For the purpose laparoscope R. Wolf and 7.5 MHz echolaparoscopic linear probe obtained from the Aloka company are employed. The LUS technique used in pancreatic diseases is described in details. In the group of pancreatic carcinoma patients 72.2 per cent prove to be inoperable. Emphasis is laid on the superiorities of LUS over transabdominal echography and laparoscopy in diagnosing, staging and resectability evaluation of pancreatic carcinomas, as well as in terms of establishing the indications and practicability of the procedure in acute pancreatitis. LS and LUS are the only preoperative alternative to intraoperative echography, since imaging, endoscopic and histomorphological diagnostic methods are combined. LS in conjunction with LUS are no longer considered as a synonym of peritoneoscopy which in turn, considerably augments the possibilities of the method in handling diseases of the pancreas.
