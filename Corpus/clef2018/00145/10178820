MR cholangiopancreatography challenges invasive methods. To gain acceptance, MRCP must accurately visualize both normal and abnormal biliary and pancreatic ducts. Imaging of the non-dilated system remains a technical challenge due to the small caliber of normal ducts. Using either nonbreath-hold or breath-hold techniques, however, the normal common bile duct can be visualized in as many as 98% of patients.
