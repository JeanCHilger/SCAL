Endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration for the evaluation of pancreatic masses. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) are accurate for the preoperative staging of pancreatic ductal carcinoma.Retrospective medical record review.A prospective registry of 98 patients having EUS-FNA for peripancreatic masses from April 1994 to April 1998 was analyzed.The accuracy of EUS-FNA for preoperative diagnosis and staging of peripancreatic neoplasms.Ninety-eight patients, aged 41 to 91 years (mean age, 67 years) with peripancreatic masses were evaluated by EUS-FNA. All patients had initial computed tomography scanning with a mass seen in 49 patients, "fullness" to the pancreas in 28 patients, and no mass seen in 21 patients. Evaluation with EUS-FNA revealed 22 benign lesions, 18 T2 masses, 37 T3 masses, 1 T4 mass, and 20 masses representing nonpancreatic tumors. Results of EUS-FNA of adjacent lymph nodes were positive in 27 patients. Twenty-seven patients had surgical resection or palliation permitting operative and pathologic staging. On comparison of EUS-FNA staging with surgical staging, 12 patients were the same stage, 14 patients were upstaged, and 1 patient was downstaged. The remaining patients who did not have surgery have been followed up for a mean of 15 months. Overall accuracy of EUS-FNA for differentiating benign from malignant masses was 96%.Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is a useful technique for the evaluation of pancreatic masses. It is highly accurate for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions and for predicting T stage, but is limited for predicting nodal status.
