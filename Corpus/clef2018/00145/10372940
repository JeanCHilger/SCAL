Autoimmune pancreatitis, pancreatic mass, and lower gastrointestinal bleed. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIMP) is a recently described clinical entity causing chronic pancreatitis. It often presents with diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and/or a focal mass at the head of the pancreas causing common bile duct obstruction and jaundice. In most instances, AIMP is mistaken for pancreatic cancer. A number of laboratory abnormalities such as positive antinuclear antibody, hypergammaglobulinemia, and antibody to carbonic anhydrase are often present in these patients. Currently, pancreatic biopsy demonstrating characteristic histopathologic changes is essential to establish the diagnosis. We report the first case of AIMP presenting as a pancreatic tail mass and lower gastrointestinal bleed.
