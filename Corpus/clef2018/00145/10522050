Experience with intraarterial infusion of styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin (SMANCS)-lipiodol in pancreatic cancer. A 54 year-old man was admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with inoperable cancer in the body and tail of the pancreas. The spleen was embolized at its hilum with a coil to infuse an anti-tumor agent selectively into the pancreatic parenchyma and transcatheter intraarterial infusion (TAI) of styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin (SMANCS)-Lipiodol, 3 mg, was performed. The computed tomography (CT) scan taken immediately after TAI revealed the incorporation of SMANCS-Lipiodol into the site of the pancreatic tail. At 2 weeks, a small amount of SMANCS-Lipiodol remained and clearness of the tumor margin was lacking in the pancreatic tail, but no remarkable change was noted in the body. As for the laboratory data, pancreatic enzyme level was not elevated immediately after TAI. At 2 weeks, tumor markers showed improvement in CEA (3.9-->2.6 ng/ml) and Elastase 1 (370-->230 ng/ml), but little change was seen in CA 19-9 (1600 U/ml: no change) and DUPAN-2 (730-->740 U/ml). In pancreatic cancer, SMANCS-Lipiodol could be infused from the splenic artery into the pancreatic parenchyma by the splenic arterial embolization.
