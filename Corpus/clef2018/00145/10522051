Intra-pancreatic rupture of the bile duct. Injury of the bile duct after blunt trauma is rare but injury and rupture of the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct is extremely rare. Injury is very difficult to recognize even if explorative laparotomy is done. Elevation of the liver tests, especially gamma GT and alkaline phosphatase, is very often the first sign of injury. When jaundice occurs the diagnostic procedures of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) must be done. If there is no sign of great injury to the head of the pancreas we have to perform normal biliary flow. Here we report a rare case of intrapancreatic rupture of the common bile duct without high degree of pancreatic injury after blunt injury. Cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed.
