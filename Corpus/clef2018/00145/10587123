Imaging-guided percutaneous biopsy of focal splenic lesions: update on safety and effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous imaging-guided biopsy in the diagnosis of focal splenic lesions.From May 1995 to November 1997, 20 imaging-guided biopsies of focal splenic lesions were performed in 18 patients, including seven patients with a prior diagnosis of extrasplenic malignancy (breast cancer, n = 3 lymphoma, n = 2A specific diagnosis was made in 16 (88.9%) of 18 patients, and no complications occurred. Malignancy was diagnosed in six patients including three patients with lymphoma. Benign conditions were diagnosed in 10 patients: a cyst in two patients hamartoma in oneImaging-guided splenic biopsy is a safe technique that provides a specific diagnosis in most patients with focal splenic lesions.
