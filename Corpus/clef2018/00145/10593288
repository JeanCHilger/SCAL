Imaging features of pancreatoblastoma: a case report. We present a patient with pancreatoblastoma along with a discussion of various cross-sectional imaging features. The tumor was a large multilocular cystic mass with solid components in the left retroperitoneal space. There were fine internal echoes on ultrasonography, and the signal intensity was high on both T1- and T2-weighted MR images in most of the locules, suggesting the presence of hemorrhagic debris. Among the various retroperitoneal organs displaced by the tumor, only the pancreatic tail was inseparable from the mass, suggesting that the pancreatic tail was the origin of the tumor. Pancreatoblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis when a large left upper quadrant mass with these imaging features is seen in infants and young children.
