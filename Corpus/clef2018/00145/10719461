Perfusion parameters in MRI diagnosis of pancreas transplants. Evaluation of the role of perfusion parameters in the detection of circulatory disturbance and chronic rejection in patients after pancreas transplantation.70 examinations of 39 patients after pancreas transplantation were performed. Using a dynamic gadolinium-enhanced Turbo-FLASH-sequence, we evaluated the perfusion parameters in a group of patients with chronic rejection, with circulatory disturbance, and in a control group with normal organ function.There were statistically significant differences of the perfusion parameters in patients with chronic rejection and circulatory disturbance compared to the control group.Dynamic MRI can help detect patients with chronic rejection and circulatory disturbance and should therefore be part of the routine follow-up in patients after pancreas transplantation.
