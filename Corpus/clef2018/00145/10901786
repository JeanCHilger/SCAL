Aneurysm of the duodeno-pancreatic arcades. Diagnostic imagery and therapeutic indications. Aneurysms of the duodenopancreatic arcades account for 2 to 3% of all aneurysms of the digestive arteries. Mortality is high due to the risk of rupture and the difficult diagnostic situation.The first case involved a short wide collar aneurysm implanted on the first centimeter of the superior mesenteric artery, associated with tight stenosis of the celiac trunk. The patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain and was treated surgically. In the second case, there was a false aneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery which developed a few months after acute biliary pancreatitis. The aneurysm was treated by exclusion using a transcutaneously delivered endovascular coil prosthesis.These cases illustrate the importance of imaging (magnetic resonance angiography) both for diagnosis and treatment monitoring, allowing early care with very limited morbidity and mortality.
