Method for dissection of mesenteric metastases in mid-gut carcinoid tumors. With adequate medical management the midgut carcinoid tumor generally is an indolent malignancy associated with substantial life expectancy and appreciable life quality, even in the presence of liver metastases and significant tumor burden. Abdominal complications may occur in this entity of carcinoids owing to entrapment of intestines and encasement of mesenteric vessels by mesenteric metastases and associated marked mesenteric fibrosis. This may be the cause of abdominal pain, disabling diarrhea, weight loss to the extent of malnutrition, and eventually the risk of death with acute or chronic intestinal obstruction or intestinal gangrene. Operative removal of the mesentericointestinal lesion is often indicated to prevent or treat these complications but may be technically difficult when mesenteric metastases extend in the vicinity of major vessels in the mesenteric root. At laparotomy 56 patients with advanced midgut carcinoids underwent removal of the mesenteric tumor with a method for preserving the mesenteric vessels. This was feasible by mobilizing and releasing the right colon and mesenteric root from posterior adhesions, identifying the mesenteric artery below the pancreas, and free-dissecting this artery on the tumor capsule in the mobilized mesentery. Dissection was successful even with tumors initially judged inoperable unless tumor growth completely surrounded the mesenteric vessels or extended retroperitoneally. One patient was subjected to distal intestinal artery bypass. Symptom relief was been substantial and often of long duration after mesenteric tumor removal in patients who prior to surgery often had threatening intestinal ischemia. Patients with advanced midgut carcinoids may benefit markedly from dissectional removal of mesenteric tumors, which (conceivably better than conventional wedge resection) preserves the length of the remaining intestine.
