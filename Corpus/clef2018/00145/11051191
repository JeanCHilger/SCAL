Laparoscopic cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst: a case report. A 49-year-old man with a history of acute pancreatitis was hospitalized with a diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging all demonstrated a homogeneous cyst, 9 x 4 cm in size, at the tail of the pancreas without mural nodules or septa. Because an intestinal structure was identified between the cyst and stomach preoperatively by computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography, laparoscopic cystogastrostomy was carried out instead of percutaneous or endoscopic cyst drainage. The cyst was exposed by dissecting the lesser omentum and found to have no adhesion to the surrounding tissues. Anastomosis was performed using an endoscopic linear stapler via small cystotomy and gastrotomy openings on the lesser curvature, which were then sutured laparoscopically. The postoperative course was uneventful. Laparoscopic surgery is recommended as a safe, reliable, and minimally invasive treatment for managing pancreatic pseudocyst.
