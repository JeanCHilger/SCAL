Pain at 24 hours associated with amylase levels greater than 5 times the upper normal limit as the most reliable indicator of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The frequency of post-ERCP/sphincterotomy pancreatitis is between 1.3% and 7.6% in prospective studies. This range likely reflects differences in definitions of pancreatitis and methods of data collection.To identify clinical findings and enzymatic values consistent for clinical pancreatitis at 24 hours, the post-ERCP/sphincterotomy course of 1185 procedures was prospectively recorded. Patients were evaluated for pancreatic-type pain, white blood cell count, and serum amylase before and 24 hours after the procedure pain and amylase levels were also recorded 6 to 8 hours after the procedure. CT was performed in all patients with pain associated with amylase levels greater than 3 times normal. All patients were evaluated clinically at 48 hours.Pancreatic-type pain never occurred in cases with amylase levels lower than 3 times normal it was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with amylase levels greater than 5 times normal, either 6 to 8 hours or 24 hours after the procedure. Leukocytosis and CT findings consistent with pancreatitis were observed only in patients (41.7% and 29.5%, respectively) with 24-hour amylase levels greater than 5 times normal. None of the 18 patients with pain at 24 hours and serum amylase lower than 5 times normal had symptoms that persisted at 48 hours. Twenty-five (41.7%) of the 60 patients with pain at 24 hours and amylase higher than 5 times normal had 48-hour pain at 48 hours and hyperamylasemia.Features consistent with clinical pancreatitis were present only among patients with pancreatic-type pain at 24 hours and amylase levels higher than 5 times normal. Additional follow-up is required for these patients.
