Imaging techniques in patients with biliary obstruction. The most frequent causes of cholestasis include choledocholithiasis and neoplasms (pancreatic head carcinoma, ampullary carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma). The authors discussed imaging modalities currently applied in the diagnostics of patients with suspected obstruction biliary tract obstruction. Special attention was paid to the efficacy of these techniques in detecting the obstruction and determining its level and nature. In general, US or CT are first performed in patients with cholestasis. The use of percutaneous cholangiography and retrograde cholangiopancreatography is often limited to therapeutic interventions. Magnetic resonance offers images similar to both conventional cholangiography and computed tomography. This technique offers complex evaluation of bile ducts and other abdominal organs.
