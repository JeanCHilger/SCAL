Internal drainage into an Onlay-Roux-en-Y jejunal loop in isolated pancreatic injury with ductal transection: short-term and long-term follow-up in two pediatric cases. Two pediatric cases of isolated pancreatic injury treated by internal drainage into an Onlay-Roux-en-Y jejunal loop are reported. The discussion concerns the difficulties of early diagnosis, the importance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in surgery and the reasons for the choice of internal drainage by Onlay-Roux-en-Y jejunal loop in our two cases.
