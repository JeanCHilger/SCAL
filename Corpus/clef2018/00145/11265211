Metachronous pancreatic metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma. 3 new cases. We report two males and one female, aged 71, 81 and 73 years old respectively, previously operated of a renal cell carcinoma. During the follow up of the 71 years old male, the CAT scan showed three lesions in the pancreas. Also, the CAT scan in the female showed one lesion in the tail of the pancreas. The 81 years old male was admitted to the emergency room due to a upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy showed a proliferating lesion in the second portion of the duodenum whose biopsy showed a clear cell carcinoma. The CAT scan showed also a tumoral mass in the head of the pancreas. All three patients were subjected to surgical resection of the tumors without postoperative complications or mortality.
