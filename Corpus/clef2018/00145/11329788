A case of successful management of nonresectable pancreas cancer with liver metastasis by intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with angiotensin-II and administration of tegafur/uracil. Nontypical chemotherapy regimens exist for advanced pancreatic cancer. We herein report a 62-year-old man whose nonresectable pancreatic cancer was treated effectively with a new method of intra-arterial regional chemotherapy with angiotensin-II (AT-II). The patient was admitted to our hospital with obstructive jaundice and anorexia. He was diagnosed as having inoperable advanced pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis. Enteric-coated tegafur/uracil (400 mg) was administered for 3 weeks. Simultaneously, intraarterial infusion with 5-fluorouracil (500 mg) and infusion of methotrexate (100 mg) with 50 micrograms of AT-II was given every week. A catheter connected to a subcutaneously implanted port system was placed into the common hepatic artery. As a result of this treatment, the maximum diameter of the pancreatic tumor decreased from 3 cm to 2 cm on the CT-scan. Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) decreased from 24,000 U/ml to 186 U/ml. Moreover, the performance status of patient also improved, and he was discharged from our hospital despite his terminal cancer. This regimen could well be effective in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer.
