Achieving eugastrinaemia in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: resection or enucleation? Eugastrinaemia in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can be an elusive goal, nearly one third of laparotomies failing to detect the tumour.A personal series of 13 patients with a mean age of 52 years operated between 1980 and 1996 was reviewed retrospectively. All patients had fasting hypergastrinaemia and recalcitrant ulcer disease with or without diarrhoea.Computed tomography or selective visceral angiography localised the tumour to the pancreas in 6 of 12 elective patients the thirteenth presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer. All underwent laparotomy with gastrinoma tissue being completely excised in every case, including the 6 patients with failed pre-operative localisation whose tumours arose from the duodenum (4), pancreas (1) and lymph node (1). Eugastrinaemia was achieved in all but 1 patient and was sustained during a mean follow-up of 5.2 years (SD = 4.2 years). These 12 patients remained clinically free of disease during a mean clinical follow-up of 7.5 years (SD = 5.0 yearsSince normalisation of serum gastrin was achieved in 12 of 13 patients, laparotomy may well be worthwhile even if the gastrinoma cannot be localised pre-opera- tively.
