Ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography changes the standard in pancreas diagnosis. Since the introduction of MRI, including imaging of the hepato-pancreatic duct system (MRCP) and 3D-MR angiography (3D-MRA), new pancreatic diagnostic procedures have been developed.We report on 143 patients with benign and malignant diseases of the pancreas, who only received MRI preoperatively. All radiologic findings were confirmed intraoperatively.For resectability, MRI obtained sensitivity of 96.0% and specificity of 89.5% and for classification sensitivity of 99.1% and specificity of 95.2%.Based on our experience, the benign vs malignant nature of the disease, MRI is a safe and reliable method for pancreatic tumors being able to become the standard diagnostic procedure in the future.
