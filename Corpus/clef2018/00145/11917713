Comparative study between magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the diagnosis of the pancreatic and biliary obstruction. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were methods used for diagnosis of the diseases in the biliary and pancreatic ducts.Compare the diagnostic concordance among, analyzing sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy.There were 41 patients in the studied group, divided in two groups: I--without biliary or pancreatic tract obstruction, and II--with obstruction. Group II was further divided in A--obstruction due to lithiasis, and B--due to other causes.Concordance between the two methods was found in 67% in group I and 82% in group II. Sensitivity of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was 94% and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was 89%. Specificity of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was 100% and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was 67%. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography positive predictive value was 93%, the negative predictive value was 50% and the accuracy was 85%.Both methods showed the same sensitivity.
