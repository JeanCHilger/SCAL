Preoperative laparoscopic examination using surgical manipulation and ultrasonography for pancreatic lesions. Unnecessary laparotomies in patients with advanced pancreatic disease are unlikely to provide any benefits and may compromise both the quality and duration of survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound to the diagnosis or staging, or both, of pancreatic lesions.Fifty-two patients were diagnosed preoperatively with pancreatic cancer. The diagnoses made by laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) were compared with those made prior to the operation. Laparoscopic visualization of the body of the pancreas was obtained via an infragastric approach. For the laparoscopic examination of the head of the pancreas, a retroduodenal approach was used.In 52 patients with cancer of the pancreatic head and body, unresectable findings were observed in 13 patients. Portal vein displacement without other unresectable findings was evident in six patients using LUS, and was confirmed at exploratory laparotomy in five patients. The surgical approaches were changed, with seven patients undergoing an open exploration for biliary drainage and the other six patients receiving endoscopic endoprostheses. In six of the 52 patients, LUS-guided needle biopsies and frozen-section examinations detected chronic pancreatitis (n = 4), a malignant lymphoma (n = 1), and an abdominal tuberculosis (n = 1), which were diagnosed preoperatively as pancreatic cancers and cysts. Only one patient undergoing the laparoscopic procedure had acute pancreatitis this patient was treated conservatively.LUS, when combined with laparoscopic manipulations, may overcome many of the limitations of laparoscopy alone in the investigation of pancreatic lesions by providing an accurate diagnosis and assessment of the size and extent of the local dissemination.
