Pancreatic epithelial cyst in an adult treated by central pancreatectomy. The infrequent occurrence of benign epithelial cysts of the pancreas is the reason why little is known regarding their clinical relevance and surgical management. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman with a benign epithelial cyst that was resected by the rarely performed central pancreatectomy. The presentation, evaluation, and differences between this and other cystic lesions of the pancreas are discussed. The benefits of central pancreatectomy for this benign lesion are reviewed.
