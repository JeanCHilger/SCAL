Power Doppler ultrasonography for the assessment of vascular invasion by pancreatic cancer. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of power Doppler ultrasonography (US) in assessing the vascular invasion by pancreatic cancer.A prospective study of 40 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer (head 35, body 5) was performed. All patients underwent surgery. The relationships between tumor and each vessel were classified into four types according to the closest circumferential contact of the tumor with the vessel. A type 0 indicated no contact type 1 indicated less than one third contactPortal vein invasion was confirmed in resected specimens in 23 cases and by operative findings in 5 cases. For the diagnosis of portal vein invasion, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of power Doppler US were, respectively, 79.3, 90.9, and 82.5%. The respective values were 79.3, 100, and 85% for CT and 72.4, 81.8, and 75% for angiography. For the diagnosis of arterial invasion, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of power Doppler US were 80, 92, and 90%, respectively. The corresponding values were 47, 88, and 73% for CT and 47, 100, and 80% for angiography.Power Doppler US proved to be useful for the diagnosis of vascular invasion by pancreatic cancer.
