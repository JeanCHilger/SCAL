MR imaging of ampullary carcinomas. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the appearance of ampullary carcinomas on MR images.Sixteen patients with ampullary carcinomas underwent MR imaging. Tumor detectability, signal intensity of the tumor, and enhancement pattern on dynamic study were analyzed. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings were assessed and were compared with the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) findings.Signal intensities of the tumor on each image were various. Dynamic study detected all tumors except one, and all detected tumors showed delayed enhancement. MRCP delineated more than half of the tumors as a filling defect within the duodenal fluid and clearly demonstrated pancreaticobiliary ductal.Dynamic study is mandatory in diagnosing ampullary carcinoma, because it can depict most of the tumors, and delayed enhancement of such tumors is characteristic in case of ampullary carcinoma. MRCP can provide reliable information about pancreaticobiliary duct and it can replace diagnostic ERCP.
