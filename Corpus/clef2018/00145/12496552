Laparoscopic endogastric pseudocyst gastrostomy: a report of three cases. The transgastric pseudocyst-gastrostomy is the standard approach for internal drainage of persistent and large retrogastric pancreatic pseudocysts that complicate acute necrotizing pancreatitis. We report on the application of a laparoscopic endogastric approach for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and discuss the merits of this technique as well as of the other previously described minimally invasive approaches for the management of pancreatic pseudocysts. Between January 2001 and August 2001, three female patients presented with large symptomatic pseudocysts 3-10 months after an episode of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Internal drainage was effected by a laparoscopic endogastric pseudocyst gastrostomy, and the necrotic pancreas was debrided. There were no conversions and no postoperative complications. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (range, 3-5). All patients remain asymptomatic, and resolution of the pseudocyst was radiologically evident at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 4-11). The laparoscopic endogastric pseudocyst gastrostomy appears to be a safe and effective minimally invasive approach for internal drainage of large retrogastric pancreatic pseudocysts and facilitates debridement of the necrotic pancreas.
