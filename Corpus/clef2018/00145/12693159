Pancreatic tuberculosis. Tuberculosis infrequently involves pancreas. The clinical features in patients with pancreatic tuberculosis are usually non-specific. The radiological features mimic pancreatic malignancy or pancreatitis. Ultrasound or CT scan guided fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy may show caseating granulomatous inflammation. The present report includes two cases of pancreatic tuberculosis and review of relevant literature. One of our patients was diagnosed at laparotomy and the other with a CT scan guided fine needle aspiration cytology. Both patients responded well to anti tubercular chemotherapy and are now asymptomatic.
