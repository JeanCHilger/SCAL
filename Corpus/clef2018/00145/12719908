Tumor-associated focal chronic pancreatitis from invasion of the pancreatic duct by common bile duct carcinoma: radiologic-pathologic correlation. We report a case of tumor-associated focal chronic pancreatitis of the uncinate process of the pancreas. The chronic pancreatitis was secondary to stenosis of the main pancreatic duct from invasion by a common bile duct carcinoma. A feature distinguishing the chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma was the localized dilatation of pancreatic duct branches evident in the focal lesion of the uncinate process.
