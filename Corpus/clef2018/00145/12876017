MR imaging features of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas in adult and pediatric patients. This study was conducted to describe the MR imaging features of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas.Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas, a tumor typically seen in young women, is a large, well-defined, encapsulated lesion with heterogeneous high or low signal intensity on T1-weighted, heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted, and early peripheral heterogeneous enhancement with progressive fill-in on gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MR imaging. These features help differentiate this rare tumor from other pancreatic neoplasms.
