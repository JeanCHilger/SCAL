Endosonographically controlled transluminal fine needle aspiration biopsy: diagnostic quality by cytologic and histopathologic classification. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has emerged as a highly accurate technique for detecting and classifying mediastinal and pancreatic lesions as well as abdominal and recently retroperitoneal masses with a minimum of risk for the patient.To objectify these statements, we evaluated the quality of 72 EUS-FNA specimens by cytologic and histopathologic classification, investigated their contamination with tissue from the needle pathway and observed puncture-related complications in a retrospective study of 44 EUS-FNA in 41 consecutive patients (56 +/- 14 years, m = 24, f = 17 13 pancreatic, 9 adrenal, 6 abdominal and 13 mediastinal masses). EUS-FNA was performed using a PENTAX 32 UA endosonoscope (longitudinal 7.5 MHz sector array) in combination with a needle system type "Hancke-Vilmann".16 vs. 11 of 34 histopathologic and 38 cytologic specimens were classified "excellent", 7 vs. 10 "sufficient", 7 vs. 13 "poor" and 4 vs. 4 "failed". Analysis of contamination with tissue from the needle pathway showed 4 vs. 2 specimens "highly", 3 vs. 14 "clearly", 8 vs. 19 "slightly" and 19 vs. 3 "not" contaminated. Specimens classified "excellent" were less contaminated (p = 0,037). EUS-FNA identified 35 benign and 24 malignant masses. Definite diagnosis failed in 13 specimens. One nonfatal complication occurred. EUS-FNA is an accurate (89 %) and low-risk procedure to examine primary undiagnosed mediastinal, pancreatic, intraabdominal and especially adrenal lesions in most of the cases. Contamination with tissue from the needle pathway seems to be a major predictive factor of poor specimen quality and failed diagnosis.EUS-FNA expands the diagnostic approach of mediastinal, abdominal, pancreatic and adrenal masses and provides accurate specimens for reaching new differential-diagnostic competence, especially in endocrinologic cases.
