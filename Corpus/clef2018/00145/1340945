Computed tomography guided fine needle aspiration biopsies. Computed tomography (CT) allows the performance of fine needle aspiration biopsies in situations in which ultrasound or conventional X rays do not correctly visualize the lesion or the needle tract. One hundred four patients with a clinical suspicion of neoplasia were subjected to CT guided percutaneous aspiration biopsies in a lapse of 6 years. The most frequently biopsied organs were the lung (39.5%), liver and gallbladder (20.2%) and pancreas (15.4%). Forty nine percent of procedures were performed in the thorax and 51% in the abdomen. Of 51 patients with suspicion of thoracic cancer, there was only one false negative and no false positive results, with an overall accuracy of 98%. For abdominal procedures, there were no false positive results, although there were 6 false negative results, specially for pancreatic or retroperitoneal lesions. Overall accuracy for abdominal procedures was 88%. It is concluded that CT guided fine needle biopsy is a safe and accurate method for the diagnosis of thoracic and abdominal lesions.
