Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: ERCP as standard preoperative diagnostic technique. In a prospective study 250 patients with proven cholelithiasis and clinical, biochemical and ultrasound indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) and (if bile-duct stones had been shown) endoscopic papillotomy (EPT). The biliary system was demonstrated in 229 patients (91.6%). Biliary tract stones were confirmed in 18 of 68 patients in whom they had been suspected clinically. In addition, ERCP revealed small stones in the bile-duct in eight of 154 patients with normal biochemical results and unremarkable ultrasound imaging, and in seven patients bile-duct anomalies which required EPT or open cholecystectomy. However, in retrospect five of the patients with cystic duct anomalies could have been treated by LC. The complication rate of ERCP/EPT was 3.2%. It is concluded from these results that, in view of the cost and potential risk to the patient, ERCP before LC can be limited to patients suspected of having bile-duct stones, even though small stones may be missed.
