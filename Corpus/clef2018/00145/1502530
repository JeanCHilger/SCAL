Sonography of pancreatic cancer. The aim of this retrospective study was to test the quality of pancreatic sonography in a hospital without CT. Out of 25 patients 21 were assessable. We made the correct diagnosis in 76.2% (n = 16) of the cases. The tumour size was between 25 and 60 mm. 20 tumours showed a relatively hypoechoic mass. A dilatation of biliary ducts could be seen in 87.5%. Metastasis of lymph nodes we could only detect in 38.5%, liver metastases in 64.5%. The sensitivity increases with the experience of the examiner, but lot of time is necessary. It is difficult to make a differential diagnosis between carcinoma and pancreatitis. In this cases, CT shows better results. In spite of improvements in sonography, early cancer still is a diagnostic problem.
