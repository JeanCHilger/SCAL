Pancreatic tuberculosis: a rare cause of pseudoneoplastic obstructive jaundice. Isolated pancreatic tuberculosis is rare, and can mimic pancreatic carcinoma. We report a case of pseudoneoplastic pancreatic tuberculosis revealed by an obstructive jaundice in a 35-Year-old man. Surgical pancreatic histopathology showed a caseating granulomatous inflammation and diagnosis was confirmed by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA using specific polymerase chain reaction-based assay (PCR). The patient was successfully treated with quadruple antituberculous therapy. In the context of the diagnostic work-up of a hypodense pancreatic mass, the diagnosis of tuberculosis relies on the presence of pancreatic caseating granulomas, that can be obtained by endosonography-guided biopsy, thus avoiding laparotomy.
