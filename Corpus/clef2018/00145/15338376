Pancreatic metastasis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a relatively rare skin tumor that is considered to have intermediate malignancy it demonstrates frequent local recurrence, but systemic metastasis is rare. We report a 49-year-old woman with pancreatic metastasis of DFSP who underwent total pancreatectomy with partial resection of the portal vein. Except for our patient, only two other cases of pancreatic metastasis of DFSP have been reported in the literature, to our knowledge. Radical resection may be considered for pancreatic metastasis of DFSP when there are no other metastatic lesions.
