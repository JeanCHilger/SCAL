Perforating mediastinal mature teratoma associated with acute cardiac tamponade report of a case. We report a case of the mediastinal teratoma associated with acute cardiac tamponade followed by emergency operation. This tumor causes a variety of complications, but reports of acute cardiac tamponade have been rare. 20-year-old male admitted into our hospital with complaint of the chest pain, who was diagnosed with mediastinal tumor. She was admitted due to sudden fever up, and 5 days after admission, the complaint of severe epigastralgia and abdominal swelling were occurred. A chest X-ray film and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed cardiac tamponade. We carried out emergency surgical pericardial drainage and extirpation of the tumor. The tumor was composed of cystic part involving of dark green fluid macroscopically. The amylase level in this fluid was 42 U/l. We observed a small hole on the pericardial sac beside the base of ascending aorta. The amylase level in pericardial effusion was 19 U/l. Histopathological diagnosis was mature teratoma perforating into pericardiac sac, which included skin, bronchus and pancreatic tissue. We concluded that the progress of the tumor and the mechanical inflammation were major cause of perforation of the tumor into the pericardial sac, and autodigestion by enzyme from pancreas was minor cause of perforation.
