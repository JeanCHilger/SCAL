Retroperitoneal hematoma after blunt trauma. We reviewed retrospectively 233 consecutive patients with retroperitoneal hematoma (RPH) resulting from blunt trauma. This study group represented 2.9 per cent of all admissions for blunt trauma and 13 per cent of all admissions for blunt abdominal trauma. Motor vehicle accidents predominated as the cause of injury. Fifty-five per cent of the patients had fractures of the pelvis. Laparotomy was the primary method used in diagnosing RPH (73 per cent). The RPH was located in zone I in 14 per cent of patients, zone II in 37 per cent, zone III in 46 per cent and zone IV in 3 per cent. The RPH was explored in 35 per cent of all patients. Major vessels were the most common organ system injured (21 per cent) in patients with zone I RPH. The kidney was the most commonly injured organ (27 per cent) in patients with zone II RPH. Injury of either the pancreas or duodenum in 14 per cent of patients with right-sided zone II RPH indicates the need for careful evaluation of those organs at operation. Patients with zone III RPH associated with fractures of the pelvis should be explored only rarely--when main iliac vascular injury is suspected (4.6 per cent in this series). Otherwise, a systematic approach using external fixator devices and angiographic embolization should be used. The over-all morbidity and mortality rates of 59 and 39 per cent, respectively, emphasize the need for aggressive resuscitation, rapid control of hemorrhage and a multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients.
