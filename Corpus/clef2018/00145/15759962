Liver metastasis presenting as pneumoperitoneum. A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Chest radiography demonstrated pneumoperitoneum. At surgery, the source was found to be a ruptured hepatic abscess. Cultures grew Clostridium perfringens, and biopsies confirmed metastasis of a previously resected pancreatic cancer. We document this rare cause of pneumoperitoneum and briefly review the literature on liver abscess as it relates to metastatic cancer.
