MRI in acute pancreatitis. 26 patients with clinical and biological suspicion of acute pancreatitis were examined by MRI. The general indications for pancreatic MRI were: suboptimal or equivocal CT or ultrasonography findings (e.g. focal pancreatic enlargement with no mass discernable on CT or US), contraindications to iodinated contrast administration (e.g. contrast allergy history and renal failure). Using fast scanning techniques most of them with breath holding and fat saturation MRI was able to depict the lesions involved (e.g. the presence and distribution of necrotic areas and fluid collections, the existence of subsequent chronic pancreatic changes) which are consistent with CT findings. MRCP demonstrated etiology, like cholelithiasis.
