Pyogenic liver abscess after choledochoduodenostomy for biliary obstruction caused by autoimmune pancreatitis. A 68-year-old man underwent cholecystectomy and choledochoduodenostomy for biliary obstruction and nephrectomy for a renal tumor. Based on clinical and histopathologic findings, autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) was diagnosed. The renal tumor was diagnosed as a renal cell cancer. Steroid therapy was started and thereafter pancreatic inflammation improved. Five years after surgery, the patient was readmitted because of pyrexia in a preshock state. A Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess complicated by sepsis was diagnosed. The patient recovered with percutaneous abscess drainage and administration of intravenous antibiotics. Liver abscess recurred 1 mo later but was successfully treated with antibiotics. There has been little information on long-term outcomes of patients with AIP treated with surgery. To our knowledge, this is the second case of liver abscess after surgical treatment of AIP.
