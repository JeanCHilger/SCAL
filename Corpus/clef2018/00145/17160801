MR cholangiopancreatography findings of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the distal common bile duct. Heterotopic pancreas is defined as the presence of pancreatic tissue at sites other than the pancreas. Involved sites may be the stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, ileum, congenital duodenal web, Meckel's diverticulum, ampulla of Vater, and the main pancreatic duct. We report the magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography findings of a patient who had biliary obstruction due to heterotopic pancreas tissue at the distal common bile duct.
