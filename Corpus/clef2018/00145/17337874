The role of multi-detector-row computed tomograph in the diagnosis of intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors of the pancreas in comparison to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Thirty patients with intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas underwent multidetector-row CT (MD-CT) in addition to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP), and, in 27 cases magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). The usefulness of MD-CT was investigated by comparing various imaging methods of the communication from the main pancreatic duct (MPD) to patulous/bulging papilla in addition to the indices for benign or malignant disease, the degree of dilation of the MPD, localization and size of cystic lesions, and presence or absence of neoplastic lesions, such as thickened walls and septa, intramural nodule, solid mass. With MD-CT, dilation of the MPD and localization and size of cystic lesions were accurately assessed, even in patients with obstruction of the main pancreatic duct in whom ERP was difficult to perform regardless of the presence or absence of massive amount of mucus. MD-CT with reconstructive imaging, such as MPR imaging and CPR imaging, allowed us to assess communication with the MPD and patulous/bulging papilla easier than MRCP. In our study, MD-CT was useful in the evaluation of thickened walls and septa that are predictive factors of malignancy in IPMT.
