Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the heart. We describe a case of a primary cardiac malignant fibrous histiocytoma in the left atrium of a 72-year-old man. Local recurrences appeared twice, at 2 and 14 months after initial tumor resection, and were managed surgically. The patient died of pancreatic metastasis 22 months after the initial diagnosis. The prognosis for MFH of the heart is poor despite aggressive surgical treatment.
