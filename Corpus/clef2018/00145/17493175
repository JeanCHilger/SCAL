Solid pancreatic hamartoma. A case of solid pancreatic hamartoma in a 58-year-old Japanese woman is presented. She had no symptoms, and a pancreatic mass was incidentally found on screening ultrasonography 4 months before admission. The patient was not alcoholic and had no history of pancreatitis. Physical examination and laboratory data were unremarkable. Preoperative imaging demonstrated a nodule in the body of the pancreas, measuring 2.0 cm in maximum diameter, which showed marked delayed enhancement during dynamic CT. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy under the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic endocrine tumor and had an uneventful postoperative course. A well-demarcated solid nodule, 1.9 cm in diameter, was evident in the body of the pancreas. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of non-neoplastic, disarranged acinar cells and ducts embedded in a sclerotic stroma with elongated spindle cells, lacking discrete islets. The stromal spindle cells were immunoreactive for CD34 and CD117. The histological diagnosis was solid hamartoma of the pancreas. There was no recurrence 5 months after surgery. Herein is reported a case of solid hamartoma of the pancreas and review of the literature. A search through the literature found only two cases of solid hamartoma of the pancreas, among the 14 cases previously reported as pancreatic hamartoma.
