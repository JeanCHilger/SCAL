Imaging spectrum of cystic pancreatic lesions: learn from atypical cases. The classic radiologic findings of cystic pancreatic masses have been well recognized however, diagnosing those lesions is still challenging since many cases show unusual radiologic findings. We reviewed the computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings of many pathologically proven cystic pancreatic masses and selected various atypical but instructive cases as well as rare pathologic cases from the past 10 years in our institution. This article presents atypical as well as rare pathologic cases of cystic pancreatic masses and correlates them with pathologic findings to obtain diagnostic clues to perform a correct diagnosis.
