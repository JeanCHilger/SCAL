MR imaging of the pancreas: 1.5T versus 3T. Pancreatic cancer has an almost uniformly grim prognosis. Early detection has the potential to improve survival, however. One promising approach to increase detection rates is the use of MR imaging at 3T. Imaging at 3T improves temporal or spatial resolution for pancreatic evaluation. Known challenges of imaging at 3T, such as increased power deposition and B1 field inhomogeneity, are not significant limitations for pancreatic imaging. Preliminary results suggest that the signal-to-noise ratio can be as much as twice as high as at 1.5T, particularly after contrast administration. Evaluation of the hepatobiliary ducts is comparable or superior to that at 1.5T. Additional studies are needed to determine if the improved image quality translates into improved sensitivity for disease.
