MR cholangiopancreatography: 1.5T versus 3T. Soon after its introduction in 1991, MR cholangiopancreatography has become an established diagnostic tool for the evaluation of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system at a field strength of 1.5T. It remains unclear whether MR cholangiopancreatography performed at 3T will benefit from the higher magnetic field strength or whether a field strength of 1.5T should continue to be considered the gold standard for MR cholangiopancreatography. This article reviews the current literature on the benefits and drawbacks of MR cholangiopancreatography at 3T compared with a standard field strength of 1.5T. Field strength-related artifacts that affect MR cholangiopancreatography at 3T also are discussed.
