Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the duodenum: treatment by classic pancreaticoduodenectomy and review of the literature. Renal cell cancer (RCC) most commonly metastasizes to the lungs, bones, liver, renal fossa, and brain, although metastases can occur elsewhere. RCC metastatic to the duodenum is especially rare, with only a small number of cases reported in the literature. Herein, we describe a case of an 86-year-old woman with a history of RCC treated by radical nephrectomy 13 years previously. The patient presented with duodenal obstruction and anemia from a solitary duodenal mass invading into the pancreas and was treated via classic pancreaticoduodenectomy. Preoperative imaging and intra-operative assessment showed no evidence of other disease. Pathology confirmed metastatic RCC without lymph node involvement. Our case report and review of the English language literature underscore the rarity of this entity and support aggressive surgical treatment in such patients.
