Autoimmune pancreatitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a form of chronic pancreatitis of presumed autoimmune aetiology. The disease is characterised with clinical, serological, histomorphological and imaging features. Autoimmune pancreatitis is recognised as a T-cell-mediated specific disease with lymphoplasmatic infiltration of pancreatic tissue and pancreatic parenchyma fibrosis. Serum immunoglobulin IgG or IgG4 and antibodies (rheumatoid factor, lactoferrin antibodies, carbonic anhydrase II, etc) are usually increased. But the lack of specific biochemical markers is a major drawback in the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis. The Japan Pancreas Society proposed diagnostic criteria for autoimmune pancreatitis as the presence antibodies, pancreas enlargement and pancreatic duct narrowing, lymphoplasmatic infiltration, response to corticosteroid therapy, and association with other autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, sialoadenitis, inflammatory bowel disease and Sj√∂gren syndrome. New criteria (HISORt Criteria) incorporate imaging changes, organ involvement, specific elevation of IgG4 subclass and histopathological markers. Autoimmune pancreatitis could be associated with diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Clinically, autoimmune pancreatitis is a disease with mild symptoms severe attacks of abdominal pain are not typical. Typically, pancreatic calcifications and pseudocyst are absent
