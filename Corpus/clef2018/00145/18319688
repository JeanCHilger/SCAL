Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided access and therapy of pancreatico-biliary disorders. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved from a purely diagnostic imaging modality to one that allows therapeutic intervention. It now serves as a viable alternative, and at times is preferred, to percutaneous and surgical techniques for obtaining biliary and pancreatic duct access and for providing drainage. EUS guided intervention is usually performed following failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or as an option for patients who decline surgical intervention or in poor operative candidates. Published data demonstrate overall technical success in 83% of patients with 12% experiencing a procedure related complication. New techniques and equipment must be developed to simplify and abbreviate the procedures, to limit complications, and improve outcomes. In addition, longitudinal data are needed to determine the long-term outcomes and role of EUS guided pancreaticobiliary intervention.
