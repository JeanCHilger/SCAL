Pancreas allografts: comparison of three-dimensional rotational angiography with standard digital subtraction angiography. To define the role of three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (RA) for the evaluation of pancreas allografts and compare 3D RA to standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA).DSA and 3D RA were performed in patients with vascular abnormalities diagnosed on contrast medium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. Patency of the allograft vasculature, confidence in the ability to make a therapeutic decision, and value of the study for definition of the optimal projection for an intervention was assessed on a graded scale.Seventeen standard DSA projections (mean, 3.4 range, 2-6) and 10 3D RA images (mean, 2Three-dimensional RA of pancreatic allografts is feasible and does not differ in accuracy from conventional DSA. It provides similar reviewer confidence in the ability to make an accurate treatment decision, but its key advantage is its superior ability to define the optimal projection for planned endovascular interventions.
