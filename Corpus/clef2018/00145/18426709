Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) of the pancreas are rare tumours with low malignant potential, usually affecting young women. Due to its relatively low incidence, there are no international guidelines published on diagnosis or treatment. The aims of our study were to summarize our clinical experience of SPN in a Hungarian Surgical Centre and to discuss the relevant international literature. The clinical data of four patients treated between 2004 and 2007 in the Petz Aladár County Teaching Hospital (Gyôr, Hungary) were analyzed retrospectively. All patients were women with age of 17-49 years. In all cases SPN was diagnosed preoperatively on the basis of CT-findings and the diagnosis was confirmed by postoperative histology. After an organ-preserving radical resection of the tumour, all patients have remained disease free with an acceptable quality of life so far. Our data suggest that CT-scan is adequate to establish the preoperative diagnosis of SPN. Surgical resection should be carried out with the required radicality, but organ preservation is advised in order to provide a relatively good quality of life.
