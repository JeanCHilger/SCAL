Intraductal tubular carcinoma of the pancreas: a case report with the imaging findings. We describe here a case of intraductal tubular carcinoma of the main pancreatic duct. Gadolinium-enhanced pancreas magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed an enhancing mass that was confined in the dilated main pancreatic duct of the pancreatic body, along with dilatation of the upstream main pancreatic duct and chronic pancreatitis that was due to obstruction. MR cholangiopancreatography and an endoscopic retrograde pancreatogram showed a filling defect that was due to an intraductal mass of the pancreatic body, along with dilatation of the upstream main pancreatic duct and no dilatation of the downstream main pancreatic duct. The pathological findings demonstrated an intraductal nodular appearance without papillary projection or mucin hypersecretion.
