Small intestine bacterial overgrowth in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Previous reports describe 30-40% of small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), SIBO is a cause of persistent symptoms in this group of patients even when they are treated with pancreatic enzymes.To asses the frequency of SIBO in patients with CP.We studied 14 patients with CP using an hydrogen breath test with lactulose to detect SIBO, a nonabsorbable carbohydrate, whose results are not influenced by the presence of exocrine insufficiency. Main symptoms and signs were bloating in 9 (64%), recurrent abdominal pain in 8 (57%), intermittent diarrhea in 5 (36%) and steatorrhea in 5 (36%). At the same time we studied a healthy control group paired by age and sex.SIBO was present in 13 of 14 patients with CP (92%) and in 1 of 14 controls (p<0.001). The only patient with CP and without SIBO was recently diagnosed and had minimal morphologic alterations in computed tomography and endoscopic pancreatography.SIBO is common in CP and may be responsible for persistent symptoms. Proper diagnosis and treatment could alleviate symptoms and improve quality of Ufe.
