Multidetector computed tomography diagnosis of fusion of pancreas and spleen confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. We report multidetector computed tomography findings of fusion between the spleen and the distal pancreas with magnetic resonance imaging findings, which has not been reported before. Diagnosis of splenopancreatic fusion can be important in patients who will undergo splenectomy or distal pancreatectomy to avoid possible complications.
