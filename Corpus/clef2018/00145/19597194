Creating access to health technologies in poor countries. Many people in developing countries lack access to health technologies. We present seven findings about processes that shape access, based on analysis of six case histories: praziquantel to treat schistosomiasis (a parasitic worm disease), hepatitis B vaccine, the Norplant contraceptive, malaria rapid diagnostic tests, vaccine vial monitors, and the female condom. Each case study is assessed with a comprehensive framework that examines the effects of architecture, availability, affordability, and adoption on creating access. The analysis shows that access to health technology in poor countries is difficult to achieve because of multiple obstacles, but it can be created under certain conditions.
