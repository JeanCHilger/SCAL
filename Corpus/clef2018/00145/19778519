Detection of Plasmodium vivax infection in the Republic of Korea by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel technique that rapidly amplifies target DNA in isothermal conditions. In a previous study, the sensitivities and specificities of LAMP, microscopy, and nested PCR were compared in the context of rapid malaria detection. In the present study, LAMP detected vivax malaria parasites in 115 of 117 microscopically positive samples (sensitivity, 98.3% 95% CI, 97.4-100%), which agreed well with the nested PCR results (sensitivity, 99.1%
