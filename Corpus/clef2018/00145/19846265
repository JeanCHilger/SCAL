Evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria case management in Gabon. A laboratory-confirmed diagnosis is the basis of malaria case management. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) create new opportunities for improved care in endemic areas. Diagnostic performance of OptiMAL-IT and Acon was assessed in comparison with microscopy at 2 sites in Gabon. Between February 2008 and January 2009, 2125 febrile children under 11 years old were diagnosed using microscopy and RDTs. Plasmodial infection was detected more frequently using Acon (27%) and OptiMAL-IT (27%) compared to microscopy (20%) (P < 0.01). Among the samples diagnosed positive by OptiMAL-IT, 78% were infected by Plasmodium falciparum, whereas 99% of positive blood smears were P. falciparum infections, 0.5% Plasmodium malariae, and 0.5% Plasmodium ovale. Both RDTs had similar sensitivity (Se) (94.0% 95% confidence interval [CI], 92-96), which varied depending on the site. When parasite density was >100 p/microL, the Se of the 2 tests was >98% (95% CI, 96-100). Likewise, the negative predictive values were high and comparable (>98%). Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs was 12%. These tests should be considered as a good alternative to microscopy, allowing not only an efficient and rapid diagnosis of malaria in primary health facilities but also to aid in promoting changes for antimalarial prescription behavior.
