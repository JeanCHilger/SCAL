Clinical application of intraductal ultrasound during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) used during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can facilitate reliable evaluation of biliary and pancreatic disorders. The smaller diameter, flexibility, and the image quality offered by IDUS devices makes them ideal for evaluating a variety of difficult biliary and pancreatic diseases, especially in undefined strictures, luminal filling defects, and ampullary neoplasms. This article examines the numerous possible roles for IDUS in the evaluation of biliary and pancreatic conditions, as well as in ampullary neoplasms. IDUS is a simple, easy to learn, and safe technique that should be considered an integral tool in the therapeutic endoscopist's armamentarium.
