High prevalence of symptomatic acute HIV infection in an outpatient ward in southern Mozambique: identification and follow-up. To determine the prevalence of acute HIV infection (AHI) within the HIV-seronegative adult population presenting with reported fever in a district hospital in southern Mozambique and evaluate clinical, immunological and virological parameters of AHI.This is a prospective observational study.Three hundred and forty-six adults presenting with reported fever at an outpatient ward at the Manhi√ßa District Hospital in Mozambique were screened for AHI by HIV rapid serology testing, followed by HIV-RNA testing in HIV-seronegative individuals. Plasma from HIV-seronegative patients was pooled in the ratio of 1: 5 for HIV-RNA testing. Whole blood was used for Plasmodium falciparum rapid test determination at screening visit. Follow-up visits at day 7, 4 and 10 months included clinical examination, HIV serotesting and assessment of HIV-RNA, CD4 cell counts and percentage of activated CD8 T cells.HIV serotesting revealed that 37.8% (95% confidence interval 32.7-43.2) of the adults had previously undiagnosed established HIV infection. Among the HIV-seronegative patients, 3.3% (95% confidence interval 1.3-6.7) were found to have AHI as demonstrated by positive HIV-1 RNA testing. Median HIV-1 RNA levels at diagnosis of AHI were 6.21 log10 copies/ml (interquartile range 5.92-6.41) and significantly higher than median HIV-RNA load at 4 months. At day 7 after screening, patients showed a median CD4 cell count of 384 cells/microl (interquartile range 239-441) and a median percentage of activated CD8 T cells of 68.4% (interquartile range 59.6-87.8).Of patients reporting with fever, 3.3% were shown to be potentially due to AHI. High prevalence of AHI in southern African populations may warrant investigation of tools and target populations for AHI screening as a novel way to address HIV prevention.
