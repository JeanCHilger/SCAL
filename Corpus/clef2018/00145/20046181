Role of immunochromatographic test for rapid diagnosis of malaria. The study was conducted to compare among the different diagnostic procedures for malaria in the department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh during the period from July 2005 to June 2006. In this study a total of 98 malaria patients were included as cases. Another 30 age and sex matched healthy people were included as controls. Blood sample from each of the case and control was collected and examined for malarial parasite by microscopic examination of peripheral blood film. Subsequently antigen and antibody were detected by immuno-chromatographic test (ICT). Out of 98 clinically suspected cases 59(60.20%) were positive for malarial parasite by microscopic examination of peripheral blood film, 57(58.16%) were positive by ICT for antigen and 58(59.19%) were positive by ICT for antibody. Sensitivity and specificity of ICT for antigen were 93.22% and 94.87% respectively. For antibody, sensitivity and specificity were 89.83% and 87.17% respectively. From this study, sensitivity and specificity of ICT for malaria was found quite satisfactory, so it is suggested that ICT for malaria could be an alternative to peripheral blood film for the diagnosis of malaria where parasite could not be detected in peripheral blood film.
