Experience in the use of the malaria rapid diagnostic test in Madagascar. Diagnosis of malaria cases depends on parasitological examination. Since 2006, the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Joseph Raseta Befelatanana University Hospital in Madagascar has been using the malaria rapid diagnostic test. The percentage of malaria cases (presumed or confirmed) in relation to the number of hospitalized patients has decreased. It was 23.4% in 2003, 10.3% in 2006 and 4.3% in 2008 (p<0.01532). To improve management of malaria cases and rationalize use of antimalarial agents, diagnosis should be confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests.
