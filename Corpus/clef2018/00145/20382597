Xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis treated by duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection. Xanthogranulomatosis is an idiopathic, rare process in which lipid-laden histiocytes are deposited at various locations in the body. We present two cases who were treated by duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection and eventually diagnosed as having xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis.A 30-year-old caucasian man was admitted to our clinic for vague abdominal pain and epigastric dullness. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography suggested the existence of chronic pancreatitis. Another 34-year-old caucasian woman was admitted to our clinic because of right upper quadrant pain. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a dilatation and stone of the main pancreatic duct. Based on a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic head resection was planned and a laparotomy was performed in both of cases.In both cases, duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection was performed. Macroscopic and microscopic findings revealed xanthogranulomatous inflammation, which led to a diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pancreatitis.Although this type of pancreatitis is extremely rare, it is important to keep it in mind for a differential diagnosis because it may simulate chronic pancreatitis or a malignant tumor on imaging.
