Retroperitoneal tumours--analysis of own clinical material--a six-year retrospective study. Primary retroperitoneal tumours and retroperitoneal organs' tumours represent a variety of lesions that require different treatments and have various prognoses. The aim of this study was to present the author's observations of the histological tumors types occurrence and their surgical treatment.One hundred twenty-three cases of retroperitoneal tumours were studied retrospectively in a 6-year period. All cases were investigated for haematological and biochemical parameters. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of abdominal cavity and pelvis were done in the all cases. All cases were subjected to laparotomy with an aim to resect the tumour completely.In the present study we observed primary retroperitoneal tumours like malignant neuroblastoma, paraganglioma, primitive neuroectodermal tumour, cavernous haemangioma and mucinous cystadenoma. Among retroperitoneal organs' tumours pancreatic lesions present the majority of them. There were 6 cases of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours. We had two cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. In adrenal glands we observed benign and malignant lesions like pheochromocytoma and fibrosarcoma. All primary retroperitoneal tumours, except two cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, were an bloc removed.Primary retroperitoneal tumours in contrast to retroperitoneal organs' tumours occur very rare. Their anatomical location makes early detection difficult and as a result they are usually quite extensive when first detected. The clinical manifestations of all retroperitoneal tumours are not specific, so it causes a lot of difficulties in early diagnosis. This is the main reason that contributes to treatment failure.
