Beta-cell adenomas without hyperinsulinemia with use of highly specific insulin radioimmunoassays: case report and review of literature. To report a case of a proinsulin-secreting islet cell adenoma in which the diagnosis was obscured by an ultraspecific insulin assay.We describe the case of a 46-year-old woman, who presented with fasting hypoglycemia and appropriately low insulin values.A prolonged supervised fast produced symptomatic hypoglycemia (20 mg/dL) after only 7 hours. During the entire fasting test, highly specific insulin remained at <3 mIU/L, with a median value (and interquartile range) of 0.9 (0.8 to 2.3) mIU/L, when the glucose concentration was <50 mg/dL. The serum C-peptide level remained high normal (mean +/- SD, 2.7 +/- 0.6 ng/mL normal fasting levels, 0.8 to 3.9), and no evidence of sulfonylurea use was detected in the patient's urine. Circulating proinsulin levels were persistently high (>200 pmol/L in all determinations when hypoglycemia was presentThe diagnosis of a hypoglycemia-producing pancreatic adenoma can be missed when an ultraspecific insulin assay is used. The direct measurement of proinsulin established the diagnosis in this case.
