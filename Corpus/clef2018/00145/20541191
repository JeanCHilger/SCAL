Removal of transanastomotic pancreatic stent tubes after pancreaticoduodenectomy: a new role for double-balloon enteroscopy. Endoscopic interventions are usually very challenging in patients with anatomic changes caused by earlier GI surgery. The recent development of the double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) system creates an opportunity to reach the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct in postsurgical conditions.To report a further application of DBE in surgical patients namely, extraction of pancreatic stents placed in pancreaticojejunal anastomosis during pancreaticoduodenectomy.Two case reports.A single-center experience in a tertiary-care unit.Two patients who underwent Whipple resection with Roux-en-Y reconstruction presented with migration of pancreatic stent tubes inserted in pancreaticojejunal anastomoses. Stents had migrated to the end of the afferent limb and were causing abdominal pain. Because extraction failed by using conventional endoscopy, we used the DBE system.Successful extraction of the stents.Stents were successfully removed in both patients with no complications. After 1 year of follow-up, the patients remained free of painful symptoms.Small volume case series.Double-balloon enteroscopy is a reliable way to investigate and treat patients with postsurgical altered anatomy. Here, we report the successful removal of pancreatic stents migrating into the jejunal loop through pancreaticojejunal anastomosis.
