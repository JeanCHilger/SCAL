Primary yolk sac tumor arising in the pancreas with hepatic metastasis: a case report. Extragonadal yolk sac tumor (YST) is a relatively rare entity. We describe here the case of an extragonadal YST that occurred in the pancreas with hepatic metastasis in an adult woman. The contrast enhanced CT images of the abdomen revealed a heterogeneous, solitary mass occupying the pancreatic neck and body with slightly inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. Two low-density lesions in the liver were also displayed on the CT images. The patient underwent surgery and the diagnosis of YST was pathologically verified.
