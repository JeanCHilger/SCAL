Diagnosis and management of pancreatic carcinoma during pregnancy. Acute, persistent abdominal pain due to ruptured pancreatic carcinoma and perforated stomach is extremely rare during pregnancy.We evaluated a woman at 34 weeks of gestation presenting with uterine contractions. Computed tomography scanning revealed a large retroperitoneal mass, and her blood carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was elevated. Immediately after an emergency cesarean delivery, pancreatic cancer was detected, and pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The patient underwent chemotherapy and remains disease-free at 2 years.Delayed diagnosis and treatment are associated with high morbidity of both neonate and mother in cases of pancreatic cancer during pregnancy. Computed tomography scanning and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels are useful for diagnosis, after which radical surgery should be performed immediately in late pregnancy.
