Validation of a four-primer real-time PCR as a diagnostic tool for single and mixed Plasmodium infections. Although microscopy remains the reference standard for malaria diagnosis, molecular tools are attracting increasing interest. To improve the detection of mixed infections, we developed a four-primer real-time PCR with four Plasmodium species-specific forward primers, based on the pan-primer design with universal Plasmodium primers as described previously. After validation for analytical sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, the four-primer PCR was evaluated on 351 blood samples from patients presenting at the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Belgium). With the four-primer PCR, we identified 188 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), 54 Plasmodium vivax (Pv), 52 Plasmodium ovale (Po) and 13 Plasmodium malariae (Pm) single infections, 27 mixed infections (14 Pf + Pm 12 Pf + Po
