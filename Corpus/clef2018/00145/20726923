Intra-abdominal vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) after necrosectomy for acute necrotising pancreatitis: preliminary experience. Infection of pancreatic necrosis, although present in less than 10% of acute pancreatitis, carries a high risk of mortality debridment and drainage of necrosis is the treatment of choice, followed by 'open' or 'close' abdomen management. We recently introduced the use of intra-abdominal vacuum sealing after a classic necrosectomy and laparostomy. Two patients admitted to ICU for respiratory insufficiency and a diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis developed pancreatic necrosis and were treated by necrosectomy, lesser sac marsupialisation and posterior lumbotomic opening. Both of the patients recovered from pancreatitis and a good healing of laparostomic wounds was obtained with the use of the VAC system. Most relevant advantages of this technique seem to be: the prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome, the simplified nursing of patients and the reduction of time to definitive abdominal closure.
