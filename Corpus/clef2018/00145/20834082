Comparison of quinine and rabeprazole with quinine monotherapy in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This study was conducted to assess the effect of combination treatment of quinine and rabeprazole in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.The study included 50 patients of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Group 1 (25 patients) received quinine and placebo (Q+P) while Group 2 (25 patients) received quinine and rabeprazole (Q+R). Diagnosis was confirmed by peripheral blood film (PBF) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Temperature was recorded every 6 h. All patients were followed-up on Days 7, 14, 21, 28 for detailed clinical and parasitological examination.A total of 20 patients in each group completed the treatment and followed-up for 28 days. While two patients in Group 1 (Q+P) and one patient in Group 2 (Q+R) were lost in follow-up and seven (Q+P = 4, Q+R =3) patients were withdrawn from the study. Fever clearance time (FCT) of the two groups was also almost similar (Group 1 : 2 = 52.8 : 51.3 h). No statistically significant difference was observed in early treatment failure (ETF) either of the groups. None of the patients in both the groups showed late clinical failure (LCF) or late parasitological failure (LPF). However, there was a significant difference in the parasite clearance rates of the two groups (p<0.05).The study results suggest that addition of rabeprazole to quinine regimen resulted in an increase in the parasite elimination rate, which may be helpful in reducing the duration of treatment and increasing patient compliance.
