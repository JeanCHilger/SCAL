Pancreatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma: a case report. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with multiple pancreatic nodules found on abdominal computed tomography. Thirteen years earlier she had undergone a left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. The patient underwent surgery with a preoperative diagnosis of multifocal metastatic or neuroendocrine tumor. At surgery, two metastatic nodules of renal cell carcinoma were found and excised. After four years of follow up there is no evidence of recurrence.
