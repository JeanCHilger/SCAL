An abdominal and thyroid status with Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Elastometry--a feasibility study: Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Elastometry of human organs. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) is a new method for the quantification of tissue elasticity. To date, ARFI technology has not been applied systematically to establish an abdominal and thyroid status. The aim of this prospective feasibility study was to evaluate ARFI elastometry performed on various healthy abdominal organs and the thyroid gland.94 patients (43 females, 51 males) with a mean age of 54 years and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. A routine ultrasound examination of the abdomen was scheduled in 72, and of the thyroid in 25. ARFI elastometry was performed in liver, spleen, pancreas, prostate, kidneys and thyroid gland with the ultrasound system Acuson S2000. ARFI values are proportional to tissue elasticity. Patients with ultrasonic or anamnestic evidence of diseased organs were excluded from the analysis. ARFI measurements were compared with the aid of the t-test and correlated using Spearman's correlation coefficient.ARFI elastometry proved feasible and the measurements obtained in the various organs differed significantly. Among healthy organs the spleen showed the highest mean ARFI velocities, followed by the kidney, thyroid, pancreas and the prostate. The lowest ARFI values were regularly found in healthy liver. Measurements in the kidneys and the spleen showed high standard deviation.ARFI elastometry may describe parenchymal stiffness of various abdominal organs and the thyroid gland. Further investigations are needed to compare these baseline findings in healthy organs with those of various tumours or diseases affecting the individual organs.
