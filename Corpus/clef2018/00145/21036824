Clinical features of children hospitalized with malaria--a study from Bikaner, northwest India. Severe Plasmodium vivax malaria in adults has been reported from Bikaner (northwestern India) but the reports on children are scanty. This prospective study was done on 303 admitted children of malaria. The diagnosis was done by peripheral blood smear and rapid diagnostic test. Further confirmation of severe P. vivax monoinfection was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The proportion of P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed (P. falciparum and P. vivax) infection was 61.01%, 33.99%, and 4.95%, respectively. Severe disease was present in 49.5% (150/303) children with malaria, with the risk greatest among P. vivax monoinfection (63.1% [65/103]) compared with P. falciparum, either alone (42.7% [79/185] odds ratio [OR] = 2.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40-3.76], P = 0.001) or mixed infections (40% [6/15]
