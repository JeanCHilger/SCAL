Clinical and molecular characterization of a near fatal case of human babesiosis in Austria. A previously healthy febrile patient with travel history to Nicaragua showed rapid clinical deterioration with hemodynamic shock and anuria. Diagnosis of severe malaria was established based on intra-erythrocytic parasites and antimalarial treatment was initiated. However, upon reevaluation Babesia microti infection was suspected and molecular characterization by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis was performed.
