Five-minute Giemsa stain for rapid detection of malaria parasites in blood smears. The Giemsa stain is used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of malaria on blood smears. The classical staining procedure requires between 30 and 45 min. We modified the Giemsa stain and reduced the staining time to 5 min without any loss of quality.
