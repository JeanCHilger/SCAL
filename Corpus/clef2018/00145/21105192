Linear endoscopic ultrasonography vs magnetic resonance imaging in ampullary tumors. To assess linear endoscopic ultrasound (L-EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in biliary tract dilation and suspect small ampullary tumor.L-EUS and MRI data were compared in 24 patients with small ampullary tumors all with subsequent histological confirmation. Data were collected prospectively and the accuracy of detection, histological characterization and N staging were assessed retrospectively using the results of surgical or endoscopic treatment as a benchmark.A suspicion of ampullary tumor was present in 75% of MRI and all L-EUS examinations, with 80% agreement between EUS and histological findings at endoscopy. However, L-EUS and histological TN staging at surgery showed moderate agreement (Îº = 0.54).L-EUS could be a useful adjunct as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with suspected ampullary tumors.
