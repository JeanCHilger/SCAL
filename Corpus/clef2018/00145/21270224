Novel nested direct PCR technique for malaria diagnosis using filter paper samples. The use of direct nested PCR enables the detection of Plasmodium spp. from blood samples collected on filter papers without requiring the time-consuming procedures associated with DNA extraction. Direct PCR provides a rapid, highly sensitive, and cost-effective alternative to diagnosing malaria using filter paper samples and standard nested PCR.
