Management of left pancreatic trauma. Left pancreatic traumas (LPTs) are rare but serious lesions occurring in 1 to 6 per cent of abdominal trauma patients and mainly resulting from blunt traumas. LPT severity is primarily dependent on the associated injuries and secondarily related to main pancreatic duct injury responsible for complications: acute pancreatitis, pseudocysts, pancreatic fistulas, or abscesses. The guidelines for blunt LPT management can be presented as follows. In case of emergency laparotomy, pancreas exploration is mandatory to detect pancreatic duct lesions. In the absence of main pancreatic duct lesions, simple drainage is advocated. In case of distal injury to the main pancreatic duct, a left pancreatectomy is mandatory. In the absence of initial laparotomy, the diagnosis is more and more based on CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which tend to replace endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a first-intent diagnostic modality. In case of distal injury to the main pancreatic duct, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is recommended. In the absence of main pancreatic duct lesions, nonoperative treatment is advocated. When LPTs are discovered at the time of complications, pancreatic fistulas and/or pseudocysts are associated with main pancreatic lesions, which can be treated by pancreatic duct stenting at ERCP and/or internal endoscopic cystogastrostomy. However, in such cases, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy remains the treatment of choice. Pancreatic ductal lesions resulting from LPT have to be diagnosed early to avoid late complications. Distal pancreatectomy remains the treatment of choice in case of severe pancreatic ductal lesions because the role of ERCP stenting and endoscopic techniques needs further evaluation.
