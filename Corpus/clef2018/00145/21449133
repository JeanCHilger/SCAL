Surgical treatment of pancreatic injuries in severe abdominal trauma. In spite of its low incidence, pancreatic injuries hold important place in abdominal trauma because of diagnostic difficulties, severe potential complications, therapeutic challenges, and high mortality rates. These injuries are related with specific morbidity and are very often accompanied with injuries of other organs. This retrospective study included 31 patients treated at The Clinic for Emergency Surgery of Clinical Center of Serbia during the period of 2004-2009 with intraoperativelly confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic trauma. The most common mechanism of injury was blunt trauma (83.9%). Among available diagnostic methods, abdominal ultrasound was characterized with high incidence of false-negative findings (33.3%) while for CT it was at 16.6%. The type of surgical procedure was related to degree and severity of injury. Specific complications occurred in 22.6% of patients, while mortality rate was 25.8%. The creation of unambiguous algorithms for optimal treatment of patients with pancreatic trauma require multi-centric prospective studies.
