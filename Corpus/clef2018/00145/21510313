Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: clinical analysis of 11 cases. This study is designed to describe the clinicopathological features, diagnosis, surgical treatment and outcome of solid pseudopapillary tumor in a single institution.A retrospective study of clinical data from a series of eleven patients with SPT managed in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between October 2001 and November 2008.All of the 11 patients were female and the average age at diagnosis was 29.5 years (range 16 to 55). The tumor was located in the body and/or tail in 8 patients and in the head in 3 patients (27.3%). The median tumor size was 5.32 cm (range 2 to 10). All 11 patients had curative resections including 5 distal pancreatectomies, 4 local resections, one pancreaticoduodenectomy and one central pancreatectomy. 2 patients required concomitant splenic vein resection due to local tumor invasion. All patients were alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 45.4 months (range 5-90 months). There were no significant associations between clinicopathological factors and malignant potential of SPT. Ki-67 was detected to be positive in two patients with pancreatic parenchymal invasion.SPTs are rare neoplasms with malignant potential typically affecting young women without notable symptoms. Aggressive surgical resection is warranted even in the presence of local invasion or metastases, as patients demonstrate excellent long-term survival. Positive immunoreactivity for Ki-67 may predict the malignant potential of SPTs.
