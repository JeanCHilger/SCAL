Combined deletions of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes result in Plasmodium falciparum malaria false-negative rapid diagnostic test. We report a case of misdiagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria from Brazil with negative PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), leading to inappropriate case management. Genetic tests showed the deletion of both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes. The detection of two distinct P. falciparum target antigens is then advisable.
