Value of preoperative diagnosis in assessing tumor extension of ductal pancreatic carcinoma. The value of preoperative diagnostics in evaluating the extension of pancreatic carcinoma can be important in some cases for planning its therapy. In ca. 90% of our own patient material only the combination of angiography and computed tomography allowed a correct decision regarding tumor invasion of the vessels. Retrospectively metastases of the liver were seen in 80% and prospectively in 66.7% (sonography), respectively 58.3% (computed tomography) with a specificity of 86.9% respectively 91.3%. These results support our procedure of performing preoperative diagnostics in order to evaluate local operability and resectability only in patients with bad physical condition.
