Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT): the cure-all for the practitioner?. Many rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for the diagnosis of infectious diseases have been developed over the last 20 years. These allow (1) administering a treatment immediately in case of a potentially fatal disease, (2) prescribing a specific rather than presumptive treatment, (3) quickly introducing measures aimed at interrupting the transmission of the disease, (4) avoiding useless antibiotic treatments and (5) implementing a sequential diagnostic strategy to avoid extensive investigations. Using the example of malaria, a new strategy that includes a RDT as first-line emergency diagnostic tool and, when negative, delayed microscopy at the laboratory opening time is implemented in Lausanne since 1999. This strategy has been shown to be safe. Each TDR has its own characteristics that imperatively need to be known by the practitioner if he/she wants to use it in a rational way.
