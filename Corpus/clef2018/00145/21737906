Delayed pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. A case report. Pancreatic fistulas still occur despite refinements in both surgical technique and perioperative management after a pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, the occurrence of delayed pancreatic fistulas is very rare.A 62-year-old woman diagnosed with a lower biliary carcinoma had undergone a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital after 16 days. One year after surgery, she was admitted to our hospital with a fluid collection around the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. A catheter was inserted percutaneously and the fluid collection was drained. The amylase value of the discharge was significantly elevated (119,500 IU/L). One week later, a fistulography showed no significant collection and the tube was clamped. The patient was discharged from the hospital without symptoms.It is important to consider the occurrence of a delayed pancreatic fistula if the patient suffers from any symptoms. It is then necessary to proceed rapidly.
