Evaluation of four rapid diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Plasmodium vivax in Korea. To evaluate 4 rapid malaria diagnostic kits (RDTs) in Korea: OptiMAL test, SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f/Pan test, Humasis Malaria P.f/Pan antigen test and CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test.Hundred malaria patients with Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and 100 healthy volunteers were recruited. The results from earlier four RDTs were compared with the reference standard, the Giemsa-stained traditional microscopic diagnosis.Compared with the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity for Plasmodium vivax were 92.7 and 100% for SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f/Pan and 94.6% and 100% for OptiMALThe performances of all four malaria RDT kits were acceptable, although Humasis Malaria P.f/Pan antigen test and CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test gave superior performances with ROK isolates.
