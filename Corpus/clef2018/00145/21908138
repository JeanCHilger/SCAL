Imported malaria: an update. Evidence suggests that imported malaria is a diagnostic challenge with initial misdiagnosis rates of 40% or greater. Given that prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only intervention proven to prevent progression to severe malaria and death, these figures are concerning. The purpose of this clinical review is to provide the most up-to-date and practical information on the diagnosis and treatment of imported malaria for the emergency health care provider. We highlight common pitfalls, errors, and mistakes in arriving at the correct diagnosis. We also emphasize the 3 key aspects to avoid progression to severe disease: rapid diagnosis, prompt initiation of treatment, and appropriate choice of antimalarial treatment.
