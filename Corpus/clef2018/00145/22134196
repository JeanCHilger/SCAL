Selective use of endoscopic ultrasound in the evaluation of carcinomas of the pancreatic head. The aims of this study were to assess the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the evaluation of adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas in cases of diagnostic dilemma and to determine the strength of agreement between perceived pre-operative stage as determined by computerised tomography (CT) and EUS and histopathological stage.Patients undergoing pancreatic EUS were identified from a computerised radiology database. The strengths of agreement between the radiological and histopathological stages were determined by the weighted kappa (Kw) statistic.Fifty-eight patients were identified. Of 37 patients with a pancreatic head mass on prior imaging, 32 had a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma confirmed by EUS, as did 11 of 21 patients with suspicious pancreatic head lesions. Twenty-five of 43 patients were deemed to have resectable carcinomas, and 2 patients had resectable mucinous lesions. In comparing CT and EUS in the 25 patients undergoing resection, the Kw for T and N stages was 0.250 (p = 0.05) and -0.080 (p = 0.288), respectively, for CT, compared with 0.738 (p = 0.0001) and 0.606 (p = 0.0001), respectively, for EUS.EUS was effective in assessing the resectability of pancreatic head adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, EUS held a significant 3-fold advantage over CT with regard to T stage and an even higher significant advantage with regard to N stage.
