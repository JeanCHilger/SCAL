Posterior approach pancreaticoduodenectomy: best option for hepatic artery anatomical variants. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the best treatment for the patients with malignant tumors of the pancreatic head. However, the procedure is also recommended in some benign pancreatic tumors. The posterior approach allows early dissection of the superior mesenteric artery, portal vein and retroportal pancreatic lamina, before any pancreatic or digestive transection. We present a 42 year old woman diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor. The clinical and biological data suggested the diagnosis of insulinoma. The computed tomography showed a nodule located in the pancreatic head with a typical vascular pattern for endocrine tumor. The exam also revealed a rare vascular variant, a common hepatic artery which arises from the superior mesenteric artery. A pancreaticoduodenectomy has been performed. We used the posterior approach which allowed the correct dissection and exposure of the abnormal common hepatic artery. The postoperative course was uneventful. Posterior approach during the pancreaticoduodenectomies avoids arterial injuries that might compromise the liver arterial supply. It is especially indicated when preoperative imaging studies diagnose anatomic variants of the hepatic arteries.
