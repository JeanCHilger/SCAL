The challenge of malaria eradication in the twenty-first century: research linked to operations is the key. Interest and support for malaria control, eradication, and research has increased greatly over the past decade. This has resulted from appreciation of the huge medical, social, and economic burden that malaria exacts from endemic populations. Recent breakthroughs in drug development (artemisinin-based combination treatments), preventive interventions (long-lasting, insecticide-treated bed nets), improved diagnosis (rapid diagnostic tests), and community mobilization have resulted in deployment of new antimalarial tools. National programs supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative, and other donors have resulted in substantial reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality. Bill and Melinda Gates have given great impetus to eradication with support for the development of key research strategies and direct funding of innovative research projects, including malaria vaccine and drug discovery, that could decrease disease and transmission. Linking research to field operations is a strategy that succeeded for smallpox eradication and will be required for the demise of malaria.
