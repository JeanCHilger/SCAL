Evaluation of "Cyscope", a novel fluorescence-based microscopy technique for the detection of malaria. This study was designed to compare the detection of malaria parasites in peripheral blood smears using the Cyscope malaria rapid fluorescent microscopic technique and light microscopy of Giemsa-stained smears.A total of 295 blood smears were collected from patients of all age groups presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of malaria to 10 City Health Clinics in Harare. For each patient two blood films were prepared. Microscopic examination was done independently in two laboratories, with one performing the Giemsa stain and the other the Cyscope method. After the tests were completed, the results were then matched and recorded without any alterations.An equal number of men and women were malaria positive and their ages ranged from five to 66 years. Concordance in the detection of parasites (positive or negative) was 98.6% (291/295). In all four cases of discordance, malaria parasites were detected using the Cyscope but not with conventional microscopy. The Cyscope gave a 100% sensitivity and a specificity of 98.6%.The Cyscope may be a valuable addition to diagnostics of malaria in resource-limited settings such as Zimbabwe.
