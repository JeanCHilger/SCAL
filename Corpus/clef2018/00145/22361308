Gastrocolic fistulae From Haller till nowadays. Gastrocolic Fistula is, in the majority of cases the pathological communication between stomach and transverse colon, because cases involved with the small intestine, pancreas and skin have been also documented, even though are rare. It occurs mostly in adults, but they can be present to infants, as well, as a result of congenital abnormalities or iatrogenic procedures (i.e. migration of PEG tube that placed before). In the Western Countries, the most common cause is the adenocarcinoma of the colon, while in Japan, adenocarcinoma of the stomach is the most frequent cause. It seldom appears, as a complication of a benign peptic ulcer, in Crohn's disease and as a result of significant intake of steroids or NSAIDs. The typical symptoms of a gastrocolic fistula are abdominal pain, nausea-vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss. Radiology has been used for the detection of the fistulae all these years but the golden standard remained the barium enema. Barium meal and CT findings play a smaller role in the diagnosis. Although the management of gastrocolic fistulae has historically been surgical, medical treatment has recently been recommended as the first line when a malignancy can be excluded.
