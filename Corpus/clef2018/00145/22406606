Colloid carcinoma of the pancreas: a distinct pancreatic neoplasm with good prognosis. Report of a case. Colloid carcinoma is considered a distinct type of pancreatic neoplasia with specific histopathological and molecular features, and a better prognosis.We present the case of a patient with a 15 cm locally invasive colloid carcinoma of the pancreas, in which an aggressive surgical approach achieved no evidence of disease 24 months after surgery.If an accurate diagnostic approach and surgical resection are performed, the 5-year survival rate can reach 60%. Presence of invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm has been reported, and this can affect the prognosis. Adjuvant therapy has not demonstrated improvement of survival in surgically-resected patients.
