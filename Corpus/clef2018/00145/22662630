Management of childhood malaria in Switzerland. Imported malaria is a rare condition in current paediatric practice in Switzerland but should be suspected in all febrile children returning from a malaria-endemic region. Immediate treatment is essential to decrease the risk of complications and mortality. Severity criteria must always be searched for. We suggest a diagnostic strategy based on the use of microscopy and rapid antigen-detection tests. Treatment depends on the Plasmodium species and the severity of illness. For uncomplicated malaria, a drug combination that includes an artemisinin derivative should be used in priority. Atovaquone/proguanil represents an alternative. Chloroquine can be used in most cases of malaria caused by another Plasmodium species. Severe malaria must be treated intravenously with quinine and soon with artesunate.
