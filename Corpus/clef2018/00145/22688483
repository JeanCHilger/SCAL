PCR negative cerebral malaria in a traveller returning from Mumbai. The incidence of imported malaria to the UK is significant. The authors report a case of a healthy young man diagnosed with PCR negative cerebral malaria, a week after returning from Mumbai. The patient presented with acute confusion and vomiting. His condition deteriorated quickly warranting intubation, ventilation and transfer to intensive therapy unit. Extensive investigation did not find an underlying cause. Antimalarial treatment was initiated based on clinical suspicion despite a negative malarial screen. A rapid response to treatment followed such that the patient was extubated within 24 h. This case highlights the need for the UK Health Protection Agency to review its risk classification of malaria for travellers to Mumbai. Additionally, clinicians should promptly initiate antimalarial treatment in an unwell traveller returning from an endemic area when there is a high clinical suspicion even in the absence of a positive initial malaria screen.
