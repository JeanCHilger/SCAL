Diagnostic yield of malignancy during EUS-guided FNA of solid lesions with and without a stylet: a prospective, single blind, randomized, controlled trial. Use of a stylet during EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) is believed to improve the quality and diagnostic yield of specimens.To compare samples obtained by EUS-FNA with (S+) and without (S-) a stylet for diagnostic yield of malignancy and cytological characteristics.Randomized, controlled trial.Tertiary referral center.Consecutive patients referred for EUS-FNA of solid lesions.EUS-FNA the number of passes was determined by lesion site (6 pancreas/others and 4 lymph nodes).Diagnostic yield of malignancy and degree of cellularity, specimen adequacy, contamination, and amount of blood.One hundred patients were prospectively enrolled in this randomized, controlled trial and the sites of EUS-FNA were the pancreas, 58 lymph node, 25Subjectivity in cytopathologists' assessment, endosonographer not blinded.There was no difference in the diagnostic yield of malignancy or proportion of inadequate specimens between passes with and without a stylet. These results suggest that the use of a stylet does not confer any advantage during EUS-FNA.
