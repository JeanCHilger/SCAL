Endoscopic therapy for tumours of the papilla of vater. Ampullary tumours are rare and can be separated in benign and malignant lesions. There are non-invasive diagnostic methods in order to detect ampullary tumours like abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography and MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography) as well as invasive methods, e.â€Šg., gastroscopy, duodenoscopy, endosonography, intraductal ultrasound, ERCP and cholangioscopy. Endoscopy is the method of choice for this indication, whereas a combination of the different diagnostic methods is common.A selective literature research with descriptive survey has been carried out.The standard method to treat benign tumours of the papilla is endoscopic papillectomy. For malignant tumours surgery is preferred. But in some certain circumstances it is also possible to treat carcinomas of the papilla endoscopically.This overview should assist surgeons and endoscopists to choose the right diagnostic approach and to treat adenomas as well as carcinomas of the Papilla of Vater appropriately.The treatment of papilla tumours depends primarily on the dignity, the morphology of the findings and the extension of the tumour (extraductal vs. intraductal).
