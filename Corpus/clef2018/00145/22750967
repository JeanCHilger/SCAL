Fine needle aspiration cytomorphology of mucinous nonneoplastic cyst of the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytomorphology of mucinous nonneoplastic cyst (MNNC) of the pancreas has not been described.Nineteen of 24 patients with surgically diagnosed MNNCs had presurgery endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-FNA biopsy. The FNA cytomorphology was retrospectively evaluated. Cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen and amylase concentrations were measured.Endoscopic US-FNA diagnoses ranged from unsatisfactory to suspicious for adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic US-FNA cytologic findings showed cuboidal or columnar cells arranged in flat 'honeycomb' sheets/nests (100.0%), papillary architecture (10.5%), acini formation (10.5%), 3-dimensional cluster (5.3%), abundant single cell pattern (5.3%), goblet cells (17.4%), and delicate or vacuolated (60.9%) cytoplasm variable in amount. Nuclei were round or oval and small to slightly enlarged with 1 or 2 inconspicuous nucleoli, fine granular chromatin, and smooth nuclear contour (irregular in 1 case). Nuclear grooves (43.5%) and nuclear pseudoinclusions (26.1%) were identified. Most cases showed thin mucin and thick mucin in 4 cases. Stroma was seen in 4 cases (17.4%). Degenerated cells/necrotic material and macrophages were also seen. Carcinoembryonic antigen ranged from 75.2 to 5,488 ng/ml and amylase from 19 to 28,478 U/L.Recognition of FNA cytomorphology of MNNC and valuable of carcinoembryonic antigen and amylase levels in cyst fluid is critical in clinical evaluation of pancreatic cysts.
