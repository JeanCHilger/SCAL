Splenic infarct with polysplenia syndrome and situs inversus. A rare case of spontaneous splenic infarction with polysplenia and situs inversus is presented. The diagnosis was made by ultrasound and confirmed by CT which showed multiple aberrant right-sided spleens with situs inversus and one of the spleen showing low attenuation areas representing infarct. Polysplenia syndrome is a rare entity associated with heterotaxy syndromes, congenital cyanotic heart diseases, billiary atresia, intestinal malrotation, immotile cilia syndrome, annular or short pancreas, preduodenal portal vein and vena caval anomalies.
