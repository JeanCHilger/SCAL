Comparative study of sensitivity of rapid diagnostic (hexagon) test with calculated malarial parasitic density in peripheral blood. Different diagnostic test kits are used for rapid diagnosis of malaria. Most are based on antigen detection (pLDH, Pan Aldolase, HRP-2). In context of Nepal the diagnostic reliability and sensitivity of these tests is unknown. Hexagon Malaria Combi™ is one of the most commonly used test kit in Nepal for rapid diagnosis of malaria. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the sensitivity of the Hexagon malaria Combi test in comparison with parasitic density by microscopy technique.A Cross sectional prospective study was conducted in three districts of Nepal from September to November 2009. Blood samples were collected from the suspected cases of malaria. Thick and thin smear were prepared from all the samples and Giemsa stain was done. Simultaneously RDT (hexagon) for malaria was done. When RDT was found to be positive, blood was serially diluted in 6 tubes as 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32 and 1:64. RDT was done on diluted blood till RDT test gave negative result. Parasitic density was calculated for undiluted and diluted blood samples and sensitivity of RDT in various parasitic densities was calculated.Hexagon malaria combi test is sensitive (86%) when malarial parasitic density is >500/μl. Sensitivity was found to be directly related to parasitic density. Its sensitivity is very low (2.9%) when parasitic density is less than 500/ μl.The sensitivity of rapid diagnostic test (hexagon Combi test detecting malarial pLDH antigen) is high only if the parasitic density is more than 500/μl.
