Assessment of the impact of malaria on CD4+ T Cells and haemoglobin levels of HIV-malaria co-infected patients. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria destroy important cells required for proper immunological and haematological functioning of the body. This research therefore aimed to assess the effect of malaria on CD4+ and haemoglobin (Hb) levels of HIV-malaria co-infected patients.The study was performed by sampling 220 adult HIV patients on highly active anti retroviral therapy (HAART) who routinely visited the Tema General Hospital in Ghana. Blood samples were obtained for both blood film microscopy identification of malaria parasites and analysis using rapid diagnostic test kits. A BD Facscount Analyzer was used in the quantification of CD4+ levels.Of the 220 patients sampled, 34 (15.5%) were HIV-malaria co-infected, all of whom (34 100%) had CD4+ counts below the normal range, while 23 (12.9%) of the HIV mono-infected patients had normal CD4+ counts. Almost all HIV-malaria co-infected patients (33Malaria co-infection with HIV decreases CD4+ T cells and Hb levels in patients. It is therefore recommended that HIV patients in malaria endemic areas should adhere to malaria preventive measures.
