Severe febrile illness in adult hospital admissions in Tanzania: a prospective study in an area of high malaria transmission. Severe febrile illness is a major cause of adult hospital admission in Africa. Studies of non-malarial fever come largely from children or from high HIV prevalence settings. This prospective study of adult admissions with severe febrile illness in a malaria-endemic area with moderate/low HIV prevalence investigated admission diagnosis as well as final diagnosis based on results of investigations. Severe malaria was the admission diagnosis in 148/198 (74.7%) cases. Plasmodium falciparum was identified in 38/188 (20.2%) admissions and 26/198 (13.1%) were bacteraemic, with 13/25 (52%) prescribed empirical antibiotics. HIV was equally common among those with (16/37 43.2%) and without P. falciparum (50/138
