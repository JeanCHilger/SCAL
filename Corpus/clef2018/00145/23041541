Genetic deletion of HRP2 and HRP3 in Indian Plasmodium falciparum population and false negative malaria rapid diagnostic test. Genetic polymorphisms in diagnostic antigens are important factors responsible for variable performance of rapid diagnostic tests. Additionally, the failure of antigen expression due to gene deletion may also contribute to variable performance. We report Indian Plasmodium falciparum field isolates lacking both Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp3 genes leading to false negative results of rapid diagnostic tests. The study highlights need to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum isolates lacking these genes in larger field populations in India.
