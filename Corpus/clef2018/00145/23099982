Isolated pancreatic tuberculosis: a diagnostic challenge. Abdominal tuberculosis is quite commonly found in miliary tuberculosis, especially in countries where TB is endemic, however the abdominal localization of tuberculosis in absence of disseminated disease is a rare condition and the involvement of the pancreas alone is extremely rare. Epidemiology of TB is changing in the latest years, often this illness is found in non-endemic regions and physicians are asked to interpret what happen when an old disease meets new diagnostic technologies. We describe the case of a young male admitted in our hospital for abdominal pain. Echotomography, CT scan and MRI showed a pancreatic mass suspected to be cancer and susceptible to surgical treatment, Endoscopic Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) showed isolated pancreatic tuberculosis.
