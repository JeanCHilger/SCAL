Adhesion of physicians to the national malaria policy: situation in Antananarivo (Madagascar), 5 years after the policy revision. Our goal was to evaluate and analyze physicians' adherence to the national malaria policy in Antananarivo, 5 years after its revision. This prospective descriptive study was conducted in public and private health centers in Antananarivo in 2010, from May 1 to June 30. Adhesion to the new policy included adoption of the rapid diagnostic test for malaria (RDT) and/or microscopy as diagnostic methods and prescription of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 106 physicians. Their average age was 43.9 years (range: 26 to 59 years). The male-female sex-ratio was 0.59. Physicians trained in using RDTs were confident in this means of diagnosis (p < 10(-4)). Prescription of ACT by physicians was associated with their participation in malaria training (p = 0.02). Only 2/3 of the physicians adhered to the current policy. Adherence increased with trust (p < 10(-4)), availability of RDT (p < 10(-5)), and training about the policy. Physician adhesion, training and confidence are essential to this policy and to changing physician behavior. Improvement of the health system is also needed.
