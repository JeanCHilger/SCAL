Assessment of the management of cases of fever and malaria by general practitioners in the central Highlands of Madagascar, 2009-2010. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of confirmed malaria among patients with fever in the central Highlands of Madagascar, the clinical utility of treating this fever, and the involvement of community general practitioners in improving malaria management. This descriptive, prospective study took place from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. Patients consulting for fever were classified into 2 groups: the first (G1) included all children younger than 5 years and the second group (G2) children 5 years or older and adults. In G1, 1383 cases of fever included 145 (10.5%) confirmed cases of malaria. The corresponding numbers in G2 were 1172 and 276 (23.5%). The prevalence of malaria was highest between December and May. In G1, the main clinical signs associated with a positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) were pallor, jaundice, seizures, and failure to eat. In G2, a positive RDT was associated with pallor, coma, and jaundice. Treatment of patients with positive RDTs was based on quinine (51%) or artemisinin-based combination therapy (49%). Malaria remains endemic in the central Highlands of Madagascar. Efforts should be undertaken to improve prescription of antimalarial drugs.
