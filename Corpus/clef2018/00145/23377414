A case of insulinoma detected by (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT and missed by (18)F-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET/CT. A 65-year-old woman with suspected insulinoma on the basis of clinical, biochemical, and conventional imaging data underwent F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) PET/CT and Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT. F-DOPA PET/CT did not show any focal uptake in the pancreas, whereas Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT showed a focal area of intense uptake in the pancreatic tail. The patient underwent surgery and an insulinoma of about 20 mm in diameter was detected in the pancreatic tail. F-DOPA PET may fail in localizing insulin secreting tumors in adults in these cases, the use of Ga-somatostatin analogs may lead to the correct diagnosis.
