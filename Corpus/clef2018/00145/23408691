Use of the rapid BinaxNOW malaria test in a 24-hour laboratory associated with accurate detection and decreased malaria testing turnaround times in a pediatric setting where malaria is not endemic. The impact of implementing the BinaxNow malaria test was evaluated. From 288 tests, 34 malaria cases were detected. Laboratory turnaround time decreased from 9.8 to 1.7 h for report of any Plasmodium spp., 10.2 to 1.6 h for P. falciparum, and 8.6 to 1.1 h for any result.
