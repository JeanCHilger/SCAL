Primary pancreatic tuberculosis: a rare and elusive diagnosis. Primary pancreatic tuberculosis is an extremely rare entity, even in tuberculosis endemic areas. A 22-year-old male presented with features of obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scan showed mass in the pancreatic head for which he underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy. Histological examination of the specimen showed caseating granulomas. Antituberculous medicines were started and he remained well 18 months after surgery. Pancreatic tuberculosis is rare and is frequently confused with pancreatic cancer on clinical presentation as well as on imaging studies. A high index of suspicion is vital to avoid surgeries in this medically treatable, often misdiagnosed condition.
