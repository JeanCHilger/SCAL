Pancreatic pseudocyst as a differential diagnosis to dissections aortic aneyrism. Pancreatic pseudocyst, a common complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis, can be an important differential diagnosis to aorta aneurism. A 46-year-old man under investigation for lung cancer presented with chest pain, dysphagia and dyspnoea. A chest X-ray showed opacity in the mediastinum opposite aorta. A computed tomography revealed a pseudocyst extending from the body of pancreas into the thorax. A mediastinal pseudocyst can cause symptoms due to compression or invasion of surrounding structures. The pseudocyst was successfully treated using endoscopic ultrasound guided transgastric drainage.
