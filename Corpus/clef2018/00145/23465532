Artemisinin based combination therapy in travel medicine. A steadily increasing number of Western travellers are exposed to malaria. Also, numbers of migrants from malarious areas are increasing. Fast and effective treatment options are needed to ensure effective malaria treatment in these groups in the future. Artemisinin combinations are well tolerated and have shown high efficacy in malaria endemic areas. Since 2001, 42 malaria endemic countries, 23 of them in Africa, have adopted artemisinin based combination therapies recommended by WHO. An additional 14 countries are in the process of changing their malaria treatment policy. Studies in non-immune travellers confirm a rapid parasite clearance time and very low rate of side effects. Outpatient clinics and hospitals in non-endemic countries should have standard operating procedures for diagnosing and managing patients with malaria. In this setting, artemisinin combinations should be available for treatment of uncomplicated malaria as they are clearly superior to any other oral antimalarial in their fast reduction of parasite biomass and in decreasing clinical symptoms. Also, they are the drugs of choice for travellers who are advised to carry stand-by emergency treatment during their journey.
