Technical note on complete excision of choledochal cysts. Choledochal cysts are congenital cystic dilatations of the extrahepatic or intrahepatic portion of the biliary tree. Complete excision of choledochal cysts is currently regarded as the gold standard treatment, while less extensive procedures including cystoduodenostomy have become obsolete due to the potential for malignant change in the remnant cyst. For type-1 choledochal cysts, which sometimes extend to the main pancreatic duct closely, some surgeons may adopt a less aggressive approach in order to avoid damage to the main pancreatic duct as such damage can lead to serious consequences. However, incomplete excision of choledochal cysts may also cause problems.Here we report on a reoperation treating incomplete excision of a choledochal cyst with focus on the technical aspect.In the reoperation, meticulous dissection of the liver hilum which had been previously operated on was performed. The hepaticojejunostomy was left intact. With the assistance of intraoperative cholangiography, the residual pancreatic portion of the choledochal cyst was completely excised. The pancreatic opening and the lower end of the common bile duct were reconstructed. Whipple operation was avoided.Careful planning with the aid of precise imaging before and during the operation largely enhanced the accuracy of the excision of the choledochal cyst.
