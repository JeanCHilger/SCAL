Measuring malaria by passive case detection: a new perspective based on Zambian experience. Most measurements of malaria are based on cross-sectional data and do not reflect the dynamic nature of transmission, particularly when interventions require timely data for planning strategies. Such data can be collected from local rural health centres (RHCs) where the infrastructure is sufficiently developed and where rapid diagnostics are in use. Because in rural areas, the population served by RHC is reasonably static, the regular use of malaria rapid diagnosis in RHCs can provide data to assess local weekly incidence rates, and such data are easily dispersed by cell phones. Essentially each RHC is a potential sentinel site that can deliver critical information to programme planners. Data collected during this process of passive case detection over a five-year period in the Macha area of Zambia show the importance of ecological zones and refugia in the seasonal fluctuation of malaria cases. If this process is implemented nationally it can assist in planning efficient use of resources and may contribute to local management and even elimination of malaria in this region.
