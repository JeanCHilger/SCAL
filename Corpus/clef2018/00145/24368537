18F-FDG and FDG-labeled leukocyte PET/CT in peritoneal tuberculosis. The authors present a 20-year-old patient with clinical suspicion of acute pancreatic infection. PET/CT showed significantly higher uptake of F-FDG alone compared with FDG-labeled autologous leukocytes in peritoneal thickening and omental deposits, with no abnormal pancreatic uptake of either tracer. Further investigation led to a diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis.
