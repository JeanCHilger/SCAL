Epidermoid cyst of an intrapancreatic accessory spleen: a case report and literature review. An epidermoid cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen is a rare lesion. Despite advances in radiologic techniques, in most cases it has been diagnosed preoperatively as a possible pancreatic neoplasm.Herein, we present a 63-year-old Caucasian woman, diagnosed preoperatively with enhanced-contrast abdominal computed tomography, as having a potential cystic tumor in the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, and the histological examination revealed the presence of an epidermoid cyst of an accessory intrapancreatic spleen.Familiarity with the imaging features, the clinical presentation and the location of the cyst are important to consider if this rare entity is to be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.
