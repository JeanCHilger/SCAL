Pancreatic abnormalities detected by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in patients without clinical signs of pancreatic disease: any difference between standard and Rosemont classification scoring? The prevalence of nine EUS features of chronic pancreatitis (CP) according to the standard Wiersema classification has been investigated in 489 patients undergoing EUS for an indication not related to pancreatico-biliary disease. We showed that 82 subjects (16.8%) had at least one ductular or parenchymal abnormality. Among them, 18 (3.7% of study population) had ≥3 Wiersema criteria suggestive of CP. Recently, a new classification (Rosemont) of EUS findings consistent, suggestive or indeterminate for CP has been proposed.To stratify healthy subjects into different subgroups on the basis of EUS features of CP according to the Wiersema and Rosemont classifications and to evaluate the agreement in the diagnosis of CP with the two scoring systems. Weighted kappa statistics was computed to evaluate the strength of agreement between the two scoring systems. Univariate and multivariate analysis between any EUS abnormality and habits were performed.Eighty-two EUS videos were reviewed. Using the Wiersema classification, 18 subjects showed ≥3 EUS features suggestive of CP. The EUS diagnosis of CP in these 18 subjects was considered as consistent in only one patient, according to Rosemont classification. Weighted Kappa statistics was 0.34 showing that the strength of agreement was 'fair'. Alcohol use and smoking were identified as risk factors for having pancreatic abnormalities on EUS.The prevalence of EUS features consistent or suggestive of CP in healthy subjects according to the Rosemont classification is lower than that assessed by Wiersema criteria. In that regard the Rosemont classification seems to be more accurate in excluding clinically relevant CP. Overall agreement between the two classifications is fair.
