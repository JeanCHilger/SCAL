Adrenal lymphangioma masquerading as a pancreatic tail cyst. Cystic lymphangiomas of the adrenal gland are rare. A 79-year-old female presented in the emergency room with epigastric discomfort, and an immovable mass was palpated in her abdomen upon physical examination. Imaging studies revealed a large cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail. The radiologic impression ruled out the possibility of a mucinous cystic neoplasm, or a pseudocyst in the pancreas. The operative findings demonstrated that the cystic mass originated in the left adrenal gland. A laparoscopic excision of the cystic mass was performed, and immunohistochemistry confirmed that this mass was a lymphangioma of the adrenal gland. Several prior reports have suggested that lymphangioma can mimic renal or splenic cysts. However, lymphangioma cases mimicking pancreatic cysts are very rare.
