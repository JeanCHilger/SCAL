A post-intubation tracheal rupture in intensive care unit. Tracheal rupture is one of the most serious post-intubation complication. However, it is widely underestimated.An 86-year-old patient with a history of pancreas adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabin was admitted in intensive care unit for an acute respiratory failure with no identified etiology. The worsening of her respiratory status required invasive mechanical ventilation. One laryngoscopy, performed by a trained operator, found a Cormack 1. Intubation was realized without stylet and the cuff inflated with a syringe. Hemodynamic instability, impaired gas exchange and an extensive subcutaneous emphysema occurred immediately. A CT-scan showed a supracarinal tracheal rupture.The etiological analysis of this case identifies several causes of pars membranosa fragility, such as female sex, age greater than 50 years and the short stature. The emergency intubation and the cuff inflated by a syringe were the risk factors of tracheal rupture in this patient.Special care should be paid to this complication, early diagnosis has probably a prognostic value. Training operators in the use of stylets and monitoring cuff pressure are required.
