CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of abdominal masses. Fine needle aspiration biopsy were made under CT guidance of 50 cases of intra-abdominal masses, including liver in 37 cases, kidney in 6, pancreas and spleen in 1 respectively, and 5 biopsies were made of tumors of the abdominal cavity. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 92%, and the accuracy for malignancies was 84.6%. No complications occurred related to the procedure. The relevant factors for precise biopsy safety and the therapeutic value of this technique were discussed. It was concluded that CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy is precise in localization, it is a safe approach yielding satisfactory diagnostic accuracy.
