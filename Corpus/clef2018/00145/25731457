A case of a patient who underwent resection of the remnant pancreatic cancer following a distal pancreatectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma. Herein, we report the case of a patient who underwent resection of the remnant pancreas for pancreatic cancer following a distal pancreatectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma. An 81-year-old woman underwent a distal pancreatectomy. The tumor was found to be pancreatic cancer. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as a poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (Stage I). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) performed 17 months later revealed a 13 mm tumor in the remnant pancreatic head. A remnant pancreatectomy was performed. The histological diagnosis was a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (StageIII). Remnant pancreatic cancer is rare following a pancreatectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma. The course of remnant pancreatic cancer can be followed with imaging. Long-term follow-up of patients who have undergone a pancreatectomyis, therefore, essential.
