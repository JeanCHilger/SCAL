A case of locoregional recurrence of gastric carcinoma that was treated using pancreaticoduodenectomy. A 71-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer in November 2011. The corresponding pathological diagnosis was of well differentiated adenocarcinoma, pT4a(SE), N1(2/15), H0, P0,M0, pStage IIIA. TS-1 was administered as an adjuvant therapy for one year from the second month after the operation. During the 16th month after the operation, we found an elevated tumor marker level and locoregional recurrence near the pancreas head and the abdominal wall upon computed tomography. We could not find any other suspected tumor recurrence using positron-emission tomography and computed tomography. We performed a pancreaticoduodenectomy and transverse colon merger resection in June 2013. Although the tumor marker was again found to be elevated during the second month after the metastasectomy, chemotherapy was continued because obstructive jaundice and gastrointestinal obstruction were prevented by the operation.
