Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology in pancreaticobiliary carcinomas: diagnostic efficacy of cell-block immunocytochemistry. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was demonstrated to be a useful tool for the diagnosis and staging of pancreaticobiliary neoplastic lesions. Nonetheless, the diagnostic value of this procedure may be limited by low cellularity of the specimen, contamination of intestinal cells and unfeasibility of ancillary immunocytochemical procedures. The present study was to evaluate its usefulness in the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions.A series of 46 pancreaticobiliary carcinomas with available cell block preparations was submitted to immunocytochemistry against cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, E-cadherin, CD10 and p53. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the cytological smear in the discrimination of malignant lesions were calculated and compared with those of cell block preparation with the immunocytochemical stains against p53 and CD10.According to our findings, the use of cell block preparations together with immunostains against p53 and CD10 allowed to discriminate malignant versus benign specimens with higher sensitivity than the only cytological examination. In detail, CD10 immunostaining was of significant help for the discrimination between cytological contaminants, such as benign gastrointestinal cells, and the neoplastic elements of pancreaticobiliary well differentiated adenocarcinomas. Also, intense nuclear immunoreactivity for p53 was encountered in about 2/3 of the cases and identified pancreatic malignancy with high sensitivity.We suggest that immunocytochemistry against both CD10 and p53 could be applied case by case, mainly to differentiate gastrointestinal and pancreatic benign cellular contaminants showing hyperplasia or reactive changes from differentiated pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas.
