Desmoid Tumor of the Pancreas: Case Report and Review of a Rare Entity. Desmoid tumors, also known as desmoid-type fibromatoses or aggressive fibromatoses, are clonal fibroblastic proliferations that arise in the deep soft tissues. They are characterized by infiltrative growth, a tendency toward local recurrence and the inability to metastasize. We present a case of a 63-year-old woman who complained of abdominal pain, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a well-circumscribed tumor in the pancreatic tail, measuring 5.1 cm. A left-sided, spleen-preserving pancreatic resection was performed, and pathological analysis showed a mesenchymal tumor. The diagnosis of a pancreatic desmoid tumor was made based on the characteristic morphology and the immune phenotype of the tumor. The English-language literature on pancreatic desmoid tumors was reviewed. In total, 16 previous cases were identified.
