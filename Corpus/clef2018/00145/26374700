Long-standing insulinoma: two case reports and review of the literature. Insulinomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors. Most are benign and solitary. However, the nonspecific symptoms and small size of these tumors led to difficulties of diagnosis and localization.We present two Arab patients with pancreatic long-standing insulinoma. Both patients presented episodic hypoglycemic symptoms respectively during 10 and 2 years. Biochemical and morphological workup detected localized pancreatic insulinoma. Open procedure surgery was done for the two patients and insulinomas were successfully removed by enucleation.Insulinoma remains a diagnostic challenge to practitioners. Diagnosis of suspected cases is easily confirmed by standard endocrine tests, especially the supervised fasting test. Accurate preoperative localization is essential for more effective and safest surgery.
