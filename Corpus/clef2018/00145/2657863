Unusual manifestations of echinococcosis. Hydatid disease is mostly located in the liver. It then has a characteristic appearance allowing a definite diagnosis by means of ultrasound and/or CT examination. Isolated extrahepatic infestation is much less common. We report a number of cases of hydatid cysts in the tail of the pancreas, the adrenal, the spleen, and in bones and muscles. With reference to these examples we discuss the potential usefulness of radiological examination for the diagnosis and also its limitations and the pitfalls that may be encountered.
