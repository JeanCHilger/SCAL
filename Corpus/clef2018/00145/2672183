Pancreatic pseudocysts. Treatment with percutaneous drainage. Recent advances in the field of imaging diagnosis, particularly sonography and CAT, have permitted the development of the so-called interventional radiology techniques, which have made it possible to resolve a series of complex problems like intraperitoneal abscess and pancreatic pseudocyst. We present the results of treatment of a series of 9 patients diagnosed as pancreatic pseudocyst using percutaneous drainage directed by sonography or CAT. Seven of the pseudocysts were secondary to episodes of acute pancreatitis and two derived from chronic pancreatitis. In 8 of the patients a complete resolution of the process was achieved, in one case after a second drainage attempt when the pseudocyst recurred one year later. The success rate was 88.8% and morbidity and mortality were null.
