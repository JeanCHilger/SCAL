Late complications of pancreatic trauma. Pancreatic trauma is rare and experience concerning its management is consequently limited. Lessons learnt in the investigation and treatment of a group of 11 patients (median age 28.0 years, range 14-44 years), who presented with the sequelae of trauma, are described. These patients were referred to a centre with an interest in pancreatic disease at a median time of 6.0 months (range 1.5-34 months) after blunt (n = 9) or penetrating (n = 2) injury to the pancreas. Ten of the 11 patients had undergone either single (n = 4) or multiple (n = 6) previous operations. Ten of the 11 patients had either strictures or disruptions of the main pancreatic duct demonstrated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and ultrasonography (n = 8) or by exploration of the pancreas (n = 2). Satisfactory results were achieved by non-operative treatment in one patient and by distal pancreatectomy in eight. One further patient, who underwent distal pancreatectomy, later required completion resection because of unsuspected ductal injury in the head of the gland. The final patient continued with symptoms of pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy. It is concluded that the non-resolving sequelae of pancreatic trauma are associated with injury to the main pancreatic duct and that specialist investigation should be performed before surgical intervention is contemplated.
