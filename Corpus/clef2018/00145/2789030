Pancreatic transection. A concept of evolving injury. We describe the difficulties in diagnosing a pancreatic injury in two patients with multiple injuries who did not have an obvious need for a celiotomy. Multiple diagnostic tests were employed, but in each patient, there was a delay in the diagnosis of the injury. A pancreatic injury may evolve over time so that repetitive clinical diagnostic studies may be required to evaluate the condition of these patients.
