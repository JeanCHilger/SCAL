Nuclear magnetic resonance of the liver, spleen, and pancreas. This review includes the initial experience with NMR imaging of the liver, spleen, and pancreas at the University of California, San Francisco, using a prototype 0.35 Tesla system. This experience shows great promise for detection of hepatic metastases using T1-weighted pulse sequences. T2-weighted pulse sequences appear sensitive for detecting cavernous hemangioma of the liver and may allow tissue specific discrimination of the benign lesion from cancer. NMR is also suitable for evaluating diffuse metabolic alterations and is sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of iron overload. Detection of fatty liver requires use of chemical shift techniques as conventional NMR imaging pulse sequences are relatively insensitive. Motion artifacts and lack of an effective bowel contrast agent limits imaging of the pancreas and retroperitoneum, where CT remains the procedure of choice. The normal spleen has longer T1 and T2 relaxation times than liver or pancreas and NMR has not been successful in diagnosing splenic metastases or lymphoma on a routine basis. We conclude that NMR imaging will be valuable in the diagnosis of focal liver disorders until fast scan techniques and effective magnetic contrast agents are available for oral and/or intravenous use, other abdominal applications will remain limited.
