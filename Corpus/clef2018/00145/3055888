Cystic pancreatic tumors: CT and sonographic assessment. Thirty-five CT scans and 23 sonograms of 45 pathologically proved pancreatic cystic neoplasms (16 microcystic adenomas, 17 mucinous [macrocystic] cystadenomas, and 12 mucinous [macrocystic] cystadenocarcinomas) in 43 patients were retrospectively and blindly reviewed. Radiologic findings and their usefulness in differentiating microcystic from mucinous subtypes were assessed. The number of cysts within the tumors (more than six in microcystic adenomas and six or fewer in mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas) and the diameter of the majority of cysts within the tumor (less than or equal to 2 cm in microcystic adenomas and greater than 2 cm in mucinous tumors) were the most helpful radiologic findings in differentiating tumor types. Calcification was present in 38% of microcystic adenomas, 18% of mucinous cystadenomas, and 8% of mucinous cystadenocarcinomas by CT. Calcification was not definitely identified on any of the sonograms. A central scar was identified in only two (13%) of 16 microcystic adenomas. Blind retrospective review was often able to correctly classify tumors as either microcystic (CT, 93% sonography, 78%) or mucinous (CT, 95%
