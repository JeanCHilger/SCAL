Gastric intramural pseudocyst of the pancreas. We describe a patient in whom a pseudocyst of the pancreatic tail ruptured into the wall of the stomach. Because of the intramural location of this lesion, its sonographic and computed tomographic features were those of a gastric tumor. The correct diagnosis was made only by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which showed extravasation of contrast material from the pancreatic duct into a nonhomogeneous cystic cavity.
