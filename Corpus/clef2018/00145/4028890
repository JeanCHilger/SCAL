Correlation of clinical and computed tomographic findings for therapy and prognosis of acute pancreatitis. A prospective study was performed in 156 patients with acute pancreatitis to find out the value of computed tomography for the diagnosis and early prognosis. The CT finding leads to a diagnosis and differentiation in 3 risk groups similar to the clinical staging. The prognostic value of CT depends on the reproducible grading of pancreatic swelling and the grade of extrapancreatic fluid collections. CT finding correlates with early prognostic factors and the clinical staging, leading to different risk groups which allows an adequate stage-depending therapy of patients with acute pancreatitis.
