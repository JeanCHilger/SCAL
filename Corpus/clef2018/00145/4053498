Scar tissue, organ atrophy and hypertrophy in the computed tomogram after abdominal surgery. After resection of parenchymal abdominal organs the developing scar tissue is characterised by fat (-30 to -50 H.U.) in connection with mesenchymal funicles. Differential diagnosis presents no problem. Atrophy and hypertrophy may sometimes be demonstrated in CT. This is valid for compensating hypertrophy of the remaining parts of the liver, splenic regeneration or an accessory spleen. Furthermore, involution of the tail of the pancreas after proximal duodenopancreatectomy could be shown in CT. One pancreatic calcification decreased after drainage of a pseudocyst.
