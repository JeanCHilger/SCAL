Computed tomography of the gastrointestinal tract: lesion recognition and pitfalls. Abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract will be found on computed tomography (CT) scans performed for other indications if they are carefully searched for. This potential will increase as CT is used earlier in the investigation of suspected abnormalities of the pancreas. retroperitoneum, and liver. Additionally, CT may be valuable in assessing the extent of a known primary lesion of the alimentary tract.
