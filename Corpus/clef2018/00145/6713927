Computed tomography of renal agenesis and ectopy. The position and shape of the organs normally adjacent to the kidney were evaluated by computed tomography in seven patients with renal agenesis and in two patients with unilateral renal ectopy. The major findings were displacement of colonic flexures, small intestine loops, duodenum, spleen, and tail of the pancreas. The shape and position of the adrenal gland was found abnormal in cases with left-sided anomaly. Genital abnormalities such as absent seminal vesicle were frequently encountered. The presence of abnormally shaped adrenal glands in patients with left renal agenesis and ectopy is a new diagnostic radiologic sign for these conditions.
