Surgical treatment of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. 15 cases of acute necrotizing pancreatitis are reported. The necessity of early diagnosis and operative treatment are emphasized. Axial computerized tomography is a major progress in the diagnosis. As for the operative treatment we advocate a wide drainage of the pancreatic area, a gastrostomy for suction, a cholecystostomy and a jejunostomy for nutrition. Postoperative mortality is, however, around 27%.
