Indications and diagnostic value of computer tomography diagnosis of the abdomen. The remarkable advantages of computerized tomography are graphic and numerical recording of very small differences in radiation absorption as well as presentation of the transverse body section. In the liver cysts, hematomas, abscesses and tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter can be diagnosed. To some extent differentiation between these lesions can be achieved by density measurements. Obstructive jaundice is another indication for computer tomography of the liver, the bile ducts and of the gall bladder. However, gall stones cannot be detected. The pancreas can be visualized in about 90% of all patients. Pseudocysts can be differentiated from inflammatory edema or tumors. The carcinoma of the pancreas does not differ in density from normal or inflammatory parenchyma. Therefore the diagnosis of carcinoma of the pancreas is still limited, although improvement has been achieved as well. The kidneys can be very well outlined on CT-images. Diagnostic assessment can be improved by application of contrast media. Recognition of cysts, urinary obstructions and tumors are possible with a high diagnostic reliability. Computerized tomography cannot replace the conventional diagnostic procedures in the future the combination of several examinations will still be necessary.
