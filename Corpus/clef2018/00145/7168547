Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography in von Hippel-Lindau disease. 47 subjects belonging to four families with von Hippel-Lindau disease were examined using ultrasound and computed tomography. The subjects had no abdominal symptoms. At renal examinations carcinomas in two, haemangioma in one and cysts in eight persons were detected. Pancreatic cysts were found in four persons. Ultrasound and computed tomography examinations of the visceral organs are easy, non-invasive and safe for members of families with von Hippel-Lindau disease. An annual ultrasound visceral follow-up examination is advisable to detect manifestations of the disease as these become more common with age. It is especially important to detect and treat renal cell carcinomas as early as possible.
