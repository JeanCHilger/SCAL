Post-splenectomy: true mass and pseudomass ultrasound diagnosis. Ultrasound plays a major role in the evaluation of mass lesions in the postoperative period. Diagnostic pitfalls may occur in post-splenectomy cases when stomach and bowel loops settle into the splenic fossa and simulate mass lesions. While true masses such as subphrenic abscess, pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst are essentially unchanging in appearance or location when scanned in varying patient positions, pseudomasses of stomach or bowel loops often do change, Awareness of possible post-splenectomy pseudomass is important in order to avoid confusing the gastrointestinal tract with a pathological condition.
