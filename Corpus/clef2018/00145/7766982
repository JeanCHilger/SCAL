Delineation of pancreas with MR imaging: multiobserver comparison of five pulse sequences. The authors compared five magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pulse sequences for their ability to depict the pancreas in 59 patients, each evaluated with at least two of the five sequences. Focal pancreatic carcinomas were present in eight patients. The five sequences were T1-weighted spin echo (T1-SE), fat-suppressed T1-SE (T1-FS), T1-weighted gradient echo (T1-GRE), T2-weighted SE (T2-SE), and T2-weighted fast spin echo (T2-FSE). Using repeated-measures analysis, three blinded observers independently reviewed 198 separate MR imaging series and rated them on a 5-point scale with regard to image quality and depiction of pancreatic borders and the number of sections containing pancreatic and common bile ducts. The most superior and most inferior sections containing pancreas were recorded for each sequence in each patient. The results were compared with analysis of variance, and interobserver agreement was measured with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). For image quality, all sequences were rated good to excellent, with the T1-SE sequence having the highest rating. For clarity of pancreatic borders, however, the T1-FS sequence was rated significantly higher (P < .006) than the other sequences the T2-SE sequence was least satisfactory. Common bile and pancreatic ducts were seen in the most sections with the T2-FSE sequence. There were no significant differences regarding identification of the most superior and inferior sections containing pancreas, and the ICC was high (.91-.97) for all sequences. For detecting focal carcinomas, no single pulse sequence was sufficient.
