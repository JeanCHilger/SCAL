Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and endoscopic ultrasound for the diagnosis of insulinoma and gastrinoma. In a prospective study of 13 patients (three males and 10 females mean age 53 [8-82] years) the value of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was compared with transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of insulinoma (six patients) or gastrinoma (seven patients). There were ten separate primary lesions of each tumour type, proven histologically. For insulinoma the sensitivity of EUS was 90%, SRS 10% and CT, US and MRI together 20%. For gastrinoma the sensitivity of EUS was 90%, SRS 100%, and 30% for the other three methods together. Thus EUS had a high diagnostic localizing sensitivity for both tumours, while SRS was highly sensitive only in the diagnosis of gastrinoma, not insulinoma. The value of CT, MRI and conventional ultrasonography lies in their ability to visualize distant metastases.
