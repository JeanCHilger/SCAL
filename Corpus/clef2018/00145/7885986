Seeking a correlation between functional and imaging findings in patients after acute alcoholic pancreatitis. The aim of the present study was to correlate the imaging and functional findings in patients who recovered from acute alcoholic pancreatitis (a.a.p.). 35 patients, 4-7 years following acute alcoholic pancreatitis underwent: secretin-cerulein test (SCT), ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) of pancreas. Control group comprised 15 patients in which endoscopic, imaging and functional findings excluded organic G.I. disease. Exocrine function impairment was stated in 65.7%. US revealed pancreatic changes in 37.1% patients and CT--in 45.7%. Significant correlation between the degree of structure abnormalities in imaging techniques nad the severity of exocrine pancreatic function impairment was found (p < or = 0.05). However, in about one third of the patients studied, changes revealed in imaging techniques were not accompanied by function impairment and vice versa. Patients after acute alcoholic pancreatitis should be followed-up to early recognize and treat the revealed changes. Imaging and functional methods should be considered as strictly complementary.
