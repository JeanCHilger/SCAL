Implication of laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology in the staging of early pancreatic cancer. Staging of pancreatic cancer still represents a challenge for surgeons involved in this field. Diagnostic methods of radiological imaging used routinely (CT, NMR, angiography) may understage this neoplasm. In fact, the presence of peritoneal or subglissonian hepatic micrometastases (< 2 cm) is a frequent surprise at laparotomy and forces the surgeon to use a palliative procedure. Actually this policy has not to be followed because the possibility to perform non-surgical palliation of jaundice or pain respectively by percutaneous radiological stent insertion and celiac alcoholization. In this viewpoint, preoperative staging has acquired an important role for a correct treatment, be it surgical or medical. Laparoscopy allows it to overcome the understaging produced by the more common diagnostic means, with the possibility to view directly the celomatic space and the surface of the abdominal viscera moreover, during this procedure it is possible to perform a peritoneal washing to obtain other information about the cancer stage. In our experience, 56 patients were judged as resectable by radiologic methods
