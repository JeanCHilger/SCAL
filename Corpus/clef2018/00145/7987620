Diagnostic tests in chronic pancreatitis. We review the values of various tests in the diagnosis of suspected chronic pancreatitis, and we give a practical approach to diagnosis. Most cases can be diagnosed by a consideration of history, simple radiology, and serum enzymes. Problems arise in patients with noncalcific early chronic pancreatitis, in whom pain alone is the main feature. In these patients, a sequence of tests may be required to arrive at a diagnosis of probable or possible pancreatitis to one that is proven. In some cases, only time will tell.
