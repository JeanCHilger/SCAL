Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in children and adolescents. Nineteen children and adolescents, mean age 9.6 +/- 1.2 years, underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Indications for ERCP were cholestasis in 11 cases, suspected pancreatic disease or trauma in 8 cases. Equipment and technique used for papilla catheterisation were similar to those routinely used in adults. Bile duct or pancreatic opacification were successfully obtained in all cases. Transient acute pancreatitis following the procedure was observed in one patient, and resolved spontaneously. ERCP confirmed diagnosis suspected after ultrasound study and abdominal CT scan in 9 patients. In the remaining 10 cases, diagnosis was only made by ERCP. Twelve patients were operated based on ERCP results. We conclude that ERCP is rarely performed in children, but remains as useful as in adults in biliary and pancreatic examination.
