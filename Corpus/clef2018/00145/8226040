Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. In a routine check-up a cystic tumour of the head of the pancreas was found in a asymptomatic 59-year-old man. As the investigation with several radiological means was not conclusive and there was found an increased value for CEA in the cysts liquid a explorative laparotomy was performed. Already the intraoperatively performed histology confirmed the diagnosis of a benign lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. After local resection the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient is today, one year later, disease-free. Lymphoepithelial tumours are well known in the parotis whereas in the pancreas only 5 cases have been reported. For positivity for CA 19-9 marker we found some evidence for the hypothesis that these kind of cysts could derive from metaplastic tissue in obstructed pancreatic ducts.
