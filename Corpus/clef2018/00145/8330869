Receptor scintigraphy with 111In-pentetreotide for endocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Receptor scintigraphy with 111In-pentetreotide is a simple method with a sensitivity of 86% for the localization of the primary tumor and its metastases in patients presenting with the clinical and biochemical symptoms of an endocrine tumor of the gastrointestinal tract or the pancreas. As a whole-body scintigraphic technique it covers all body regions and is also able to reveal small tumors which either cannot be detected or can only be detected with difficulty by the usual imaging methods. In 85 patients with GEP tumors or after operative removal of such tumors, receptor scintigraphy proved to be superior to ultrasound and computed tomography in 34%, equal in 52%, and inferior in 14% of the cases.
