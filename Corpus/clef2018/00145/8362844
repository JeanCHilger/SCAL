A case of radical resection for solid cystic tumor of the pancreas with widespread metastases in the liver and greater omentum. Solid cystic tumor (SCT) of the pancreas is known to be a low-grade malignant tumor and distant metastasis is very rare. A 50-year-old Japanese female was hospitalized because of a large mass in the upper abdomen. Computerized tomography revealed a large calcified tumor in the body-tail of the pancreas, and multiple liver tumors. Abdominal angiography demonstrated the pancreatic tumor and multiple hepatic tumors as a hypervascular mass, and disclosed a small tumor stain in the branch of the right gastroepiploic artery. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, extended right hepatic lobectomy, and removal of the omental metastases. Histopathological and electron microscopic studies made a definitive diagnosis of SCT. She is well without any signs of tumor recurrence 1 yr and 2 months after the operation. This may be the first patient receiving simultaneous radical resection for both the main tumor and widespread distant metastases.
