Intraductal mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas: imaging findings. To evaluate the radiologic characteristics of intraductal mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas.Sixteen patients with intraductal tumors underwent ultrasound (US) (n = 15), computed tomography (CT)Lesions were classified as either main duct type or branch duct type tumors. Main duct tumors were characterized at US and CT by either diffuse or segmental dilatation of the Wirsung duct. Pancreatography showed ductal dilatation and filling defects caused by mucin deposits. At US and CT, branch duct tumors, which were mainly located at the uncinate process, were seen as fluid-filled masses with central septa and the pancreatic duct was dilated. ERCP showed partial or complete opacification of the lesion. In four patients, endoscopy showed protrusion of the papilla into the duodenal lumen and mucin leaking from its dilated orifice.Imaging modalities, especially US and ERCP, enable early diagnosis of mucin-producing pancreatic tumors.
