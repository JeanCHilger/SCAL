Response of small cell carcinoma of pancreas to a small cell lung cancer regimen: a case report. Small cell carcinoma of the pancreas is a very rare malignancy with 18 cases reported in the literature, of which only 3 were treated with chemotherapy. A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma originating in the head of the pancreas and invading the duodenum. He was treated with a similar approach as for localized small cell lung cancer, with six cycles of combination chemotherapy and local radiotherapy, and went into complete remission. After 3 months, he developed liver metastases along with an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node. He was treated with two cycles of CVA, but developed lung metastases and was treated with ifosfamide/mesna. However, his overall condition deteriorated and hospice care was instituted until the patient's demise. The patient survived 14 months following diagnosis, significantly longer than the 15 reported patients with small cell pancreatic carcinomas not treated with chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy as it is utilized for small cell lung cancer appear to be beneficial for small cell carcinoma of the pancreas.
