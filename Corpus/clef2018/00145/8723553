Pulmonary infiltrations. Sign of severe acute pancreatitis. Pleural infiltrates are indicative of severe acute pancreatitis and a negative prognostic parameter for the course of the disease.The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of pulmonary infiltrates in acute pancreatitis and their importance for evaluating the severity of the disease.Incidence and localization of pulmonary infiltrates were evaluated in 140 patients with acute pancreatitis. Chest X-ray was obtained within 24 h, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography within 72 h after admission. Ranson's prognostic parameters were estimated within the first 48 h.Patients with pulmonary infiltrates (n = 36, 26%) had a significantly higher Ranson's score and pancreatic necroses more frequently than patients without this complication, plus a higher mortality rate.
