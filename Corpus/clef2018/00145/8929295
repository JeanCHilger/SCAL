Imaging features of type 1 hereditary tyrosinemia: a review of 30 patients. Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, a common genetic disorder in the province of Quebec, is characterized by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. In this autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine metabolism, the accumulation of succinylacetone leads to neurologic crises, acute and chronic liver failure, complex renal tubulopathy, rickets and a hemorrhagic syndrome. Liver trans- plantation has dramatically modified the spontaneous course of this lethal disease. The present paper describes the imaging features of tyrosinemia in 30 patients followed from 1980 to 1995 at HÃ´pital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Canada.
