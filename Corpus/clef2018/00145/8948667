Thrombocytopenia in association with a wandering spleen. An ectopic, so-called wandering spleen is an uncommon occurrence. We present the case of a young woman who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have an enlarged spleen, located in the lower abdomen and pelvis. The possibility of lymphoma was entertained because of concomitant findings of thrombocytopenia and a possible mesenteric mass. The mass was subsequently found at laparotomy to be the tail of the malpositioned pancreas, and the thrombocytopenia resolved with splenectomy. Review of the literature indicates that lymphoma is an uncommon finding in wandering spleens, that wandering spleens are enlarged in most cases, and that thrombocytopenia, while uncommon, can be seen, in particular when associated with torsion of an elongated splenic pedicle.
