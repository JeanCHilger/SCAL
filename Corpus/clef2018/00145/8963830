Preoperative diagnosis of pancreas carcinoma: what is necessary and where are the limitations in imaging?. Computed tomography continues to be the imaging modality of choice for staging of pancreatic carcinoma. It has an accuracy of over 70% in predicting tumor resectability and a sensitivity of almost 100% in detecting nonresectable pancreatic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging with the use of recent technical development delivers almost similar results. It can be expected, that introduction of dynamic contrast-enhanced fast sequences will further improve the results of preoperative staging.
