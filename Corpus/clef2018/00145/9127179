This is especially true of pancreatic pseudocysts.We report an interesting case of a pancreatic pseudocyst mimicking a renal cyst on a computed tomography (CT) scan. The clinical anatomy of retroperitoneal spaces and pathways followed by pancreatic secretions is examined. The literature on pancreatic diseases simulating renal disorders is reviewed.
