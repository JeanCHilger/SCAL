Initial experience with non-breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: a new noninvasive technique for the diagnosis of choledochal cyst in children. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an emerging tool for the noninvasive evaluation of the pancreaticobiliary tree.Non-breath-hold MRCP was used in three children to evaluate choledochal cyst a first for this new modality of diagnostic imaging. In all cases, the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, and the pancreatic duct were clearly visualized.Two cases were found to have a fusiform choledochal cyst, and non-breath-hold MRCP demonstrated pancreaticobiliary malunion and a long common channel. In the remaining case, the size and location of the huge cyst prevented visualization of any pancreaticobiliary malunion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in this patient failed to provide any additional information. All patients underwent cyst excision with hepaticoenterostomy, and made an uneventful recovery.Our initial experience suggests that non-breath-hold MRCP is a reliable method for the diagnosis of choledochal cyst in children and could replace ERCP.
