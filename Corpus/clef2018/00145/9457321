Cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas: an unusual cause of the acute surgical abdomen. Cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas is a rare tumour. The authors report on a case of cystic lymphangioma of the pancreas in a 6-year-old boy, presenting an acute abdomen. These tumours are benign and must be differentiated from other cystic abdominal lesions. Histological diagnosis is required in all cases. Treatment consists in a complete resection of the tumour. In most cases a tumorectomy is sufficient, although sometimes pancreatic resection might be necessary.
