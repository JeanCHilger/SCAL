Intrapancreatic accessory spleen: case report. We report a rare case of intrapancreatic accessory spleen which radiologically mimicked a pancreatic hypervascular tumor. The diagnosis of an intrapancreatic accessory spleen should be considered when a pancreatic mass has the CT densities and/or MR signal intensities similar to those of the spleen, with and without contrast medium.
