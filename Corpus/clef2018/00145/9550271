Thirty-eight years experience of malignant hepatic tumors in infants and childhood. A description is given of therapeutic experiences with 39 cases of malignant liver tumors in infancy and childhood during the past 38 years. Of these patients, 9 not undergoing hepatic resection all died, while 18 (60%) of 30 patients treated by hepatic resection survived. When only patients with hepatoblastoma are considered, 14 of 24 patients are alive, although 3 of them had local recurrence and had lung metastasis. Among patients with other types of liver tumor, those with hepatocellular carcinomas (2 cases) and vascular neoplasms all died in a short period of time, whereas 2 with yolk sac tumor and one with metabolic pancreatic tumor are alive despite of tumor recurrence. In summary, the results of surgical treatment of malignant liver tumors in infancy and childhood, which formerly were poor, have been improved remarkably, which we owe mainly to: 1) advances in diagnostic imaging techniques (e.g., angiography, ultrasonography, CT and MRI) permitting early diagnosis, localization of tumor, visualization of the coursing of major vessels (particularly, hepatic artery & vein) and more accurate definition of resectability, 2) technical improvement of hepatic resection and 3) progress of chemotherapy mainly with cisplatin and adriamycin.
