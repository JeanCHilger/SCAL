Endoscopic ultrasonography in pancreatic disease. Endoscopic ultrasound has emerged as an important modality for management of pancreatic disease because of its ability to provide high frequency images of the pancreatic ducts and the parenchyma. Development of interventional techniques under endosonographic guidance has further advanced the potential use of this technique in pancreatic disorders. This paper shows and reviews the current knowledge on endoscopic ultrasound in pancreatic imaging.
