Diagnosis and management of metastatic gastrinoma by multimodality treatment including liver transplantation: report of a case. Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas are being recognized with increasing frequency, not because the incidence has increased, but as a result of improvements in diagnostic tools such as radioimmunoassays for a variety of circulating peptides, and imaging methods that include positron emission tomography (PET) and immunoscintigraphy. Nevertheless, establishing the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor is always a challenge to the clinician from both diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. Liver transplantation as the ultimate therapeutic, or at least palliative, option for hepatic metastases has produced contradictory results over the past decade. We report herein the case of a 23-year-old woman who, after being diagnosed with gastrinoma in 1989, underwent the complete therapeutic array including liver transplantation for hepatic metastases in 1991. Although an extrahepatic tumor recurred 2 years later, for which double chemotherapy with 5-FU and streptozotocin was given, she is currently leading a normal life with a full-time job. This case prompted a critical review of the current literature on diagnosis and medical and surgical treatment.
