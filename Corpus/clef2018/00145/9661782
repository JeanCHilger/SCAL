Role of ultrasonic investigations in diagnosis of pancreatic diffuse pathology in flying personnel. The article presents data of a complex clinical/radiation examination of flying personnel with diagnosed diffuse pathologies of pancreas. Consistent patterns of the fibrotic process in pancreatic parenchyma were related to professional specifics. Preponderance of ultrasonic investigations, mathematical analyses, and X-ray computer tomography for the enhanced diagnostic algorithm for the medical certification of flying personnel were demonstrated.
