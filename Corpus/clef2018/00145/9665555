Annular pancreas diagnosed by single-shot MR cholangiopancreatography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has become widely used due to the rapid advances made as a non-invasive diagnostic method for the pancreatobiliary ducts. We report a case with annular pancreas in an adult in whom the pancreatic duct in the annular portion could be clearly visualized by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which was very useful for the definite diagnosis as annular pancreas.
