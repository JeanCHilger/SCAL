Aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori and regression of gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with low-grade gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (stage IE) and Helicobacter pylori infection. She received a 2-week course of omeprazole and clarithromycin, resulting in eradication of H. pylori and histological disappearance of the lymphoma. However, 9 months later (May 1996), multiple mass lesions were found around the pancreas and hepato-duodenal ligament on abdominal computed tomography. Inguinal lymph node biopsy revealed aggressive nodal type B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large cell type. She received chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone, but failed to achieve remission and died in December 1996. There was no evidence of recurrent gastric lymphoma. This case emphasizes the importance of performing follow-up examinations to detect other neoplasms in patients with gastric lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.
