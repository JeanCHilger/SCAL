Endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas in the dog. Endoscopic ultrasonography was done in 12 normal adult dogs to investigate its efficacy in visualization of the pancreas. The endoscopic ultrasonographic device used in the present study had a curved-array ultrasound transducer mounted in front of the objective lens. The tip of the ultrasonic endoscope was inserted into the stomach, and all examinations of the pancreas were performed from within the stomach. Endoscopic ultrasonography provided good images of most parts of the pancreas except for the ends of each lobe. Useful information about the pancreatic parenchyma, including pancreatic lobular structure, pancreatic duct, and vessels of the pancreas was obtained by endoscopic ultrasonography. Blood flow within vessels was detected using color Doppler and pulsed-wave Doppler examination. These results suggest that endoscopic ultrasonography is available as an effective diagnostic modality in small animal practice.
