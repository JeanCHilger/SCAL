Maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiplanar reformation (MPR) for post-processing cholangiopancreatographic data set--clinical application and pitfalls. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiplanar reformation (MPR) are the most frequently used algorithms for MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The MIP allows three dimensional overview of the pancreatic and biliary system. Because of its resemblance to ERCP images, MIP reconstruction is widely accepted by clinicians. In spite of its usefulness, MIP may be misleading without a proper reference to source images or a guidance of MPR. Opacification defects that reflect intra-ductal or intra-cystic pathologies are notably erased through the process of MIP reconstruction. Diagnosis based only on MIP images is therefore not clinically feasible. A combined use either of multisection images, or at least source images, is essential. The MPR on the other hand, enables an investigation of the details of the intra-ductal or intra-cystic pathologies. Detailing with MPR and surveying with MIP work together in interpreting MRCP data set.
