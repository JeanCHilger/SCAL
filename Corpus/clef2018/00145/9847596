Clinical evaluation of MRCP. Recently, MRCP can be obtained with good spacial resolution within a few seconds using half fourier fast spin echo technique. From July 1995 to August 1997, 1000 patients suspected of having pancreatobiliary diseases were examined with MRCP. MRCP was performed with 1.5 T scanner using Fast Asymmetric Spin Echo sequence (FASE). Satisfactory images of the main pancreatic duct were obtained in 98%, of Santorini's duct in 90%, and of uncinate process branch in 83%. Pancreas divism was accurately diagnosed. In the patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, MRCP depicted stenosis and proximal dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in 89%, and in the remaining patients no abnormalities were seen in the main pancreatic ducts because tumors were limited to side branches or Santorini's duct or distal end of the tail of the pancreas. Diagnosis of small pancreatic carcinomas (smallest lesion measured 10 mm in diameter) were feasible. In the patients with intraductal papillary neoplasms, dilatation of the main pancreatic duct and cystic dilatation of side branches were depicted, and polypoid lesions were detectable with source images. In the patients with serous cystadenomas, accumulation of the microcysts were visualized. In the patients with chronic pancreatitis, dilatation and stenosis of the main pancreatic duct, as well as side branch dilatation was depicted despite overestimation of the extent of the stenosis. Stones in the main pancreatic duct were well visualized as intraductal filling defects. In conclusion, MRCP is an effective imaging technique in the diagnosis of various pancreatic diseases.
