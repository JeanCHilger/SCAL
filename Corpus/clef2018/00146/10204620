Clinical evaluation of 3D-CT cholangiography for preoperative examination in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Three-dimensional-computed tomography (3D-CT) cholangiography is a 3D shaded surface display image of the biliary tract obtained by using helical CT after intravenous cholangiography or cholangiography per percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage tube. We investigated whether 3D-CT cholangiography could provide a useful image, for preoperative examination in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-five patients with biliary diseases were examined by 3D-CT cholangiography. Helical scanning was performed on a Proceed Accell (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA). Three-dimensional images were created using an independent workstation. A clear image of the common bile duct was obtained for all patients (100%) by 3D-CT cholangiography. The gallbladder was well visualized in 54 (93%) and the cystic duct was shown to be opacified in 55 (95%) of the 58 patients with a gallbladder. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed as having gallstones by 3D-CT cholangiography (sensitivity. 72.1% specificity, 100%
