Mucin-producing biliary papillomatosis associated with gastrobiliary fistula. We report a case of mucin-producing biliary papillomatosis in a 78-year-old woman. Abdominal ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed wall thickening and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD), as well as a nodular lesion, 1.2 cm in diameter, in the left branch of the IHBD. Gastric endoscopy revealed excretion of bile-containing mucin on the anterior wall of the body of the stomach. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed gastrobiliary fistula and discharge of mucin into the stomach. Needle biopsy of the biliary tumor revealed papillary proliferation, but no malignant cells were recognized histologically. Therefore this patient was diagnosed as having mucin-producing biliary papillomatosis forming gastrobiliary fistula. She did not present with obstructive jaundice, probably because of the fistula. She is alive, without obstructive jaundice, 16 months after the diagnosis without having had surgery. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of biliary papillomatosis forming gastrobiliary fistula and with the patient free of obstructive jaundice.
