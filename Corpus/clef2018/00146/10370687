Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery: indications, techniques and preliminary results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate feasibility, effectiveness and reproducibility of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic diseases.At the Second Department of Surgery of the "Regina Elena" Institute for Cancer Research, between June 1995 and June 1997, possibilities of the laparoscopy in diagnosis and staging of pancreatic malignancies were studied. Twenty-four consecutive cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were observed: 10 patients were pre-operatively considered unresectable and 14 cases were submitted to a laparoscopic study. Moreover, in the period from January 1996 to June 1997, a study on the therapeutical potentialities of laparoscopy was performed, attempting 5 pure or assisted laparoscopic pancreatic resections.Three cases (21.4%) out of the 14 evaluated were found to be metastatic (liver and peritoneum) 11 patients were successfully resected with an open standard procedure. Laparoscopy allowed a correct staging in all cases, even in the 21.4% of ultrasonography (US), TC and angiographic false negatives. The 5 operative procedures consisted of one resection of a cystadenoma, one resection of a head cyst, one Wirsung lithotomy with pancreaticojejunostomy for lithiasic chronic pancreatitis, and two body-tail splenopancreatectomies (1 cystadenoma and 1 adenocarcinoma). Satisfactory early results were obtained in all these cases.Laparoscopic diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer is a valuable method which allows a very high accuracy. Pancreatic resections, even if feasible, are still to be considered an experimental procedure.
