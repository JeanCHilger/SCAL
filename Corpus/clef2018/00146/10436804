Gallbladder carcinoma. Carcinoma of the gallbladder has an unusual geographic and demographic distribution being more common in Israel, Bolivia, Chile and in Southwestern native Americans in the United States. Chronic cholecystitis, choledochal cysts and significantly high body mass index are associated risk factors. Over 90% of gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Advanced local and regional disease usually is present at the time of diagnosis. P53 protein overexpression and p53 mutation may be related to increasing grade of cytologic atypia and to invasiveness. K-ras gene mutation occurs in both dysplasia and carcinomas. Ultrasonography, CT, MRI are diagnostic measures that can provide accurate staging information. Overall, the curative resection rates for gallbladder carcinoma range from 10% to 30%. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gallbladder cancer may be inadvertently discovered necessitating a more extensive resection. For those with unresectable disease, palliative surgical, endoscopic or radiologic bypass procedures can improve quality of life. Other approaches to the management of advanced tumors include combined radiation and chemotherapy and systemic chemotherapy.
