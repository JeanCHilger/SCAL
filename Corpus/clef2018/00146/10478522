Leiomyomas of small bowel. The analysis of our own country and foreign literature, devoted to the problems of clinical aspects, diagnosis and treatment of leiomyomas of the small bowel for the last 48 years has been carried out. The authors present their personal experience in follow-up of 6 cases of the small bowel leiomyomas, the main clinical manifestations of which being recurrent intestinal bleedings and in lesser degree--small bowel obstruction. The results of preoperative examination evidence that besides thorough physical, endoscopical and ultrasound examination the necessity may arise to use for diagnosis angiographic and computed-tomographic methods. The subject of special attention of each clinical physician should be the danger of malignant transformation of benign leiomyomatous neoplasms of the small bowel, which the authors encountered in 2 patients.
