ERCP and stent therapy for progressive jaundice in hepatocellular carcinoma: which patients benefit, which patients don't? Jaundice in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be due to biliary obstruction. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Biliary stenting can relieve jaundice and allow further chemotherapy, but at additional expense and potential morbidity. We sought to determine whether CT scan or ultrasound (US) could identify which patients with HCC and jaundice would benefit from endoscopic stenting. We retrospectively analyzed 26 patients with HCC and jaundice who underwent ERCP after CT or US. We compared biliary dilation on CT or US with the dominant biliary stricture seen on ERCP, and with response to biliary stenting. Eleven of 26 patients had dominant biliary stricture on ERCP 11 underwent stenting. Six of 11 (55%) stented patients had a significant decline in bilirubin
