Asymptomatic giant gastric lipoma: What to do? Gastrointestinal (GI) lipomas are benign, usually single, slowly growing tumors. Their occurrence in the GI tract is most common in the colon, but they can be found also in the small bowel and very rarely in the stomach, where they account for 5% of all GI lipomas. Although most gastric lipomas (GL) are usually detected incidentally, they can cause severe symptoms such as obstruction, invagination, and life-threatening hemorrhages. To date, only three cases of GL have been reported in childhood. We describe the case of an 11-yr-old girl with asymptomatic giant GL, who has not received any treatment until now. New diagnostic insights, therapeutic options, and indications for treatment in asymptomatic patients are discussed.
