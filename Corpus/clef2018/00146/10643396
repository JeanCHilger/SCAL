Bacterial coxitis caused by Salmonella enteritidis. Case report and differential diagnostic considerations. Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1% of patients with Salmonella infections. These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease. We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head. Histologic analysis showed signs of pre-existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake. Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue. Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour. The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature. This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.
