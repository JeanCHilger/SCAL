Malignant perihilar biliary obstruction: magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographic findings. We studied the efficacy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the evaluation of malignant perihilar biliary obstructions, with reference to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).A total of 40 patients with malignant perihilar biliary obstructions, who underwent both MRCP (Magnetom Vision Siemens, Erlangen, GermanyMRCP examination was successfully performed on all patients, whereas ERCP examination was unsuccessful in two patients. Both MRCP and ERCP were very effective in detecting the presence of biliary obstructions (40 of 40 vs. 38 of 38, p = 1.0). MRCP was superior in its investigation of anatomical extent (34 of 40 vs. 24 of 38, p = 0.015) and the cause of the jaundice (31 of 40 vs. 22 of 38, p = 0.023) compared to ERCP. Specifically, the performance of MRCP is promising for the interpretation of cholangiocarcinoma (22 of 26) and gallbladder carcinoma (five of five), but is relatively ineffective for the interpretation of icteric HCC (two of four) and metastasis (two of five).MRCP represented an ideal noninvasive diagnostic tool for the evaluation of malignant perihilar biliary obstructions with reference to ERCP.
