A preoperative alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy program for patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of a preoperative alternating chemotherapy and radiotherapy program followed by surgery in stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The tumor response, resection rate, tumor/lymph node downstaging, and survival were also evaluated. The positive predictive value (PPV) in the diagnosis of mediastinal lymph node metastasis was 81% using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with short inversion-time inversion recovery (STIR) technique (STIR-MRI) on our criteria. Eligible patients had clinical N2 lesions (stage IIIA) and a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0-2. The treatment program consisted of two courses of preoperative cisplatin, vindesine, and ifosfamide alternating with radiotherapy, including two courses of 20 Gy radiation. Surgery was performed within 4 weeks after the treatment. Twenty-two patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC (20 men and two women, age 35-71 years) were enrolled into the study. Hematologic and other toxicities were within an acceptable range. Surgery was not indicated for two patients because of distant metastasis
