Anomalous bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We report a patient in whom the common hepatic duct drained into the gall bladder body and the cystic duct continued as the bile duct into the duodenum. The anomalous duct was inadvertently injured during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The injury was repaired and end-to-end anastomosis of the hepatic and cystic ducts was done through a subcostal incision.
