Evaluation of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic lesions. Pancreatic lesions present a diagnostic challenge. Even modern imaging techniques are not sensitive enough in determining resectability of pancreatic tumors. A substantial proportion of patients therefore undergo unnecessary surgical exploration. We determined the impact of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound (LAPUS) examinations on surgical decision-making in 60 patients with pancreatic lesions. Of 48 with solid pancreatic lesions, 22 were defined by LAPUS as having nonresectable tumors, while conventional imaging studies defined only 9 of them as such. 3 of these 9 underwent successful resections of the pancreatic mass. Surgical intervention was ruled out by LAPUS in 16 patients (33.3%) but 26 had resectable lesions of whom 25 underwent surgery. 3 of this group were found to have nonresectable tumors at surgery, a false-positive rate of 6.2%. Overall sensitivity of LAPUS in our series was 88%. In 12 patients with cystic pancreatic lesions LAPUS contributed significantly to the preoperative decision due to clear imaging of the cystic lesion. Additional information was obtained from ultrasound guided-biopsy of the cyst wall, as well as determination of tumor-marker levels in the cystic fluid aspirate. LAPUS contributed significantly to operative management in 58%.
