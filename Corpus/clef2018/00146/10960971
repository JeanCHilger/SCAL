Value of CT and MRI in malignant hepatobiliary tumors. Computed tomography (spiral-CT, multislice-CT, CT-angiography) and magnetic resonance imaging have been refined technologically within the last several years. The value of MRI in the diagnostic workup of malignant liver tumors has significantly increased. The reasons are the improvement of image quality, the reduction of acquisition time with the possibility of imaging during one breath-hold period, the introduction of liverspecific contrast materials (superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, hepatocellular contrast media), contrast-enhanced MR-angiography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography. MR imaging should be used--following ultrasound--more and more as primary imaging modality.
