Laparoscopic detection and resection of insulinomas. Laparoscopic ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for the localization of islet cell tumors has been described before, but few reports on laparoscopic resection of insulinomas exist. We retrospectively reviewed the results of our experience with laparoscopic detection and the resection of insulinomas to determine its feasibility.Between February 1996 and February 1999, 10 patients underwent operation for organic hyperinsulinism at our institution. Patient and clinical characteristics were studied retrospectively. Laparoscopic ultrasonography was performed to localize the insulinoma and then laparoscopic resection was performed.Eight women and 2 men underwent operation for hyperinsulinism. In 6 patients the insulinoma could be resected laparoscopically, either by enucleation (5 patients) or by resection of the pancreatic tail (1 patient). Four procedures were converted to laparotomy for the proximate location of the insulinoma to the portal vein or pancreatic duct (3 procedures) and failure to identify the insulinoma (1 procedure). The overall success rate of preoperative localization of an insulinoma with the use of various imaging techniques was 60% (6/10 patients). Laparoscopic ultrasonography could identify an insulinoma in 90% of the patients (9/10 patients). The median hospital stay was 7 days.Laparoscopic ultrasonography followed by laparoscopic removal of the insulinoma in patients with clinically manifested hyperinsulinism is a feasible and safe technique with low morbidity and fast postoperative recovery. Preoperative localization studies appear of limited value.
