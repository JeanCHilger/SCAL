Huge biliary cystadenoma mimicking cholecystic lymphangioma in subhepatic space. Biliary cystadenoma is a rare cystic neoplasm and constitutes only 5% of all intrahepatic cysts of biliary origin. We report a case of a 44-year-old woman with huge biliary cystadenoma in the subhepatic space, mimicking a cholecystic lymphangioma. Findings of various imaging modalities including reconstructed CT image are presented and correlated with surgical and pathologic findings.
