Giant fibroma of mesocolon transverse imitating tumor of ovary: a case report. The fibroma of mesocolon transverse is a rare lesion occurring primarily in age about 45-55 of years. The rarity of these lesions and the absence of characteristic clinical findings makes diagnosis difficult.The authors describe a case of fibroma mesocolon transverse in woman aged 75 years which became directed to Department of Gynecology & Obstetric in Hospital of SÅ‚upsk on account suspicions of ovarian tumor.Fibroma mesocolon transverse usually present as abdominal distention of long duration, pain, vomiting, less frequently as a palpable abdominal mass.

Other diagnostic modalities included intravenous pyelogram, barium enema examination, upper gastrointestinal tract series, CT scan and MRI in selected patients exclude gastrointestinal and genitourinary cysts and tumors. Histologically, several specific types could be distinguished of intra-abdominal lesions: lymphangioma, nonpancreatic pseudocyst, enteric duplication tumor, mesothelial tumor, enteric tumor, torsion of an omental segmental infarction cyst, hydatic omental cyst, omental fibromatosis tumor, ectopic ovarian cyst of the omentum, benign teratoma of the omentum or mesocolon.
