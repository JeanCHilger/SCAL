Preoperative diagnosis of ileal lipoma by endoscopic ultrasonography probe. The occurrence of tumor in the small intestine is relatively rare. It has been demonstrated that lipoma of the ileum is a cause of intussusception. We report a 59-year-old man admitted to our hospital for lower abdominal pain. Diagnosis of intussusception was made by abdominal x-ray and ultrasonography. Enema contrast studies revealed ileocolic intussusception. Colonoscopy revealed a tumor with an submucosal tumor (SMT)-like head and coil-spring appearance in the ascending colon. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hyperechoic submucosal lesion with features compatible with lipoma. Subsequently, this was confirmed histopathologically after resection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of preoperative diagnosis of ileal lipoma by EUS.
