Magnetic resonance cholangiography in patients with biliary disease: its role in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure whose role in the management of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of MRC in the evaluation of the biliary tree in patients with suspected biliary disease, and in particular, PSC.MRC and invasive cholangiography (ERCP or PTC) were both performed in 73 patients, (33 male, 40 female, mean age 56 years) with clinical and/or biochemical evidence of cholestasis. Images were interpreted by two radiologists unaware of the results of other studies.Forty-two patients (58%) had benign biliary disease, including 23 patients (32%) with PSC 9 patients (12%) had malignant biliary diseaseMRC has excellent diagnostic accuracy in the presence of biliary disease. Because of its noninvasive nature, MRC may have advantages over invasive cholangiography when diagnosis is the major goal of the procedure.
