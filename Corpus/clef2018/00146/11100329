Double cystic duct detected by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and confirmed by intraoperative cholangiography in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a case report. A case of double cystic duct with cholecystolithiasis detected by preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and confirmed by intraoperative cholangiography which was treated successfully by laparoscopic surgery is reported. The patient was a 74-year-old woman who complained of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. On admission, ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic areas accompanied by obscure acoustic shadows in the gallbladder. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed 2 cystic ducts 1 branched from the common bile duct and the other from the right hepatic duct. After a diagnosis of double cystic ducts, we chose laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperative cholangiography via 1 of the cystic ducts revealed the presence of the other. We were able to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any complications and the postoperative course was uneventful. This case suggests that preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intraoperative cholangiography is required to avoid complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
