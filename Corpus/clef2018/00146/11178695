Icteric-type hepatoma: magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiographic features. We evaluated the imaging features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) of icteric-type hepatoma and correlated these with the findings of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), percutaneous cholangiography, and surgery.Thirteen patients with viral hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis of the liver and obstructive jaundice underwent MRC and dynamic MRI. Five patients received percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage one of these patients also underwent resection of the left hepatic lobe. Another patient received MRC followed by thrombectomy and T-tube insertion. ERC and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage were performed in another patient for bile diversion.Primary liver tumors and dilatation of biliary system were demonstrated in all patients. No capsule formation could be found in any primary liver tumors. MRI showed the simultaneous presence of an intraluminal tumor in the portal trunk and common hepatic duct in eight patients. Three different MRC features were found: (a) an oval defect in the hilar bile duct(s) with dilated intrahepatic ducts (n = 9), (b) dilated intrahepatic ducts with missing major bile ducts (n = 2), and (c) localized stricture of the hilar bile duct(s) (n = 2).The presence of one or more of the following features in multiplanar MRI and MRC help to identify this rare, specific type of hepatocellular carcinoma: (a) the presence of an intraluminal tumor in both the portal trunk and the common hepatic duct, (b) enhancement of the intraluminal tumor in the common hepatic duct on the arterial phase, (c) type I MRC feature, and (d) hemobilia, blood clot within the gallbladder, and/or type II MRC feature.
