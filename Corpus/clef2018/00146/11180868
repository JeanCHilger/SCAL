Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) of the liver is a rare tumor and is difficult to differentiate from cholangiocellular carcinoma or metastatic liver tumor on image diagnosis. A case of curatively resected EH of the liver is reported. A 48-year-old woman was admitted because she had a mass in the liver. Cholangiocellular carcinoma was suspected preoperatively. Right trisegmentectomy of the liver, combined with bile duct resection and portal vein resection and reconstruction, was performed. Characteristic macro- and microscopic findings of the resected specimen revealed EH of the liver. The patient has survived for more than 6 years without recurrence. Because of the tendency of EH of the liver to appear in multiple or scattered forms, only 12 cases of resection for EH have been reported.
