Hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma mimicking hydatid cyst. Report of a case. We report on a case of hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma in a 44-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with upper abdominal discomfort. Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed a cystic mass resembling hydatid cyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) demonstrated communication with the left hepatic duct. At surgery, a cystic mass with communication to the left hepatic duct was found and resected en bloc with a margin of normal liver tissue. Histological examination showed a hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma.
