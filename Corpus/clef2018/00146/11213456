Biliary tract cancers. Biliary tract cancer is the second most common primary hepatobiliary cancer, after hepatocellular carcinoma. The most frequent localisation is the gallbladder. Mean age of diagnosis is 65 years. The exact cause remains unknown despite well documented risk factors. The majority of these tumours are adenocarcinomas. Symptoms, frequently non specific, are occasionally typical including jaundice, right upper quadrant mass or fatigue and weight loss. Magnetic resonance imaging is becoming the main diagnostic tool, replacing retrograde or transhepatic cholangiography. Surgical resection remains the only treatment that may allow long term survival. However, it is possible in only one third of patients.
