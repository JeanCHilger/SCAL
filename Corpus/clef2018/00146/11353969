Analysis of the quality and efficiency in learning laparoscopic skills. This study demonstrates the application of time-action analysis to the evaluation of task performance of diagnostic laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasonography.The first 25 diagnostic laparoscopies with laparoscopic ultrasonography performed by a surgical resident were analyzed and compared with the outcomes of these procedures performed by an experienced surgeon. The time, actions, and correctness of task performance were evaluated. Furthermore, outcome correctness and postoperative complications were assessed.No postoperative complications occurred. The resident made one wrong diagnosis, for which the cause was detected by peroperative analysis. Additionally, 1% of the subtasks were performed only partially, 4% not at all, and 2% using the wrong technique. The efficiency for most diagnostic tasks remained significantly lower than that of the experienced surgeon (p < 0.001).Time-action analysis can be used to provide detailed insight into the quality and efficiency of learning surgical skills. It enables objective measurement of correctness in task performance as well as time and action efficiency.
