Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation of unresectable hepatic malignancies. A phase 2 trial. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatic malignancies has been performed successfully via a percutaneous route or at laparotomy. We analyzed the efficacy and utility of laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound and RFA in patients with unresectable hepatic malignancies.Between November 1997 and November 1999, 27 patients with unresectable hepatic malignancies and no evidence of extrahepatic disease were entered in a phase 2 trial of laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound and RFA. Real-time ultrasonography was used to guide RFA, and lesions were ablated at a temperature of 100 degrees C for 10 min. Overlapping ablations were performed for larger lesions.Additional tumors were identified in 10 (37%) of the 27 study patients by laparoscopy and laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound despite extensive preoperative imaging. Radiofrequency ablation of 85 hepatic tumors yielded no mortality and only one case of postoperative bleeding. During a mean follow-up period of 14 months, four tumors (4.7%) locally recurred. Of the 27 patients, 11 (41%) remain free of disease at this writing (22%) are alive with diseaseLaparoscopic RFA and intraoperative ultrasound constitute a safe and accurate method for ablation of unresectable hepatic tumors.
