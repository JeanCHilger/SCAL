Duodenal hemangiopericytoma: CT and MRI findings. Hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is a rare mesenchymal tumor generally occurring in adults and originating from the pericytes. The tumor more commonly affects the soft tissues of the extremities, the pelvis, and the retroperitoneum. We describe the computed tomographic and magnetic resonance appearance of a patient affected by HPC of the duodenum.
