A case of urachal xanthogranuloma causing recurrent intestinal obstruction. A 68-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of lower abdominal pain and fever. There was a tender mass palpable in the lower abdomen. Plain abdominal X-ray film revealed multiple air-fluid levels with dilated small bowel loops, suggesting intestinal obstruction. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid mass extending from umbilicus to the bladder dome beneath the rectal muscle. There was normal mucosa of the bladder by cystoscopic examination. A urachal tumor was clinically suspected and en bloc removal of the mass, the remaining urachus, umbilicus, omentum and bladder dome was performed. The histological diagnosis was urachal xanthogranuloma. The patient has remained in good health without any recurrence for 6 months since the surgery. We discuss urachal xanthogranuloma in the literature.
