Recent trends in the management of proximal bile duct cancer. A case of obstructive jaundice in a 55-year-old male patient is reported. Ultrasonography in the case showed a space occupying lesion proximal to porta. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed complete occlusion of bile duct near porta. The patient was operated upon and the growth was totally excised. The biliary tract was reconstructed by a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The anastomosis was stented in the right and left hepatic ducts and the distal ends were brought out of the abdomen and fixed to the skin. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the tubes were clamped after 2 weeks. Regular follow-up clinically and radiologically for 3 months showed no recurrence. The tubes were removed after 3 months. The patient is well for last one and half years without any complaint.
