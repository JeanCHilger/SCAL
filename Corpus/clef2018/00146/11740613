EUS and ERCP features of nonalcoholic duct-destructive, mass-forming pancreatitis before and after treatment with prednisolone. Nonalcoholic, duct-destructive, mass-forming pancreatitis in a 28-year-old man was presented with endoscopic ultrasonographic (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic (ERCP) findings before and after corticoid therapy. Because this disease is often mistaken for a malignant tumor, EUS combined with ERCP may provide imaging characteristics useful for differentiation from malignant tumor, for early diagnosis, and for monitoring therapeutic effects.
