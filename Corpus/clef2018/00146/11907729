Intraductal ultrasonography of traumatic neuroma of the bile duct. We report a case of a 70-year-old female with traumatic neuroma of the bile duct. Transpapillary intraductal ultrasonography showed a cystic duct stump, from which a smooth and homogeneous hypoechoic mass arose the adjacent bile duct wall had a normal structure. Intraductal ultrasonography is useful for distinguishing traumatic neuroma from bile duct carcinoma.
