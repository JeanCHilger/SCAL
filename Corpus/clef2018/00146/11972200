The contribution of laparoscopy to the treatment of gastric cancer. Laparoscopy plays a role in the preoperative diagnosis of gastric cancer, particularly in determining the location and extent of the neoplasia. In addition to its use in staging, laparoscopy is indicated for the gastric resection of T1-T2, and its middle- and long-term results are comparable to those obtainable with open surgery. Herein we describe our experience with the laparoscopic resection of gastric carcinomas, including the dissection of lymph nodes and the Billroth II reconstruction of digestive continuity with gastrojejunostomia.We carried out laparoscopic gastric resections in 25 patients with adenocarcinomas. Our method involved installing five trocars, tying the left and right gastric vessels and the right gastro-epiploic vessels, sectioning the duodenum 3 cm from the pylorus, sectioning the remaining portion of the stomach obliquely 3 cm from the cardias, and performing Billroth II reconstruction.The average duration of the operation was 4 h 45 min. The average number of removed lymph nodes was 30.5 (range, 22-41). Five patients were converted to laparotomy. Significant complications were observed in four cases (16%). Hospitalization ranged from 5 to 16 days. The average follow-up was 38 months (range, 7-63), without evidence of relapse.In terms of morbidity, our results were similar to those obtained with open surgery. Lymphectomy according to the extent and number of lymph nodes is acceptable in the treatment of tumors of the lower third of the stomach. More case studies are needed to provide further indications of the applicability of the technique (which is currently used only in a few centers) and long-term results.
