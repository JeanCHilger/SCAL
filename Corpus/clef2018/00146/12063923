Malignant transformation of perianal Buschke-Löwenstein tumor. Extensive abdominoperineal rectum excision and reconstruction with transpelvic myocutaneous rectus abdominis muscle flap. The Buschke Löwenstein tumor (giant condyloma) in its perianal variant is an extremely rare disease caused by human papilloma virus. Although of histologically benign appearance, it infiltrates and destroys the surrounding tissue. There is a high risk of local recurrence and malignant transformation. The treatment of choice is wide surgical resection.A 56-year-old woman presented with perianal giant condyloma infiltrating the rectum and vagina. The extensive soft tissue defect resulting from wide resection was filled with a transpelvic myocutaneous rectus abdominis flap. Histology showed a squamous cell carcinoma arising in the Buschke Löwenstein tumor with clear resection margins. Therefore, the patient was irradiated locally after uneventful primary wound healing.A simultaneous reconstruction of a large pelvinoperineal soft tissue defect with the transpelvic myocutaneous rectus abdominis flap allows primary healing, accelerated rehabilitation, and safe adjuvant radiotherapy without risk of serious radiation damage to the small bowel by preventing it from protruding into the pelvic defect.
