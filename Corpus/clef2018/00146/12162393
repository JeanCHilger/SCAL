Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasound and its impact on patient management: 1990-2000. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a relatively new method used in the investigation and staging of upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) disease.To review practice and outcomes of EUS in an Australian university teaching hospital.The first part of the study was a retrospective review of indications, safety, referral patterns and technical difficulties of all EUS procedures performed at Concord Hospital, New South Wales, Australia, over a 10-year period from 1990 to 2000. The second part of the study examined the impact of EUS on the management of 225 consecutive cases, as determined by a questionnaire completed by each of the referring doctors.A total of 537 EUS examinations was performed over the 10-year period. Indications for EUS included: (i) assessment of oesophageal lesions (241), (ii) assessment of gastric lesions (184) and (iii) assessment of pancreaticobiliary (112) disease. Cancer staging was performed in 46.7% of oesophageal and 31.4% of gastric cases. Sedation was achieved using intravenous midazolam (5.3+/-1.3 mg mean +/- SD) and 52% of cases required additional intravenous pethidine (48.5+/-10.0 mgEndoscopic ultrasound is an accurate, safe and useful imaging method in UGIT disease. The increasing demand for EUS and EUS-guided FNAB suggests an expanding future for EUS in Australia.
