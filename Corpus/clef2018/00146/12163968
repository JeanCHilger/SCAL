Retained gallbladder/cystic duct remnant calculi as a cause of postcholecystectomy pain. Pain following cholecystectomy can pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. We reviewed our experience with calculi retained in gallbladder and cystic duct remnants that present with recurrent biliary symptoms.Over the last 6 years, seven patients were referred to us for the evaluation of recurrent biliary colic or jaundice. There were four men and three women ranging in age from 35 to 70 years. All seven had biliary pain similar to the symptoms that precede cholecystectomy two of them also had also associated jaundice and one had pancreatitis. The time from cholecystectomy to onset of symptoms ranged from 14 months to 20 years (median, 8.5 Years). Four had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy and three had had an open cholecystectomyFive of seven underwent diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), which revealed obvious filling defects in the cystic duct or gallbladder remnant. The final patient was diagnosed by laparoscopic ultrasound after eight negative radiographic studies. Four patients underwent laparotomy and resection of a retained gallbladder and/or cystic duct. Two patients were treated with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) one of them also required endoscopic biliary holmium laser lithotripsy. One patient underwent successful repeat laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were no treatment-related complications. At a median follow-up of 11.5 months, all have achieved complete stone clearance and are asymptomatic.Retained gallbladder and cystic duct calculi can be a source of recurrent biliary pain, and a heightened suspicion may be required to make the diagnosis. This entity can be prevented by accurate identification of the gallbladder-cystic duct junction at cholecystectomy and by routine use of cholangiography. A variety of therapeutic options can be employed to obtain a successful outcome.
