Small scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma with central scar: MR imaging findings. We describe the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of a small scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma in a 74-year-old man. The initial MR imaging findings indicated that the tumor had a small central scar, which suggested the differential diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and metastasis. A small scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma may have a central scar and should be included in the differential diagnoses for small hepatic masses with a central scar.
