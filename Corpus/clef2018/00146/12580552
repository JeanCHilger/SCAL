August 2002: 21-year-old male with cystic intracerebral tumor. The August 2002 COM. A 21-year-old male presented with a single episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures. Radiology revealed a cystic tumor with mural nodule suggestive of a pilocytic astrocytoma. However, histopathological examination and electron microscopy revealed features of an intracerebral schwannoma. Therefore, although rare, in an intracerebral cystic lesion with mural nodule, the possibility of an intracerebral schwannoma should be entertained. This is important because this is a benign tumor with favourable response to resection.
