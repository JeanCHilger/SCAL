Enlarged spinoglenoid notch veins causing suprascapular nerve compression. To report the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of enlarged veins in the spinoglenoid notch as a cause of suprascapular nerve compression.Six patients presented to MR imaging for evaluation of chronic shoulder pain. Clinical information and MR imaging studies were reviewed. The spinoglenoid notch vascular structures were compared with measurements made in 10 age-matched controls.Spinoglenoid notch vascular structures measured in 10 asymptomatic age-matched control patients ranged from 1 to 4 mm in diameter with an average of 2.2 mm. The six study patients had vascular structures that ranged from 6 to 10 mm in diameter with an average of 8.4 mm. Atrophy and fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus muscle was noted as an associated finding at MR imaging in all six patients. Surgery was performed in three of the six patients, at which time a venous varix was identified in the spinoglenoid notch in all three patients.We describe distended veins in the spinoglenoid notch. These may be readily apparent at MR imaging and should be distinguished from paralabral ganglion cysts compressing the suprascapular nerve in the absence of labral tears, especially if percutaneous aspiration of a ganglion cyst is entertained.
