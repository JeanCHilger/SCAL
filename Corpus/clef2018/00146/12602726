Extrahepatic bile duct stricture and elevated CA 19-9: malignant or benign? Biliary obstruction due to a proximal bile duct stricture is commonly a result of cholangiocarcinoma. We describe a patient who began having intermittent episodes of jaundice 3 years after cholecystectomy. Despite endoscopic placement of a biliary stent and adequate biliary decompression, the serum CA 19-9 level remained elevated at 58 U/ml (normal <37 U/ml). Segmental bile duct resection and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy were done. The stricture was caused by a traumatic bile duct neuroma. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations of this entity are discussed, with special emphasis on the value of noninvasive biliary imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the utility and interpretation of the CA 19-9 level, and the role for resection or surgical biliary decompression.
