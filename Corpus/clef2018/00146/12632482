Hepatocellular carcinoma with obstructive jaundice: diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Obstructive jaundice as the main clinical feature is uncommon in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Only 1-12 % of HCC patients manifest obstructive jaundice as the initial complaint. Such cases are clinically classified as "icteric type hepatoma", or "cholestatic type of HCC". Identification of this group of patients is important, because surgical treatment may be beneficial. HCC may involve the biliary tract in several different ways: tumor thrombosis, hemobilia, tumor compression, and diffuse tumor infiltration. Bile duct thrombosis (BDT) is one of the main causes for obstructive jaundice, and the previously reported incidence is 1.2-9 %. BDT might be benign, malignant, or a combination of both. Benign thrombi could be blood clots, pus, or sludge. Malignant thrombi could be primary intrabiliary malignant tumors, HCC with invasion to bile ducts, or metastatic cancer with bile duct invasion. The common clinical features of this type of HCC include: high level of serum AFP history of cholangitis with dilation of intrahepatic bile duct
