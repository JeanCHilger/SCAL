A comparison of EUS features between CD-117 positive GI stromal tumors and CD-117 negative GI spindle cell tumors. GI stromal tumors are spindle cell tumors that stain positive for immunohistochemical CD-117 (c-kit). Prognostic factors for malignancy include size (> or =4 cm), mitotic index (5 mitotic figures/50 high-powered fields), and ulcerated, cystic, or necrotic areas within the tumor. The purpose of this study was to compare these features in c-kit positive vs. c-kit negative tumors.All patients referred for EUS of submucosal lesions were identified, and histopathology, including immunohistochemical staining, was reviewed to determine all diagnoses of GI stromal tumors. Size, echo pattern, and presence of cystic spaces and ulceration were recorded as diagnosed by EUS. Histopathologic diagnoses were made by FNA or endoscopic submucosal-mucosal resection. If surgical resection followed, the surgical diagnosis, staining pattern, mitotic index, and presence of ulceration, necrosis, and nuclear atypia were recorded.Forty patients (21 men, 19 women 38 white, 2 African AmericanIf a GI stromal tumor is suspected, EUS-FNA with immunohistochemical staining should be performed for CD-117 (c-kit). C-kit tumors are more likely to have malignant features and should be resected or subjected to close clinical follow-up.
