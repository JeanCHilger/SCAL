Limitations of laparoscopic visceral surgery in oncology. Controversial discussion focuses on the application of laparoscopic curative resection for cancer due to oncologic radicality,tumor cell dissemination, and port site metastases. Considering the limitations of laparoscopic surgery, it is necessary to objectively evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is associated with an improved quality of curative treatment. Therefore, controlled studies comparing the results of laparoscopic vs conventional cancer surgery are mandatory. To date, comparable findings on short-term outcome of laparoscopy with open resection can only be shown for colorectal cancer. However, long-term data including recurrence and survival are still missing as randomized studies (phase IIIb) are still to be completed. Consequently, laparoscopic curative resection should only be performed within controlled trials. In terms of the upper GI tract, minimally invasive surgery has proven to be technically feasible in expert centers including limited resections for early gastric cancer, left pancreatectomies, or hepatic resections for malignancy. Finally, laparoscopy has gained acceptance in the field of diagnosis (e.g., staging laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound) and palliative treatment (e.g. gastroenterostomy, thermoablation) without the need for controlled studies.
