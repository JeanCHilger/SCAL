Portal cavernoma-associated cholangiopathy: a clinical and MR cholangiography coupled with MR portography imaging study. Although biliary symptoms appear to be uncommon in patients with portal cavernoma, almost all of them have endoscopic retrograde cholangiographic abnormalities. The mechanisms underlying the biliary changes are explained poorly. This study in patients with portal cavernoma had 3 aims: (1) to assess the manifestations related to biliary involvement (2) to evaluate with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging the aspect and frequency of cholangiographic changes
