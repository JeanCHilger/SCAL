Traumatic neuroma of the cystic duct with biliary obstruction. Report of a case. A case of amputation neuroma of the biliary tract occurring 12 years after a cholecystectomy is reported. The patient, a 81 year-old man, presented with obstructive jaundice due to a stricture of the extrahepatic biliary tract. The stricture was resected and biliary reconstruction was achieved with a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop. The diagnosis of neuroma was obtained only at histology that showed hyperplastic nerve bundles, positive for protein S 100. The patient is well one year and six months after surgery without signs of recurrence of the stricture. Although the amputation neuroma of the biliary tract has already been reported, it seems worthwhile to emphasise this further report. This lesion is an unusual cause of benign stricture of the biliary tract that may pose difficult diagnostic problems.
