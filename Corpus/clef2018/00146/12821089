Multifocal biliary papillomatosis: an indication for liver transplantation. Biliary papillomatosis is a uncommon disease. Because of the high rate of recurrence and the possibility of malignant transformation, liver resection or transplantation was recommended. A case of diffuse bilobar biliary papillomatosis, in a 60 years old patient, responsible for cholangitis, cholestasis and for high portal pressure (esophageal varices grade I and II and hypersplenisme) is reported. The patient had had an external biliary drainage leading to an great loss of hydroelectrolytic component important. Opacification and biopsies under endoscopic control assert the right diagnosis. He was treated by a orthotopic liver transplantation. Post operative course was simple. In the 9th month, it was asymptomatic with a completely satisfactory evolution. The other therapeutic modalities was discussed, as well as the review of the literature.
