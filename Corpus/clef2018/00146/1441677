Diffuse cholangiofibromatosis--incidental findings in sonography, ERCP and laparoscopy. Diffuse cholangiofibromatosis is a rare and asymptomatic abnormality. Its clinical significance results from problems that occur in differential diagnosis to granulomatous hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, multiple microabscesses or diffuse tumour infiltration of the liver, when it is incidentally found in ultrasound, ERCP or laparoscopy. The characteristic findings in these examinations are described in two case reports. The ultrasonic pattern of multiple intrahepatic double structures, microcystic areas and surrounding hyperechoic reflexes are in accordance with multiple intrahepatic microcystic and hazy areas in ERCP x-rays and multiple white-yellowish areas that retract liver surface in laparoscopy. Final diagnosis is confined by the characteristical microscopic finding of von Meyenburg-complexes in liver biopsy.
