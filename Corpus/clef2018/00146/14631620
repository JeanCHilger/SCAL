Spinal cord compression: a review of 70 pediatric patients. The authors report their experience with 70 pediatric patients with spinal cord compression (SCC) due to malignancies identified among 898 patients with solid tumors. An extradural tumor was the most frequent cause of SCC (71%) 54% of these were soft tissue sarcomas and neuroblastoma. Most intradural tumors (70%) were outside the spinal cord, 9/12 being metastatic medulloblastomas. The SCC localized mainly to the dorsal and lumbosacral regions (42% each). Pain was the most common symptom (94%). MRI proved diagnostic in all cases in which it was used, while myelography was diagnostic in 85% of 26 patients. CT scan demonstrated the lesion in 83% of the patients. Laminectomy was provided for patients with paraplegia of less than 96 h evolution
