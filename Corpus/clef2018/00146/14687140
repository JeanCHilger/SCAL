EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of suspected hilar cholangiocarcinoma in potentially operable patients with negative brush cytology. Despite improvements of diagnostic modalities differentiation between benign and malignant hilar strictures remains a challenge. Hilar neoplasia requires preoperative tissue diagnosis to avoid risk of inappropriate extensive surgery. This is commonly attempted using various techniques at ERCP, which have variable sensitivity and accuracy. We used endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for the preoperative diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC).Prospective evaluation of 44 patients (31 male, mean age: 59 yr) with strictures at the liver hilum were diagnosed by CT and/or ERCP. All were suspicious of HC but had inconclusive tissue diagnosis. They underwent EUS-FNA with linear echo endoscope and 22 gauge needles.Adequate material was obtained in 43 of 44 patients. Cytology revealed HC in 26 and other malignancies in 5 patients 12 had benign results: sclerosing cholangitis (n = 4), primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 4), inflammation (n = 3), sarcoid-like lesion (n = 1). There were no significant differences in age, lesion size, or echo features among patients with adenocarcinomas, other malignancies, or benign lesions. Thirty-two patients underwent surgery, 2 had autopsy, 10 were followed up clinically. Four of the benign results were false negatives. No complications occurred. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 91%, 89%, and 100%, respectively. EUS and EUS-FNA changed preplanned surgical approach in 27 of 44 patients.These results suggest that EUS-FNA is of value as a new, less-invasive approach for tissue diagnosis of hilar strictures of unknown cause. It was technically feasible without significant risks, when other diagnostic tests were inconclusive and was able to change preplanned management in about half of the patients.
