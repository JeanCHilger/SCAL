Fetal cystoscopy in the management of fetal obstructive uropathy: experience in a single European centre. To audit diagnostic and therapeutic fetal cystoscopy for suspected posterior urethral valves (PUV).In 13 fetuses, (14-28 weeks) the bladder was entered with a 1.3 mm embryo-fetoscope and intravesical findings documented. In 10 fetuses, an attempt was made to treat the obstruction by saline hydro-ablation (n = 4) and/or guide-wire passage (n = 9). Renal function was assessed post-natally at 10 to 34 months.The bladder wall was visualised in 12/13 cases and the bladder neck in 11 in 10 cases the upper urethra was entered, and the obstruction visualised in five. PUV were 'seen' in 4/9 confirmed cases, but also in one case of urethral atresia, while in two others the degree of resistance to guide-wire passage suggested atresia or prune belly. Therapeutic attempts were technically successful, at least initially, in 6/10 cases. Of the five cases with confirmed PUV and normal fetal urinary electrolytes, two have acceptable renal function at follow-up. Hydro-ablation in one case resulted in resolution of sonographic signs of obstruction, and ablated valves were confirmed post-natally.Semi-rigid fetal cystoscopy allows entry into the upper urethra in most obstructive uropathies, although bladder neck angulation precludes visualisation of the site of obstruction in the majority. Guide-wire passage or hydro-ablation may allow relatively atraumatic ablation of PUV in utero without the chronic bladder decompression associated with vesico-amniotic shunting. However, current technical limitations need to be overcome, possibly by the use of flexible or angled fetoscopes, before the role of cystoscopic treatment can be formally evaluated.
