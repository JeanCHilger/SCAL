Lipoma of the small bowel. A 40-year-old female presented with chronic diarrhoea, intermittent abdominal pain, and melena. She reported of a 7 kg loss of weight within the preceding 6 weeks and showed signs of mild abdominal pain upon palpation of the right lower quadrant. Our clinical diagnosis was Crohn's disease or infectious gastro-enteritis as a CT scan showed thickening of the colonic wall in the right lower quadrant. However a previously performed ileocolonoscopy was normal. TECHNICAL EXAMINATIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging showed a thickened terminal ileum with extensive narrowing of the bowel lumen, in addition a polyp obstructing the lumen of the terminal ileum at 30 cm was detected during colonoscopy.The involved portion of ileum was resected. Intraoperatively an intussusception with the polyp forming the leading edge was found. Histological analysis led to the diagnosis "lipoma". Postoperatively the patient is now feeling well without any abdominal pain.Tumours of the small bowel are rare and are therefore often forgotten in the list of differential diagnoses of abdominal pain. If symptomatic, these tumours present mainly with uncharacteristic and unspecific signs, often leading to a delay in correct diagnosis as in the presented case. We therefore suggest that small bowel tumours should be considered at earlier stages in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pain in the middle-aged patient with signs of intestinal obstruction.
