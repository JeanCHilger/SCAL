Differentiation between benign and malignant hepatic lesions: utility of color stimulated acoustic emission with the microbubble contrast agent Levovist. This study was undertaken to determine whether the examination of color stimulated acoustic emission in the late phase of Levovist (SH U 508A Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) enhancement is helpful in the discrimination between benign and malignant liver lesions.Fifty-six patients with focal hepatic lesions were examined. Diagnosis of the lesions was confirmed by liver biopsy, computed tomography, or scintigraphy. Thirty-one patients had malignant liver lesions: hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 14), cholangiocellular carcinoma (n = 1), metastasis (n = 14), and lymphoma (n = 2). Twenty-five patients had benign lesions: focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 8), hepatic adenoma (n = 1), focal hyposteatosis or hypersteatosis (n = 6), hemangioma (n = 7), and regenerative cirrhotic nodules (n = 3). After a delay of 5 to 10 minutes without scanning, the liver was examined by color stimulated acoustic emission with a fast sweep of 1 to 3 seconds.All patients with homogeneous color stimulated acoustic emission in the late phase of Levovist enhancement had benign liver lesions (P < .001 specificity, 100%Color stimulated acoustic emission in the late phase of Levovist enhancement has a high specificity and sensitivity for differentiation between benign and malignant focal liver lesions.
