A case of superficial esophageal cancer complicated with idiopathic muscular hypertrophy of the esophagus. We hereby reported a case of 60-year old man with superficial esophageal cancer complicated with idiopathic muscular hypertrophy of the esophagus. Endoscopic ultrasonography and CT showed the thickness of esophageal muscular layer, but the accurate diagnosis could not be entertained before operation. Idiopathic muscular hypertrophy of the esophagus is an entity rarely encountered, and most cases are diagnosed at postmortem examination. Only a few cases have been reported regarding its clinical symptoms and images. The etiology remains to be elucidated, and the pathologic features are characterized by significant thickness of inner circular muscular layer of esophagus without degeneration of plexus and ganglionic cells. This case report deals with superficial esophageal cancer complicated with idiopathic muscular hypertrophy of esophagus. Literature review is also included.
