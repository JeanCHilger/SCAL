Benign hilar stenosis mimicking Klatskin tumor. Preoperative diagnosis of hilar carcinoma (Klatskin tumor) is usually done according to the only clinical and imaging findings. However, in 5-15% of patients operated with this diagnosis, hilar stenosis is an inflammatory pseudo-tumoral benign one. We reported the case of a patient who underwent resection of common bile duct for suspicion of hilar carcinoma in whom, despite clinical and imaging findings highly suggestive of malignancy, pathologic examination revealed aspecific cholangitis. After a review of the literature, we conclude that resection of common bile duct is mandatory to exclude malignancy and allows excellent biliary drainage. Associated major hepatectomy should ideally be indicated, due to its higher risks, after pathological confirmation of cholangiocarcinoma, if necessary by frozen section.
