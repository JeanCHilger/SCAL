Benign nontraumatic inflammatory stricture of mid portion of common bile duct mimicking malignant tumor: Report of two cases. Benign nontraumatic inflammatory stricture of the common bile duct (CBD) may result in obstructive jaundice, which can be misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor of the CBD preoperatively. Two cases with strictures of the mid portion of the common bile duct presenting with obstructive jaundice are reported herein. Preoperative radiological studies prompted us to confidently make the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. However, the postoperative diagnosis on histological examination of the resected lesions was chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The complications of chronic duodenal ulcer are considered as the etiology of these two disorders.
