Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: resectability and radicality after routine diagnostic imaging. En-bloc resection has contributed to the improvement of long-term survival in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, attenuation of intraoperative traumatization of the tumor may decrease tumor spread. The objective of this study was to assess the importance of a routine diagnostic workup for the surgical strategy, radicality, and results in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.Between September 1997 and December 2002, 82 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma were treated at our department. Preoperative diagnostic workup included endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results of preoperative and retrospective (blinded) assessment of diagnostic data concerning the tumor growth along the bile ducts were compared with the results of surgery.The resection rate was 75%, and the hospital mortality, 7%. The prospective assessment of the resection to be performed was correct in 81% of cases. In ERC, magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC), and PTC, tumor assessment was precise in 29%, 36%, and 53%, of cases, respectively. Overestimation occurred more frequently than underestimation. The 3-year survival of patients with formally curative or palliative en-bloc resection was 61% and 15%, respectively. For the 9 patients with hilar resection, the 3-year survival was 25%. Survival of patients was comparable, regardless of whether their tumor had been correctly assessed or over- or underestimated. In the multivariate analysis, R0 resection was the only significant prognostic factor ( P = 0.011).Our routine diagnostic approach led to high resection and survival rates. Obviously a sophisticated diagnostic workup is not an absolute prerequisite for adequate surgery.
