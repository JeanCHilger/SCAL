Assessment of a neuroendocrine tumour by 111In-pentetreotid scintigraphy and PET with 18FFDOPA and 18F-FDG. We present the case of a 67 year old patient diagnosed of a neuroendocrine carcinoid tumour of the small intestine. The tumour and subsequent metastases were resected previously by surgery, but a new recurrence was suspected. CT showed left adrenal enlargement. 18F-FDG PET was normal and 111In pentetreotide scintigraphy showed liver and left diaphragmatic uptake. 18F-FDOPA PET showed uptake foci in liver and left diaphragm and also in left adrenal gland, retro urinary bladder area and multiple foci in abdominopelvic region, suggesting a peritoneal carcinomatosis. 18F-FDOPA PET was the first imaging modality to assess the extensiveness of the disease that was confirmed six month later by CT. Neuroendocrine tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasia. They are studied by conventional radiologic and functional techniques of nuclear medicine. This case illustrates the need to use the different techniques and tracers according to the characteristics of the tumor to be studied to thus improve the diagnostic and prognostic performance.
