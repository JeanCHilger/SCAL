Unilocular extrahepatic biliary cystadenoma mimicking choledochal cyst: a case report. We report here on a case of extrahepatic biliary cystadenoma arising from the common hepatic duct. A 42-year-old woman was evaluated by us to find the cause of her jaundice. Ultrasonography and CT showed a cystic dilatation of the common hepatic duct and also marked dilatation of the intrahepatic duct. Direct cholangiography demonstrated a large filling defect between the left hepatic duct and the common hepatic duct dilatation of the intrahepatic duct was also demonstrated. Following excision of the cystic mass, it was pathologically confirmed as a unilocular biliary mucinous cystadenoma arising from the common hepatic duct.
