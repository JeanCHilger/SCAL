The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease. Endoscopy is an essential tool for diagnosis, management and prognostic evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease. However dyscomfort, potential risks and costs associated to endoscopic examinations should contribute to the narrowing of indications to those cases in which the result of endoscopy is essential to determine a variation in the management strategy. Ileocolonoscopy performed by an expert endoscopist allows accurate diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in up to almost 90% of cases. Colonoscopy has a prognostic role during a severe flare of disease (the occurrence of severe endoscopic lesions have a negative prognostic value with significantly higher risk not to respond to medical treatment) both in ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease moreover in Crohn's disease the evaluation of recurrent lesions at anastomosis after curative surgery has a strong prognostic role (endoscopic recurrence closely correlates with clinical/surgical recurrence) and preliminary data suggest that mucosal healing assessed with endoscopy after biologic treatments could be associated with a better prognosis. Finally colonoscopy is essential for cancer surveillance during the long-term follow-up. Furthermore there are new endoscopic techniques under evaluation in inflammatory bowel disease, like wireless capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy for the imaging of small bowel, or endoscopic ultrasound for evaluation of strictures or of perianal disease. Finally some operative techniques like balloon dilation could possibly be employed more frequently in the future in the management of Crohn's disease. Future perspectives in endoscopy for IBD are chromoendoscopy and newer endoscopic imaging techniques, possibly leading to an "in-vivo histology".
