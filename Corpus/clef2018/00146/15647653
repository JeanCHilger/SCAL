Repeated hepatectomy for recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of two cases. Repeated hepatectomy for remnant liver recurrence of primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a seldom-encountered surgical technique because of its poor prognosis. Here, we present two long-term survivors of recurrent ICC by repeated hepatectomy. One patient underwent five hepatectomies in 6 years first, extended left hepatectomy for a primary mass-forming-type ICC and then four partial hepatectomies for independent recurrent tumors all developing in segment V. The other patient underwent re-hepatectomy for a very large recurrent tumor 7 years after the first left hepatectomy for a primary periductal-infiltrating-type ICC
