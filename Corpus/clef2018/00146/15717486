A case of primary small intestinal cancer diagnosed by laparoscopy. The patient was a 61-year-old female who developed ileus. Physical findings showed abdominal distension but peritoneal irritation signs were not observed. After the conservative treatment by the ileus tube, encircling stenosis was observed in the jejunum at about 50 cm on the anal side from the Treitz ligament on contrast radiography of the small intestine through the ileus tube. Tumor markers were normal except for mild elevation of IL2-R (609 U/ml). After confirming sufficient bowel decompression and the absence of other lesions, surgery was performed based on a preoperative diagnosis of small intestinal tumor including adhesive ileus, GIST, or malignant lymphoma. First, under the laparoscopic observation, the lesion was resected and definitive diagnosis was established as primary moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the small intestine by rapid intraoperative pathological diagnosis. Then, extensive jejunal resection involving sufficient lymph node dissection was performed as open surgery. Radical surgery was successfully performed.
