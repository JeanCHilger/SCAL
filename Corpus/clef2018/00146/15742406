Use of color Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of anomalous connection in pancreatobiliary disease. To estimate the detectability of anomalous connection in pancreatobiliary disease (ACPBD) cases, measuring gallbladder wall blood flow (GWBF).In the retrospective study, we enrolled 42 subjects with gallbladder wall thickening. GWBF velocity was determined as an average value of the peak velocity of color signals on the gallbladder wall, three times in each case. Based on the findings on endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), the 42 subjects were divided into 11 cases with ACPBD and 31 cases without ACPBD. In the prospective study, the subjects were 92 cases with gallbladder wall thickening. Using the cut-off level of the flow velocity obtained in the retrospective study, the usefulness of measuring GWBF velocity in diagnosing ACPBD was evaluated.In the retrospective study, imaging of GWBF was obtained in 40 of the 42 subjects. The mean GWBF velocity of the ACPBD cases was 29.4+/-3.9 cm/s (mean+/-SD), which was significantly different (P<0.0001 95% CI 5.48-13.2) from that of the without ACPBD cases (20.1+/-5.9 cm/s). Based on this result, we prepared a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the cut-off level appropriate for diagnosing ACPBD was estimated to be 25 cm/s. In the prospective study, GWBF was detected in 86 of the 92 subjects. Based on the EUS or ERCP findings, the 92 subjects were divided into 15 cases with ACPBD and 77 cases without ACPBD. When a cut-off level of 25 cm/s was employed, ACPBD could be diagnosed with a sensitivity of 87.0% (13/15) and a specificity of 87.3% (62/71).Measurement of GWBF velocity, which is less invasive and provides objective values, is very useful for diagnosing ACPBD prior to the development of malignant tumors in cases with gallbladder wall thickening.
