Diagnosis and treatment of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: results in a series of 124 patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic methods and therapeutical results in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma admitted between 2000 and 2003 and to assess the efficacy of various imaging methods.We included 124 consecutive patients with suspected cholangiocarcinoma who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) between 2000 and 2003. Every patient underwent an ultrasound (US) examination before ERCP. ERCP was considered as the "gold standard" for diagnosis. The therapy applied consisted of endoscopic stenting, US guided biliary drainage or surgery. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for every tumour localisation and also globally for all tumours.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of US were 85.9 %, 76.9 %, and 84.4 % for hilar localization, 59.1 %, 50 % and 57.1 % for the mid bile duct (CBD) and 33.3 %, 42.8 % and 36.8 % for the distal CBD tumours. The global performances for US in diagnosing extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were 73.5 %, 61.5 % and 70.9 %. In 73 cases (74.5%) an endoscopic stent was placed. In 11 cases (11.2%) we performed an US guided biliary drainage and in 14 cases (14.2%) surgery was recommended.Ultrasonography proved to be a reliable method for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in spite of its low accuracy for distal localization. The combination of the two investigations (US and ERCP) was very efficient in the management of these patients. Endoscopic stenting for hilar localization is a good therapeutical option.
