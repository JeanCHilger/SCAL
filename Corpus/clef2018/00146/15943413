Major hepatobiliary surgery during pregnancy: safety and timing. Hepatobiliary disease, although rare, may present during pregnancy with potential complications for mother and fetus. We present two cases of choledochal cysts and one case of a hepatic adenoma diagnosed in gravid patients. All three patients had acute events or failed medical management and were successfully treated with open resection, excision, or reconstruction during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy without requiring blood transfusions or tocolytic therapy. Although conservative treatment may be indicated in select patients due to the risk of underlying disease, we recommend surgical treatment preferably in the second trimester. With diligent intra- and postoperative management, pregnant patients can safely proceed with major hepatobiliary surgery.
