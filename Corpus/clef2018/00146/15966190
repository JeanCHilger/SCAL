Right hepatic duct opening into the cystic duct: the role of pre- and intraoperative cholangiography. Although an aberrant hepatic duct entering the cystic duct is not especially rare, the main right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct is extremely rare. A 69-year-old woman developed severe intermittent right upper quadrant pain and high fever. A diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis was made by radiographic examinations. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated dilatation of the right hepatic duct, but could not identify the junction of the right hepatic duct and the cystic duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography established that the right hepatic duct joined the cystic duct and that cholecystolithiasis was present. As the right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct can lead to ductal injury, this anomaly should be kept in mind when performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pre- and intraoperative cholangiography contribute to the avoidance of iatrogenic bile duct injury. When the right hepatic duct drains into the cystic duct, the gallbladder should be removed distal to the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts.
