Imaging of congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract. The radiological imaging plays a vital role in the evaluation of patients with congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract. The evaluation of these patients, most of which present early after birth, frequently requires the use of various imaging modalities for making the correct diagnosis and planning surgical correction. This article reviews the common congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract including obstructive lesions, anomalies of rotation and fixation, anorectal anomalies, and intestinal duplications. The plain radiograph is often diagnostic in neonates with complete gastric of upper intestinal obstruction and further radiologic evaluation may be unnecessary. An upper gastrointestinal series should be performed in all patients with incomplete intestinal obstruction. Sonography is useful in the evaluation of many congenital anomalies affecting pediatric gastrointestinal tract especially hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, enteric duplication cysts, midgut malrotation, meconium ileus and meconium peritonitis. Moreover, CT and MRI has assumed a greater importance as these provide excellent anatomic details which may be necessary for correct diagnosis as well as treatment planning. This is particularly true in evaluation of congenital anomalies such as esophageal/enteric duplications, vascular rings and anorectal anomalies. It is important to be familiar with the role nad usefulness of the various imaging modalities so that these can be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure while minimizing the patient discomfort.
