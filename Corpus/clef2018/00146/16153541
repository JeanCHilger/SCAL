Compression of the common hepatic duct by the right hepatic artery. Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography has been used wildly as preoperative examination before laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LSC). However, cases that suggested the stenotic lesion of extrahepatic bile duct are not so rare in MR cholangiography. When stenosis is found, further examination is needed to avoid the possibility of bile duct cancer. We reported a case in which the stenotic lesion was diagnosed compression of the common hepatic duct by the right hepatic artery by multislice CT (MCT) cholangiography.
