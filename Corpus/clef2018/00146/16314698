Magnetic resonance imaging of the gastrointestinal tract. Comprehensive bowel examination results from the combined use of T2-weighted single-shot and breath hold T1-weighted gradient echo, minus/plus fat suppression, and gadolinium-enhanced 3D gradient echo (3D VIBE, T1 FAME, 3D THRIVE). Gadolinium-enhanced imaging should be performed dynamically, but the venous 60- to 90-second delayed phase images with fat suppression are generally the most valuable. Removal of fat signal for detection of enhancing normal and abnormal structures is critical. Newly available True-FISP (FIESTA, BFFE) sequences obtained in the 2D form can be very helpful in delineation of bowel wall pathology and overall bowel anatomy, particularly when combined with a water-based intraluminal distending agent. Advantages include rapid acquisition, high signal-to-noise, and motion insensitivity. Generalized protocol for comprehensive evaluation of the entire abdomen and pelvis can be used for the following bowel indications: type and severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) identifying enteric abscesses and fistulae
