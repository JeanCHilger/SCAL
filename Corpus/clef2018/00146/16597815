Management of inflammatory bowel diseases in Eastern Europe. Limited data are available on the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in East European countries. The diagnostic tools and most treatment options are also available in Eastern Europe. The diagnostic procedures commonly used became more sophisticated in the past few years, with a greater use of computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and serology testing however, double contrast barium enema, enteroclysis, and endoscopy remained standard. The medical therapy and surgical strategies are also somewhat different from those applied in Western countries. In ulcerative colitis, besides mesalazine, the use of sulphasalazine is still frequent, while azathioprine is only used in a minority of patients. The use of conventional corticosteroids is common and the rate of non-colorectal cancer associated colectomies is low. In contrast, 5-aminosalicylates are still used for maintenance in Crohn's disease and azathioprine is generally less frequently given compared with Western Europe. Biological agents have also become available about five years ago, yet their use is restricted mainly to specialised centres.
