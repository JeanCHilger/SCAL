The decision-making value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in patients suspicious for pancreatobiliary diseases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an operator-dependent procedure and has significant procedure-related morbidity and mortality. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a safe noninvasive method for pancreatobiliary imaging. The aims of this study were to evaluate the potential impact of MRCP on performing ERCP and to evaluate the decision-making value of MRCP in patients suspicious for pancreatobiliary diseases.Two hundreds twelve patients (M:F 108:104, mean age 59.3 +/- 13.7) who underwent MRCP due to clinical or sonographic suggesting pancreatobiliary disease were included. We divided patients into four groups according to their presumptive diagnosis: biliary stone (group 1), biliary tumor (group 2), gallstone pancreatitis (group 3) and other biliary diseases (group 4).Numbers of cases in group 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 145, 43, 17 and 7, respectively. In 144 cases (67.9%), ERCP was unnecessary and 76 cases (35.8%) required neither ERCP nor any other treatment. Thereafter, these cases were thought to be a patient group in whom the workload of performing ERCP could be reduced.MRCP can reduce the number and efforts doing ERCP and is helpful in decision-making for the treatment of pancreatobiliary disease. Therefore, MRCP could be the primary diagnostic tool before choosing ERCP.
