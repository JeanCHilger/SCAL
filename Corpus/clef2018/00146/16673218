A rare cause of a central bile duct stricture. A 55 year old female patient was diagnosed because of painless jaundice and weight loss. She had undergone conventional cholecystectomy 15 years before.Bilirubin level before ERCP and stent implantation was 287 micromol/l at maximum. A subtotal stenosis was found in the proximal common hepatic duct. Endosonographically, a mass of 14 mm diameter was seen. She was suspected of having a Klatskin tumour Bismuth type II. Tumour markers (CEA, CA19-9) were within normal ranges.One month after stent implantation open surgery was performed suspecting a malignant tumour of the bile duct. A solid tumour at the hepatic bifurcation was resected completely. Reconstruction was performed by hepatico-jejunostomy was formed and the blind end of the jejunum was anastomosed to the gastric antrum to form an "access loop". Upon histological analysis no malignancy was found. However, a distinct fibrosis within the suspicious area was seen, formed around braided suture material.Preoperative distinction between benign and malignant bile duct stenosis can be difficult, even impossible. Thus, every resectable bile duct tumour should undergo surgery even and especially if a histological diagnosis cannot be reached preoperatively and the condition of the patient is adequate.
