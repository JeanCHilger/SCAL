Isolated or multifocal segmental intrahepatic bile duct dilatation: management. Segmentary dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts are well depicted with ultrasound. Two groups of diseases could be differentiated by searching a liver mass: biliary diseases without any tumor or dilatation of biliary duct due to an adjacent liver mass. Inside these two groups, some diseases are frequent and other not. We will emphasize autoimmune cholangitis and (Low Phospholipid Associated Cholelithiasis) LPAC with MDR3 deficiency. Decisional trees are proposed.
