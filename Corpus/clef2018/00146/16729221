Comprehensive breast cancer adjuvant digital summary. Patients with breast cancer often fail to recall the details of their original diagnosis and adjuvant therapy with the passage of time. Subsequent follow-up and treatment at a later time and a different institution wastes valuable time and effort to retrieve the original data.Twenty-five consecutive patients with breast cancer of all stages admitted for adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment and surgical excision were entered on study. An individualized comprehensive visual evaluation summary sheet (VESS) was created that detailed initial diagnosis, preceding relevant investigations, drug scheduling, and dosages of adjuvant therapy. Completion of a VESS required a computer, a digital camera with connection to a microscope, and radiology images over the PACS system. The completed one-page summary can be printed or stored.A VESS takes up an average of 4.4 MB (1.24-8 MB), each containing 11.5 images (range, 4-23 images), spanning a time period of around 216 days (range, 125-558 days).Patients received a complete summary of pertinent information concerning their diagnosis and adjuvant therapy.
