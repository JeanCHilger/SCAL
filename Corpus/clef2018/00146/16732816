Evaluation of gall bladder carcinoma with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dynamic MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the preoperative assessment of gall bladder carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging and MRCP were carried out in 15 patients with gall bladder carcinoma before surgery and the imaging findings correlated with surgical and pathological findings. Gall bladder carcinoma manifested as focal or diffuse wall thickening in 73% (11/15) and as a mass replacing the gall bladder in 27% (4/15). All tumours showed enhancement in the early phase, which persisted into the delayed phase. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI with MRCP in detecting hepatic invasion, lymph node metastasis and bile duct invasion was 87.5 and 86%, 60 and 90%, and 80 and 100%, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging correctly diagnosed duodenal invasion in only 50% and in none of the two patients with peritoneal metastasis. In conclusion, dynamic MRI with MRCP is an accurate and a reliable method of showing gall bladder carcinoma and in assessing its local and regional extent as part of preoperative assessment.
