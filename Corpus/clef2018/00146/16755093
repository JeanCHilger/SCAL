Nonparasitic solitary giant hepatic cyst causing obstructive jaundice was successfully treated with monoethanolamine oleate. A 77-year-old man hospitalized for epigastric pain showed jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. Laboratory tests revealed elevated hepatobiliary enzymes and inflammatory markers, and imaging studies demonstrated a 12 cm hepatic cyst compressing the common bile duct. The diagnosis was a giant hepatic cyst causing obstructive jaundice. Cyst drainage and sclerotherapy with 5% monoethanolamine oleate was performed twice, resulting in almost complete disappearance of the cyst. Obstructive jaundice due to a hepatic cyst, as seen in this case, is relatively rare and this report includes a review of other similar cases in Japan.
