Intraabdominal pulmonary sequestration. A case series and review of the literature. Pulmonary sequestrations are infrequent congenital malformations, and very rarely they are located below the diaphragm, particularly in the left suprarenal area. Prenatal detection is available. Differential diagnosis includes lesions such as enteric duplication cysts and neuroblastomas. Between 1999 and 2002, we operated on 4 patients with intraabdominal pulmonary sequestration. This series is presented here, with a review of the literature and current guidelines for the management of these unusual lesions.
