Primary hyperparathyroidism--case report and review of the literature. We present case report of primary hyperparathyroidism treated surgically as well as a review of literature concerning this subject. The disease of not well known etiology presents with elevated parathormon levels and hypercalcemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism which states 85% percent of all kinds of hyperparathyroidism is usually parathyroid adenoma, in 11-15% glandular hyperplasia and in 1-4% parathyroid cancer. Clinical symptoms are muscle weakness and fatigue, nephrolithiasis, occasionally peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, hypertension. Laboratory test reveal increased level of PTH, hypercalcemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and decreased phosphorus levels. Diagnostic imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, MRI or CT have sensitivity about 52-75%. Highest sensitivity in localization of ectopic parathyroid adenoma has sestamibi scintigraphy with technetium-99. Skeleton x-rays show typical changes in distal parts of bones and osteopenia. Treatment of choice is surgical excision of adenoma. Normalization of PTH and calcium levels after surgery and improvement of renal, musculoskeletal and circulatory system function could be achieved in 95%. Most common complications are recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypo- or hyperparathyroidism, bleeding or stridor.
