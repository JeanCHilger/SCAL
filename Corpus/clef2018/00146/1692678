Changing patterns in diagnosis and management of bile duct cancer. An analysis of 186 patients treated for bile duct cancer at UCLA Medical Center from November 1954 to December 1988 demonstrated improvements in several areas of diagnosis and management. Comparison of 96 patients treated between 1954 and 1978 (group 1) with 90 patients treated between 1978 and 1988 (group 2) showed earlier diagnosis and treatment in group 2 (2.1 months from onset of symptoms) than in group 1 (4.9 months p less than 0.05) and this was correlated with increased use of ultrasonography, computed tomographic (CT) scans, transhepatic cholangiography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Operative mortality rates were lower in group 2 (4%) than in group 1 (12%) and the difference was most marked in patients with upper-third lesions, where resections in group 1 had a 23% operative mortality rate but group 2 resected patients had zero mortality (p less than 0.001). A program of operative staging and selection of patients for resection or palliative procedures has resulted in better operative risks with no deterioration in survival.
