Colloid (enterogenous) cyst in the frontal lobe. A 60-year-old man presented with a left frontal mass lesion incidentally detected at a health check without apparent symptoms. Computed tomography revealed the lesion as homogeneous high density and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed the lesion as hyperintense on T(1)-weighted images, isointense on T(2)-weighted images, and hypointense on diffusion-weighted images. T(1)-weighted MR images with gadolinium showed no enhancement of the mass lesion. Cerebral angiography revealed an avascular area around the left frontal lesion. Total removal of the lesion was achieved through a craniotomy without complications. Histological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopy examinations established the definite diagnosis of colloid cyst.
