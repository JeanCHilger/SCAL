Magnetic resonance findings of bile duct adenoma with calcification. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) appearances of bile duct adenoma (BDA in a patient who underwent partial hepatectomy of segment 8 are presented. BDA showed a ring-shaped hyperdense area suggesting calcification and ring enhancement on CT. It appeared hypointense on both T1- and T2-weighted MR images. Preoperatively, the diagnoses considered included metastatic carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, tuberculosis, and rare tumors such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The radiological findings were confirmed by pathological investigation.
