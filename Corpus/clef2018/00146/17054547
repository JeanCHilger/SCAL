Adult choledochal cysts: an audit of surgical management. Choledochal cysts are rare congenital cystic dilatations of the biliary tree. Surgical management has evolved with regards to timing and surgical procedure of choice. We conducted a retrospective review of clinical presentation and surgical management of adult choledochal cysts.Thirty-two patients with choledochal cysts who underwent surgery between April 1991 and January 2005 were reviewed. There were 27 Todani Type I, 2 Type II, 2 Type IVA and 1 Type V cysts. Eighty-four per cent of patients underwent complete cystectomy and hepaticojejunostomy. Seven patients had revision surgery comprising completion cystectomy and hepaticojejunostomy.There were no perioperative mortalities. Perioperative morbidity rate was 44% and the commonest complication perioperatively was wound infection (19%). Malignancy was noted in one histological specimen. This patient was disease free for 1 year postoperatively and was subsequently lost to follow up. No further malignancy was found on median follow up of 3.9 years (range, 1-14 years) for the other 31 patients.Adult choledochal cysts are rare and are often non-specific in their clinical presentation. In managing patients with choledochal cysts, it is important to first treat complications such as sepsis and pancreatitis before imaging of the biliary tree with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to evaluate the full extent and type of choledochal cyst. Surgical management should be planned single-stage surgery comprising complete cyst resection, cholecystectomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and should be carried out by hepatobiliary specialists. Excellent perioperative morbidity and mortality results are possible with this strategy. Malignancy is rare and was only noted in 3% but close follow up is warranted.
