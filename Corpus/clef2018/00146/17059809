Capsule endoscopy detection of metastasis of a malignant melanoma in the small intestine. We report a case of a 74-year-old man with a Clark's level II, 2.5 mm melanoma on his back that was excised. A post-operative PET scan found no lesions. One and a half years later, the patient developed anaemia with blood in his stool. A gastroscopy and colonoscopy found no lesions. Video capsule endoscopy, however, detected a tumour in the small intestine. At laparotomy, the tumour was removed. Histological diagnosis showed metastatic malignant melanoma. We believe that video capsule endoscopy may increase the rate of diagnosis of small-bowel melanoma metastases.
