Laparoscopic resection of an ileal lipoma: Report of a case. A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for investigation of upper abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography (US) showed a hyperechoic mass in the right lower abdomen, and computed tomography (CT) showed a low-density mass and intestinal invagination. Thus, we made a diagnosis of intestinal lipoma with intussusception and performed laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum, including the tumor. The resected specimen contained a round tumor, 25 x 22 x 20 mm, which was identified as an intestinal lipoma histopathologically. Our experience supports earlier reports that US and CT are effective tools in the diagnosis of bowel lipoma. Laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice for benign tumors of the small intestine because it is minimally invasive, with cosmetic, physical, and economic benefits.
