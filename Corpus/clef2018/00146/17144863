Case report: Endoscopic laser lithotripsy of seminal-vesicle stones. A 25-year-old man presented with painful ejaculation, an ejaculate volume of 0.75, and complaints of passing "granules" in the semen. Transrectal ultrasonography showed bilateral seminal vesicle enlargement. The patient underwent transurethral resection of the ejaculatory duct. The entry point of duct was resected using pure cutting current, resulting in the passage of multiple proteinaceous-appearing stones. Approximately 10 months later, the patient reported recurrent painful ejaculation and passage of granules in his semen. At cystoscopy, the ejaculatory duct openings were intubated with a cone-tipped catheter to perform bilateral seminal vesiculograms, which showed numerous mobile filling defects and a Steinstrasse appearance at the ejaculatory ducts. A 7F semirigid ureteroscope entered the lumen without difficulty over a guidewire, and the stones were fragmented with a 270-microm holmium laser fiber. The ejaculatory ducts were balloon dilated to 18F. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case where a ureteroscope was utilized to treat seminal-vesicle stones. The seminal vesiculogram proved to be extremely valuable in the diagnosis.
