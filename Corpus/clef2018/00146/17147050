Role of MR cholangiopancreatography in the evaluation of biliary disease. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in biliary tree patology in comparison with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and surgical findings.Forty-six patients , with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of biliary tree pathology, and after an abdominal US, underwent MRCP with a 1.5 T superconductive magnet equipped with a phased-array body coil. MR exam was performed with baseline sequences for the examination of the upper abdomen, followed by specific MRCP sequences and, in cases of suspected neoplastic disease, completed with abdominal sequences after a bolus injection of paramagnetic contrast.MRCP showed normal findings in 16/46 patients, biliary duct dilatation in 25/46 patients (7 choledocolithiasis, 10 benign obstructions and 8 neoplastic stenoses) and stenoses without dilatation of biliary tree in 5/46 patients. In 25 patients with biliary duct dilatation, CPRM correctly identified the level of in 100% of patients (25/25) and the nature in 88% of patients (22/25). In 5 patients with stenosis without dilatation of biliary tree, CPRM identified 2 true positives (sclerosing cholangitis), 2 false positives and 1 patient is still in follow-up.In our experience MRCP proved to be highly accurate as fundamental diagnostic step in patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of biliary disease. The workload of ERCP, invasive method with risk of complications, in the diagnosis stage could therefore be reduced and its use be reserved for therapeutic indications.
