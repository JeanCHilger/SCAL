Solitary hilar biliary adenoma: MR imaging and MR cholangiography features with pathologic correlation. Biliary adenoma is a rare tumour characterized by the proliferation of bile duct epithelium into the lumen. Diagnosis is usually based on the imaging findings of bile duct dilatation and intraductal mass. We describe previously un-reported magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiography features with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and pathologic correlation of a solitary hilar biliary adenoma.
