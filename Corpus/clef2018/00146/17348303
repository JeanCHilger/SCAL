Adult intussusception--a surgical dilemma. Adult intussusception is rare. It is expected to be found in 1/30,000 of all hospital admissions, 1/1300 of all abdominal operations, 1/30-1/100 of all cases operated for intestinal obstruction and one case of adult intussusception for every 20 childhood ones.The authors encountered 4 cases of adult intussusception. M:F ratio was 1:1. Mean age was 47years. Small bowel obstruction was documented in all. They were investigated by radiographs, ultrasound exam, barium studies, endoscopy and CT scan.All however were diagnosed at operation although some pre-operative suspicion was raised in one case. All had a laparotomy. Two were ileo-ileal and two ileo-caecal intussusceptions. One was chronic intussusceptions and three sub-acute. One intussusception had a malignancy (lymphoma) as a lead point. Two had a submucous lipoma at the apex. In an interesting case the suture knot from a recent small bowel anastomosis (2-3 weeks prior) was forming the lead point of the intussusception! The 2 ileo-ileal intussusceptions had segmental resection. Right hemicolectomy was done for the 2 ileo-caecal cases. "Target lesion" and leumen-within-leumen were the CT hallmarks on review. Retrospective barium enema review failed to show the intussusception. This may suggest the intussusception may have been recurrent or chronic. All 4 recovered uneventfully and remained well. One patient was referred for chemotherapy for intestinal lymphoma.Adult intussusception remains a rare cause of abdominal pain. The treatment almost always is surgical.
