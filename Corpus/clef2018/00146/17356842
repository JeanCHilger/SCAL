Biliary cystadenoma of the left intrahepatic duct (2007: 2b). Biliary cystadenoma is a rare epithelial cystic neoplasm representing only 5% of intrahepatic cystic lesions of biliary origin. Commonly, the lesions are solitary cystic structures with multiple thin-walled septa predominantly arising from the right hepatic duct. Although the lesions are generally intrahepatic, extrahepatic tumors have been reported. Biliary cystadenomas range in diameter from 1.5 to 35 cm. The tumor usually affects middle-aged women. Clinical symptoms are related to the mass effect and comprise episodes of jaundice due to biliary obstruction and intermittent upper abdominal pain. Laboratory parameters are nonspecific. As the tumor is considered a premalignant lesion, complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. We report a case of typical biliary cystadenoma of the left hepatic duct.
