Bile leak after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is commonly performed as the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone diseases. Bile leak is a potential complication of this procedure and the cystic duct stump is the most common site of leakage. Early diagnosis and treatment of bile leak is crucial in decreasing the morbidity and mortality related to this complication. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement and/or sphincterotomy is highly effective in the diagnosis and treatment of this problem.
