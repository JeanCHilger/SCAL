Colorectal lymphangioma. Lymphangiomas of the colon are historically rare benign tumors. Only 331 cases have been reported in the world medical literature between 1931 and 2004. With widespread use of colonoscopy, however, they are being found more frequently. We report the case of a 74-year-old woman in whom a colonoscopy revealed a 3 x 4-cm submucosal lesion in the cecum that was eventually diagnosed as a lymphangioma. A CT of the abdomen showed a soft-tissue mass in the cecum and a low-density hepatic lesion. An endoscopic ultrasound of the colon showed a 3 x 4-cm hypoechoic lesion with internal septa arising from the submucosal layer of the cecum. This lesion resembled a vascular malformation therefore a biopsy specimen was not taken. Pathologic findings of a specimen taken after a subsequent right hemicolectomy identified a submucosal lymphangioma. Published reports indicate that colonoscopy cures most lesions smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. Resection should be reserved for larger lesions or those in patients exhibiting protein-losing enteropathy.
