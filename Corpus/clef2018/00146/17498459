Xiphoid metastasis from duodenal cancer. Duodenal cancer has a low prevalence in the general population. Metastases from this neoplasm usually affect the lymph nodes, liver or lung. Bone metastases from duodenal cancer are highly infrequent and xiphoid localization is exceptional. We present the case of a patient who, 5 years after undergoing surgery for duodenal adenocarcinoma, developed xiphoid metastasis. We discuss the utility of positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of this entity and the therapeutic options.
