The pathological diagnosis is based on microscopy and immunohistochemistiy.To review the experience of our surgical unit in patients with GIST MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of medical records of 15 patients (aged 66+/-13 years, 11 women), with a pathological diagnosis of GIST, treated between 1999 and 2005.The main presenting symptoms were melena in 40%, hematemesis in 20%, abdominal pain in 60% and anemia in 13%. In only one patient, the tumor appeared as an incidentaloma. All patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy A CAT scan was done in 87%, a barium swallow in 60% and a digestive endosonography in 20%. Thirteen tumors were located in the stomach and two in the small bowel. Mean tumor diameter was 5.3+/-1.7 cm. Surgical management was a tumor resection in 40%, a partial gastrectomy in 27%, a total gastrectomy in 20% and an intestinal excision in the rest. Mean hospital stay was 6.9+/-4.2 days.
