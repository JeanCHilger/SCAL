Diagnostic approach using endosonography guided fine needle aspiration for lymphadenopathy in primary sclerosing cholangitis. We report a case of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with benign lymphadenopathy which was diagnosed with endosonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). A 65-year-old woman was admitted to Jikei University Hospital with severe jaundice. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and liver biopsy revealed the findings consistent with PSC, abdominal computed tomography revealed numerous large perihepatic lymph nodes with a maximum diameter of more than 3 cm. Therefore, EUS-FNA was done in order to exclude malignant lymphadenopathy, and adequate specimens obtained by EUS-FNA showed reactive hyperplasia of lymph node. The patients were scheduled to undergo liver transplantation.
