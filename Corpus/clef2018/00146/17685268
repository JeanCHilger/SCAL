Choledochal cyst: diagnosis and surgical treatment. A 20-year old woman with a 2-month history of epigastric pain, progressive jaundice and obstructive liver biochemistry underwent imaging of the biliary tract, carried out using ultrasonography, CT-scan and MRI. Abdominal ultrasound showed a dilation of the choledochal duct. CT-scan and MRI revealed a cystic dilation of the choledochal duct. Because of possible malignant degeneration, en-bloc cholecystectomy and resection of the cyst were performed, with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy reconstruction. This case demonstrates the diagnostic value of MRI and MRCP in a pathology that is rather rare in Western countries.
