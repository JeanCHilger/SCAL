Prognostic relevance of volumetric analysis in tumour specimens of hypopharyngeal cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic relevance of the tumour specimen's volume in patients with squamous cell cancers of the hypopharynx.Tumour specimens of 67 patients treated primarily with surgery were evaluated, prospectively. Pathologic tumour volume was described as the product of the three longest diameters of the tumour in cubic millimeters (mm(3)). Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relation of pathologic tumour volume to pTNM stages as well as to patients' survival. This study has been approved by our institutional review board.Pathologic tumour volume was significantly associated with pT (P = 0.006) and pN (P = 0.01). The univariate evaluation of tumour variables showed pathologic tumour volume (P = 0.01) and pN (P = 0.04) as the only parameters which were significantly associated with overall survival. Entering these variables in a Cox regression model, pathologic tumour volume had the most impact on overall survival (P = 0.03). Most important thereby is the fact that we could distinguish within the pN0 group between the more and the less favourable cases.Pathologic tumour volume could be an essential prognostic indicator and the inclusion of this parameter in future clinical trials is recommended.
