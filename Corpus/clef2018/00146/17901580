Modern methods of endoscopic diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract. The last years brought the substantial development of new diagnostic procedures of gastrointestinal tract. High resolution endoscopy and magnifying endoscopy both give the detailed picture of the mucosal surface of esophagus, stomach, duodenum and large bowel. They are very useful in diagnosis precancer states or early cancer. The use of the biopsy forceps and cytology brush allows histologic confirmation of endoscopic impression. The new methods, which allow complete diagnosis of small bowel are double balloon enteroscopy and capsule endoscopy. They are recommended in case of Crohn's disease, identification of bleeding source, detection of stenoses and neoplastic changes in the small intestine, diagnosis of chronic diarrhea and detection of visceral diseases or malabsorption syndromes. Only double balloon enteroscopy allows to take the biopsy as well as to make endoscopic therapy. Chromoendoscopy involves topical application of stains to the mucosa on endoscopy in order to delineate and better characterize specific findings. This technique is thought to be helpful for both the diagnosis of early cancer for evaluation of non-neoplastic diseases. Endoscopic ultrasonography connecting endoscopic and ultrasonographic techniques is applied to diagnose the intramural abnormalities.
