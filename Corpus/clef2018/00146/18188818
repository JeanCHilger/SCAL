Interdisciplinary diagnosis of and therapy for cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis of and therapy for cholangiocarcinomas still remains an interdisciplinary challenge. For diagnostic and therapeutic purposes intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas need to be distinguished. Multiple imaging tools such as sonography, multidetector computer tomography, magnetic resonance tomography as well as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography for the diagnosis and localisation of these tumours are available. To date, surgical resection is the only curative treatment. At the time of diagnosis, most of the tumours are advanced. Therefore, only a small percentage of patients are suitable for curative surgery. Infiltration of the portal vein no longer constitutes a contraindication for surgery. Liver transplantation is not a reasonable option for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas but may be of advantage for perihilar Klatskin tumours. Severe cholangitis is the main cause of death of patients with obstructive cholangiocarcinomas. Drainage of the biliary tree system or surgery with construction of a biliary-digestive anastomosis is often necessary. If possible, a photodynamic therapy (PDT) should be performed in addition to biliary drainage. PDT has been shown to facilitate biliary drainage and to improve survival. The value of radiologist-assisted interventional procedures as well as percutaneous ablation and radiochemotherapy is not well established. In addition, so far, there is no standardised chemotherapy in a palliative situation established but there is some evidence for a benefit of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. For the best care and treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinomas an interdisciplinary approach is required and to achieve progress in the therapy patients should be included in prospective clinical trials to test new approaches.
