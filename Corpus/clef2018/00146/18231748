Clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in differentiating benign and malignant focal liver lesions. To explore the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in differentiating benign and malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs) with SonoVue, CEUS was used to examine 113 patients with focal liver lesions (FLLs) in our hospital during July 2005 to December 2006. All the patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) or contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI). Except for patients with focal fatty sparings (n=18) and with hemangiomas (n=8), all the patients were confirmed by operation or ultrasonic-guided liver puncture biopsy. A sulfur hexafluoride gas-based contrast agent was used with a MI of 0.15 to 0.17. Forty-eight cases of malignant FLLs, including 30 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 2 cholangiocarcinomas and 16 metastatic tumors, were detected. Seventy-eight cases of benign FLLs, including 33 hemangiomas, 9 focal nodular hyperplasias (FNHs), 19 focal fatty sparings, 5 abscesses, 7 regenerative nodules and 2 inflammatory pseudo-tumor, were involved. The contrast pattern of benign and malignant FLLs was quite different. CEUS has higher specificity and sensitivity than conventional ultrasound in differentiating benign and malignant FLLs.
