A case of asymptomatic intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct without hepatolithiasis. A 65-year-old woman was found to have dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct in the right anterior segment during a general health. Laboratory data were within normal ranges and no solid mass was detected in her abdominal computer tomography (CT) or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated an obstruction of the right bile duct. Intraoperative cholangiography showed stenosis of the intrahepatic bile duct in the anterior inferior segment (B5) and narrowness of the intrahepatic bile duct in the anterior superior segment (B8), so that we strongly suspected intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Histologically, surgically resected liver specimens, without tumor mass by macroscopic observation, showed intraductal papillary proliferation with fibrovascular cores and intraductal spreading of carcinoma in situ throughout a considerable area, especially in bile ductules around the peripheral small portal area. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical profile of the tumor (MUC5AC+/CK7+) was compatible with an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPN-B). Consequently, this case was diagnosed as IPN-B with spreading CIS, stage I (pT1, pN0, P0, H1, M0). We report a case of IPN-B with interesting histopathological findings and emphasize that cholangiography is especially helpful for the diagnosis of bile duct dilatation due to infiltration of carcinoma cells.
