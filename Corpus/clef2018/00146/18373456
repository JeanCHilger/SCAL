Retained gallbladder remnant after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Upper abdominal pain and other symptoms may recur after cholecystectomy, often presenting a diagnostic challenge. We will analyze 3 cases of gallbladder remnants, containing stones that presented with recurrent biliary symptoms.Three patients have presented to our clinic with recurrent biliary symptoms, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, over the last 5 years. All 3 had biliary pain similar to the symptoms that precede cholecystectomy 1 of them also had associated mild jaundice.A cystic lesion containing stones was identified on transabdominal ultrasound in all 3 patients, suggesting the possibility of a gallbladder remnant. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed the diagnosis of a gallbladder remnant in 2 of them. The 3 patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) owing to jaundice. This revealed a dilated gallbladder remnant and sludge into the bile duct and was treated by sphincterotomy and cleansing of the duct. All 3 patients were treated successfully via laparoscopic "recholecystectomy."Gallbladder remnant, containing stones, can be the cause of otherwise unexplained postcholecystectomy pain. "Recholecystectomy" constitutes the definite treatment for any residual gallbladder remnant and can be performed laparoscopically.
