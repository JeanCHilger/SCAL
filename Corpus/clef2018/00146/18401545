A rare case of primary actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall: diagnosis and treatment. We present the case of a 60-year-old man who presented with a left hypochondrial swelling first noticed 4 weeks prior to admission to our clinic. Based on the findings of the ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging investigation, a tumour of uncertain origin of the abdominal wall was suspected, also involving the small bowel. The swelling, including the affected lateral and transverse oblique muscles as well as the subcutaneous tissue and the adjacent omentum majus, was completely excised. The resulting myoaponeurotic defect of the left lateral abdominal wall was closed with interrupted Vicryl sutures and stabilised with a PTFE prosthesis (20 x 10 cm) that was placed intraabdominally and secured by spiral tackers and interrupted transfascial monofilament Prolene sutures. Microscopic examination of the excised specimen revealed an actinomycosis of the anterior abdominal wall, which is extremely rare. The surgical treatment was followed by antibiotic therapy for 6 months. This treatment resulted in full recovery with no further complications.
