Cholangiocarcinoma complicating primary sclerosing cholangitis: a 24-year experience. To report the prevalence and outcome of cholangiocarcinoma arising in primary sclerosing cholangitis for a British tertiary referral centre.All patients diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis and concurrent cholangiocarcinoma were identified from a prospectively maintained departmental database, and the mode of presentation, management and outcome were determined.Of 370 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 48 patients (13%) were diagnosed with a cholangiocarcinoma within a median time of 0.51 months (range: 0-73.12) from presentation to the unit. Mode of presentation included: inoperable tumours (n = 14) incidental findings in transplant hepatectomy specimens (n = 13)Cholangiocarcinoma is a common finding in primary sclerosing cholangitis and regular screening of this cohort of patients at referring centres is advocated to detect early tumours, as surgical treatment at an early stage offers significantly better outcomes for this cohort of patients.
