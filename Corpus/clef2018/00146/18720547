Diagnostic and therapeutic role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in biliary rhabdomyosarcoma. Biliary rhabdomyosarcoma (BRMS) is an uncommon childhood malignancy which has been managed surgically. We present a case of a 3-year-old boy with BRMS, in whom endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was successfully used both diagnostically and therapeutically, thus obviating the need for surgery and its attendant risks of morbidity and mortality. We conclude that ERCP is an effective alternative to surgery for BRMS in some patients.
