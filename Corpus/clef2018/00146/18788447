Case of urachal cancer treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin, 5-FU and leukovolin). A 52-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of urachal cancer. She complained of supurapubic dull pain and gross hematuria. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a non-papillary sessile tumor, which was located on the dome of the bladder and invaded the small intestine. The tumor was diagnosed as Sheldon's stage IIIC urachal cancer. After three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin, 5-FU and leukovolin), the tumor was reduced from 7 x 6 cm to 5.5 x 5 cm in size. Consequently, the patient underwent an en-bloc resection of the urachal tumor with the dome of the bladder and the parts of the ileum invaded by the tumor. One course of adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) was performed. Surgical specimen revealed histologically well differentiated squamous carcinoma and invasion to the propria of the ileum. The surgical margins were negative for the cancer. For 1.5 years after the surgery, no local recurrence or distant metastasis has been observed.
