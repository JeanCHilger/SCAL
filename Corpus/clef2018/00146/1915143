Use of endoscopy to diagnose symptomatic duodenal duplication cyst in an adult. The case of a female patient with a symptomatic duodenal duplication cyst diagnosed on endoscopy is reported. It is very important to discriminate between this rare anomaly and choledochocele as the treatment differs. Ultrasonography and ERCP are useful for the differential diagnosis. This rare anomaly is more often diagnosed in children. In adults duodenal duplication cysts may cause obstructive jaundice. The endoscopic finding of a cystic lesion in the medial wall of the second duodenal section at the papilla Vateri should be interpreted as a sign of the disease.
