Usefulness of computed tomography during cholangiography for the diagnosis of multiple hepatic peribiliary cysts: a report of three cases with chronic liver disease. Hepatic peribiliary cysts are composed of multiple tiny cysts along the larger portal tracts and have been reported to be harmless. On clinical images, peribiliary cysts resemble other diseases such as biliary dilatations, cholangitis, or periportal edema. Therefore, it is important to distinguish peribiliary cysts from these diseases using a combination of several imaging modalities. Herein, we report three cases of peribiliary cysts. The first case underwent laparotomy for the presumptive diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In the remaining two cases, hepatic peribiliary cysts were diagnosed and laparotomy was avoided. Magnetic resonance cholangiography contributed to the diagnosis, owing to their characteristic distribution. In addition, computed tomography during cholangiography (cholangio-CT) demonstrated that the cysts had no communication with the intrahepatic biliary system. Therefore, cholangio-CT is considered to be the most useful modality for the diagnosis of peribiliary cysts.
