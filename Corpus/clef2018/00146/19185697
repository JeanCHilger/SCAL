Evaluation of hilar biliary strictures by using a newly developed forward-viewing therapeutic echoendoscope: preliminary results of an ongoing experience. Obtaining a definitive tissue diagnosis in patients with hilar biliary strictures (HBS) is often difficult.To describe our experience using a newly developed forward-viewing linear echoendoscope (FVL-EUS) with FNA as a primary diagnostic tool in patients with HBS.Case series.A tertiary care, academic medical center.Four patients with HBS who underwent the procedure.Performance of FNA with the FVL-EUS.Visualization and puncture of the primary lesion with a definitive tissue diagnosis was obtained in all of the 4 cases performed. Metastatic hilar cholangiocarcinoma and recurrent neuroendocrine tumor were diagnosed in 2 patients and followed by placement of a self-expandable metal stent, when possible. In the other 2 patients, a diagnosis of resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unclear origin without evidence of vascular involvement was made, and plastic stents were placed before surgery the first patient was found to have peritoneal metastases, and resection was aborted, and in the second patient, a gallbladder tumor was diagnosed in the surgical specimen.The small number of patients.These preliminary data suggest that FVL-EUS used as a primary tool for the evaluation of patients with HBS may be of value and should be further explored in properly designed studies with a meaningful number of patients.
