Comparison of supine magnetic resonance imaging with and without rectal contrast to fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography for the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse. To compare supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with and without rectal contrast, with fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography (CCP) for the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse.Supine MRI and CCP studies were reviewed in 82 patients. All patients were women with an average age of 58.8 years, and the studies were done a mean of 25 days apart. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with rectal contrast (n = 35) and without rectal contrast (n = 47). Fluoroscopic cystocolpoproctography was performed with rectal (n = 82), vaginal (n = 82), small bowel (n = 81), and bladder (n = 78) contrast, and images were corrected for magnification. Each study was independently reviewed by 2 readers, and outcome variables were presence/absence of cystocele, vaginal prolapse, enterocele, sigmoidocele, and anterior rectocele. Sigmoidoceles were included with enteroceles for data analysis.For the entire patient group, the prevalence of cystoceles was 89% on CCP and 80% on MRI vaginal prolapse was 81% on CCP and 56% on MRIMagnetic resonance imaging without rectal contrast showed statistically fewer pelvic floor abnormalities than CCP. Except for enteroceles, MRI with rectal contrast showed statistically similar frequency of pelvic organ prolapse as CCP.
