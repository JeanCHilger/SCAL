Early detection of extrahepatic bile-duct carcinomas in the nonicteric stage by using MRCP followed by EUS. Most extrahepatic bile-duct carcinomas are usually diagnosed when they are already in an advanced stage, which is the main reason for the poor prognosis of this tumor.To examine the usefulness of MRCP followed by EUS in the early diagnosis of extrahepatic bile-duct carcinoma in the nonicteric stage.This study included patients who were nonicteric, who had abnormal serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, and whose common hepatic duct was more than 8 mm in diameter on abdominal US because of unknown reasons.A single-center, prospective study.An academic medical center.The sensitivity and specificity of MRCP followed by EUS for the early diagnosis of extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma in the nonicteric stage.A total of 142 patients who were nonicteric underwent prospective MRCP, and 26 of them underwent EUS. Ten patients (5 with stricture, 4 with filling defect, and 1 with no stricture or filling defect) had extrahepatic bile-duct carcinoma, including 5 patients with an incidentally diagnosed T1 stage tumor. The sensitivity and specificity of MRCP followed by EUS were 90% and 98%, respectively.A single center and small number of patients.MRCP followed by EUS was highly sensitive and specific for the early diagnosis of extrahepatic bile-duct carcinoma in the nonicteric stage, including T1 stage tumors. Filling defects, as well as stenosis in the bile duct, are important MRCP findings of T1 stage carcinoma.
