Jejunal lymphangioma presenting as an ovarian mass. Intra-abdominal lymphangiomas are rare benign tumours that usually arise in the mesentery of the small bowel. We present the case of an intra-abdominal lymphangioma that involved both the jejunum and its adjacent mesentery that ultrasound and CT scanning suggested was an ovarian tumour. Laparoscopy confirmed normal ovaries and a jejunal mass which was resected at laparotomy. This circumstance has very rarely been described in the literature and represents a diagnostic dilemma of which clinicians should be aware. Intra-abdominal lymphangioma should be included with other non-gynaecological diseases in the differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass, and requires a multi-specialty approach.
