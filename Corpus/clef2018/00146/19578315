Carcinoma of the gallbladder which progress on the mucosa of choledochocolonic fistula. A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for further examination of pneumobilia and atrophy in the gallbladder. Abdominal CT scan and EUS revealed that the atrophic gallbladder was occupied by a tumor lesion. In addition, ERCP showed choledochocolonic fistula. Colonoscopy revealed an elevated lesion in the colonic side of fistula, and biopsy of the elevated lesion revealed adenocarcinoma. Cholecystectomy and right hemicolectomy was performed under a preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder carcinoma with choledochocolonic fistula. Pathologically, most of the tumor was localized in the gallbladder, and grew along the mucosa of choledchocolonic fistula. This case was of interest with regard to the relationship between the choledochocolonic fistula and gallbladder carcinoma.
