Blood banking in a malaria-endemic area: evaluating the problem posed by malarial parasitaemias. The emergence and wide dissemination of drug-resistant malarial parasites underscore the need to prevent post-transfusion malaria. In Nigeria, as in most of sub-Saharan Africa, however, blood donors are not routinely screened for malarial infection. Recently, 391 consecutive potential blood donors in a malaria-endemic area of south-western Nigeria were each checked for malarial parasitaemia using three methods: microscopy (all samples), OptiMAL (315 samples) and/or the Clinotech Malaria Cassette (142 samples). OptiMAL detects parasite-specific lactate dehydrogenase whereas the Clinotech test detects the surface proteins of merozoites and sporozoites. Microscopy revealed parasitaemias in 79 (20.2%) of the potential donors, the levels of parasitaemia varying from 34 to 6289 asexual parasites/microl (mean=445/microl). The prevalence of malarial parasitaemia, as detected by microscopy, was significantly higher during the rainy season than in the dry season (27.3% v. 5.5% P<0.0001). There was no significant association between patent parasitaemia and fever (i.e. an axillary temperature > or =37.5 degrees C), blood group, gender or anaemia. The corresponding prevalences of malarial parasitaemia detected using the rapid diagnostic tests were 3.8% (12/315) for OptiMAL and 57.8% (82/142) for the Clinotech. With the results of the microscopy used as the 'gold standard', OptiMAL gave a sensitivity of only 16.0% but a specificity of 98.5%. The corresponding values for the Clinotech tests were 69.2% and 50.0%, respectively. It would clearly be beneficial to include screening for malaria parasitaemia in the routine investigation of potential blood donors in Nigeria, especially during the rainy season, when the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria appears relatively high.
