Comparison of MR enteroclysis with colonoscopy in Crohn's disease--first locust bean gum study from Turkey. The aim of this study was to compare magnetic resonance enteroclysis (MRE) findings with those of colonoscopy, using locust bean gum (LBG) as an oral contrast agent in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Crohn's disease.Nine patients with histologically proven Crohn 's disease were enrolled in this study MRE was performed within a week of colonoscopy. All patients were examined using a 1.5 T MR Scanner after per os administration of 850 mL of a combination of LBG and mannitol. After intravenous administration of 50 mg Eritromisin and 40 mg Scopolamine, images were obtained using a T2-weighted, balanced GRE, fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequence, before and after intravenous gadolinium administration. Bowel wall thickness and enhancement of inflamatory bowel wall were measured.The oral ingestion of LBG was well tolerated and allowed optimal small and large bowel distention in all patients. MR findings correlated with the colonoscopy results. Additional inflammatory lesions of the colon and mesenteric inflamatory changes such as lymphadenopathy, conglomerate tumor, and fistulas were demonstrated. Contrast enhancement of the affected bowel wall was markedly increased and positive correlation was obtained between bowel wall enhancement and bowel wall thickness.Gadolinium-enhanced MRE with oral locust bean gum is very efficient in the detection and follow-up of the intestinal and extraintestinal findings of Crohn's disease.
