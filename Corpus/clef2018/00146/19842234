Cystic Brunner's gland hamartoma in the duodenum: a case report. Cystic Brunner's gland hamartoma in the duodenum is exceedingly rare, although microscopic examination may sometimes reveal a Brunner's gland hamartoma containing dilated ducts in the duodenum. We present a case of large cystic Brunner's gland hamartoma in the duodenum with a long stalk, which is described in light of multidetector-row computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and a modified small bowel series, together with pathologic correlation and differential diagnosis.
