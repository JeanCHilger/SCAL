Choledochal cyst IV A type with primary ductal stricture. Type IV A choledochal cyst is a very uncommon disease, characterized by congenital cystic dilatation of the biliary tree extending to the intrahepatic biliary channels also. A case of a 19-year-old female with jaundice and abdominal pain is reported. The patient underwent a thorough clinical, laboratory and imaging examination. Computerized tomography and magnetic cholangiopancreatography revealed a 13.5 cm choledochal cyst with intrahepatic involvement. Excision of the extrahepatic part of cyst was combined with a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. A ductal stricture was discovered at the distal part of extrahepatic cyst. There were no perioperative and late complications in the follow-up.
