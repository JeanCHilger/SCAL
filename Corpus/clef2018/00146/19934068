Capsular retraction: an uncommon imaging finding in hepatic inflammatory pseudotumour. Capsular retraction is an infrequent but characteristic feature of malignant liver lesions such as hepatic metastases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Rarely, this finding may be observed in association with benign lesions, such as atypical haemangiomas. Capsular retraction has not previously been reported in association with hepatic inflammatory pseudotumour (IPT). Hepatic IPT is an uncommon benign hepatic lesion with a good clinical prognosis. In this report, we discuss the case of a 48-year-old woman with capsular retraction secondary to multifocal hepatic inflammatory IPTs.
