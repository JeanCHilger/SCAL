On investigation, she was diagnosed as having a choledochal cyst with large stone cast and portal hypertension. Single stage resection of the choledochal cyst with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was done by meticulous dissection and ligation of collaterals.Single stage resection of a choledochal cyst is possible in spite of associated portal hypertension, if the portal vein is patent.
