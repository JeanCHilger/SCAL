A case of radiation therapy successfully treated liver and lung tumors arising from postoperative cecum cancer. The patient was an 85-year-old man who underwent a rt-hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy and choledocholithotomy for cecum cancer and bile duct stone. The tumor was a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, type 2 in the Japanese classification of colorectal carcinoma. The tumor was considered to be in stage II (ss, ly2, v0, n (-), P0, H0, M (-)). He did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy. After 2 years and 3 months from the surgery, an abdominal MRI and an abdominal CT scan revealed a 30 mm hepatic nodule lesion. We diagnosed with liver metastasis of the cecum cancer. The patient refused both surgery and radio-frequency ablation therapy. We chose radiotherapy for liver metastasis. He was given a total dose of 50 Gy/25 fractions. After 3 months from the radiotherapy, the tumor was reduced gradually and tumor marker (CEA) was normalized. The disease was diagnosed as CR because no tumors were detected. There has been no liver recurrence. But after 4 years and 6 months from the surgery, 20 mm lung nodules in rt-lower lung were revealed by chest X-ray. Once more, we chose radiotherapy for lung tumor. He was given a total dose of 66 Gy/33 fractions. At present, the tumor was reduced gradually. There has been no recurrence since his irradiation. If the case was made a good choice, radiation therapy appears to be effective for liver and lung tumors from the colorectal cancer.
