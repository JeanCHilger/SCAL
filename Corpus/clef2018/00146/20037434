A case of long-term survival for advanced gallbladder cancer. A 50-year-old woman with epigastric uncomfortable feeling was referred to our hospital. We have diagnosed her as an advanced gallbladder cancer with direct liver invasion and lymph node metastasis of hepatoduodenal ligament by the image analysis, including enhanced abdominal CT, MRI and FDG-PET. Subsequently, we performed operation with cholecystectomy, hepatic segmentectomy of S4a/5, bile duct resection and D2 lymph node dissection, resulted in the curative operation. We additionally performed adjuvant chemotherapy with 6 courses of 800 mg/m2 of gemcitabine (GEM) on days 1, 8 and 15 for every 35 days. No recurrent signs were observed for 33 months after curative operation.
