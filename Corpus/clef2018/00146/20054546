Refractory cystobiliary fistula secondary to percutaneous treatment of hydatid cyst: treatment with N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate embolization. A 27-year-old female with a type 2 hydatid cystic lesion in the liver according to the Gharbi classification (CE 3A according to the WHO classification) was referred for percutaneous treatment after albendazole treatment for 1 year. A catheterization technique was performed but hypertonic saline and alcohol were not given into the cavity due to cystobiliary leakage. During the 4-month follow-up period, sequential cavitography revealed biliary fistula, and bile-stained drainage had not been ceased despite the sphincterotomy, nasobiliary drainage catheter, and plastic stent. Since the patient refused to surgery, we embolized the biliary fistula using N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate for the first time in the literature. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient's course was uneventful and ultrasound, multidetector-row CT, and MRI examinations revealed no collection in or adjacent to the cavity.
