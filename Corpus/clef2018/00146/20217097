An endodermal cyst mimicking an intra-axial tumor in the medulla oblongata. Endodermal cysts, also known as enterogenous, neurenteric, foregut, epithelial, bronchogenic, or respiratory cysts, are rare benign lesions lined by columnar epithelium of a presumed endodermal origin. Endodermal cysts are rarely intracranial, but when this occurs, the cysts are frequently located in the posterior fossa with the most common locations being anterior to the brainstem and within the fourth ventricle. However, an endodermal cyst located in the medulla oblongata is extremely rare.Here, we present a case of a 23-year-old man with an endodermal cyst located in the medulla oblongata. Although rare, clinicians should be aware that this lesion is differentiated from other cystic lesions of the posterior fossa by the absence of a mural nodule.Total resection of endodermal cysts in the medulla oblongata is recommended, despite their location and adhesion to surrounding structures, due to its frequent recurrence.
