Choledochal cysts in adults. Choledochal cysts are usually diagnosed during childhood. They mainly affect females. Abdominal pain and jaundice are the two most common symptoms. Our objective was to report the experience of a third-level referral center in the management of choledochal cysts in adults.We performed a 17-year retrospective review of patients with choledochal cysts who underwent surgical interventions in a gastrointestinal surgery department.There were 23 patients with a median age of 26 years 16 were females. The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain and jaundice. Only four patients had an abdominal mass. The most frequently used diagnostic studies were abdominal sonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. According to the classification of Todani, most cysts were type I and were found in 17 patients, two patients had type II, three patients had type III (choledocele) and one patient had type IVA. Eighteen patients underwent complete removal of the cyst with a concomitant hepatic-jejunostomy, three patients had transduodenal sphincteroplasty and two patients had only cystectomy. Seven patients developed postoperative complications, representing a morbidity rate of 35%. None of the patients died during the first 30 postoperative days. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in the resected specimen in only one case.The surgery of choice for choledochal cysts in the adult is hepatojejunostomy, which has a low surgical morbidity and mortality.
