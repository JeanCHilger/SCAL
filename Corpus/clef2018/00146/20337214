Cardiac metastasis from poorly differentiated carcinoma of the cervix: a case report. Disease metastatic to the heart from cervical carcinoma is rare and associated with a poor prognosis. Multimodality treatment has been shown to provide palliative benefit.A woman presented with stage Ib2 cervical cancer metastatic to the tricuspid valve. She presented with small bowel obstruction from a small bowel metastasis 4 years after initial treatment with chemoradiation. Computed tomographic imaging revealed a small bowel mass as well as a pericardial effusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a tricuspid mass. Endomyocardial biopsy confirmed metastatic disease consistent with a cervical primary. The patient was treated with bowel resection, systemic chemotherapy and cardiac radiation. She died of cardiac failure 8 months after diagnosis of the cardiac lesion.Cervical cancer metastatic to the heart is rare and associated with a poor prognosis. Selected patients may benefit from multimodality treatment.
