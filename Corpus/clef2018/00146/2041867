Percutaneous diagnosis and therapy of the bile ducts and gallbladder. Feasibility and status. Percutaneous transhepatic access to the bile duct has opened up new possibilities not only for diagnosis by means of cholangiography and cholangioscopy with endoscopically guided biopsy by small-bore equipment, but also for the treatment of benign and malignant obstructive jaundice. In malignant disease recanalization of the obstruction is possible by means of laser, intracavitary irritation, internal bile drainage in Klatskin tumors, large-diameter endoprostheses (e.g., a Y-shaped prosthesis) or metal stents. In benign disease, balloon dilatation of inflammatory stenoses, stone extractions from the bile duct or gallbladder by means of Dormia baskets, ultrasound or piezoelectric shockwave-contact lithotripsy and chemical litholysis are possible. Very often percutaneous access is a real alternative to surgical intervention.
