The value of pre-operative magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in management of patients with gall stones. To analyze influence of pre-operative MRCP on the management of patients with gall stones.This prospective randomized study was carried on 250 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 3 years. In group I, pre-operative MRCP was performed in 125 patients with age range of 18-62 years. Group II included 125 patients managed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy without doing pre-operative MRCP with age range of 21-65 years.In group I pre-operative MRCP screening revealed clinically silent CBD stones in 5 patients (4%), accessory cystic duct in 2 (1.6%), abnormal insertion of cystic duct in 1 (0.8%). Postoperatively, bile duct injury was inflected in 1 patient in group I. On the other hand, there were 2 patients with bile duct injury and 5 patients with residual stones in group II. There was a statistically significant increase of post-operative complications in group II (p <or= 0.5).MRCP is diagnostically useful in management of patients with gall stones prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and its routine use can reduce the incidence of post-operative complications.
