Hemobilia, a rare and difficult diagnosis. Haemobilia, i.e. blood loss via the bile ducts, is a rare disorder, which may be caused by trauma, vascular disorders, gallstones, infection/inflammation, tumours and coagulation disorders. Haemobilia may cause grave morbidity and mortality. Important symptoms are: gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice and colicky pains in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Gastroduodenoscopy, ultrasound, ERCP, CT-scan and MRI may be used to obtain additional information when haemobilia is suspected. Selective angiography may provide detailed information of the bleeding, but is less appropriate as an initial screening method. Haemobilia may be treated by selective embolisation of the involved artery or by operative treatment. Embolisation is the treatment of first choice in most situations. We present a case report of a patient with recurrent haemobilia caused by a ruptured aneurysm of a hepatic artery leaking intermittently into the bile ducts. Partly because of the rareness of this syndrome, the disorder was recognized with delay in our patient. After two embolisation attempts had failed, he was treated successfully by obliterative endoaneurysmorrhaphy.
