Multiple bile duct hamartomas mimicking diffuse hepatic metastasis: GI image. Bile duct hamartomas (von Meyenburg complex) are the rare benign neoplasm of the liver due to dysembryogenesis constituted historically, cystic dilatations of the bile duct encompassed by fibrous stroma. Usually, they are asymptomatic and are not detected on routine radiological examinations including ultrasound or CT scan. Magnetic resonance cholangiography has been suggested as the best investigation for their imaging diagnosis. Their presence can cause diagnostics confusion and complicate the patient's management. We report a 45-year-old female with symptomatic cholelithiasis, whose liver on laparoscopy mimicked multiple hepatic metastases.
