Biliary cystadenoma with bile duct communication depicted on liver-specific contrast agent-enhanced MRI in a child. Biliary cystadenoma is a benign, but potentially malignant, cystic neoplasm of the biliary ducts occurring most commonly in middle-aged females and very rarely in children. We present a 9-year-old boy with biliary cystadenoma, diagnosed by MRI using a new liver-specific contrast agent (gadoxetic acid) that is eliminated by the biliary system. The images clearly demonstrate the communication between the multiloculated cystic mass and the biliary tree, suggesting the possibility of biliary cystadenoma. Due to the malignant potential of a cystadenoma, the lesion was resected. The resection was complete and the postoperative course was uneventful.
