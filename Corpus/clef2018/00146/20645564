Diffuse ganglioneuromatosis: infrequent pathology communication and review of literature. Ganglioneuromatosis is an infrequent disease characterized by mienteric plexus and enteric nervous fiber hyperplasia, habitually manifested by constipation, pain and abdominal distension. There are two ways of presentation: mucosa or transmural. Regularly may be associated with another pathologies like multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and Von Recklinghausen's disease. The objective of this publication is to present an extremely infrequent pathology and make a bibliographic review of its clinical, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutical aspects. We present a fifty-six year old male with a six month history ofabdominal pain and pseudo-obstruction syndrome. During the hospitalization he presents infectious complications, with septic shock secondary to nosocomial pneumonia and death. A Necropsy was done and ganglioneuromatosis was diagnosed. Due to the low incidence of this pathology, it is rarely included in the differential diagnosis of pseudo-obstructive syndrome in adults. The post-mortem diagnosis moved us to perform a bibliographic search to amplify our knowledge and compare this particular case with those previously communicated by other authors.
