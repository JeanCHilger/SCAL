A case of locally invasive obstructive jejunal cancer with curative resection after stenting and chemotherapy. Small bowel adenocarcinoma is a relatively rare malignancy. In Korea, 13.1% of small bowel adenocarcinoma occurs in the jejunum. The absence of effective screening methods and relatively obscure symptoms contribute to the higher percentage of advanced cases at the time of diagnosis. Although curative resection is the mainstay of treatment, it is often impossible. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have shown a disappointing treatment result for advanced staged small bowel adenocarcinoma. We report a 54-year-old woman with locally invasive jejunal cancer who underwent curative resection after stent insertion with enteroscopy and chemotherapy.
