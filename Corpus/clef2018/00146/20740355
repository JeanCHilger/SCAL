Solitary hepatic lymphangioma: report of a case. A 52-year-old woman presented with upper abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a 4-cm well-defined mass containing solid and cystic components in segment IV of the liver, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed heterogeneous enhancement within the tumor, indicating a solid or fibrous component. There were no cystic lesions in any other organs. A partial hepatectomy was performed, based on a preoperative diagnosis of sclerosing hemangioma and biliary cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Pathologically, the tumor appeared to be a multilocular and cystic lesion lined by attenuated endothelial- like cells with no atypia. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the endothelial-like cells to be positive for the lymphatic-specific markers D2-40, LYVE-1, and Prox-1, which proved helpful for confirming the diagnosis as solitary hepatic lymphangioma. This case is presented with details of the pathologic and radiologic findings, because solitary hepatic lymphangioma is an extremely rare tumor and no previous reports have provided details of the immunohistochemical characteristics.
