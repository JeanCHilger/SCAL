Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration for diagnosing upper gastrointestinal submucosal lesions: a prospective study of 50 cases. The objective was to assess EUS-FNA for diagnosing intramural upper GI tract lesions. The subjects were 50 patients (21M/29F) with upper GI submucosal lesions who underwent EUS-FNA at a referral center for GI system over a 12-month period. All cases were followed for 1 year after initial EUS-FNA. Cytologic diagnoses were categorized as benign, malignant, suspicious for malignancy, mesenchymal tumor, endocrine tumor, or nondiagnostic. All tumors were assessed for various cytomorphologic features. The accuracy of the initial FNA diagnoses was evaluated for each patient who also underwent subsequent histopathological examination of a core biopsy and/or surgical biopsy/resection material of the same lesion. According to the site of the lesions while 84% of all esophageal lesions were diagnosed as mesenchymal
