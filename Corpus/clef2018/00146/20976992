Percutaneous cystic duct stent placement in the treatment of acute cholecystitis. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is well established as a temporising treatment option in selected patients presenting with acute cholecystitis. However, some patients who undergo cholecystostomy will have persistent discharge, which precludes catheter removal, or may not be medically suitable for future cholecystectomy. In these circumstances, percutaneous cystic duct stenting isa novel treatment option. It may delay or avoid the need for cholecystectomy, and thereby provide definitive treatment in a subset of patients who have acute cholecystitis and a high anaesthetic risk or limited life expectancy. Current application has been limited largely to patients with pre-existing malignant common bile duct strictures, but there is potential for the application to be broadened to include other subsets of patients. In this paper, we describe the technique used for percutaneous cystic duct stenting in a patient and report on its effectiveness. We also explore the technical considerations and consider the application of the procedure on other groups of patients.
