Localization diagnosis of laparoscopic ultrasonograph in laparoscopic surgery of insulinoma. To discuss the localization diagnosis value of laparoscopic ultrasonography in laparoscopic surgery of insulinoma.Retrospectively reviewed the results of laparoscopic ultrasonography in 32 patients from Jan 2007 to Aug 2008 with insulinoma which confirmed after surgery, and analyzed the detection rate of laparoscopic ultrasonography.Insulinoma tumors were success located in 31 patients among 32 patients by laparoscopic ultrasonography. The detection rate was 96.9% and the location accurate rate was 100%. Thirty-seven insulinoma tumors were detected in 31 cases, including 29 solitary insulinoma and 2 multiple insulinomas. One patient did not show a definite tumor in the pancreas and extrapancreatic organ during the laparoscopic ultrasonography examination.Laparoscopic ultrasonography has a high detection rate in localizing diagnosis of insulinoma and can clear display the relationship between tumor and adjacent tissue. It is useful for surgeon to select the suitable operation modality.
