Usefulness of peroral cholangioscopy in preoperative diagnosis of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. Surgical resection is considered the first-line treatment of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB).

We report a patient with IPNB in whom preoperative peroral cholangioscopic evaluation was useful.
