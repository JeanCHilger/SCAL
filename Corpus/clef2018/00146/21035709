Cervical cystic lymphangioma in a patient with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome: clinical case report and review of the literature. We present the case of a 9-year-old boy diagnosed with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, who showed a very large left cervical cystic lymphangioma. He was previously subjected to various treatments for lesions in the intestinal tract including blood transfusions for anemia, sclerosis, enterotomies or resections. The tumor was resected without any complications and the anatomopathologic report confirmed this diagnosis. The blue cavernous hemangioma syndrome (or blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome) is a rare disease characterized by cavernous angiomas involving the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Several cases of cystic lymphangiomas associated with this syndrome have been published recently and lymphomatous differentiation has been identified in the cells of cutaneous lesions. Given their common embryological origin, we underscore the importance of bearing in mind that it is possible for different types of vascular malformations to coexist in the same patient.
