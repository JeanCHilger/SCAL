An uncommon cause of hiccups: sarcoidosis presenting solely as hiccups. Common causes of hiccups are over-distension of the stomach, a sudden change in gastrointestinal temperature, excessive alcohol and tobacco ingestion, and sudden excitement or emotional changes. Common presenting symptoms of sarcoidosis include cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. It is very rare for a sarcoidosis patient to present with hiccups. A 48-year-old man presented with hiccups of 2 weeks' duration. He denied having headaches, earache, cough, abdominal pain, fever, or body weight loss history. On physical examination, he had no peripheral lymphadenopathies in the neck, axilla and inguinal regions, no organomegaly in the abdomen and no skin abnormalities. A neurological examination showed normal findings. Laboratory investigations revealed a normal complete blood count, liver function, renal function, serum calcium, and tumor markers. Transabdominal ultrasound was negative, and panendoscopy revealed a small healing duodenal ulcer. Chest radiography showed an enlarged right lung hilum, while computed tomography showed enlargement of multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with a 22-gauge needle and trucut biopsy with a 19-gauge needle (quick-core biopsy needle) were performed, and cytology, cell block and histology revealed non-caseating granuloma, with negative tuberculous and fungus cultures. Mediastinal lymph node due to sarcoidosis can be a rare cause of hiccups.
