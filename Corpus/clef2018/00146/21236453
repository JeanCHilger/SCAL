Use of preoperative, 3-dimensional magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in pediatric choledochal cysts. Standard choledochal cyst (CC) operations involve dilated extrahepatic bile duct excision followed by biloenterostomy. However, biliary variants and associated intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) stenoses or dilatations triggering postoperative sequelae require additional procedures. The usefulness of preoperative 3-dimensional magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (3D MRCP) and virtual cholangioscopy (VES) for observing biliary morphology and pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) was evaluated.In 16 pediatric CC patients (age range, 4 months to 9 years median, 3 years), visualization of PBM and aberrant bile duct anatomy and IHBD morphology at the hepatic hilum (HH), umbilical portion (UP), and posterior branch (POST) were compared between 3D-MRCP and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). VES and intraoperative cholangioscopy (IOS) findings were compared.HH, UP, and POST visualization rates were 100%, 94%, and 94%, respectively, by 3D-MRCP, and 100%, 69%, and 69%, respectively, by IOC. IHBD stenosis detection rates at each region were 38%, 13%, and 13%, respectively, by 3D-MRCP, and 25%, 0%, and 9%, respectively, by IOC. IHBD dilatation detection rates at each part were 75%, 47%, and 60%, respectively, by 3D-MRCP, and 88%, 82%, and 91%, respectively, by IOC. PBM was confirmed in 56% and 93% of cases on 3D-MRCP and IOC, respectively. Both 3D-MRCP and IOC showed biliary variants in 5 cases (31%). VES showed membranous strictures at HH, UP, and POST in 6, 2, and 2 cases, respectively, whereas IOS did so at HH in 4 cases and POST in 2.Preoperative 3D-MRCP and VES accurately depict biliary morphology, allowing concrete operative planning in pediatric CC patients, complementing IOC and IOS.
