Magnetic resonance imaging findings among women with tubercular tubo-ovarian masses. To assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women with tubercular tubo-ovarian masses.Twenty-four women with a confirmed diagnosis of tubercular tubo-ovarian masses underwent MRI. The findings were compared with laparotomy/laparoscopy results wherever possible.The mean age was 30.7 years and the mean parity was 1.5. The main symptom in 37.5% of patients was infertility. The MRI findings included unilateral definitive tubo-ovarian masses (n=4 [16.7%]) bilateral definitive tubo-ovarian masses (n=4 [16.7%])MRI seems to be a useful modality for the diagnosis of tubercular tubo-ovarian masses.
