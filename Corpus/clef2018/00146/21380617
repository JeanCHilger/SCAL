Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. For a long time, laparoscopic pancreatic surgery was simply a matter of extended diagnostics without a simultaneous resection.The increase of experience in complex laparoscopic procedures combined with a substantial improvement in technical equipment has led to the possibility of performing pancreatic resections laparoscopically.In contrast to the experimental laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy has proved its safety and efficacy.In order to avoid splenectomy-associated complications, such as the OPSI-syndrome or formation of abscesses in the splenic area, the spleen-preserving technique is more favorable. Due to ischemia caused by the resection of the splenic vessels, as well as portal hypertension in the long-term follow-up, those vessels should remain untouched. The following article and video describe our approach for laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with sparing of the splenic vessels.
