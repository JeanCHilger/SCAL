Giant Brunner's gland hamartoma: diagnosis and endoscopic treatment. Brunner's gland hamartoma is a polypoid lesion typically composed of an increased quantity of normal-appearing Brunner's glands, accompanied by a variable proportion of smooth muscle. Most of these masses are asymptomatic and behave as benign tumors. Occasionally tumoral growth can provoke gastrointestinal problems which, together with the possibility of malignant transformation, will require resection after a broad differential diagnosis has been made with solitary duodenal mass. Both clinical and radiographic studies are nonspecific and often do not allow diagnosis of these tumors. Basic endoscopic studies (upper endoscopy) with adequate characterization of the lesion by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can establish a high diagnostic suspicion and determine the best therapeutic option (endoscopy or surgery). We present a case of giant Brunner's gland hamartoma. The initial manifestation was iron-deficiency anemia with no evidence of bleeding. After adequate characterization of the lesion, EUS allowed complete and safe endoscopic resection, avoiding more invasive surgical treatment.
