Postprandial abdominal pain owing to isolated enteric duplication cyst in the superior mesenteric artery root: sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging features. A 7-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with postprandial abdominal pain. An abdominal sonogram revealed a retroperitoneal septated cystic lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a septated cystic lesion in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) root with a vessel originating from the proximal SMA supplying the cyst wall and a deformed adjacent aortic contour. A laparotomy was performed and confirmed the presence of an isolated enteric duplication cyst with its own blood supply from the SMA and marked perilesional adhesions to the duodenal loop and aorta. Histopathologic study was consistent with a duplication. To our knowledge, this is the first report of isolated enteric duplication cyst in the superior mesenteric root with perilesional adhesion leading to postprandial abdominal pain, which was successfully relieved after surgery.
