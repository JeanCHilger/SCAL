Small intestinal metastasis from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of a case. Metastasis of the small intestine that derives from a primary hepatic neoplasm is rare. We encountered a case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with jejunal metastasis after resection of a primary lesion. A 61-year-old male patient was referred to us with a diagnosis of liver tumors. Partial hepatectomy was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was ICC. Seventeen months after surgery, the patient was found to have a mass in the jejunum and lymph node swelling by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The jejunal tumor was preoperatively diagnosed as a metastasis of ICC from a biopsy specimen obtained by double balloon endoscopy, and the tumor was resected. The patient received systemic chemotherapy but succumbed with ICC recurrence 46 months after the primary surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first report of jejunal recurrence of ICC. In addition, this report suggests the usefulness of double balloon endoscopy to make the correct diagnosis of the jejunal tumor.
