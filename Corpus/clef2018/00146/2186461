ERCP in bile duct dilatation with jaundice due to spontaneous hydatid cyst rupture. Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, therapy and result. We report the case of a 17 years old Turkish patient hospitalized for colics and jaundice. Ultrasound, computer tomography and ERC showed enlarged intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. The further investigations documented the rupture of a hepatic hydatid cyst into the biliary tract with obstructive jaundice. Other causes of jaundice as cystic duct malformation, calculi, tumours could be ruled out by surgery and histology. Etiology, diagnosis and treatment of hydatid jaundice are discussed.
