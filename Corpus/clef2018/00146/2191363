The benefits of percutaneous cholecystostomy for decompression of selected cases of obstructive jaundice. Eleven selected patients with obstructive jaundice underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) for decompression. Ten of these patients had the constellation of distal common duct obstruction, nondilated or minimally dilated intrahepatic ducts, and a distended gallbladder one patient with a bleeding dyscrasia had moderately dilated intrahepatic bile ducts. All procedures were successful and effective, and 10 of 11 cholecystostomies were performed within 5-15 minutes. No specific complications occurred. The success, ease, and safety of the procedure indicate primary use of PC for biliary decompression when the intrahepatic bile ducts are minimally dilated or nondilated, because standard transhepatic biliary drainage may be difficult in these cases. Because cannulation of the cystic duct and hence internalization through the tumor may be difficult, PC may be most valuable preoperatively, or before standard percutaneous biliary drainage, or as an alternative to endoscopic drainage. This is a rapid and safe method with which to achieve biliary decompression, especially with minimally dilated or nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts.
