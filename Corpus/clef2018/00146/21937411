Celiac artery occlusive disease: a rare but potentially critical condition in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Undiagnosed occlusive disease of celiac trunk and/or superior mesenteric artery may lead to life-threatening complications after pancreatoduodenectomy.Retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 171 patients scheduled for pancreatico- duodenectomy or total pancreatectomy.The prevalence of arterial occlusive disease was 5.9% (10 patients), including complete celiac artery occlusive disease in 2 patients (1.2%). Preoperative diagnosis was achieved in 90% of the patients by lateral-views of imaging studies. In arterial stenosis <50% (3 patients), abstention was always successful. In arterial stenosis >50%, successful treatment options included abstention (n=1), preoperative endovascular dilatation (n=1) or stenting (n=1), division of the median arcuate ligament with (n=1) or without (n=1) postoperative endovascular stenting, and aorto-hepatic bypass (2 patients). No early postoperative ischemic complications occurred. However, one patient died from late intestinal ischemia.Arterial occlusive disease is rare in patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy but expose the patient to severe complications if undiagnosed. A tailored management according to the type of arterial stenosis, to patients' indication for surgery and to patients' arterial anatomy is indicated. Surgical and endovascular management may be successfully combined.
