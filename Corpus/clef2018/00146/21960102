A case of a neuroendocrine carcinoma in the minor papilla. Neuroendocrine tumors are usually found in the ileum, appendix, rectum, colon and stomach. Ampullary neuroendocrine tumor is extremely rare and only a few cases of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the minor papilla have been reported. The preoperative diagnosis is very challenging because either asymptomatic or manifests as nonspecific abdominal pain. The tumor is relatively small and located at the deep mucosa and submucosa. Endoscopy with deep biopsy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography are good diagnostic tools. The best therapeutic choice is surgery. We report an unusual case of a 55-year-old woman who underwent endoscopy as part of a regular health checkup and was diagnosed a neuroendocrine carcinoma in the minor papilla, which was successfully resected by pancreaticoduodenectomy.
