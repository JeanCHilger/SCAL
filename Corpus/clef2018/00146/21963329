A prospective controlled trial of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration compared with mediastinoscopy for mediastinal lymph node staging of lung cancer. The study objective was to compare endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) with mediastinoscopy for mediastinal lymph node staging of potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer.Patients with confirmed or suspected non-small cell lung cancer who required mediastinoscopy to determine suitability for lung cancer resection were entered into the trial. All patients underwent EBUS-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy under general anesthesia. If both were negative for N2 or N3 disease, the patient underwent pulmonary resection and mediastinal lymphadenectomy.Between July 2006 and August 2010, 190 patients were registered in the study, 159 enrolled, and 153 were eligible for analysis. EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy sampled an average of 3 and 4 lymph node stations per patient, respectively. The mean short axis of the lymph node biopsied by EBUS-TBNA was 6.9 ± 2.9 mm. The prevalence of N2/N3 disease was 35% (53/153). There was excellent agreement between EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy for mediastinal staging in 136 patients (91% Kappa, 0.8EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy achieve similar results for the mediastinal staging of lung cancer. As performed in this study, EBUS-TBNA can replace mediastinoscopy in patients with potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer.
