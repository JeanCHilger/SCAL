Endoscopic ultrasound-guided anterograde treatment of biliary stones following gastric bypass. Endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones in gastric bypass patients is challenging. We describe a novel method involving endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided anterograde interventions. After prior experience with EUS-guided rendezvous endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and direct EUS-guided anterograde stenting for malignant biliary obstruction, we have attempted EUS-guided treatment of biliary stones as first-line therapy following gastric bypass. Our approach involves: (i) EUS-fine needle aspiration (FNA) puncture into an intrahepatic bile duct (ii) EUS-guided cholangiography
