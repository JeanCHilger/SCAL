Update in biliary endoscopy. Biliary endoscopy has seen the development of several new techniques in the last few years. Its current role includes direct diagnostic imaging, tissue sampling, early diagnosis and palliation of biliary tumors. Relatively new methods for biliary stones management are electrohydraulic lithotripsy combined with choledochoscope guidance and laser lithotripsy. Intraductal ultrasound, confocal laser endomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography are emerging, purely diagnostic endoscopic tools in biliary endoscopy. Cytological examinations such as digital imaging analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization have the potential of becoming very important in the early diagnosis of biliary tumors. Direct visualization of the biliary mucosa and tissue sampling can be done with the last generation of cholangioscopes. All these tools are promising, especially for the 'undetermined biliary strictures'. Improvements in quality of life, survival and biliary drainage in patients with non-operable cholangiocarcinoma have been reported after the application of both photodynamic therapy and high-dose rate intraluminal brachytherapy. Drug-eluting stents with incorporated anti-tumor agents designed to improve patency and reduce the risk of tumor ingrowth have already been tested, and other stents are under investigation as well.
