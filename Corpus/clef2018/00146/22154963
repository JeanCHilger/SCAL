Biliary papillomatosis in three Caucasian patients in a Western centre. Biliary papillomatosis (BP) is a rare condition with a strong potential for malignant transformation and cases from Western centres are sparse.(1) We discuss the presentation, investigation and management of this condition in three Caucasian patients and present a review of the existing literature on BP.The case notes of three Caucasian patients with BP who presented to our tertiary referral centre were reviewed. Their case histories, investigations and managements are presented. A search of MEDLINE, PubMed and Cochrane databases was performed to review relevant literature around BP.BP is a rare condition characterised by multiple papillary adenomas involving the biliary tree which lead to recurrent attacks of cholangitis. It is a low-grade neoplasm with high malignant potential and should be regarded as a pre-malignant lesion.
