Klatskin tumors and the accuracy of the Bismuth-Corlette classification. The Bismuth-Corlette (BC) classification is the current preoperative standard to assess hilar cholangiocarcinomas (HC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy, sensitivity, and prognostic value of the BC classification. Data of patients undergoing resection for HC were analyzed.  Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and standard computed tomography were undertaken in all cases. Additional 3D-CT-reconstructions, magnetic resonance imaging, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography were obtained in selected patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the  literature was performed. Ninety patients underwent resection of the hilar bile duct confluence, with right or left hemihepatectomy in 68 instances. The overall accuracy of the BC classification was 48 per cent. Rates of BC under- and over-estimation were 29 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively.  The addition of MRI, 3D-CT-reconstructions, or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography improved the accuracy to 49 per cent (P = 1.0), 53 per cent (P = 0.074), and 64 per cent (P < 0.001), respectively. Lowest sensitivity rates were for BC Type IIIA/IIIB tumors. Meta-analysis  of published BC data corresponding to 540 patients did not reach significance. The BC classification has low accuracy and no prognostic value in cases of HC undergoing resection.
