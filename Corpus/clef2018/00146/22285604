Diffusion-weighted MR imaging for detection of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. To measure the sensitivity of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and determine the most appropriate b value for DWI to explore the correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value and the degree of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma differentiation.Preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance examinations were performed for 31 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Tumor ADC values were measured, and the signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and signal-intensity ratio between the diffusion-weighted images with various b values as well as the T2-weighted images were calculated. Pathologically confirmed patients were pathologically graded to compare the ADC value with different b values of tumor at different degrees of differentiation, and the results were statistically analyzed by using the Friedman test.A total of 29 cases of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were detected by DWI. As the b value increased, tumor signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio between the tumor and normal liver gradually decreased, but the tumor signal-intensity ratio gradually increased. When b=800 s/mm2, contrast-to-noise ratio between tumor and normal liver, tumor signal-intensity ratio, and tumor signal-to-noise ratio of diffusion-weighted images were all higher than those of T2-weighted images the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). As the b value increased, the tumor ADC value gradually declined. As the degree of differentiation decreased, the tumor ADC value declined.The b value of 800 s/mm2 was the best in DWI of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma the lesion ADC value declined as the degree of cancerous tissue differentiation decreased.
