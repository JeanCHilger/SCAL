Duplicated gallbladder: surgical application and review of the literature. Duplicated gallbladder is a rare congenital anomaly, usually asymptomatic and occurring as incidental radiographic or surgical finding during upper abdomen, liver and extrahepatic biliary tract surgery. We report on a case of two separate gallbladders, one main and one accessory, each one with its own cystic duct. The main cystic duct drained into the common bile duct while the accessory bile duct extruded into the left side of common bile duct just inferior to the main cystic duct termination. Imaging advances such as computerized tomography, intraoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may aid in the establishment of accurate diagnosis. The anomaly is of great importance because the surgeon may miss the main or the accessory gallbladder and the patient may need to be re-operated in case of cholelithiasis.
