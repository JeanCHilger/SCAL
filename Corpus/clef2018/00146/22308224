Diagnosis of a biliary cystadenoma demonstrating communication with the biliary system by MRI using a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent. Biliary cystadenomas are predominately benign tumours that have a low malignant potential. We present a case of a 30-year-old female with a histopathological confirmation of a biliary cystadenoma following resection. The diagnosis was made pre-operatively by MRI using the hepatocyte-specific contrast agent gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) (MultiHance Bracco Diagnostics Inc., Princeton, NJ). At the biliary excretory phase, delayed phase images demonstrated communication between the multilocular cystic mass and the biliary tree, which helped to confirm the diagnosis of biliary cystadenoma. This highlights the beneficial use of hepatocyte-specific agents for their dual function as an extracellular agent and a hepatobiliary agent.
