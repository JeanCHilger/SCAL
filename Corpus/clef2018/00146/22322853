Curative resection of combined neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder has very rarely been reported as it accounts for only 0.5% of all neuroendocrine tumors. It has a very aggressive biological behavior. These tumors are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and surgical management is therefore not an option. We performed a hepatopancreaticoduodenectomy along with adjuvant chemotherapy in a 48-year-old patient with a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder. The patient has been followed up at the outpatient clinic for 18 months without there having been any recurrence. Patients with a locally invasive neuroendocrine carcinoma in the gallbladder may benefit from aggressive surgical treatment followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary management in high-grade metastatic tumors is, however, mainly medical.
