We report 3 cases of extramedullary neurenteric cyst without associated dysraphic lesions. One of the cases had an ultrastructural study. Magnetic resonance imaging provided a preoperative diagnosis. The embryogenesis of neurenteric cysts, their main clinical aspects and their surgical treatment are reviewed.
