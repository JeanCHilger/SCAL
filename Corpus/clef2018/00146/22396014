Improving malaria management through Rapid Diagnostic Tests: appropriation by providers communities (Sénégal). Introduced in the public health services in Senegal since 2007, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are a new technical opportunity for clinical diagnosis of malaria. We analyze how different categories of caregivers, who are the providers, assume appropriation of their professional practices. Similarly, we document, from the analysis of their application for care, attitudes of recipients towards RDTs. The results show a time lag between the uses of this tool and the recommendations. RDTs have a recognized epidemiological usefulness. However, their positive integration requires a change in behaviors that caregivers and recipients are not always willing to assume. Indeed, the architecture, working conditions and applications for care influence the modes of appropriation of this technical innovation.
