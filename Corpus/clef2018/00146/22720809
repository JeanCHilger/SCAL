Alimentary neoplasia in geriatric dogs and cats. Lymphomas, carcinomas, leiomyomas, and stromal tumors are the most common tumors found in the canine and feline gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic and surgical biopsies are often the mainstays of diagnosis, although ultrasound is playing an increasingly greater role. Small cell lymphocytic lymphoma of the feline intestines poses a special diagnostic dilemma and may require immunohistochemistry as well as polymerase chain reaction to distinguish it from lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis. This article will focus on the more common neoplastic problems of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of geriatric dogs and cats.
