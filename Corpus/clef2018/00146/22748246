Endoscopic management of benign biliary strictures. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the first-line management in most situations when a benign biliary stricture is suspected. Although management principles are similar in all subgroups, the anticipated response rates, need for ancillary medical and endoscopic approaches, and use of less proven strategies vary between differing causes. Exclusion of malignancy should always be a focus of management. Newer endoscopic techniques such as endoscopic ultrasound, cholangioscopy, confocal endomicroscopy, and metal biliary stenting are increasingly complementing traditional ERCP techniques in achieving long-term sustained stricture resolution. Surgery remains a definitive management alternative when a prolonged trial of endoscopic therapy does not achieve treatment goals.
