Breast carcinoma with asymptomatic metastasis to the gallbladder. The biliary tract is an unusual site of metastasis from breast carcinoma, and this has rarely been reported in the literature. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for an incidental finding of gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasonography, which was subsequently confirmed to be consistent with metastasis from the breast primary.
