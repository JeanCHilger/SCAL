¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and small bowel endoscopy in a patient with small bowel leiomyoma. A 49-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin, after repeated negative endoscopic and radiographic evaluation, including colonoscopy, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, CT and angiography. His condition had not been diagnosed for the past 18 years. ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET/CT) showed mild FDG uptake by a tumor of the small bowel (SUVmax 2.83), and capsule endoscopy (CE) and double balloon endoscopy (DBE) revealed a well-defined smooth submucosal tumor in the jejunum. The patient underwent a laparotomy and small bowel resection. The pathologic diagnosis was a small intestinal leiomyoma. Our report suggests the significance of combination of CE, DBE and PET/CT in the diagnosis of small bowel leiomyoma.
