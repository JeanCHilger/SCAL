Primary small bowel malignancy: a 10-year clinical experience from Southern Taiwan. The difficulty in establishing early definitive diagnosis and treatment of primary small bowel malignancy (PSBM) is a challenge for clinicians. This study aimed to analyze the symptomatology, diagnosis and outcomes of PSBM.A retrospective chart review study was conducted on 49 patients who underwent surgical treatment for PSBM at a tertiary hospital between May 2000 and January 2010.The patients with PSBM had non-specific clinical symptoms. Major diagnostic tools in the current study were computed tomography (CT) (n=40), gastrointestinal series radiography (n=10), angiography (n=5), double-balloon enteroscopy (n=3), gastroduodenoscopy (n=2), magnetic resonance imaging (n=1) and exploratory laparotomy (n=8). Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was the most common PSBM (n=21), followed by lymphoma (n=14), adenocarcinoma (n=8), leiomyosarcoma (n=3) and sarcoma (n=3). The overall 5-year cumulative survival rate of the patients with PSBM was 57.1% with a mean survival time of 31.8Â±7.8 months. The 5-year cumulative survival rates for the different PSBMs were 79.1%, 46.9% and 33.2% for GIST, adenocarcinomas and lymphomas, respectively (p=0.087).CT is very useful in detecting PSBM. Poor prognosis in PSBM patients detected by CT or angiography could be the result of delayed diagnosis prior to the procedure.
