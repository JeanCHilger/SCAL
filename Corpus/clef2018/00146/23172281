A case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with protein-losing enteropathy. Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a syndrome characterized by excessive gastrointestinal protein loss, resulting in hypoproteinemia and edema. A variety of benign and malignant conditions can be associated with PLE and acute leukemia is a very rare cause of PLE. We report a case of PLE associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A 27-year-old man was admitted due to watery diarrhea, epigastric pain and bilateral leg edema. Laboratory findings showed hypoproteinemia and polycythemia. The diagnosis of PLE and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were confirmed on the measurement of fecal a1-antitrypsin clearance and bone marrow examination. After systemic chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, his clinical symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings were gradually improved.
