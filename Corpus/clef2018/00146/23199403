Diagnosing malaria in pregnancy: an update. Pregnancy malaria (PM) due to Plasmodium falciparum is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for women and their offspring, but is difficult to recognize and diagnose. During PM, parasites typically sequester in the placenta, whereas peripheral blood smears often appear negative. In addition, many infected women remain asymptomatic, especially in areas of high transmission where systemic immunity is high, although sequelae including maternal anemia and intrauterine growth retardation develop insidiously and increase mortality. New rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have shown promise for malaria diagnosis in nonpregnant individuals, including a product recently approved by the US FDA for use in the USA. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for diagnosis of PM may be suboptimal. Here, we review the methods that are used to detect or diagnose PM, including blood smear microscopy, RDTs, PCR-based methods, and finally placental histology, which is often cited as the gold standard for use in research studies and clinical trials.
