Biliary obstruction induces extremely elevated serum CA 19-9 levels: case report. Assessment of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels is used for diagnosis and follow-up of pancreaticobiliary cancers, and high levels of this biomarker are suggestive of a malignancy. CA 19-9 may also be elevated in patients with conditions other than tumors, such as cholestasis, biliary obstruction, and cholecystitis.A 50-year-old male patient presented with jaundice and elevated CA 19-9 levels (161,902 IU/ml). Repeated biopsies of the common bile duct revealed no malignancies. Radiological findings indicated a mass protruding through the common bile duct. Positron emission tomography demonstrated increased (18)F-fluoro2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in the liver and a mass resembling metastasis was detected. A Whipple procedure was performed and demonstrated no tumor. Postoperatively, CA 19-9 levels decreased to within normal limits (27 IU/ml).These results indicate that CA 19-9 levels should not be the sole criterion for a diagnosis of malignancy. Although other analytical tools may aid diagnosis, surgical exploration may be required in some instances to avoid misdiagnosis and determine whether radiological results are falsely positive.
