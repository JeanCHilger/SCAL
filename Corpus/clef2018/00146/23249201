Actionable theranostics for global maternal health: a focus on HIV and malaria. A new wave of rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics, which harness the power of genomics and proteomics, hold great potential to improve aspects of maternal health on a global scale. This review will provide a context to issues related to global maternal health and highlight international endeavors aimed to alleviate morbidity and mortality during pregnancy, childbirth and into the postnatal period. The authors will couple these efforts to actionable and promising theranostic advancements in the detection and treatment of HIV and malaria through the lens of maternal global health strategies.
