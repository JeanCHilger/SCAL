A case of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bile duct. A 74-year-old man presented to a physician with a chief complaint of jaundice. He was diagnosed with bile duct carcinoma and admitted to our hospital. Laboratory data revealed abnormally elevated levels of total bilirubin, serum hepatic transaminase, and CA19-9. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed neoplastic stenosis from the hilus hepatis to the common bile duct. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed an enhancing tumor in the hilus hepatis bile duct, and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) revealed abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the tumor. Under a diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the patient underwent an extended right hepatectomy and left hepatico -jejunostomy. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56. The tumor was diagnosed as primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bile duct. The patient exhibited multiple liver metastasis 6 months after the operation. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed for the liver metastasis. Although TACE exerted a cytoreductive effect temporarily, multiple liver abscesses developed. The patient died of liver failure 16 months after the operation. We report this rare case of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bile duct.
