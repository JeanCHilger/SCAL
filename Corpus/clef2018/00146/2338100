Computed tomography with intravenous cholangiography contrast: a method for visualizing choledochal cysts. Our patient presented with a typical case history and typical symptoms. She also belongs to a group with a high incidence of the disorder. The diagnosis was suspected at ultrasonography, which accurately detected the presence and location of a cyst, but could not establish its origin. Computed tomography is a better diagnostic tool, as it will detect small differences in attenuation and thus identify contrast accumulation in the bile ducts, even when the function of the lever parenchyma is decreased. As scanning is performed in the transverse plane with the patient supine, the layering of contrast medium in the dilated duct is also displayed. In the analysis of our case, the accumulation of biliary contrast medium in the lesion at CT established its origin. The fusiform nature of the dilatation (the type I form of the disorder), was demonstrated at ERCP, after which the operation was performed.
