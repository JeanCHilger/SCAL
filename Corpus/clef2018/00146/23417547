ERCP with intracholedocal biopsy for the diagnosis of biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma in children. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common tumor of the biliary tract in children. Although some features at preoperative radiographic studies (ultrasound, CT, MRI) may be suggestive of BT-RMS, until few years ago the final diagnosis was obtained by either operative or transcutaneous biopsy, thus exposing to a risk of regional dissemination. More recent and still anecdotal, is the histological diagnosis on tissue obtained by transluminal biopsy either during transhepatic cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), the latter having the major advantage of a much lower risk of loco-regional dissemination. We present two cases of BT-RMS that were histologically diagnosed by intracholedocal biopsy performed during ERCP, after being suspected at conventional imaging.
