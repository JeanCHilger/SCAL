Single-session endosonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliopancreatic diseases is feasible, effective and cost beneficial. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are often required in patients with pancreaticobiliary disorders.To assess the clinical impact and costs savings of a single session EUS-ERCP.Patient and intervention data from April 2009 to March 2012 were prospectively recruited and retrospectively analyzed from a database at a tertiary hospital. Indications, diagnostic yield, procedure details, complications and costs were evaluated.Fifty-five scheduled combined procedures were done in 53 patients. The accuracy of EUS-fine needle aspiration for malignancy was 90%. The main clinical indication was a malignant obstructing lesion (66%). The ERCP cannulation was successful in 67%, and in 11/15 failed ERCP (73%), drainage was completed thanks to an EUS-guided biliary drainage: 6 transmurals, 5 rendezvous. Eight patients (14%) had related complications: bacteremia (n = 3), pancreatitis (n = 2), bleeding (n = 2) and perforation (n = 1). The mean duration was 65 ± 22.2 min. The mean estimated cost for a single session was €3437, and €4095 for two separate sessions. The estimated cost savings using a single-session strategy was €658 per patient, representing a total savings of €36,189.Combined EUS and ERCP is safe, technically feasible and cost beneficial. Furthermore, in failed ERCP cases, the endoscopic biliary drainage can be completed with EUS-guided biliary access in the same procedure.
