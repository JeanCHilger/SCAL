A novel preoperative fusion analysis using three-dimensional MDCT combined with three-dimensional MRI for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anatomical relationship between the tumor, portal veins, hepatic arteries, and hilar hepatic ducts at the hepatic hilum using a novel preoperative fusion analysis for patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. This involved combining three-dimensional multidetector-row computed tomography with three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. This novel fusion imaging technique can play an important clinical role for patients undergoing surgery for hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
