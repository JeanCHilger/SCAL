Rarity of severe bleeding and perforation in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for submucosal tumors. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is an established procedure for the pathological diagnosis of gastrointestinal submucosal tumors (SMTs). Although bleeding and perforation are potentially severe complications of EUS-FNA, the incidences and severities of these complications have not yet been fully evaluated because of their relative rarity.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidences and mortality of severe bleeding and perforation in patients who underwent EUS-FNA for SMTs.The records of 1,135 consecutive patients who underwent EUS-FNA for SMTs at 219 hospitals, with low- to high-volume, were reviewed using a Japanese nationwide administrative database.Of the targeted lesions 73.5% were located in the stomach, 13.4% in the esophagus, 8.2% in the duodenum, and 4.9% at other sites. Five patients (0.44%) experienced severe bleeding requiring red blood cell transfusion or endoscopic treatment, with none experiencing perforation. Only one patient (0.09%) died in-hospital within 30 days of EUS-FNA (0.09%), with death not associated with bleeding or perforation.EUS-FNA is safe in evaluating SMTs, with low risks of bleeding and perforation.
