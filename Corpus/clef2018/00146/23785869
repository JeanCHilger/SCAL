Comparison of an immuno-chromatographic technique-based kit (Malaria card) with microscopy for rapid diagnosis of malaria in and around Loni, Maharashtra. Although Plasmodium vivax is the major species responsible for malaria in most parts of India, P. falciparum infections have now increasingly been reported from some parts of India. A study was therefore, undertaken to compare immuno-chromatographic technique (ICT) based Malaria card test with microscopic examination of peripheral blood film in diagnosis of malaria in and around Loni, Maharashtra. A total of 143 (about 24%) samples of 590 febrile patients tested were detected positive for malarial infection- 74 samples for P. vivax (approx. 52%) and 69 for P. falciparum (approx. 48%). With Malaria card test, the sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 92.6% were recorded for P. vivax and 95.2% and 95.5% for P. falciparum, respectively. Therefore, the test is a valuable adjunct in an emergency for rapid diagnosis of malaria, though microscopy remains the mainstay for routine use in countries, like India.
