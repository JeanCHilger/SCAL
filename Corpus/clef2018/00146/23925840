Imaging bile duct tumors: pathologic concepts, classification, and early tumor detection. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy of the bile ducts which has several predisposing factors such as hepatolithiasis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, and can develop from precancerous conditions such as biliary intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. As surgical resection of early stage cholangiocarcinoma or precancerous lesions may provide better prognosis, early detection of those lesions is very important. Imaging studies play important roles in the diagnosis of bile duct tumors followed by appropriate management. Indeed, not only diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma but also appropriate categorization of bile duct tumors based on their morphologic features and location on cross-sectional imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, is important to predict their biologic behaviors, and choose relevant treatment strategies. We herein review the classification system of the bile duct tumors with their radiologic and pathologic findings as well as role of imaging in the early detection of bile duct tumors.
