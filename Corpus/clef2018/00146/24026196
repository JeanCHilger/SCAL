Cystic duct with no visible signal on magnetic resonance cholangiography is associated with laparoscopic difficulties: an analysis of 695 cases. We investigated the association between the magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) results and surgical difficulties and bile duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).MRC was performed on 695 consecutive patients before LC. We divided the patients into two groups (visible cystic duct group and "no signal" cystic duct on MRC group) and compared them with regard to the length of the operation, conversion rate to open cholecystectomy (OC) and rate of bile duct injury.The "no signal" cystic duct on MRC group had a longer operation and higher rate of conversion to OC compared with the visible cystic duct group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence rate of bile duct injury between the two groups.The "no signal" cystic duct on MRC group was associated with laparoscopic difficulties, but not with an increased rate of biliary injury. When a visible cystic duct is not observed on MRC an early conversion to open surgery may avoid a bile duct injury during LC.
