Gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the duodenum: surgical management and survival results. To provide long-term survival results of operable duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (DGISTs) in a tertiary center in China.In this retrospective study, the pathological data of 28 patients with DGISTs who had been treated surgically at the Second Department of General Surgery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (SRRSH) from June 1998 to December 2006 were reviewed. All pathological slides were examined by a single pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. In patients whose diagnosis was not confirmed by immunohistochemistry at the time of resection, representative paraffin blocks were reassembled, and sections were studied using antibodies against CD117 (c-kit), CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin, S-100, actin (HHF35), and desmin. Operative procedures were classified as wedge resection (WR, local resection with pure closure, without duodenal transection or anastomosis), segmental resection [SR, duodenal transection with Roux-Y or Billroth II gastrojejunostomy (G-J), end-to-end duodenoduodenostomy (D-D), end-to-end or end-to-side duodenojejunostomy (D-J)], and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD, Whipple operation with pancreatojejunostomy). R0 resection was pursued in all cases, and at least R1 resection was achieved. Regional lymphadenectomy was not performed. Clinical manifestations, surgery, medical treatment and follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed. Related studies in the literature were reviewed.There were 12 males and 16 females patients, with a median age of 53 years (20-76 years). Their major complaints were "gastrointestinal bleeding" (57.2%) and "nonspecific discomfort" (32.1%). About 14.3%, 60.7%, 17.9%, and 7.1% of the tumors originated in the first to fourth portion, respectively, with a median size of 5.8 cm (1.6-20 cm). Treatment was by WR in 5 cases (17.9%), SR in 13 cases (46.4%), and by PD in 10 cases (35.7%). The morbidity and mortality rates were 35.7% and 3.6%, respectively. The median post-operative stay was 14.5 d (5-47 d). During a follow-up of 61 (23-164) mo, the 2-year and 5-year relapse-free survival was 83.3% and 50%, respectively. Eighty-four related articles were reviewed.Surgeons can choose to perform limited resection or PD for operable DGISTs if clear surgical margins are achieved. Comprehensive treatment is necessary.
