Hepatobiliary cystadenomas. Hepatobiliary cystadenomas are rare cystic tumours that can arise from any portion of the biliary tract but most commonly develop intrahepatically. They typically cause non-specific symptoms and are often detected incidentally. Cystadenomas can be mistaken for simple hepatic cysts on radiological imaging, which leads to inadequate treatment. Hepatobiliary cystadenomas have a malignant predisposition and a high recurrence rate. Complete excision including hepatic resection is therefore generally recommended.Three cases of hepatobiliary cystadenoma were identified at one unit over a six-month period. Their clinical details and management are reported.Three female patients are described aged 25, 37 and 73 years. One patient presented because of recurrent infection, one presented because of pressure related symptoms and one lesion was identified incidentally. All patients were investigated by ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), two additionally had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and one had a liver biopsy. The tumours were 4-16cm in size and all lesions were excised by non-anatomical, parenchyma sparing resections. Histology revealed mixed epithelium with underlying ovarian-like stroma.The management of hepatic cystadenomas as well as operative and pathological findings are discussed. Preoperative ultrasonography, CT and MRI is recommended, and early referral for specialist hepatobiliary review is advised. Operative resection is also recommended and complete excision was achieved in these cases. This strategy is supported by the current literature and recurrence has been shown to be unlikely.
