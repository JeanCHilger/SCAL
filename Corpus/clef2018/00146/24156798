Can biliary-cyst communication be predicted by Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR cholangiography before treatment for hepatic hydatid disease? To evaluate the role of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) in the evaluation of biliary-cyst communication (BCC) before treatment for hepatic hydatid disease (HHD).Thirty-one patients with clinical and laboratory follow-up for HHD with suspected diagnosis of BCC underwent three-dimensional (3D) T2-weighted MRC and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRC, dynamic 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequences, using Gd-EOB-DTPA to identify the presence or absence of BCC. A total of 45 hepatic hydatid cysts in the 31 patients were evaluated for cyst diameter, BCC, and the time to contrast-enhancement of the hydatid cyst after Gd-EOB-DTPA injection. The surgical and interventional radiological procedures and imaging findings were compared. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both techniques in identification of BCC were calculated.The accuracy of contrast-enhanced MRC for identifying BCC was superior with a sensitivity of 87.4% and accuracy of 90.5% (p < 0.05). A diameter of â‰¥10 cm was associated with significantly increased risk of BCC on contrast-enhanced MRC images (p < 0.05).The use of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC yields information that complements T2-weighted MRC findings and improves identification of BCC. The use of T2-weighted MRC, in addition to contrast-enhanced MRC, is recommended to increase preoperative accuracy of identifying BCC.
