Accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography in assessing response to therapy and mucosal healing in patients with Crohn's disease. We assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) in monitoring response to therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) using ileocolonoscopy as a reference standard.We performed a prospective multicenter study of 48 patients with active CD and ulcers in at least one ileocolonic segment. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy and MRE at baseline and 12 weeks after completing treatment with corticosteroids (CS) or anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. Disease activity was quantified using Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) and Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA). The primary analysis was to determine the accuracy of MRE in identification of healing, defined as the disappearance of ulcers in endoscopy examination. Additional analyses established the accuracy of MRE in determining endoscopic remission (a CDEIS score <3.5) and change in severity based on consideration of all segments.MRE determined ulcer healing with 90% accuracy and endoscopic remission with 83% accuracy. The mean CDEIS and MaRIA scores significantly changed at week 12 in segments with ulcer healing, based on endoscopic examination (CDEIS: 21.28 ± 9.10 at baseline vs 2.73 ± 4.12 at 12 weeks P < .001 and MaRIA: 18.86 ± 9.50 at baseline vs 8.73 ± 5.88 at 12 weeksMRE evaluates ulcer healing with a high level of accuracy when ileocolonoscopy is used as the reference standard. The MaRIA is a valid, responsive, and reliable index assessing response to therapy in patients with CD.
