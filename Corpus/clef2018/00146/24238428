Diagnostic challenges of composite colorectal tumors of adenoma-mantle cell lymphoma type. Composite intestinal tumors of adenoma-lymphoma type are rare. To our knowledge 1 tumor showing this association has been previously reported, the histologic diagnosis being made retrospectively. We report the case of an 80-year old male patient complaining for epigastric pain, rectorrhagia, diarrhea, and weight loss. At endoscopy, a rectal lesion (3 cm) of villous low-grade dysplasia adenoma type was detected. Due to persistence of symptoms, new gastro- and coloscopies were performed, the biopsies showing low-grade dysplasia adenomas (right colon, and rectum) and an abundant lymphoid infiltrate (gastroduodenal anastomosis, small intestine, sigmoid, right and left colon, transverse colon, and rectum) of mantle cell lymphoma type, the rectal polyp being composed of both tumor types. The muscularis mucosa was focally infiltrated by the lymphoma, the bulk of the lymphoma being submucosal. After the treatment of 8 mini-cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, prednisone cures, lymphoma persisted. On endoscopic ultrasound examination, after the 6 cures of bendamustine following the cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, prednisone treatment, the signal of the rectal villous lesion disappeared in the peripheral layers, including of the muscular layer, suggestive of an invasive lesion or persistence of lymphoma. Biopsies confirmed the persistence of the rectal adenoma with low and high-grade adenoma, without lymphoma. In conclusion, the biopsic diagnosis of composite intestinal tumors of adenoma-mantle cell lymphoma type may be challenging, the bulk of the lymphoma being submucosal as in the present case. Although the malignant tumor treatment is the priority in such cases, the effects of chemotherapy on the evolution of benign tumors such as adenomas should be carefully assessed.
