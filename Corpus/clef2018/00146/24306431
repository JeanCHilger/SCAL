Large hepatic adenoma in a 21-year-old male. Hepatic adenoma is an uncommon benign lesion of the liver that occurs more frequently in women in their third and fourth decades. The female/male ratio is up to 11:1. Hepatic adenomas may be single or multiple occasionally reaching sizes up to 20 cm. They are non-cancerous lesions, however they can become malignant. We present a 21-year-old male patient with no medical history who presented with abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, abnormal liver function tests and a 14 kg weight loss in a 2-year period. A CT scan was performed with a 17 cm tumour compressing intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient underwent a right hepatectomy with no complications. Histopathological analysis of the tumour revealed a hepatic adenoma with central necrosis. The patient is asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up.
