Diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: value of contrast agent in the gallbladder and cystic duct on Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MR cholangiography. To evaluate value of %volume of contrast agent in gallbladder and contrast in cystic duct in diagnosis of acute cholecysititis with Gd-EOB-DTPA MRC obtained 60 min after contrast injection (T1-MRC60min). We included 16 acute cholecystitis (AC), 23 chronic cholecystitis (CC), and 40 healthy volunteers. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed cutoff value of 30.5% as predictor of AC comparing with healthy volunteers (sensitivity 93.8%, specificity 100%, AUC 0.958) and cutoff of 0% as predictor of AC comparing CC (sensitivity 81.2%, specificity 82.6%, AUC 0.823). In AC absent or obliterated cystic duct on T1-MRC60min showed 81.3%, 100%, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. These can be helpful for diagnosis of AC.
