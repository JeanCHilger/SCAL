A surgical case of peritoneal dissemination metastasis of bile duct carcinoma after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for bile duct carcinoma in April 2010. In August 2011, abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a solitary tumor (30Ã—17 mm in diameter) behind the anastomosis of gastrojejunostomy. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed gastrojejunal ulceration (biopsy: Group V adenocarcinoma). Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed a solitary tumor without any recurrence. We diagnosed the patient as having solitary recurrence of peritoneal dissemination of bile duct carcinoma. In September 2011, we performed resection of the peritoneal dissemination. The patient was discharged from the hospital 12 days after the operation and had a good postoperative course. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as peritoneal dissemination of bile duct carcinoma. Subsequently, the patient received postoperative chemotherapy. The patient remains alive with recurrence of peritoneal dissemination 37 months after pancreaticoduodenectomy and 20 months after resection of the peritoneal dissemination.
