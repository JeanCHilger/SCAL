Insertion of percutaneous transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis for unresectable lower cholangiocellular carcinoma following cholangitis due to endoscopic biliary plastic stent obstruction. The patient was an 87-year-old woman who was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which was treated with an anticoagulant, and with chronic kidney disease. The patient was diagnosed as having liver dysfunction and lower cholangiocellular carcinoma (cStage I) on ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Since it was impossible to perform curative resection owing to the patient's decreased cardiac and renal function, we performed palliative endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) with a plastic stent (PS), and the patient was discharged 11 days later. However, the patient was readmitted because of fever (>38.0Â°C) and vomiting 124 days after ERBD. We assumed that the patient had developed cholangitis due to PS obstruction. Moreover, her blood culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. We were unable to replace the PS as the tumor had increased in size and hemorrhage from the papilla of Vater continued after the stent had been removed. The signs of inflammation improved after treatment of sepsis with antibiotics and immunoglobulins, and we performed percutaneous transhepatic cholangio drainage( PTCD) and eventually inserted a percutaneous transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis (PTBE) with an expandable metallic stent (EMS). The patient died 2 months later no stent occlusion was observed. Our experience suggests that endoscopic biliary stents should be selected bearing in mind the patency of the stent and the prognosis.
