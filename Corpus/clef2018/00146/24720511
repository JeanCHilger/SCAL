Novel method of endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy to prevent stent dysfunction. The present study assesses the feasibility as well as the technical and functional success rates of a novel endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) technique called the locking stent method that uses end-bare covered metallic stents (EBCMS).Twenty consecutive patients who were histologically diagnosed with unresectable cancer complicated with obstructive jaundice underwent EUS-HGS due to failed endoscopic biliary drainage or inaccessible papilla. We retrospectively collected clinical data for these patients including technical and functional success rates and complications.Seven were treated by EUS-HGS (EUS-HGS group), and 13 were treated using the locking stent EUS-HGS method (LS group). Technical and functional success rates were 100% in both groups. Procedural duration did not significantly differ between the EUS-HGS and LS groups (26.9 ± 9.0 versus 32.3 ± 11.1 min, P = 0.30). Two patients developed complications related to stent migration in the EUS-HGS group. In contrast, although mild post-procedural bile peritonitis required conservative treatment for a few days, none of the stents malfunctioned in the LS group.Our method can safely and effectively prevent stent dysfunction, but validation in a prospective clinical trial is required.
