One case of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma amenable to resection after radioembolization. We report the case of a 57-year-old man who was diagnosed with a large unresectable cholangiocarcinoma associated with 2 satellite nodules and without clear margins with the right hepatic vein. Despite 4 cycles of GEMOX (stopped due to a hypertransaminasemia believed to be due to gemcitabine) and 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, the tumor remained stable and continued to be considered unresectable. Radioembolization (resin microspheres, SIRS-spheres) targeting the left liver (474 MBq) and segment IV (440 MBq) was performed. This injection was very well tolerated, and 4 more cycles of FOLFIRINOX were given while waiting for radioembolization efficacy. On computed tomography scan, a partial response was observed the tumor was far less hypervascularized, and a margin was observed between the tumor and the right hepatic vein. A left hepatectomy enlarged to segment VIII was performed. On pathological exam, most of the tumor was acellular, with dense fibrosis around visible microspheres. Viable cells were observed only at a distance from beads. Radioembolization can be useful in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, allowing in some cases a secondary resection.
