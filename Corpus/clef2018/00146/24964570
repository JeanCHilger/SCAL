Giant liver hemangioma in patient with ileal gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. These tumors represent more than 80% of all mesenchymal tumors found in the gastrointestinal tract, though they account for only approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Literature offers case reports, which describe symptomatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors and they generally represent patients with larger tumors.We present the case of a small gastrointestinal stromal tumor in a 40-year-old man, with associated giant liver hemangioma and fever, and with history of abdominal discomfort and fever. Clinical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, palpable mass in the right lower abdomen, and signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 (Morbus von Recklinghausen). Computed tomography revealed a giant tumor in the right lobe of the liver. Magnetic resonance showed abscess in the hemangioma of the liver. An intestinal tumor was incidentally found and excised during surgical laparotomy. An intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor was revealed by histopathology and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Although a multidisciplinary team proposed surgical removal of the liver tumor mass, the surgeons decided to follow up the patient because of a high risk of new intervention.According to the available data, this is a very rare case of small intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor, with symptoms of fever and giant abscess in the liver hemangioma.
