Single-incision laparoscopic surgery for a small-intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor: report of a case. Our report concerns a 64-year-old man with a small-intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), which was successfully treated with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). Small-bowel endoscopy detected a submucosal tumor located approximately 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz in the wall of the proximal jejunum. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a tumor (diameter, 4 cm) containing high- and low-density areas in the proximal jejunum. On 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET), the tumor demonstrated intense FDG uptake (maximum standard uptake value, 3.82), whereas it displayed high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images. No metastatic lesions were observed. The patient was diagnosed with a jejunal GIST. Wedge resection of the jejunum was performed using the SILS procedure. The tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a low-grade malignant GIST. SILS is a useful resection technique for small-intestinal GIST.
