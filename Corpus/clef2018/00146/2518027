Usefulness of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in diagnosis of choledochal cysts in children. We report 11 infants with choledochal cyst confirmed during surgery. In none of the patients an abdominal mass was palpated during physical examination. In 10 (91%) of the patients, ERCP showed the cyst. Ultrasound was positive in 82% (9/11) of the cases. Two patients had acute relapsing pancreatitis with severe anatomical abnormalities at the pancreatobiliary junction. Multiple biliary lithiasis were seen in four cysts. ERCP is of significant value in establishing the diagnosis, defining anatomic abnormalities and complications. ERCP should be the procedure of choice in patients with suspected choledochal cyst.
