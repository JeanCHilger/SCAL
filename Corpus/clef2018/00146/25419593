Small bowel intussussception due to metastatic melanoma of unknown primary site. Case report. Malignant melanoma is characterized by metastases also to the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the small bowel. The diagnosis is often delayed because unspecific clinical presentation (frequently as chronic iron deficiency anemia, rectal bleeding or intestinal obstruction). We present a case of melanoma of unknown primary site, with clinical presentation of intestinal obstruction. A segmental resection of the ileum was performed including mesentery with lymph nodes. Histology revealed metastatic melanoma from unknown primary. PET and MRI confirmed disseminated disease without brain metastasis.
