A case of disease-free, long survival in a patient with mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder treated with induction CDDP/CPT-11 chemotherapy and resection. A 57-year-old woman with a complaint of a right upper quadrant mass was referred to our hospital. Multimodal studies such as PET-CT revealed large hepatic tumors and swollen para-aortic lymph nodes, the origin of which was unclear. Pathological analysis of a biopsy specimen obtained from the liver tumor led to a diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma. After 4 CDDP/CPT-11 chemotherapy treatment courses, remarkable shrinkage of liver tumors and disappearance of the swollen lymph nodes were achieved. Subsequently, liver tumor and extrahepatic bile duct resection and lymphatic dissection were performed. Pathological analysis of the resected specimens revealed that the liver tumors and metastatic lymph nodes originated from the gallbladder, leading to a diagnosis of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma. After 5 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy using the same regimen, the patient has remained disease free for 24 months since the initialdiagnosis.
