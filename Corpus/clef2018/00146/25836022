Characterization of Liver Tumors by Diffusion-Weighted Imaging: Comparison of Diagnostic Performance Using the Mean and Minimum Apparent Diffusion Coefficient. To determine the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(min)) values of benign and malignant hepatic lesions based on diffusion-weighted imaging and to compare the diagnostic performance of ADC(min) and mean ADC (ADC(mean)) values for differentiating between benign and malignant tumors of the liver.We retrospectively subjected 240 patients with 195 malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], n = 137 metastases, n = 44Mean ADC (Ã—10 mm/s) was 1.19 for malignant (HCC, 1.15 metastasis, 1.23Mean ADC and ADC(min) were valuable for differentiating between malignant and benign hepatic lesions. The area under the ROC curve of ADC(min) was significant higher than that of ADC(mean).
