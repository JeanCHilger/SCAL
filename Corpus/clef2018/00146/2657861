Primary carcinoid of the choledochus. The differential diagnosis of obstructive disease processes of the common bile duct can be very difficult even when sonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and angiography are applied. In most cases, morphological changes are due to stones or carcinoma. We report on a case of a carcinoid tumor located in the intrapancreatic part of the common bile duct. Exact localization, delineation and demonstration of the local extension of such a tumor requires at least ERCP and angiography, as these are the most efficient imaging techniques for these purposes.
