Cystadenoma of the gallbladder. A case of obstructive jaundice due to extrinsic common bile duct (CBD) pressure from a gallbladder mass is presented. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) demonstrated a dilated CBD and a massively dilated gallbladder. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a multiseptated cystic structure originating from the gallbladder fossa. Histologic sections of the surgical specimen demonstrated a multilocular cyst lined with biliary-type epithelium. Fibromuscular proliferation of the cyst walls also was noted. A literature search did not reveal documentation of a similar gallbladder lesion. We believe this lesion represents the first reported case of gallbladder cystadenoma.
