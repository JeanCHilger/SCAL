CT and MRT--their influence on surgery. The introduction of new pictorial methods in the last decade and the increase of information for the surgeon have brought about changes not only in several therapeutic concepts but also in the indications for surgery and in surgical strategies. The influence of CT and MRT on surgery can be summarized in 3 points: 1. Substitution of previous forms of surgical therapy by interventional radiology. Examples are curative CT-guided percutaneous puncture and drainage of abscesses of the liver and other organs. 2. Improved diagnostics and follow-up of acute morphologic processes with non-correlating clinical signs, as acute necrotizing pancreatitis allows a better definition of the therapeutic concept. 3. Advances in tumour surgery by early detection of malignant processes and improved follow up after surgery for the early detection of recurrences and metastases.
