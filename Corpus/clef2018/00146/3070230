Diagnostic strategy of the liver and bile ducts. The diagnosis of gallbladder and liver diseases depends primarily on noninvasive techniques (ultrasound and computer tomogram). Gallstones can be detected by ultrasonography in more than 90% of such patients and this is a sufficient indication for operation. The preoperative diagnosis of stones of the biliary tract by sonography is however, unreliable. Even a preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography cannot justify foregoing an intraoperative cholangiogram. Detection of metastasis is still a problem in the diagnosis of liver tumors. Further developments in computed tomogram and scintigram techniques, however, promise improvements.
