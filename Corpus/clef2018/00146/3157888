A case of echinococcal cyst in the round ligament of the liver. Preliminary note. Hydatidosis is an endemic condition in many countries. The parasite may infect any tissues but the most commonly affected are the liver (70%), lungs (10%), muscles (4.7%), spleen (2.1%) and brain (1.4%) with bone, thyroid, breast and pancreas infections rarely encountered. An observed case of hydatid cyst of the round ligament of the liver is described. The aetiology, physiopathology and diagnosis of the case are briefly reviewed with emphasis on the fact that laparoscopy was better able to clarify the diagnosis than scintigraphy or echography.
