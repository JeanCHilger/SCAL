Hemobilia: comparison of diagnostic technics. Considerations on 14 patients. Fourteen cases of hemobilia of traumatic (six), vascular (six) or neoplastic (two) origin were reviewed. Eleven patients obtained correct diagnosis only be integration of at least two diagnostic procedures out of Ultrasonography, Computed Tomography, arteriography and cholangiography. Although US and CT are extremely useful as screening procedures, correct diagnosis should be only possible by integration of more diagnostic technics. Arterial embolization represents a successful alternative to surgical intervention moreover US may also be helpful for follow-up of treated patients.
