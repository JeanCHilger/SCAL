Pancreatitis associated with congenital duodenal duplication cyst in an adult. A case is reported of an adult patient with a history of relapsing pancreatitis. A soft duodenal submucosal lump was found by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography (ERCP). Endoscopic ultrasonography (endo-US) showed an anechoic lesion covered with normal duodenal wall structure. Histology of the surgically resected cyst confirmed the diagnosis. Since surgery no further attacks of pancreatitis have occurred.
