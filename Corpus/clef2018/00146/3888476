The "liver scan" appearance in cholescintigraphy. A sign of complete common bile duct obstruction. One hundred consecutive Tc-99m IDA hepatobiliary scans were reviewed revealing 14 scans (14%), that showed nonvisualization of the common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder (GB), and small bowel (SB), but good hepatic uptake of Tc-99m IDA derivative, a pattern designated by us as "the liver scan appearance." In 11 of 14 cases (79%), the diagnosis of complete CBD obstruction was confirmed by surgery, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and/or percutaneous needle biopsy (PBx). Common bile duct obstruction was suspected but not proven in the other three cases. The cholescintigraphic, ultrasound, PTC, ERCP, intraoperative cholangiogram, clinical, laboratory, and surgical findings are presented and correlated. The "liver scan-appearance" by cholescintigraphy should suggest a diagnosis of complete common bile duct obstruction however, it does not specifically differentiate between stone or tumor as the cause of obstruction.
