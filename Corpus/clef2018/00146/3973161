MR imaging of a choledochal cyst. The preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) appearance of a choledochal cyst using the saturation recovery-spin echo technique is presented along with the CT and ultrasound images. Although CT suggested the correct diagnosis of choledochal cyst, the "solid" characteristics depicted by sonography led to confusion. The MR image demonstrated a mass, similar to the CT image with both a long T1 and T2, thus substantiating the cystic nature of the mass. Hepatoscintigraphy confirmed the obstructive nature of the lesion.
