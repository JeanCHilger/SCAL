Laparoscopic ultrasonography. Diagnosis of liver and pancreatic cancer. We tested two kinds of laparoscopic ultrasonography having a 3.5 MHz and a 5.0 MHz, linear assay, generated into 45-mm-long and 13-mm-wide laparoscopic tip. Twenty studies were performed in 6 patients with HCC, 2 patients with pancreatic cancer and others. It is clearly demonstrated that this apparatus provides sufficient resolution real-time ultrasound visualization of a target organ on which ultrasonic probe is placed under direct vision.
