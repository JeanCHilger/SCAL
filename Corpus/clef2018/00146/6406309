Carcinoma of the ampulla and papilla of Vater. We reviewed 30 patients with a carcinoma of the ampulla and papilla of Vater. The first symptoms were weight loss, sudden onset of diabetes mellitus, loss of appetite, tiredness, and upper abdominal discomfort or pain. Jaundice and fever were found to be late symptoms. The mean delay between the onset of complaints and diagnosis was 2 1/2 months. The diameter of the tumour varied from 4 to 35 millimetres. Seven patients had a tumour diameter of less than 9 millimetres. Extension of the tumour in the duodenum was never seen with tumours less than 8 millimetres in diameter. Extension of the tumour into the pancreas and metastases in the peripancreatic lymph nodes were only found with tumours with a diameter greater than 15 millimetres. The mean delay between onset of symptoms and operation was 3 months. At 52 months 79% of the patients younger than 64 years were still alive, while the survival rate of the patients of 65 years and older was 11%. Also at 52 months 58% of patients with a tumour size less than 2 centimetres were still alive, while the survival rate of the patients with a tumour larger than 2 centimetres was 31%.
