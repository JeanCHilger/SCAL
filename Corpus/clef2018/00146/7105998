Mirizzi syndrome (author's transl). The Mirizzi syndrome consists of the trial cystic duct stone, cholecystitis and benign hepatic duct stenosis. The differentiation between intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis can be made sonographically in almost 100% of cases. In a high percentage of cases the ultrasound investigation can localise the level of the block. However, the additional use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is necessary for an exact pre-operative diagnosis. The most efficient diagnostic plan is illustrated by a case presentation of a patient with Mirizzi syndrome.
