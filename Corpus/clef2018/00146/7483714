Rare causes of cholestasis in ERC/PTC. Using case reports, attention is drawn to rare causes of cholestasis the clarification of which by ERC/PTC and by endoscopic therapy, if necessary, will clearly shown the usefulness of this method. The picture of an unusual choledocholith, the extraction of a "suture stone", the case of a Mirizzi syndrome, a cholecystocolic fistula, a cystic dilatation of the choledochus with Caroli's syndrome and status after choledochojejunostomy, the extraction of an ascarid from the papilla at biliary pancreatitis as well as the detection of a biliobronchial fistula resulting from an unsound hepaticojejunostomy are examples to underline the diagnostic usefulness of the ERC/PCT including its therapeutic capabilities and consequences in contrast to other methods, such as x-ray, ultrasound or computertomography.
