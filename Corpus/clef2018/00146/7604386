Hepatectomy under extracorporeal circulation. Resection of hepatic tumors located near the confluence of the hepatic vein or invading the inferior vena cava has become technically feasible and relatively safe by using venovenous bypass. However, some technical problems remain to be solved.We performed three cases of hepatic resection under extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermic perfusion.An unexpected hemorrhage was observed in all three cases for different causes. The patient of case 2 died of liver failure developed from fatty liver. Bile duct stenosis was observed in cases 1 and 3.Although hepatectomy under total vascular exclusion by use of Biopump is now considered a safe procedure, attention should be paid when this procedure is performed because some technical problems still remain.
