A case of gallbladder cancer associated with a common bile duct neuroma, and a cystic lesion of the liver with histologic findings similar to those of an inflammatory pseudotumor. We report a rare case of gallbladder cancer associated with a common bile duct neuroma, and a cystic liver lesion with histologic findings similar to an inflammatory pseudotumor, in a patient who had had no previous abdominal surgery. The patient was a 62-year-old man whose major complaint was fever. Ultrasonography and a computed tomography scan revealed gallstones, an elevated lesion in the gallbladder, and a cystic liver lesion. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated stenosis of the common bile duct. Cultures of the cystic fluid and gallbladder bile were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The patient underwent hepatectomy (inferior S4, S5, and S6), cholecystectomy, resection of the common bile duct, and right hemicolectomy. The resected specimens revealed gallbladder cancer with the microscopic appearance of a papillary adenocarcinoma, and a 12 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm cystic liver lesion with a wall 7 mm thick. Histologic studies of the wall of the cystic liver lesion revealed infiltration by histiocytes and plasma cells, and the presence of fibrous connective tissue, which findings are characteristic of inflammatory pseudotumors. A 9 x 6 mm elevated lesion, with the microscopic appearance of a neuroma, was resected from the common bile duct.
