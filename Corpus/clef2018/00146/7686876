Neoplasm of the hepatic hilum: the role of resection. A series of one hundred cases of primitive tumors of the biliary confluence (Klatskin tumor) observed between 1970 and 1990 are reviewed with respect to the variations occurring in the diagnostic backup and treatment policy. The need for peroperative staging is noted: On the basis of their clinical experience, the authors restricted the preoperative study to those investigations providing more information about endo- and exobiliary diffusion of tumoral mass (ultrasound, direct cholangiography). The review demonstrates the possibilities of a surgical approach to a palliative or resectional treatment in all patients in whom no local or general contraindications are present. Other cases are treated with percutaneous or endoscopic biliary stenting. The authors conclude that tumor resection with bilio-digestive anastomosis is the treatment of choice in selected patients, and results in a better quality of life with an improved "comfort index".
