Endoscopic bile duct stone removal prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Of 1049 patients referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for symptomatic gallstone disease, 67 (6%) had clinical, biochemical, or echographic findings suggesting common bile duct stones. Patients in this group were studied preoperatively with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In 26 patients (39%), the diagnosis was confirmed. In 12 other cases (18%), the macroscopic finding of a stripped or bleeding papilla without common bile duct stones suggested stone migration. ERCP in the remaining 29 patients (43%) was normal. Thirty-four endoscopic sphincterotomies (ES) were performed, 26 for common bile duct stones and 8 for cystic lithiasis or gallbladder microlithiasis. In the entire group of patients with choledocholithiasis, stone removal was possible. All 67 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an average of 2.8 days following the endoscopic procedure. Twenty-one patients (31%) had acute cholecystitis, and 5 had chronic scleroatrophic cholecystitis. Five (7.5%) of the 67 patients were converted to an open procedure. In 10 cases (16%), the cystic diameter was larger than an 8-mm M-L clip, which made necessary the use of endoligature or extra clips. No complications or deaths resulted from ERCP or ES. Two of the 62 patients (3.2%) who underwent LC had to be reoperated on, 1 because of a right subphrenic collection, and the other because of bilious ascites. No common bile duct lesions or deaths resulted in the analyzed group. The average hospitalization time, with the exception of those patients converted or reoperated on, was 8 days.
