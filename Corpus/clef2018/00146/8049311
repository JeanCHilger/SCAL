Proximal cholangiocarcinoma: a multidisciplinary approach. To evaluate our diagnosis and treatment of proximal cholangiocarcinoma.Retrospective clinical study.Department of Surgery, University Hospital.66 patients with proximal cholangiocarcinoma [median age (range): 64 years (28-87)].Ultrasonography (n = 65), computed tomography (n = 55), endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography [ERCP] (n = 54), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography [PTC] (n = 32), angiography (n = 19) and cytology (n = 13) were used in diagnosis. Treatment consisted of: insertion of a stent (n = 37), resection of the tumour (n = 16), and biliary-enteric anastomosis (n = 9). Twenty-eight patients received radiotherapy, 3 patients received no active treatment.Usefulness of diagnostic methods, survival.Ultrasonography, ERCP and PTC were helpful whereas computed tomography, angiography, and cytology added little additional information. Mean (SEM) survival after resection was 35.8 months (7.4) and after conservative treatment 10.4 months (1.5) (p < 0.001).A multidisciplinary approach is necessary and the tumour should be resected if possible.
