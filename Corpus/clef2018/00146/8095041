Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the elderly: a single unit audit. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has an established role in the management of pancreato-biliary disease, but its role in elderly patients has not been evaluated. A prospective study was carried out in 50 elderly patients, aged between 65 and 94 years, to compare the sensitivity and specificity of ERCP in this age group with ultrasound and liver blood tests, and to examine its safety and therapeutic effectiveness. ERCP was successful in 46 of 50 (92%) procedures. Thirty-four patients had abnormal findings, and 18 sphincterotomies were performed. No complications were recorded. There was a poor correlation between ultrasound and ERCP with agreement in only 45% of cases sensitivity 35% and specificity 75%. Liver blood tests, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase were elevated in all 30 cases with obstructed ducts on ERCP. Ultrasound revealed obstruction in only 10 (33%) of these. Thus, liver biochemistry proved a more reliable indicator of biliary obstruction than ultrasound. In 22 cases endoscopic stone clearance or demonstration of inoperable lesions obviated surgery while in 9 cases surgery was indicated, because of multiple large stones not cleared at ERCP, or for bypass of a malignant stricture. ERCP is therefore safe and effective with a high diagnostic and therapeutic yield even in the poor risk elderly.
