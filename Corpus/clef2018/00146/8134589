Pancreas transplants: efficacy of US-guided cystoscopic biopsy. Between December 1991 and June 1993, the authors performed cystoscopic transduodenal biopsy of pancreas transplants in 35 consecutive patients (18 men and 17 women, aged 22-48 years [mean, 34 years]). The first 12 biopsies were performed under direct visualization and the last 23 were performed with ultrasonographic (US) guidance. Specimens were adequate for pathologic diagnosis in nine of 12 (75%) and in 22 of 23 (96%) biopsies, respectively. US-guided biopsy of pancreas transplants is safe and effective and gives increased diagnostic yield.
