Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in children. The authors presented the cases of two children with inflammatory myofibroblastic (IMF) tumor and reviewed the literature to facilitate the preoperative recognition, delineate the clinical features, and describe the natural history of this entity. The first child had IMF tumor arising from the mesentery of the small intestine. He presented with an abdominal mass associated with severe inflammatory response manifested by fever, impaired growth, thrombocytosis, and microcytic, hypochromic anemia. After surgical resection, his fever resolved and his growth rate and the laboratory abnormalities normalized. Five months after initial diagnosis, the fever, anemia, and thrombocytosis recurred along with two tumors arising from the omentum and the abdominal soft tissue. After the second surgery, he remains free of recurrent disease for 30 months. The second child presented with a lung mass that was radiologically indistinguishable from pulmonary sequestration. After surgical resection, she remains free of recurrent disease for 18 months. IMF tumor should be considered in any solid tumor that occurs in association with a chronic inflammatory response. IMF tumor should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration.
