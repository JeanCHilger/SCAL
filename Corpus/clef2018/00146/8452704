A patient with Mirizzi's syndrome. The diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. A 35-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of jaundice and pruritus. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) showed a partially obstructed common hepatic duct with a smooth and curved laterally based compression defect having the appearance of being secondary to an impacted gallbladder stone. Gallbladder filled with contrast medium but the cystic duct was not visualized, thus suggesting cholecystobiliary fistula formation. According to these radiologic findings, the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome was made. We discuss differential diagnosis, therapeutic aspects and the importance of preoperative diagnosis.
