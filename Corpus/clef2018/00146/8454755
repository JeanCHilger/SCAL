Early MR follow-up of partial hepatectomy. Twenty-seven patients were studied with MRI between 3 and 40 days following partial liver resection. Twenty-four patients had undergone major hepatectomy (three to six segments) and three had undergone minor hepatectomy (tumorectomy, one bisegmentectomy, two). Indications for surgery were as follows: metastases (n = 16), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 5), hemangioma (n = 3), focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 2), and cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1). A total of 36 MR examinations were performed using a 1.5 T superconducting unit. Three patients were studied three times and three patients were studied twice. The MR images were evaluated to detect and to characterize liver parenchymal abnormalities and intraabdominal fluid or blood collections as well as to assess vascular and/or graft patency. The MR images showed hepatic ischemia in two cases and allowed differentiation between intraabdominal hemorrhagic (n = 30 and nonhemorrhagic (n = 4) fluid collections. Gradient echo images allowed assessment of polytetrafluoroethylene graft patency as well as demonstration of iliac vein (one case) and portal vein (one case) thrombosis. The presence of surgical clips at the resection margins did not affect image quality.
