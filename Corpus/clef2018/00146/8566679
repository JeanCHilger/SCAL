Cholangiocarcinoma. The cholangiocarcinoma is a low-prevalence neoplasia, but represents a great medical challenge in its diagnosis and treatment because of its insidious clinical manifestations. Its cellular origin has been associated to other hepatic tumors, and to multiple congenital or acquired factors (infections, drugs and other diseases). The most frequent histological type is the adenocarcinoma and the most common localization is the choledochal duct local metastases are frequently found in autopsies. The usual clinical findings are pruritus, weight loss, anorexia, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The immunohistochemical advances related to oncogenes (ras & C-erb B-1) and tumor markers (Epidermal Growth Factor and Integrin among others) allow to make differential diagnosis with other hepatic cancers and will provide valuable information about its cell biology. The initial approach to patients with this disease is made by ultrasound (US), which can be associate to Doppler
