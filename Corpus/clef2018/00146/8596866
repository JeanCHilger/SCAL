Cholangiography before biliary surgery: single-shot MR cholangiography versus intravenous cholangiography. To compare depiction of the biliary tract with magnetic resonance (MR) and intravenous cholangiography before biliary surgery.Intravenous cholangiograms and heavily T2-weighted single-shot MR images in 60 patients with biliary calculi were compared prospectively. Images obtained with each technique were independently assessed for depiction of anatomy and calculi.The gallbladder was adequately visualized with intravenous cholangiography in 77% of patients and with MR cholangiography in 88%. Rates for visualization of the common bile duct were 97% and 100%, respectively for the cystic duct, 27% and 75%Single-shot MR cholangiography may replace intravenous cholangiography for visualization of the biliary tract. However, the delineation of tiny gallbladder calculi and shrunken gallbladders with thickened bile is limited.
