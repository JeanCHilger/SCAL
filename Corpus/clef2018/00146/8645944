Radiographic diagnosis and surgical repair of a sciatic hernia: report of a case. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with a reducible painless swelling in her left buttock. The mass was preoperatively diagnosed as a sciatic hernia by herniography, which showed the peritoneal sac through the sciatic foramen, and by enterography, intravenous pyelography, and cystography, which demonstrated that the small intestine and urinary bladder had herniated into the sac. The diagnosis and management of this patient are described, followed by a review of the literature on sciatic hernias.
