Gastric carcinoid. A clinical case and review of the literature. Endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract is very useful, because it allows a rapid diagnosis and, in some cases, a therapeutical effect.The authors have seen a woman, 72 years old, with epigastric pain, dryness of the mouth, diarrhoea and meteorism. She had an old simple gastritis (of two years standing) and her therapy, since the time of the diagnosis, is omeprazole (20 mg/die). The patient was submitted to gastroscopic examination that revealed two spot lesions and a polypous lesion on which was made a biopsy. The patient was submitted also to the following examination: 1) urinary dosage of 5 HIAA 2) urinary dosage of 5 OHTCarcinoid tumors are usually small and rare lesions and they are in the following sites: A) between mouth and the second part of duodenum B) between the second part of the duodenum and the transverse segment of the colonPatients are usually 50-60 years old, with other neoplasm. The picture is marked by flushing, diarrhoea, abdominal cramp and disease of the right heart valve.Diagnosis is based on urinary dosage of 5-HIAA (n.v. > 10 mg/24 h.) that is higher than the normal value. Computed tomography and echography are useful.The small neoplasm are treated by local surgical resection, while the biggest tumors have been treated by pharmacological therapy with useless results.
