The role of relaparoscopy in the management of bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The incidence of bile leaks has increased with the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The present paper is focused on bile leaks--their diagnosis and management approaches with special consideration to relaparoscopy. From February 1992 to May 1995 a total of 1223 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in two hospitals. Eight biliary leaks were found in the series under study (i.e. 0.65%). The diagnosis was confirmed by means of ultrasound, CT scans and ERCP. Three leaks resolved spontaneously on external drains placed during the operation. Two and three patients underwent laparotomy and relaparoscopy, respectively. The etiology of the leakage included three cases of ducts of Luschka, one cystic duct leak, and one retained CBD stone. the source of the remaining leaks was not determined. In all cases the management approaches comprised relaparoscopy and laparotomy. It may be concluded that an early diagnosis and management of bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomies would prevent further complications.
