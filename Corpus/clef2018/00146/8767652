Mini-probe ultrasound of the upper gastrointestinal tract--1995 state of the art and perspectives. Workshop on Mini-Probe Ultrasound in Gastroenterology, MÃ¼nster, 28 October 1995. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) allows for intraluminal sonographic imaging of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreatobiliary duct system, the papilla of Vater, as well as the colon and rectum. EUS has proved valuable for diagnosis and staging of tumours of the upper intestinal tract. EUS can also provide valuable additional information concerning lesions that cannot be immediately classified. As doing this involves, first, removal of the conventional endoscope and, second, insertion of the echo endoscope, EUS is not suitable for routine examinations. Therefore EUS has remained an independent endoscopic diagnostic modality. Moreover, due to their diameter conventional echoendoscopes cannot be inserted into the pancreatobiliary duct system. Fine calibre high frequency ultrasound probes promise a resolution of less than 2 mm in diameter. The following report is a summary of a one-day workshop which took place in Muenster, Germany on Oct. 28, 1995. Its goal was to define the current state of the art of miniaturised endoscopic ultrasound probes in the field of gastroenterology. During this workshop, possible clinical applications for diagnosis, therapy, as well as follow-up were described and discussed. The potential of miniaturised endoscopic ultrasound probes was explored in terms of possible future technical developments.
