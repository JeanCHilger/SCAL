Dynamic sequential 3D gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the whole breast. Dynamic contrast-enhanced 2D MR imaging of the breast has shown high sensitivity and specificity for the detection and characterization of breast lesions. We investigated the ability of a dynamic fast 3D MR imaging technique that repeatedly scans the whole breast in 44-s intervals without an interscan delay time to obtain similar sensitivity and specificity as 2D imaging. Fifty-six patients scheduled for breast biopsy were entered into the study, and 83 lesions detected by 3D dynamic scanning were biopsied. Dynamic 3D contrast-enhanced breast imaging with subtraction detected and correctly classified all 23 cancers, and 44 of the 60 benign lesions yielding a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 73%, and a 100% predictive negative value. The enhancement profiles of metastatic lymph nodes were similar to those of primary cancer. This technique allowed detection of multifocal and multicentric lesions and did not require a prior knowledge of lesion location. These results indicate that dynamic contrast-enhanced 3D MRI of the whole breast is a useful and economically feasible method for staging breast cancer, providing a comprehensive noninvasive method for total evaluation of the breast and axilla in patients considering breast conservation surgery or lumpectomy.
