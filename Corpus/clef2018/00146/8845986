Limited laparoscopic liver resection of benign tumors guided by laparoscopic ultrasonography: report of two cases. Two cases of limited laparoscopic liver resection of benign tumors located in segment II and segment IV have been presented. The tumors were found during preoperative studies of biliary attacks and studied by means of ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan. During laparoscopy, the exact localization and surgical limits of the tumors were determined by visualization and laparoscopic ultrasonography. Dissection during laparoscopy was performed using the endoscopic cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator, achieving resection of the tumors with minimal blood loss.
