Biliary cystadenoma. We report a case of biliary cystadenoma in a 40 years female who presented with an epigastric abdominal mass. The preoperative diagnosis was made by means of US, CT and MRI. Lack of calcifications and the serological tests ruled out hydatid disease. Total excision by shelling out the lesion from the liver parenchyma was performed. We recommend complete surgical removal as the treatment of choice due to the malignant potential and the high recurrence rate after partial resections.
