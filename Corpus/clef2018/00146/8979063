Endosonographic characterization of duodenal elevated lesions. Endoscopic diagnosis of duodenal elevated lesions is problematic for two reasons. Endoscopic biopsy often fails to confirm a histologic diagnosis of submucosal lesions. Moreover, a biopsy specimen is often insufficient to verify a differential diagnosis of mucosal lesions. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of endosonography in the resolution of these problems.The endoscopic and endosonographic features of 15 duodenal elevated lesions that had been confirmed histologically in our hospital were reviewed retrospectively.Of the 15 cases, 8 were submucosal lesions (lipoma, Brunner's gland hyperplasia, lymphangioma, carcinoid tumors, leiomyoma, and malignant lymphoma) the rest were mucosal lesions. A correct histologic diagnosis based on endoscopic biopsies was obtained in only 6 cases (three submucosal lesions and three mucosal lesions). On the other hand, ultrasonography was useful in the characterization of all submucosal lesions based on their echo level, layer of origin, and tissue homogeneity. As for mucosal lesions, the depth of infiltration was correctly estimated with endosonography. Either endoscopic resection or surgery was selected on the basis of endosonographic information.We conclude that endosonography is useful in the differential diagnosis of submucosal lesions and in determining suitable treatment methods for duodenal mucosal and submucosal lesions.
