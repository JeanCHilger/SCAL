Contemporary management of deep neck space infections. Deep neck infections continue to be seen despite the wide use of antibiotics. These infections follow along fascial planes to create deep neck space abscesses. The clinical presentation often points to the space involved. Understanding the regional anatomy gives the surgeon the ability to treat these grave infections. The records of 24 patients with a diagnosis of deep neck space abscess admitted to Hermann Hospital between 1988 and 1993 were reviewed. Fifty percent of the patients had received antibiotics for an infection of the ear, nose, or throat before the development of a neck space abscess. Ten patients had parapharyngeal abscesses, seven had retropharyngeal abscesses, six had submandibular space abscesses, and one had parotid space abscess. Thirty-five organisms were isolated in 18 cases (1.9 isolates per patient). The most common organism cultured was Streptococcus (13 of 18), followed by Staphylococcus (6 of 18), Bacteroides (5 of 18), Micrococcus (2 of 18), and Neisseria (2 of 18). One case each of Candida, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Proteus, Proprionobacter, and Pseudomonas was cultured. Six patients had no growth on culture but did have organisms found on Gram's stain. The operative techniques and antibiotics used are discussed. The main complications of jugular vein thrombosis, carotid artery rupture, and mediastinitis are described, as well as an unusual case of meningitis from a large retropharyngeal-parapharyngeal abscess.
