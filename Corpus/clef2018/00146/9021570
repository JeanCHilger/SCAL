Currarino triad: anorectal malformation, sacral bony abnormality, and presacral mass--a review of 11 cases. Currarino et al, in 1981, described an association of a congenital anorectal stenosis, or another type of low anorectal malformation, an anterior sacral defect, and presacral mass. Eleven patients with this anomaly were treated at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Seoul National University Children's Hospital from 1984 to 1995. Among these patients, low-type imperforate anus (IA) was seen in three cases and anorectal stenosis was present in eight cases. Presacral masses included seven teratomas, two meningoceles, one dermoid cyst, and one enteric cyst with dermoid cyst. All had a deformed sacrum. Among the eight with anorectal stenoses, posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) with diverting colostomy was performed in seven cases, and repeated rectal dilatation was performed in one case. Among the three low-type IA, anoplasty was performed in two cases and PSARP was performed in one case. Although PSARP is a safe and satisfactory method facilitating the excision of the presacral mass, in meningoceles the repair should be performed before correction of anorectal malformation because of the risk of meningitis that can occur when surgeries are done simultaneously. In two cases, untethering of a tethered spinal cord was performed. All patients are continent. Because the incidence of Currarino triad is high when there is an anorectal stenosis (38% in the present series), the Currarino triad should be suspected in anorectal stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is a preferred diagnostic method because the incidence of association of tethered cord in this triad is high (18% in the present series).
