MR signal intensity changes in hepatic parenchyma with ductal dilation caused by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. MR images of the liver in 13 patients with surgically proven intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were reviewed retrospectively and correlated to the histologic analysis of surgical specimens. We paid special attention to the peripheral liver tissue with ductal dilation but without tumorous involvement. High signal intensity was observed in the hepatic parenchyma with ductal dilation on T1-weighted spin-echo images (8 of 12) and spoiled gradient-recalled echo images (seven of seven), as compared with the contralateral hepatic lobe without duct dilation. The high signal intensity was not suppressed with fat saturation and showed enhancement after administration of contrast (11 of 12). Concurrent portal venous obstruction did not have significant effect on these findings (P < .05). Correlation with pathologic specimens suggested that this enhancement was associated with periportal fibrosis. The etiology of the high signal intensity on unenhanced spin echo or gradient-recalled T1-weighted image remains unclear. Radiologists should recognize these findings and should distinguish these from tumor involvement or the arterial buffer response caused by portal venous obstruction.
