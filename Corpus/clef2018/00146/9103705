Imaging of gallbladder and biliary tract before laparoscopic cholecystectomy: comparison of intravenous cholangiography and the combined use of HASTE and single-shot RARE MR imaging. To compare intravenous cholangiography (i.v.c.) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as preoperative imaging techniques in patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Twenty patients underwent i.v.c. and MRI, 40 axial 'localizer' images were first obtained with a half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) sequence. Next, an extremely high T2-weighted rapid acquisition relaxation enhancement (RARE) acquisition (TE = 1100 msec) was used for MR cholangiography. All images obtained with i.v.c. and MRI were independently analyzed by two observers. The relative visibility of the (normal or abnormal) gallbladder (GB), cystic duct (CD), and bile ducts (BD) on both types of images was scored as follows: 1 = MRI better than i.v.c. 2 = no difference
