MR imaging of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. We present a case of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis that involved the liver and duodenum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the MR findings in a patient with this disease. A large gallbladder was filled with a tumorous mass and the interface between the liver and mass was unclear. Small abscesses in the mass and prominent contrast enhancement of the peripheral region were found in our case, but these findings are similar to those described in gallbladder carcinoma.
