Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children and adolescents. During the period between August 1991 and November 1995, seven patients under age 17 were submitted to videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Two were males and five females with ages ranging from 12 to 16 years (mean 13.8 years). The diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis with gallstones was made by the clinical history and physical and ultrasonographic examinations. There was no evidence of an association with hemolytic diseases, familial hyperlipidemia or Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and the abdomen approached by four ports: a 10 mm umbilical incision, a 5 mm cystic, a 5 mm one at the xiphoid appendix and a 10 mm one at the left lateral margin of the left rectus abdominal muscle between the umbilical scar and the xiphoid appendix. Operative time averaged 120 minutes (105-150 min). One case required conversion to laparotomic approach because of Mirizzi's Syndrome, which was diagnosed by intraoperative cholangiography performed in all cases. There were no deaths or major postoperative complications. Hospital stays ranged from 1-3 days in the six patients submitted to LC. Thus LC in children can be considered a good method, requiring only more care regarding the use of proper equipment, complete and careful dissection of the biliary hilus, and intraoperative cholangiography. The latter is indispensable, as these children can present a higher rate of anatomic anomalies. The advantages of this techniques include a less painful postoperative period with a faster recovery, and it is especially recommended in children, who are less tolerant to physical restriction and pain than adults.
