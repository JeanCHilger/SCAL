Combination therapy with 5'-DFUR, MMC and CDDP in patient with far advanced gastric cancer: report of a case. A 48-year-old man was referred to our hospital for a Borrmann 3 type advanced gastric cancer. Endoscopic biopsy disclosed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Ultrasonography and CT scan revealed left hydronephrosis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography detected a stenosis of common bile duct at the hepatic hilum due to lymph nodal metastasis, and laparoscopy revealed peritoneal dissemination. Because the tumor was diagnosed as not for curative resection, the patient was treated by 4 courses of combination therapy with 5'-DFUR, MMC and CDDP. No adverse effect of chemotherapy was observed. As a result, lymph nodal metastasis and peritoneal dissemination were reduced. Curative intent total gastrectomy was performed, together with pancreatico-splenectomy, left hemicolectomy, cholecystectomy, and extended lymph nodal dissection. The patient is well and alive with no sign of recurrence 2 years after operation.
