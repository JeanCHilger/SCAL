Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma. A patient with combined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) underwent partial hepatectomy, and the correlation between the pathological and radiological findings was examined retrospectively. The tumor showed hypoattenuation and hypoenhancement relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma on noncontrast and postcontrast CT, respectively. Both the HCC and CCC components of the tumor showed hypointensity and heterogeneous hyperintensity on T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images, respectively. While the HCC component of the tumor showed hyperenhancement relative to the liver parenchyma on arterial phase images of dynamic MR imaging, the CCC component showed hypoenhancement. When components with different degrees of vascularity are seen in a hepatic tumor, combined HCC and CCC should be considered.
