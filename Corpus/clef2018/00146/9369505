US and CT findings of small bowel neoplasms. Small bowel (SB) neoplasms are very rare tumours, but are still associated with high mortality rates, since the tumour-related symptoms occur late and are non-specific. In addition, endoscopy is not feasible in most cases, and radiological contrast studies do not reach the high accuracy obtained in the evaluation of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Cross-sectional imaging, and particularly CT, is becoming increasingly relevant in the diagnosis of these tumours. Both US and CT allow tumour detection, even when performed on an emergency basis, and are capable of showing the lesion as well as possible complications. Moreover, CT offers the possibility of a preoperative staging by evaluating tumour extension through the bowel wall, lymph node involvement and possible metastases. Finally, in most cases a direct correlation between cross-sectional findings and histology can be found, thus permitting tumour characterisation.
