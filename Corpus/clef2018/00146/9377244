Transcutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and endobiliary interventions in patients with obstructive jaundice. Complex of rational investigation and treatment of the patients with hepatic portal tumor, including transcutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, was proposed. In 285 patients with obstructive jaundice various endobiliary interventions were performed. External cholangiostomy was done to 98 patients, external-internal drainage--in 92, endostenting--in 18, cholecystostomy--in 76. Endobiliary intervention was applied solely in 31.5% of patients, and in the rest--as the preparation to laparotomy.
