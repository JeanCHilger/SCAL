Choledochal cysts in adults. The clinical features and management of 14 adults with choledochal cysts who presented to our hospital are discussed. There were 10 Todani type I, and four type IV cysts. The cysts were fusiform in all but three cases. The pancreatobiliary junction was abnormal in only two patients. Ten patients had cystolithiasis. Six patients had undergone previous biliary surgery, three of whom presented with biliary strictures. We recommend that choledochal cyst be considered as a differential diagnosis in all patients with dilated bile ducts, especially when symptoms persist after biliary surgery. In two patients who had undergone endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone clearance, and in whom the diagnosis was still in doubt after cholangiography, hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan confirmed the diagnosis of choledochal cyst by showing persistent biliary stagnation despite free flow of bile across the sphincter of Oddi. Complete resection of the cyst was achieved in all cases with one postoperative death. A modification of the standard surgical technique is described which makes mobilisation of the cyst easier. The need to demonstrate the pancreatobiliary ductal confluence as an aid to complete excision of the cyst is emphasised.
