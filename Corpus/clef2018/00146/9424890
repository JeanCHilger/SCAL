Results of treating liver cysts. In the years 1974-96, 27 patients aged 31-74 were treated for symptomatic pseudocysts. The duration of symptoms ranged from 3 months to 20 years. Patients were complaining for: pain in the upper abdomen (82%), feeling of fullness (59%), nausea and vomiting (41%), weight loss (23%).
