Laparoscopic treatment of duodenal carcinoid tumor. Wedge resection of the duodenal bulb under endoscopic control. A 46-year-old man with epigastralgia and slight elevation of urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) was found to have a well-demarcated carcinoid tumor in the duodenal bulb. The tumor measured 8 mm in size, and showed submucosal involvement but no metastasis to the liver and regional lymph nodes. After laparoscopic exposure and lifting of the duodenal wall around the tumor, wedge resection of the duodenal bulb including the tumor was performed successfully with a laparoscopic endostapler under direct endoscopic control. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. Laparoscopic wedge resection of the duodenum would be an appropriate minimally invasive treatment of selected duodenal neoplasms with special preoperative assessments and intraoperative considerations.
