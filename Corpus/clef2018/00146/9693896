Endoscopic ultrasonography in the evaluation of pediatric digestive diseases: preliminary results. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is rarely used in pediatrics. Its feasibility and potential indications have been assessed in this retrospective study.Twenty-three EUS examinations were carried out on 18 children (mean age 12 years, ranging from 4 to 16 years) using a mechanically rotating 7.5 and 12 MHz sector scan transducer. Upper digestive tract EUS (n = 17) was performed in children suffering from biliopancreatic diseases, angiomatosis or digestive tumors. They were performed under intravenous sedation. Anorectal EUS (n = 6), carried out after simple lavage in most cases, investigated tumors (adenomas and carcinoid tumor) or proctological diseases.No technical failures or complications were encountered. EUS proved useful in the diagnosis of pancreatitis and portal hypertension. When included in pretherapeutic examinations, it provided useful information in cases of angiomatosis, biliary lithiasis and polyps. It was also useful in the follow-up of children after endoscopic excision or surgical treatment of adenomas or tumors (carcinoid tumor, neurofibroma).EUS would therefore appear to be a promising technique in pediatric gastroenterology. More work is needed in order to better determine its indications and the need for equipment specific to children.
