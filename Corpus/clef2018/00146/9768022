Stromal tumors in the digestive tract. A case of duodenal localization. Stromal tumors of the digestive tract are undifferentiated connective tissue tumors which are difficult to characterize even with immunohistochemistry.A stromal tumor of the duodenum (the most frequently encountered location) was resected entirely. Histochemistry was unable to provide a precise identification of the histological nature. The tumor was considered to be low grade due to the low mitosis index despite its large size and the presence of necrosis. Careful surveillance was indicated.The risk of these tumors is uncertain and may be assessed on the basis of histological prognosis factors such as tumor size, mitosis index and ploidy. Echoendoscopy can be particularly useful for diagnostic purposes providing information on location in the duodenal musculosa.
