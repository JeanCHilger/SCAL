Use of oral superparamagnetic contrast media in cholangiopancreatography with TSE single-shot magnetic resonance. To investigate the yield of an oral superparamagnetic contrast agent (Lumirem) in turbo spin echo (TSE) single-shot MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in patients candidate to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Thirty patients (mean age: 52.2 years) scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent MRCP with TSE single-shot sequences. To cover the biliary tree, thick-section TSE images were acquired according to the cross-sectional location of the biliary tract. Six 50-mm images progressively rotated by 30 degrees each were acquired during breath-holds. The precontrast images were obtained before the negative oral contrast agent was administered. The postcontrast images were acquired 10 minutes after oral contrast agent administration. Two observers made a qualitative evaluation on all images: the contrast enhancement was assessed comparing the pre- and postcontrast images of each examination on the basis of signal intensity in the stomach and duodenum, giving a score on a graduate scale. The greater yield of postcontrast images was validated by statistical analysis. The actual diagnostic improvement obtained with postcontrast images was validated for every single case.The greater yield of postcontrast images was statistically significant in the common bile and cystic ducts, but not in the gallbladder and Wirsung duct. Better images were obtained in 22/30 patients. The actual diagnostic improvement in the visualization of the common bile and cystic ducts was statistically significant in 7/30 patients. To conclude, administering an oral negative contrast agent improved image quality and the diagnostic yield. The agent was well tolerated and safe and we suggest its use in TSE single-shot MRCP of the patients candidate to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
