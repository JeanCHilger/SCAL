Ectopic ACTH Cushing's syndrome: V3 vasopressin receptor but not CRH receptor gene expression in a pulmonary carcinoid tumor. In the etiological diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, it may be difficult to distinguish pituitary disease from ectopic ACTH production, specially when this is due to a benign neuroendocrine tumor. We describe a patient with partial dexamethasone suppression consistent with Cushing's disease, an absent response to CRH suggesting ectopic ACTH production and an atypical, apparent circadian rhythm. Bilateral cavernous sinus catheterization suggested a nonpituitary source of ACTH and, in the search of an ectopic tumor, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, abdominal CT scan, and duodenopancreatic endoscopic echography were performed and failed to reveal any abnormality. Thoracic CT scan disclosed a tiny right lung nodule that showed a definite tracer uptake on MIBG scintigraphy. After resection, the nodule proved to be an 8-mm typical pulmonary carcinoid, with positive immunostaining for the classical neuroendocrine markers and for ACTH, and showing tissue expression of the POMC gene. However, the CRH receptor gene was not expressed, explaining the absent CRH response in vivo, whereas the V3 vasopressin receptor gene was expressed in the tumor tissue. The latter feature appears to be characteristic of benign carcinoids and may contribute to explaining the CRH-independent circadian rhythm observed in this case.
