Laparoscopic enucleation of a pancreatic insulinoma: report of a case. We report herein the case of a 48-year-old Japanese woman in whom a pancreatic insulinoma was successfully treated by laparoscopic enucleation. The patient presented after developing episodic neurohypoglycemic symptoms, and an insulinoma in the pancreatic tail, 1.0 cm in diameter, was diagnosed by the results of biochemical and radiological examinations. A laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonogram demonstrated a solitary hypoechogenic tumor in the pancreatic tail. After the tail and body of the pancreas with the spleen were mobilized, laparoscopic enucleation was performed without any complications. The total operative time was 225min and the estimated blood loss was 20 ml. Serial blood sugar measurements demonstrated a sharp rise in blood sugar levels at the time of enucleation. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. She has remained well for 33 months following surgery without any hypoglycemic symptoms.
