MRI, CT, US and ERCP in the evaluation of bile duct hamartomas (von Meyenburg complex): a case report. A case of multiple bile duct hamartomas (von Meyenburg complex) of the liver accompanied by exudative and in part necrotizing pancreatitis is presented. Magnetic resonance imaging (fat suppressed, T2-weighted images with prolonged echo time) could exclude diffuse tumor infiltration of the liver, which had not been possible with CT, sonography, or ERCP. To our knowledge, no comparable case has been reported.
