Hepatic incidentaloma. A case report of cholangiocarcinoma. The finding of incidentalomas is becoming increasingly frequent during the course of routine diagnostic tests. At the hepatic level, the preclinical diagnosis of primary tumours has enabled a growing number of patients to undergo surgery with reduced operating trauma and greater oncological radicality. The authors report a case of cholangiocarcinoma whose pre-clinical diagnosis enabled its resection in spite of the patient's advanced age.
