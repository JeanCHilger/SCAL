Trichobezoars. Trichobezoars are accumulations of hair casts in the stomach associated with trichophagia. The typical patient is an adolescent female who presents with alopecia and an upper abdominal mass which on moving can cause intermittent gastric outlet obstruction. Only a minority of patients have severe psychiatric disorders. When hair strands extend from the main mass in the stomach, all along the small bowel and reaching the cecum, the condition is termed the Rapunzel syndrome. In about 5% of patients there are separate hair masses in the stomach. The clinical presentation includes abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight-loss, vomiting, loose stools, pancreatitis, jaundice, anemia and hypoalbuminemia. These signs and symptoms raise the suspicion of malignancy. Complications of bezoars include ulcers, perforation of the bowel, obstruction and intussusception. Diagnosis can be established either by barium swallow or by CT scan. Ultrasound might suggest the diagnosis, but sonographic features are definitely not pathognomonic. Treatment is surgical, as endoscopic removal is usually unsuccessful. We present 2 children in whom trichobezoars were found.
