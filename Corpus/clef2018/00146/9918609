Comparison of laparoscopic ultrasonography and fluorocholangiography in 300 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study compares laparoscopic ultrasonography to fluorocholangiography in detecting common bile duct (CBD) stones and delineating biliary anatomy.A prospective nonrandomized study of 300 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a university hospital was performed. After port placement but before dissection, laparoscopic ultrasonography of the extrahepatic CBD was performed in both transverse and longitudinal planes. Cystic duct fluorocholangiography was attempted in all patients.Of 300 patients, CBD stones were detected in 26 (9%) with 25 of these (96%) detected on laparoscopic ultrasonography. Sonography identified the location and size of the CBD as well as anomalous anatomy prior to dissection. No CBD injuries were encountered. End-fire transducers were easier to use than rigid or flexible side-fire transducers all gave excellent image quality.In this large study, laparoscopic ultrasonography and fluorocholangiography were equally sensitive in detecting CBD stones. Sonography delineates the biliary anatomy noninvasively and does not require dissection or opening of the biliary system. Laparoscopic ultrasonography may improve the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially in cases of acute inflammation or distorted anatomy.
