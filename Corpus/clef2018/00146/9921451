Evaluation of a new MRI cholangiography sequence with a half-Fourier acquisition technic. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new MR cholangiography sequence in which thick slices are obtained with half Fourier acquisition (SSFSE) in biliary obstructive diseases.Fifty patients with suspected bile duct obstruction were prospectively investigated with MR cholangiography using SSFSE sequence with thick slices. The gold standard was ERCP (n = 40), percutaneous cholangiography (n = 1) or surgical findings (n = 9). According to this gold standard, 17 patients had bile duct lithiasis and 21 had neoplastic obstruction.The sensitivity and specificity of MR cholangiography were 100% and 94% for the diagnosis of lithiasis obstruction and 95% and 97% for neoplastic obstruction. Agreement between the MR cholangiogram and the gold standard was good whatever the site of obstruction (range of kappa values: 0.79-1).MR cholangiography with SSFSE sequence is a useful, precise and easy to use technique. Acquisition time for thick slices is short (< 2 sec) limiting cardiorespiratory artefacts and eliminating the need for post-treatment.
