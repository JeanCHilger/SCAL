Coexisting extraadrenal pheochromocytoma and von Meyenberg complexes: report of a case. We herein report on a 62-year-old man who developed extraadrenal pheochromocytoma and von Meyenberg complexes of the liver (bile duct microhamartoma). The patient identified preoperatively as having a paraaortic mass which was subsequently diagnosed to be a pheochromocytoma. During the operation, small multiple nodules were unexpectedly recognized in the liver. Some of the liver nodules were resected by a wedge biopsy, and then were pathologically identified to be von Meyenberg complexes. This may be the first reported case of the coexistence of pheochromocytoma and von Meyenberg complexes. It is therefore necessary for surgeons to be aware of von Meyenberg complexes in the differential diagnosis of multiple liver metastases in malignant disease.
