Liver transplantation for metastatic hemangiopericytoma associated with hypoglycemia. We report a case of successful liver transplantation in a young man with metastatic hemangiopericytoma confined to the liver. He had a primary retroperitoneal hemangiopericytoma removed in 1982 and was diagnosed as having liver metastases 8 years later. Subsequently, he developed hypoglycemia, which did not respond to chemotherapy. Hepatectomy and transplantation resolved his hypoglycemic attacks. He remained well and symptom free for 4 years. Liver transplantation can provide effective palliation and should be considered in carefully selected patients with localized metastatic cancer.
