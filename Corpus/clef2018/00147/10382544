Selective embolization of a bile leak after operative resection of an echinococcal cyst. One year after an Echinococcus granulosa cyst had been resected in a 37-year-old woman she presented for follow-up. She was without symptoms and physical examination was unremarkable.Sonography and computed tomography showed renewed growth of the cyst (6.5 cm diameter) in the VIth liver segment. The Echinococcus antibody titre was increased to 1:20 (normal 1:5).An echinococcal cyst was again diagnosed and a pericystectomy with intrahepatic drainage performed. A bile leak developed postoperatively through an open bile duct at the operative site. This duct was selectively visualized by endoscopic retrograde choleangiography and its distal part embolized with 1.5 ml Histoacryl: there was no further bile leak. No relevant clinical side effects occurred.Selective embolization is a possible alternative to currently employed procedures for stopping bile leaks.
