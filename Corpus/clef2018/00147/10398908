Adenoma arising from the cystic duct and extending to the confluence of the extrahepatic biliary tract. We describe a rare case of adenoma with a few foci of severe atypia arising from the cystic duct in a 68-year-old woman, initially diagnosed by the presence of intracholecystic tumefactive sludge on abdominal ultrasonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) disclosed a tuberous filling defect at the orifice of the cystic duct. Pathology examination of the biopsied specimen obtained from ERC disclosed not a cancerous but an adenomatous lesion. Macroscopically, the resected specimen showed a superficially spreading and shallowly elevated lesion extending from the cystic duct to the common bile duct. Although a few sporadic foci of severe atypia were observed, microscopy did not reveal any cancer findings, but confirmed the tumorous lesion as benign adenoma, showing mild-to-moderate atypia. Postoperative immunohistochemistry revealed no expression of p53 protein. We briefly refer to the rarity of adenoma in the biliary tract and discuss the difficulty of differential diagnosis of neoplastic lesions in the extrahepatic biliary tract.
