Mirizzi syndrome--a report of 3 cases with a review of the present classifications. We report three cases of Mirizzi syndrome, two with external compression of the common hepatic duct and another with cystobiliary fistula. All patients presented with jaundice. The diagnosis was suggested by ultrasonography and confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). All three had the stones removed surgically, one through a choledochotomy, another through an opening in the gall bladder and the third at the time of subtotal cholecystectomy. We would like to propose a simple classification of Mirizzi syndrome, based on surgical procedures necessary for the correction of the pathological anatomy. If it involves the removal of calculi with some form of cholecystectomy, we consider it as Type I, whereas Type II involves the construction of a hepaticojejunostomy apart from the removal of calculi.
