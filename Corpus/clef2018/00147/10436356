Mirizzi syndrome: A rare cause of obstructive jaundice. Mirizzi syndrome is a rare cause of bile duct obstruction secondary to extrinsic compression of the hepatic duct by stones impacted in the cystic duct or infundibulum of the gallbladder. The suspicion of Mirizzi syndrome primarily relies on radiographic means such as ultrasound, computed tomography and cholangiography. The recognition of this rare syndrome is crucial in developing the proper treatment approach. We present 3 cases of Mirizzi syndrome and a review of the literature pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of this rare cause of obstructive jaundice.
