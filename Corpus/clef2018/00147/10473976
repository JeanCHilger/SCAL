Ampullary hamartoma: A rare cause of biliary obstruction. Tumors of the papilla of Vater are very rare. Despite advanced imaging techniques the distinction between benign and malignant tumors remains very difficult. Because most ampullary and periampullary tumors are malignant, primary management is surgical. Here we report the case of a 65-year-old man with biliary obstruction caused by an ampullary hamartoma simulating cancer. The correct diagnosis was not established until surgery.
