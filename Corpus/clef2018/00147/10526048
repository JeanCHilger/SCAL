Laparoscopic resection of large leiomyomas of the gastric fundus. Two patients with a large leiomyoma arising from the gastric fundus underwent laparoscopic resection. In case 1, the tumor was located in the anterior wall of the gastric fundus. To prevent stenosis and preserve the volume of the residual stomach, intragastric resection was adopted. The tumor was markedly and resected with laparosonic coagulating shears with a 1-cm safety margin. In case 2, a large tumor was detected in the duodenal bulb. Serious hemorrhage mandated emergency resection. The tumor originated from the posterior wall of the fundus. Attempts at reduction with the forceps failed. Reduction by digital manipulation via laparoscopic port sites was successful. An endostapler was used to resect the tumor and close the anterior wall. Both patients recovered uneventfully.
