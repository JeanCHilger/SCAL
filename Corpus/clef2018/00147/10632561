Bronchobiliary fistula after hemihepatectomy: cholangiopancreaticography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiography findings. A bronchobiliary fistula (BBF), which is defined by an abnormal communication between the biliary system and the bronchial tree, is an uncommon complication after hemihepatectomy, trauma, hydatid disease, choledocholithiasis and other causes of biliary obstruction. We report the case of a 56-year-old man with colon cancer, who developed a BBF 2 months after right hemihepatectomy for liver metastases. The findings at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) included a stricture of the common bile duct and biliary leakage from the liver resection plane with biliary infiltration of the right lower lobe of the lung. The patient was treated successfully by endoscopic insertion of a biliary plastic stent which bridged the stricture and lead to closure of the fistula.
