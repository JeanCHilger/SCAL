Demonstration of gastric submucosal lesions by high-resolution transabdominal sonography. We evaluated the accuracy of high-resolution transabdominal sonography (TAUS) in identifying and characterizing gastric submucosal masses previously detected by endoscopy.Patients given endoscopy for suspected submucosal gastric lesions and 2 patients with gastric wall cysts were enrolled. Patients underwent TAUS and then endoscopic sonography (EUS) on the same day, and the sonographic results were compared with endoscopic and histologic findings.Among 101 patients with gastric submucosal masses on endoscopy, TAUS revealed a mass in 94 (93%) of these 94 patients, 60 underwent EUS. The final diagnoses were 31 leiomyomas, 10 leiomyosarcomas, 13 ectopic pancreases, 2 cysts, and 1 glomus tumor, 1 carcinoid tumor, 1 lipoma, and 1 fibroma. Leiomyomas (mean size, 3.2 cm) and leiomyosarcomas (mean size, 7.1 cm) were shown sonographically to originate from the muscular layer. Ectopic pancreases (mean size, 1.2 cm) were shown to originate from the submucosal layer and had a homogeneously echogenic pattern. Gastric cysts were found in the submucosal layer and were anechoic. The glomus tumor and the carcinoid tumor were found in the muscular layer and were hypoechoic. The lipoma and the fibroma were located in the submucosal layer and were echogenic on TAUS.TAUS had a detection rate of 93% in visualizing submucosal gastric masses previously identified by endoscopy. TAUS is less invasive than EUS and can be used to follow submucosal gastric masses that are not excised.
