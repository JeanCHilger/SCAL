Total pelvic exenteration and reconstruction for locally invasive recurrent sarcoma of the perineum. Extensive primary tumors and locally recurrent tumors of the pelvis or perineum are difficult to manage. We describe the techniques necessary to perform total pelvic exenteration with en bloc resection of the perineum and genitalia for treatment of recurrent sarcoma of the perineum. Wide excision of the sarcoma with negative margins can be achieved by resecting the inferior portion of the pubic symphysis. An absorbable mesh sling may be used to suspend the small bowel above the pelvis, facilitating postoperative radiation. A catheterizable continent urinary reservoir avoids the necessity of two stomas and improves quality of life. Adequate tissue coverage can be attained by myocutaneous gracilis flaps that promote wound healing.
