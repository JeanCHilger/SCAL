Preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder torsion by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The patient was a 78-year-old woman who was diagnosed as having gallbladder torsion preoperatively. This is the first reported case diagnosed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Signs and symptoms of this condition are often subtle. Radiologic evaluation by ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) showed acute cholecystitis with stone. Drip-infusion cholangiography CT failed to outline the gallbladder, and distortion of the extrahepatic bile ducts and interruption of the cystic duct were observed. MRCP showed 1) a v-shaped distortion of the extrahepatic bile ducts due to traction by the cystic duct, 2) tapering and twisting interruption of the cystic duct, 3) a distended and enlarged gallbladder that was deviated to the midline of the abdomen, and 4) a difference in intensity between the gallbladder and the extrahepatic bile ducts and the cystic duct. A definitive diagnosis of gallbladder torsion (volvulus) was made by MRCP preoperatively. If treated surgically, gallbladder detorsion before cholecystectomy is a helpful technique to avoid bile duct injury. This condition should be suspected in elderly women with acute cholecystitis or acute abdominal pain of unknown origin, and MRCP may be very useful in making a definitive diagnosis.
