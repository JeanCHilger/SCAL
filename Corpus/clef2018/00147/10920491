Echolaparoscopy in the staging of abdominal neoplasms. Prospective study. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and influence on surgical strategy of laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasound on staging of abdominal malignancies.Prospective evaluation of laparoscopic ultrasound staging, according to the TNM classification, of 80 consecutive cases of abdominal malignancies in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and influence on surgical strategy. Pathologic examination of final surgical specimens or laparoscopic biopsies was used as control.Laparoscopic ultrasound evaluation was carried out successfully in 95% of cases with no mortality and morbidity. Twenty one out of 76 patients (28%) had their stage changed based on laparoscopic ultrasound findings. Unnecessary laparotomy was avoided in 11 cases (14%) due to evidence of advanced disease at laparoscopic ultrasound. For pancreatic cancer laparoscopic ultrasound was more sensitive for TNM, specificity was higher just for nodal evaluation. For liver tumor laparoscopic staging revealed more sensitive for N and M evaluation. Laparoscopic ultrasound staging had low specificity and sensitivity for T evaluation, while it was more sensitive and specific than clinical staging for nodal and distant metastasis assessment respectively for gastric and colon cancer.Laparoscopic ultrasound staging is a safe, feasible and effective staging tool for several abdominal malignancies. The introduction of laparoscopic ultrasound probes overcomes the lack of tactile sensation proper of laparoscopy, allowing precise evaluation of both solid and deeply located abdominal structures. The use of laparoscopic ultrasound staging may help to reduce the number of unnecessary laparotomies.
