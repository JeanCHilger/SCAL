Cholangiolocellular carcinoma of the liver: CT and MR findings. The authors report two cases of surgically proved cholangiolocellular carcinoma of the liver. Marked contrast enhancement was observed at the periphery of the tumor on CTs and MRIs obtained during the hepatic arterial and portal venous phases, with concentric filling on the delayed images. On T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRIs, the tumor was, respectively, hypointense and hyperintense, with a central hypointense area. Therefore, helical CT and MRI features of these cholangiolocellular carcinomas were thought to be similar to those of cholangiocarcinoma.
