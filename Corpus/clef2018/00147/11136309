Incidence of benign lesions in patients resected for suspicious hilar obstruction. The differentiation between benign and malignant strictures at the hepatic hilum is difficult. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and radiographical features of hilar lesions in a series of patients resected for a presumed cholangiocarcinoma.Of 132 consecutive patients undergoing resection for a suspicious lesion at the hepatic hilum, 20 (15 per cent) had a histopathologically proven benign tumour, diagnosed as chronic fibrosing or erosive inflammation, sclerosing cholangitis, or a granular cell tumour. All medical files and radiological examinations of the patients were reassessed.Clinical symptoms were considered suspicious in 16 of 19 patients. At ultrasonography only one of 16 patients had an unsuspicious examination. In 14 of 18 patients cholangiographic images were considered suspicious. Overall reassessment confirmed a suspicious lesion in all 20 patients.Because of the limitations of current diagnostic tools, a false-positive preoperative diagnosis of malignancy resulted in a 15 per cent resection rate of benign lesions in this series of suspicious hilar strictures.
