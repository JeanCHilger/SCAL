Primary biliary cirrhosis: MR imaging findings and description of MR imaging periportal halo sign. This study reviews the prevalence of MR imaging abnormalities seen in 21 consecutive patients with primary biliary cirrhosis before transplantation and describes a new MR imaging sign in these patients: the MR imaging periportal halo sign.Abdominal adenopathy was present in 62% of the patient population, and none of the patients with adenopathy had a known malignancy. Findings associated with end-stage cirrhosis and portal hypertension were seen and included ascites (62%), splenomegaly (71%), portosystemic collaterals (57%), portal vein thrombosis (5%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (5%). The MR imaging periportal halo sign was seen in 43% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, but none of the patients in a sex- and age-matched cohort of 21 patients with cirrhosis not caused by primary biliary cirrhosis had the finding. Statistical analysis of these results produced a t score of 3.97 and a p value of less than 0.001, suggesting that this new MR imaging sign is highly specific for the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis.
