Choledochal cyst: a changing pattern of presentation. The aim of the present paper was to study the spectrum of choledochal cysts and analyse the results of various surgical procedures.A prospective study was undertaken, at University Hospital, Varanasi, India, of 10 patients with choledochal cyst who presented between January 1996 and June 2000. The patients had a median age at presentation of 16.0 years (interquartile range (IQR): 13.75 years). All patients underwent ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography for confirmation of diagnosis. Cyst excision was performed in eight patients followed by reconstruction by hepaticoduodenostomy and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in four patients each. Two patients underwent cystoduodenostomy.One patient who underwent hepaticoduodenostomy had a minor leak that responded to conservative management. All patients were asymptomatic at a median follow up of 36.5 months (IQR: 31 months).There is a changing trend in the commonest mode and age of presentation fewer patients are presenting with the classical triad and the mean age of presentation is higher. Reconstruction by hepaticoduodenostomy is equally effective, more physiological and less time consuming as compared to hepaticojejunostomy, if the anastomosis can be achieved without tension.
