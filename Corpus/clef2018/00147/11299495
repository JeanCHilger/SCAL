Acute gastrointestinal bleeding caused by a rare, benign tumor of the duodenum (gangliocytic paraganglioma). Diagnosis and treatment of massive gastrointestinal bleeding is sometimes very difficult problem in a surgical unit. Authors present a case of a 40 years old female with an atypical source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The origin of the bleeding was detected only by intraoperative enteroscopy. The source of the bleeding was a very rare benign tumour of the duodenum (Gangliocytic paraganglioma) which involved the papilla of Vater. During the operation resection of the pedunculated tumour was carried out, with choledochal--and Wirsungoplastyc, associated with external drainage of these ducts. According to the literature in preoperative diagnosis of this rare tumour endoscopy, angiography, and EUS are very useful. In case of malignancy, metastases radical operation-pancreatoduodenectomy--is indicated.
