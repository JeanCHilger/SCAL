Endoscopic ultrasound-guided (neurolytic) celiac plexus block. Celiac plexus neurolysis is an established technique for relieving pain in cancers of the upper abdomen. This article reviews the novel technique of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided neurolytic celiac plexus block. This recently described procedure is a therapeutic extension of curvilinear array endosonographic fine needle aspiration. The indications, patient preparation, and technical aspects of the procedure are described in detail. The potential complications are mentioned and the results of the published studies are reviewed. We believe that where the expertise is available, this procedure can be integrated into the diagnostic EUS of patients with inoperable upper abdominal malignancy. As such, this would be the safest and most cost-effective approach for celiac plexus neurolysis in these patients. The role of EUS-guided celiac plexus block in patients with chronic pancreatitis may be emerging and needs further study.
