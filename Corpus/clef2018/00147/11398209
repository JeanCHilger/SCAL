Role of video-laparoscopy in the staging of intra-abdominal lymphomas and gastrointestinal cancer. There is good category II/III evidence that video-laparoscopic staging is valuable in certain gastrointestinal (gastric, esophageal, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary) and intra-abdominal lymphomas, but no category I evidence (based on prospective randomized trials). The evidence available is all retrospective, but of sufficient consistency to indicate that laparoscopic staging adds to the primary (imaging) staging and often alters the clinical stage of the disease and hence the management of the individual patient. The advent of laparoscopic contact ultrasound (LCU) scanning has improved the staging accuracy for pancreatic and hepatobiliary neoplasms. The laparoscopic approach also offers a means of surgical palliation in certain patient groups. However, there are a number of unresolved issues concerning the use of video-laparoscopy. The most important concerns whether staging laparoscopy should be performed immediately before scheduled surgery or as a separate intervention. The cost-efficacy of these two management options needs to be evaluated in prospective studies. In some centres, laparoscopic staging is being conducted by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. This raises issues of safety and ability to undertake certain procedures that may be necessary during the laparoscopic staging.
