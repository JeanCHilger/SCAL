Carcinoid tumor mistaken for persistent neurogenic bowel symptoms in a patient with paraplegia: a case report. Neurogenic bowel in spinal cord injury (SCI) can present with constipation and diarrhea as ongoing problems. Usually, these manifestations are adequately controlled with modification in the bowel program. When these symptoms persist, other causes should be considered. This case report describes a jejunal carcinoid tumor with colonic extension that was diagnosed in a paraplegic patient with persistent constipation and diarrhea. A 39-year-old man sustained a T1 paraplegia with neurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction from a gunshot wound. His bowels were initially managed adequately with digital disimpaction. Over the next 8 years, he had intermittent constipation that was managed with the addition of various suppositories. He then developed progressively worsening constipation, and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Although his symptoms initially resolved with medical management, the constipation worsened. Upper endoscopy revealed a submucosal bulge in the duodenal bulb. A month later, gallstones were found on renal ultrasound performed to evaluate recurrent urinary tract infections. He underwent cholecystectomy, but his GI symptoms persisted over the next several months. Repeat upper endoscopy subsequently revealed an ulcerated tumor at the duodenojejunal flexure. An upper-GI scan with small bowel follow through showed a proximal jejunal mass. The patient underwent laparotomy with resection of the mass. Final pathologic diagnosis was malignant carcinoid tumor. This case shows the importance of entertaining other clinical entities in patients with SCI when constipation and diarrhea persist despite adequate management.
