Management of Mirizzi syndrome: a new surgical approach. In a prospective study of a patient population of 1,340 with biliary calculus disease, that ran from January 1993 to December 1997, 34 patients (2.53%) were identified as having Mirizzi syndrome. Eight patients were found to have type I (A and B) and 26 patients were found to have type II Mirizzi syndrome. A history of recurrent biliary colic and jaundice was present in the majority of patients.Ultrasonography was helpful in five patients and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was helpful in 17 patients in the diagnosis of this condition. Because the amount of gall bladder tissue used in choledochoplasty is not yet standardized, a new policy regarding choledochoplasty was adopted. In type IA, retrograde cholecystectomy with simple closure of cystic duct was carried out. In type IB, retrograde cholecystectomy and choledochoplasty with 5 mm cuff of the gall bladder was carried out. In type II lesions the procedure depended on the size of fistula. Patients with fistula sizes of less than one-third of the common bile duct diameter underwent choledochoplasty with 5 mm cuff of the gall bladder, and patients with fistula sizes between one-third and two-thirds of the diameter of the common bile duct underwent choledochoplasty with 10 mm cuff of the gall bladder. Patients with fistula sizes of more than two-thirds of the common bile duct diameter underwent Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.There was no operative mortality and the complication rate was 17.64%.Although, out of 26 choledochoplasties, we encountered only one (3.84%) stump stone in a maximum follow-up period of 59 months, further long-term follow-up studies are required to prove the efficacy of the procedure.
