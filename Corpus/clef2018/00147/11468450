Biliary giardiasis in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus. A 41-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (CD4 count, 446/mm3) developed a protracted course of abdominal pain, weight loss, and increasing liver function tests after undergoing a metronidazole treatment regimen for Giardia enteritis. Three months later, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) showed dilated common and intrahepatic bile ducts and luminal irregularities of the common bile duct. Seven months after the onset of his acute diarrhea, a repeat ERCP with aspiration demonstrated many Giardia trophozoites and cysts in the bile and continued structural abnormalities consistent with cholangiopathy. A 10-day course of high-dose intravenous metronidazole did not resolve these signs or symptoms. A gallbladder ultrasound showed a thickened wall. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy led to resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase over an 8-month period. Gallbladder histopathology revealed chronic cholecystitis, but no parasites were seen on hematoxylin and eosin staining or with Giardia antigen enzyme immunoassay testing of the gallbladder. The patient refused to undergo a follow-up ERCP, but a right upper quadrant ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen were normal.
