Hepatobiliary cystadenoma combined with multiple liver cysts: report of a case. Hepatobiliary cystadenomas are rare benign tumors with malignant potential. They are almost always solitary lesions accompanied by multilocular cysts in the liver, and are difficult to differentiate from cystadenocarcinoma, despite the diagnostic modalities available. This report describes a case of hepatobiliary cystadenoma with multiple cysts in the left hepatic lobe, diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging in a 48-year-old woman. Abdominal computed tomography revealed only multiple cystic lesions in the left lobe, but cholangiography via a nasogastric biliary drainage tube combined with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography showed a stenotic region with fine irregularity in the left lateral posterior segmental bile duct and left lateral anterior segmental bile duct. Hepatobiliary cystadenocarcinoma with multiple liver cysts was suspected. We performed left hepatectomy, and microscopic examination confirmed a diagnosis of hepatic cystadenoma with multiple liver cysts. There was no nuclear atypia or mitosis in the epithelium of the locus, which was constructed of simple columnar-to-cuboidal epithelium with basal nuclei. The patient is well without recurrence more than 4 years after surgery.
