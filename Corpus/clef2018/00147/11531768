Tuberculous biliary strictures: uncommon cause of obstructive jaundice. Tuberculous biliary stricture is a very rare cause of obstructive jaundice. A case of a man who had had pulmonary tuberculosis 20 years ago is reported. He now presented with obstructive jaundice due to multiple strictures just below the confluence of the hepatic ducts and in the right hepatic duct. At surgery these turned out to be tuberculous in origin. There was also tuberculous involvement of the gall bladder and cystic duct. The commonest differential diagnosis in such cases is cholangiocarcinoma (as in the present case). Imaging helps in defining the extent of bile duct obstruction. Suspicion of the disease and establishing a tissue diagnosis is very important in treating this potentially curable condition, especially with the worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis.
