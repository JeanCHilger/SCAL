Management of biliary duct confluence injuries produced by hepatic hydatidosis. From 1978 to 1999 a total of 850 patients underwent surgical treatment for hydatid disease of the liver at our surgical department. Biliary duct confluence injuries produced by hepatic hydatidosis (HH) were founded in six patients (0.7%). Surgical intervention was undertaken to relieve the obstructive jaundice and clinical manifestations of cholangitis and to treat the hydatid cyst. A partially open cystopericystectomy technique was used in three patients with a double bilioenteric Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The remaining three patients (two with prehepatic portal hypertension and one with triple hepatic duct confluence) were subjected to a cystojejunostomy. There were no hospital deaths. Two cases of anastomotic leakage following a high bilioenteric anastomosis occurred but did not require surgical treatment. During the follow-up (5-19 years) one patient suffered local recurrence of the hydatid disease 7 years after cystojejunostomy. The site of intrahepatic biliary and vascular involvement, the presence of biliary duct anomalies, and the presence of portal hypertension are decisive factors when choosing the "ideal" procedure for reconstruction. Conservative surgical approaches (partial cystectomy and cystojejunostomy) are the treatments of choice. Radical surgery is often a serious matter.
