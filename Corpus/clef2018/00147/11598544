Complicated polycystic liver disease with intracystic hemorrhage and obstructive jaundice. Polycystic liver disease, which is generally part of the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, is often asymptomatic. We report a case of obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the biliary tract by a large haemorrhagic liver cyst. The patient was a man with sporadic polycystic liver disease without polycystic kidney disease and with normal renal function for his age. Ultrasound combined with cholangio-MRI provided non-invasive confirmation of intracystic bleeding and intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Obstructive jaundice was confirmed by cyst puncture-aspiration which resolved symptoms and normalized biology. The initial treatment of haemorrhagic liver cyst complicating polycystic liver disease must be medical with cyst aspiration-drainage and sclerotherapy to avoid surgery in these fragile patients.
