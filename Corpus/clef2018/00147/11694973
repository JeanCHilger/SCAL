Double common bile duct with ectopic drainage into the stomach. Case report and review of the literature. A rare abnormal biliary tract consisting in a double common bile duct with an ectopic biliary tree draining into the stomach is described. This congenital anomaly, associated with lithiasis in the ectopic duct, was detected for the first time on MR-cholangiopancreatography. Only 23 cases of abnormal biliary drainage into the stomach have been reported in the literature. Embryogenesis and potential risks, such as lithiasis in the ectopic duct and the development of gastric carcinoma, are discussed.
