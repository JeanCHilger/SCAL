Diagnostic methodologies: serology, endoscopy, and radiology. The two major inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), represent clinicopathologic entities that traditionally have been diagnosed on the basis of a combination of clinical, radiologic, endoscopic, and histologic features. Serum perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) have recently been added to our diagnostic armamentarium. Several studies have demonstrated that UC-associated pANCAs recognize nuclear antigens. Additional studies have demonstrated that the pANCA human monoclonal antibody (mAb) Fab 5-3 reacts with histone H1 and with bacterial and mycobacterial antigens. Several reports have suggested that, in CD, pANCA and ASCA are correlated with colonic and small bowel disease respectively. One study found that higher ASCA levels were correlated with more aggressive CD. Serology may prove to be useful in predicting the evolution of indeterminate colitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and leukocyte scintigraphy hold promise in identifying inflammatory CD. MRI enteroclysis is useful in identifying both luminal small bowel disease and extraluminal complications. A recent study of surveillance colonoscopy in extensive Crohn's colitis showed a high risk of dysplasia and cancer.
