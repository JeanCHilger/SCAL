Magnetic-resonance-guided percutaneous cryoablation of hepatic tumours. To study the feasibility of percutaneous cryoablation of hepatic tumours monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Prospective studyUniversity hospital, NorwaySix patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.Percutaneous cryoprobe positioning under general anaesthesia. Positioning and freezing monitored by near-real-time MRI using an open 0.5 Tesla MRI configuration system.Safety and feasibility of the procedure. Measurement of volumes of cryolesions.One patient developed a biliary leakage that had to be drained. Four patients developed pleural fluid. Two small tumours were adequately cryoablated. In the remaining 4 patients with large (>4 cm) tumours, an adequate cryolesion could not be formed. Cryolesion volumes larger than 105 cm3 were not produced even using 3-4 probes. MRI visualised the growing cryolesion well, but positioning of the cryoprobes was time-consuming.MR guided cryoablation is clinically feasible and gives good visualisation of the procedure. Patients with small tumours (<3 cm) seem to be best suited to this percutaneous approach as cryolesion volumes claimed to be adequate for tumour destruction can be produced. Measurement of tumour volume preoperatively may help to select patients who will respond.
