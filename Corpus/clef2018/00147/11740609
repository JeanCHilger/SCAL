Gallbladder lymphangioma: MR findings. Intraabdominal lymphangiomas are rare lesions that can be difficult to diagnose. We report ultrasonographic (US), computed tomographic (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and pathologic findings in a patient with cavernous lymphangioma originating in the gallbladder. US and CT showed a multiseptated cystic mass in the gallbladder fossa. T2-weighted MR images and MR cholangiopancreatography depicted the lumen of the gallbladder and thin septations of the cystic mass, which originated in the gallbladder. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed no apparent communication between the cyst and the gallbladder. Histologic findings obtained during the operation were consistent with cavernous lymphangioma. Its characteristic histology was observed in the subserosal layer of the gallbladder. This case is a rare instance of cavernous lymphangioma originating in the gallbladder preoperatively diagnosed by MR and MR cholangiopancreatography.
