Transmural drainage of cystic peripancreatic lesions with a new large-channel echo endoscope. The availability of a new large-channel echo endoscope led us to develop a new needle-stent device for endoscopic puncture and drainage of pancreatogenic cystic lesions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided one-step 10-F puncture and drainage with the new equipment could be feasible and successful. The use of the technique and the short-term outcome in our first four patients are described and discussed.Cystic lesions were drained using the new technique in four patients. All the patients had symptomatic peripancreatic lesions, one with intrahepatic and one with intrasplenic extension. Punctures were carried out using a new echo endoscope with a 3.7 mm working channel and an Albarran lever. The 10-F transmural stents were placed over a 1 mm stainless steel needle and a 6-F Teflon catheter using a special assembly designed for controlled one-step placement and stent release.Puncture and drainage were technically successful in two patients. In one patient, the 10-F component failed to pass the cystic wall. Drainage was successful in the same session using a 7-F one-step device. In one patient, no stent was placed, but the 1 mm needle was used for diagnostic tissue sampling during the procedure because of the suspicious cyst morphology. Surgical resection revealed a ganglioneuroma.The new echo endoscope allows endoscopic interventions for peripancreatic cystic lesions under excellent endoscopic and EUS control. The Albarran lever was reliable and helpful for optimal direction of the needle. The new echo endoscope combined with special needle-stent devices was effective and safe for diagnosis and therapy in the first four cystic lesions. Cystic tumors must always be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with apparently pancreatitis-induced cystic lesions.
