Imaging findings of intrahepatic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma. To study the imaging features of intrahepatic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma.The imaging features of 11 cases of surgically and pathologically confirmed intrahepatic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. B-ultrasonic scanning(BUS) was performed in all patients. CT was done in 8 patients, including conventional unenhanced scanning followed by enhanced scanning in 4 patients, dynamic double-stage scanning in 2 patients, and dynamic double-stage scanning followed by delayed scanning in the other 2 patients. Of the 3 patients received MRI, conventional SE series, T1WI and T2WI were performed in 2 patients, conventional SE series and dynamic scanning in the other one.All lesions were hypo-echoic in BUS, homogeneous or heterogeneous. On unenhanced CT, the lesions were of low density with ill-defined border. On enhanced scanning, moderate enhancement was observed at the edge of the lesions. MRI was of low intensity in T1WI and moderately high intensity in T2WI. Dynamic MRI and double-stage CT scanning showed characteristic enhancement from the periphery toward the center of the lesion. Focal dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts around the tumor was seen in 6 cases and retraction of liver capsule in 3 cases.To some extent, the imaging features of intrahepatic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma are characteristic. They are useful for differentiating these tumors from other space-occupying lesions in the liver.
