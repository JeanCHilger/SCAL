MR cholangiography in the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis: initial results. To retrospectively analyze prospective magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiographic interpretations of findings and compare them with clinical outcome and to determine the accuracy of MR cholangiography in depicting extrahepatic biliary atresia and helping to distinguish it from other causes of neonatal jaundice.Twenty-six infants (15 male, 11 female median age, 2 months) underwent MR cholangiography with a 1.5-T MR imaging unit. Original interpretations were compared with clinical outcome. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the accuracy of MR cholangiography in depicting extrahepatic biliary atresia. Equivocal cases and any cases lost to follow-up were excluded.Findings in six of 26 infants were interpreted as normal, and none of five patients (one lost to follow-up) had biliary atresia or other surgical lesions two were abnormal but not suggestive of biliary atresia (one false-negative finding)Results of this study found that MR cholangiography is 82% accurate, 90% sensitive, and 77% specific for depicting extrahepatic biliary atresia. Contrary to previous reports, false-positive and false-negative findings occur at MR cholangiography.
