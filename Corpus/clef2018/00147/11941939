Left hepatectomy for the choledochal cyst (type IV-A) with intrahepatic stenosis: report of a case. The case of a 16-year-old male with expansion of the gallbladder and dilatation of the common bile duct is reported. Ultrasonography and computed tomography imaging showed expansion of the gallbladder and eminent cystic dilatation in the common bile duct and the left intrahepatic bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography indicated expansion-like beads of the bilateral hepatic ductus and the left intrahepatic bile duct, including anomalies of the pancreaticobiliary ductal junction. Because relative stenosis of the membranous diaphragm was revealed in the porta hepatis, we diagnosed this case as a type IV-A choledochal cyst, using Todani's classification. Intraoperative cholangiography and cholangiofiberscopy showed a pinhole stricture and re-expansion of the tip of the left intrahepatic bile duct. As the narrow segment could not be expanded though we put proper pressure there, left hepatectomy was performed as a preventive measure in addition to extended biliary tract excision and cholangiojejunostomy. Hepatectomy seems to be an appropriate choice in a case of intrahepatic stenosis to help increase the patient's postoperative quality of life.
