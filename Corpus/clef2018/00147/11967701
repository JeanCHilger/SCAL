Right hepatic duct emptying into the cystic duct: report of a case. Anomalous insertion of the right hepatic duct into the cystic duct is a rare anatomic variation. At this writing, only nine cases have been reported in the literature. In the patients presenting with this anomaly, the surgeon may accidentally transect the right hepatic duct during cholecystectomy.We encountered a case of anomalous insertion of the right hepatic duct into the cystic duct, which was clearly demonstrated in the intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.As the half-cut point of the cystic duct happened to be on the gallbladder side of the cystic duct, cholecystectomy was accomplished laparoscopically.In anomalous insertion of the right hepatic duct into the cystic duct, hepatic duct transection could happen. Preoperative precise evaluation of the biliary duct, awareness of potential biliary variations, and identification of all anatomic structures before ligation and division were essential to prevent bile duct injury.
