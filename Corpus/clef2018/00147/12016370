Gallbladder carcinoma: findings at MR imaging with MR cholangiopancreatography. To describe magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings in gallbladder carcinoma, and to correlate these findings with available surgical and biopsy information.Preoperative MR images (T1-weighted spin-echo, T2-weighted fast spin-echo, single shot fast spin-echo, and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced gradient echo) in 34 patients with gallbladder carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed for appearance of the primary neoplasm and for demonstration of hepatic, peritoneal, duodenal, and nodal involvement. Imaging findings were then compared with surgical findings (n = 19 patients) and histologic findings (n = 15 patients).Gallbladder carcinoma manifested at MR imaging as focal gallbladder wall thickening with an eccentric mass in 76% (26/34) of cases. The most common types of regional spread demonstrated were direct liver invasion in 91% (31/34), lymphadenopathy in 76% (26/34), and biliary tract invasion in 62% (21/34). Sensitivity for direct hepatic invasion was 100%, and was 92% for lymph node metastasis.MRI and MRCP can provide information relevant to preoperative staging of gallbladder carcinoma.
