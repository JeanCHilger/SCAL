Detection of Mirizzi syndrome with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography: laparoscopic or open approach? Imaging of the gallbladder and biliary tract has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. Magnetic resonancecholangiopancreatography provides a noninvasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography in the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. In this laparoscopic era, when diagnosis is certain, surgeons must choose between a laparoscopic and a traditional open approach. The authors review their cases of hepatobiliary surgery during the period 1993-2000. Three cases of Mirizzi syndrome (0.4%) were observed among 712 surgical hepatobiliary patients (two type 1 cases and one type 2 case). The authors suggest that with Mirizzi syndrome type 1, laparoscopy together with peroperative cholangiography should be used to resolve anatomic doubts. If clipping of the cystic duct is possible and certain, then laparoscopy may be continued and finished. In the case of cholecystocholedochal fistula (Mirizzi syndrome type 2), when the diagnosis is determined before surgery, the authors believe that laparoscopy is dangerous. Adhesions, inflammation, and anatomy changes may cause injuries to the main bile duct, so an open traditional approach is suggested.
