Bronchobiliary fistula due to hydatid disease of the liver: a case report. As a complication of hydatid cyst disease of the liver, bronchobiliary fistula is a rare condition and manifests as bilioptysis. We report the case of a 34 year-old man with echinococcosis of the liver who developed a bronchobiliary fistula which manifested as chronic cough and bile stained sputum. A chest X-ray showed an unilateral infiltrate in the costodiaphragmatic angle. Bronchoscopy revealed bile filling the right basal bronchi. Magnetic resonance cystography revealed that the hepatic bile ducts communicated with the right basal pleural space. Percutaneous transhepatic drainage was applied. When the patient was reevaluated, the hydatid cyst had eroded into the pleural space, and a pleural effusion had developed. The condition of the patient deteriorated. Hence, surgical therapy was performed. After surgery, the condition of the patient improved. He was discharged from the hospital in good condition.
