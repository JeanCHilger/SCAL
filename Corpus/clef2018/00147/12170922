Surgical management of complicated hydatid cysts of the liver. To review the clinical presentation and surgical management of complicated hydatid cysts of the liver.Forty-three patients with hydatid disease of the liver were managed surgically between 1991 and 1998. There were 14 men and 29 women with a median age of 34 years. An abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography and serology established diagnosis. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed in patients with associated jaundice and high suspicion of intrabiliary rupture. Eleven (26%) patients had complicated cysts and formed the basis for our study.Infection (n = 5, 11%) and intrabiliary rupture (n = 4, 9%) were the common complications. Intrathoracic rupture and intraperitoneal rupture were encountered in one patient each. All patients with infected cysts presented with pain and fever (n = 5, 100%) while those with intrabiliary rupture had jaundice (n = 4, 100%), pain and fever (n = 3, 75%). Surgical procedures performed in complicated cysts were-infection: omentoplasty (n = 2) and external drainage (n = 3) intrabiliary rupture: omentoplasty (n = 2) and internal drainage (n = 2). Patient with intrathoracic and intraperitoneal rupture underwent external drainage. There was no mortality. Postoperative morbidity was encountered in 14 patients and was more in complicated cysts (n = 6/11Hydatid disease in not an uncommon problem. Around a fourth of patients, present with complications such as infection or intrabiliary rupture. The site, size, number of cysts and presence of complications govern the choice of surgical procedure. Complicated cysts can be successfully managed surgically with good long-term results.
