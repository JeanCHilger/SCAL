Magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating functional disorders of female pelvic floor. To evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of MRI in the study of functional diseases of the female pelvic floor.Ten healthy volunteers and 30 patients with clinically suspected pelvic floor deficiency, with or without pelvic organ prolapse, were evaluated by a high field strength magnet operating at 1.5 T. In each case SSFSE sequences (TR/TE:25720/67) in axial, coronal and sagittal planes, both at rest and during Valsalva's manoeuvre, were performed. Based on the MRI findings using fixed and mobile anatomical landmarks, the functional disease of the pelvic floor was diagnosed and quantified based on the identification and grading of visceral prolapse. The MRI findings were compared with the clinical findings in all cases and with the surgical data in the 7 patients who had undergone surgery.The MR image quality was adequate in all cases. In the group of symptomatic women MRI diagnosed: urethral hypermobility syndrome: 22 cases isolated abnormalities of the anterior compartment: 8 cases of cystocele (low grade: 2, middle grade: 2, severe: 4)In our experience MRI made an important contribution to the diagnosis and grading of functional disorders of the female pelvic floor and pelvic organ prolapse. The ability to simultaneously demonstrate both muscular and ligamentous structures and pelvic viscera, without using X-rays or contrast agents, is the main reason for the good results achieved by MRI and for its widespread use in this disorder. Furthermore the use of fast, breath-hold sequences can provide high-quality images both at rest and during Valsalva's manoeuvre. In conclusion MRI proved to be an accurate imaging tool that is more sensitive than clinical pelvic evaluation in diagnosing and grading functional disorders of the female pelvic floor and pelvic visceral prolapse.
