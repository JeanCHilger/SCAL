Wire-guided intraductal US in the assessment of bile duct strictures with Mirizzi syndrome-like features at ERCP. Mirizzi syndrome refers to common hepatic duct obstruction caused by extrinsic compression that is usually from a stone impacted in the cystic duct. The utility of transpapillary intraductal US for assessment of biliary strictures with radiographic features of Mirizzi syndrome was studied retrospectively.Intraductal US was performed in 16 patients with a common hepatic duct stricture caused by extrinsic compression and nonvisualization of the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. An over-the-wire catheter US probe (20 MHz) was inserted into the bile duct. Intraductal US findings were compared with the final diagnoses at surgery.Intraductal US was successful in all patients. The extraluminal cause of the common hepatic duct stricture was detected in 14 patients (87.5%). In 9 patients, intraductal US detected an impacted stone outside the common hepatic duct. Intraductal US demonstrated extraluminal lesions without evidence of a stone in 5 patients, including a mass in 4 and asymmetrical, irregular thickening of the bile duct wall in 1 patient. In the remaining 2 patients, intraductal US demonstrated only a distended gallbladder.Transpapillary wire-guided intraductal US is useful for assessing biliary strictures with features that suggest Mirizzi syndrome and optimizes management of patients with these findings.
