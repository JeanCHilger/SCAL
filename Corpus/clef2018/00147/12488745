Multiple biliary papillomatosis: comparison of MR cholangiography with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. The purpose of this work was to compare MR cholangiography with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the diagnosis of multiple biliary papillomatosis (MBP).Nine patients with pathologically proven MBP underwent MR cholangiography and ERCP. A comparison was made between ERCP, multislice HASTE, and single-shot RARE. Each biliary tract was divided into five sections for assessment therefore, 45 biliary duct areas were used for lesion detection and determination of quality of depiction.Of the 35 segments detected by percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy, pathologic examinations were performed in 31 segments: papillary adenocarcinoma was proved in 28 and papillary adenoma in 3. The multislice HASTE sequence showed bile duct branches with biliary papillomatosis better than did ERCP (p = 0.0029) and single-shot RARE sequence (p = 0.0558). The multislice HASTE procedure had the highest number of lesions detected, followed by single-shot RARE and ERCP, but there was no significant difference between the imaging techniques.Our preliminary data suggest that MR cholangiography can replace ERCP for the detection of MBP.
