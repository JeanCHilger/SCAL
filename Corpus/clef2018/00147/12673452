Biliary cystadenocarcinoma followed up as benign cystadenoma for 10 years. We describe a case of biliary cystadenocarcinoma that showed a longterm clinical course. A 69-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal discomfort. The patient had been diagnosed with benign cystadenoma of the liver at another hospital in 1987 and had been followed up for 10 years. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a unilocular cystic lesion, which included multiple conspicuous papillary protrusions in the left hepatic lobe. Left lateral segmentectomy was performed, and intraoperative cholangiography revealed a communication between the cystic tumor and intrahepatic bile duct. The tumor contained clear mucinous fluid and enfolded multiple yellowish papillary projections on the cystic wall. Histological examination showed the tumor to be biliary cystadenocarcinoma. The patient is doing well 4 years after the operation.
