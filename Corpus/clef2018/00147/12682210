Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts through hepatic neoplasms. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) were successfully placed through hepatic malignancy, without technical complication, in nine patients. A mean follow-up of 229 days (range, 53-391 days) was available in six patients. Ascites improved in three patients and variceal hemorrhage did not recur in another three patients. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred in three patients. Three acute shunt occlusions and two deaths occurred within 30 days of TIPS placement. Shunts that traverse malignancy can be created safely without increased technical complication. Although there is a high rate of acute shunt occlusion, hepatic neoplasm alone should not be a contraindication for TIPS placement.
