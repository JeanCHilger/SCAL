Gallbladder duplication successfully removed laparoscopically using endoscopic nasobiliary tube. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is sometimes difficult due to complicated biliary anatomy including gallbladder duplication, a rare anomaly of the biliary tract. We report a case of duplicated gallbladder successfully removed under laparoscopy using endoscopic nasobiliary (ENB) tube cholangiography. A 61-year-old Japanese woman presented us with right upper abdominal pain. Ultrasonography revealed two cystic structures lying in the gallbladder fossa, and the upper one contained multiple stones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed two gallbladders, each of which has a cystic duct draining into the common bile duct separately. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was planned under the preoperative diagnosis of double gallbladder with gallstones in the accessory gallbladder. The ENB tube was inserted just before the operation. Laparoscopic removal of the double gallbladder was successfully done using the ENB tube to identify the biliary tree anatomy and to close the stump of the cystic duct. In this communication, we would like to stress the usefulness of the ENB tube at the time of laparoscopic biliary surgery in patients with biliary anomalies including gallbladder duplication.
