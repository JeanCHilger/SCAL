Use of multislice helical computed tomography cholangiography in the diagnosis of biliary disease. A recent advance in computed tomography (CT) technology, multislice helical CT, has enabled production of clearer three-dimensional (3D) images and has drawn interest. We report the usefulness of CT cholangiography using a multislice helical CT scanner for the diagnosis and preoperative imaging of the biliary duct in a case of peculiarly shaped gallbladder with cholecystitis. A 34-year-old woman admitted to our hospital presented with chronic hypochondralgia. A CT scan showed that the gallbladder was normal without wall thickening or stones. However, there appeared to be a tumor, containing a stone approximately 1 cm in diameter, attached under the gallbladder in front of the right kidney and extending up to its lower level. Magnetic resonance cholangiography also depicted a normal gallbladder without wall thickening or stones. Hence, gallbladder stones were not diagnosed by previously the mentioned investigations. In contrast, a 3D image produced by multislice helical CT cholangiography was very clear. From the bottom of the gallbladder, a narrow canal continued to a stone. We diagnosed that the wall of the lower part of the long gallbladder had become thick and elongated because of chronic cholecystitis caused by a gallbladder stone, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Macroscopically, the resected gallbladder showed an extremely thickened wall from the lower body to the fundus, in which a stone was located in the center. Multislice helical CT cholangiography has the potential to become one of the most significant examinations for diagnosis and anatomical analysis of biliary disease prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
