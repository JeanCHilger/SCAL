Evaluation of a new curved linear array echoendoscopy system for EUS. EUS-FNA can be used to accurately diagnose and stage GI and pulmonary neoplasms. This study evaluated the performance characteristics of a new compact linear EUS system during EUS-FNA.A total of 37 patients enrolled in this prospective pilot study underwent clinically indicated EUS-FNA and/or celiac plexus neurolysis with the compact EUS system.The mean time to perform a radial and linear array EUS with FNA and/or celiac plexus neurolysis was 24 minutes shorter with the compact EUS system compared with that for an historical control procedure in which a conventional linear EUS unit was used (p = 0.0007). The EUS images and visualization of the needle during EUS-FNA were rated good to excellent in greater than 95% of the patients. With respect to ease of esophageal intubation, duodenal intubation, and general maneuverability, the performance of the new linear echoendoscope, compared with a radial scanning videoechoendoscope, was the same or better in, respectively, 85%, 87%, and 100% of procedures. The video image quality of the new linear array echoendoscope was superior to that of the radial scanning videoechoendoscope in all patients. No complications were encountered.EUS-FNA and celiac plexus neurolysis can be performed safely with the new compact EUS system. The efficiency of this procedure is enhanced compared with historical experience with other instruments. Although image quality is sufficient for EUS-FNA and celiac plexus neurolysis, the compact unit cannot be used as a "stand-alone" system for routine diagnostic EUS, and its use must be complemented by standard radial imaging.
