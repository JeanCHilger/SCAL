Noninvasive preoperative evaluation of biliary anatomy in right-lobe living donors with mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MR cholangiography. Accurate preoperative radiologic imaging is essential to assess the vascular and biliary anatomy of right-lobe living donors and to ensure their safety. Volumetric magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) using Mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP) contrast has been recently proposed to evaluate the biliary anatomy of living donor candidates.During their preoperative evaluation, 18 right-lobe (RL) living donors underwent 3D Mn-DPDP-enhanced MRCP in addition to the standard thin- and thick-slab MRCP imaging. Immediately prior to hepatectomy all 18 RL donors underwent intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) via the cystic duct. We compared the efficacy of these different radiologic techniques to actual intraoperative IOC findings.Sixty-eight intrahepatic bile ducts were identified on IOC, 67(98.5%) by Mn-DPDP-enhanced 3D MRCP, 41 (60%) by thick-slab SSFSE imaging, and 35 (51%) by thin-slice SSFSE imaging. Mn-DPDP-enhanced 3D MRCP detected 100% (n = 5) of the anomalous origins of the right bile duct, and thick-slab MRCP detected 20% (n = 1) and thin-slab MRCP detected 0%. Anterior and posterior right intrahepatic bile ducts were identified by MnDPDP-enhanced 3D MRCP 100% of the time, by thick-slab SSFSE imaging 35% of the time, and by thin-slice SSFSE imaging only 12% of the time.Mn-DPDP-enhanced 3D MRCP imaging was highly sensitive and specific in identifying variants of the intrahepatic bile ducts. This technique should be included in the standard protocol of preoperative radiologic evaluation of RL living donor candidates.
