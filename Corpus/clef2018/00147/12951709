Enterovesical fistula secondary to Crohn's disease manifested by inflammatory pseudotumor of the bladder. The authors describe a case of enterovesical fistulas in a patient with Crohn's disease that presented exclusively as urinary symptoms manifesting as bladder tumor. Ultrasound examination showed a normal upper urinary tract and a bladder tumor. Cystoscopy examination revealed a bladder tumor at the retrotrigonal region without showing the fistula orifice. Transurethral resection of the tumor revealed an inflammatory pseudotumor of the urinary bladder at the results of histological studies. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a normal upper urinary tract but a bladder tumor and a sigmoidovesical fistula. The results of barium contrast studies established the presence of numerous enterovesical fistulas. Partial resection of the ileum, ileostomy, colostomy and suture of the bladder fistulas was performed. Histological diagnosis of the affected ileum was Crohn's disease. The clinical features, natural history and treatment of enterovesical fistula secondary of Crohn's disease were discussed.
