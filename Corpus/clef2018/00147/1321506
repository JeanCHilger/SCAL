Four year experience with cholangiocarcinoma: a survey of patients, clinical presentation, management and prognosis in two hospitals. Seventeen patients with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in Toa Payoh and Tan Tock Seng Hospitals from 1986-90 were studied retrospectively. There was a male preponderance (male:female = 12:5) with a mean age of 58 years (range 28-82 years). All presented with obstructive jaundice. Three had cholangitis. Biliary stones were associated in 3 (18%). Two patients (12%) had choledochal cysts. The level of obstruction was identified at the hilum in 12 (70.5%), lower third in 4 (23.5%) and at a choledochojejunostomy anastomosis in 1 (6%). Ultrasound and percutaneous cholangiography (PTC) were the commonest investigations used. Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) was performed in 7 (41%) and computer tomography (CT) of abdomen in 6 (35%). Biochemically, a raised alkaline phosphatase (1.5-9 x normal) was typical. Biliary bypass surgery was performed in 7 (41%) Whipple's procedure in 2 (12%) and drainage only in 6 (35%). Nine operated upon survived an average of 6 months (range 2-11 months) and six by drainage survived an average of 62 days (range 13-155 days). Three (of which two declined treatment) were lost to follow up. Cholangiocarcinoma is an uncommon cancer occurring in the older age group. In younger patients, choledochal cyst seems to be an association. Survival is dismal with palliative treatment.
