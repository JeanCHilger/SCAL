Early bile duct carcinoma. The clinocopathologic features of seven patients with early bile duct carcinoma are reported. Early bile duct carcinoma has been defined as bile duct carcinoma limited to the bile duct wall. The seven patients included six men and one woman ranging in age from 44 to 77 years. Six patients complained of jaundice and the other presented with right hypochondralgia. Ultrasonography showed a dilated proximal bile duct in the seven with a polypoid mass in three. Computerized tomography showed a dilated biliary tree in the seven together with a polypoid mass in two. Direct visualization of the bile duct with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and/or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography showed a polypoid tumour of the bile duct and a dilated proximal biliary tree in all seven. Each of the seven polypoid tumours were well differentiated papillary or tubular adenocarcinoma restricted to the bile duct wall with minimal stromal invasion. There was neither any lymph node metastasis nor perineural invasion. Five of the seven patients were doing well at 24-112 months after a complete resection. One patient died from multiple liver metastases 21 months after intervention. The other patient died from other diseases 138 months after operation. These seven cases can be classified as early bile duct carcinoma due to both the limited invasion and favourable prognosis. The clinical features of the seven patients were quite similar to those of usual bile duct carcinoma. However there are still no proper diagnostic clues for early bile duct carcinoma and these patients represent fortunate cases that clinicians happened to discover by chance.
