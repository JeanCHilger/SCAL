Bacterial spinal epidural abscess. Review of 43 cases and literature survey. We have reviewed our experience with 43 cases of bacterial spinal epidural abscess, as well as previously reported series of cases. We found a striking male predominance of the disease, accounting for 86% of cases. Most patients had some underlying conditions that predisposed to infection, a prior infection at a distant site, or an abnormality or trauma to the spine. Presenting symptoms included backache (72%), radicular pain (47%), weakness of an extremity (35%), sensory deficit (23%), bladder or bowel dysfunction (30%), and frank paralysis (21%). Patients cared for in public hospitals tended to seek medical attention in later stages of the disease than patients admitted to private hospitals. Spinal epidural abscess was the suspected diagnosis in only 40% of the cases the remainder of the time various other infections, tumors, neurologic diseases, or degenerative conditions were considered. Patients in whom the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess was not initially entertained on admission suffered delays in diagnosis and experienced neurologic deterioration. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogen (65%) and was associated with positive blood cultures in nearly every case
