Neurenteric cyst at craniocervical junction: report of a case. The authors report a rare case of neurenteric cyst at the foramen magnum presenting with a central cord syndrome and dysfunction of the lower cranial nerves. A magnetic resonance imaging study showed a cystic lesion over the lower medulla oblongata and C1-2 spinal cord. Differentiation between a neurenteric cyst and an epidermoid cyst was difficult. Successful total removal of the cyst was performed. The lesion consisted of an enteric cyst lined with a mucus-secreting columnar epithelium, containing highly proteinaceous supernatant and thick mucus deposit. The patient recovered dramatically after surgery.
