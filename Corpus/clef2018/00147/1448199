Anterior sacral meningocele associated with tethered cord syndrome. A case of anterior sacral meningocele associated with tethered cord syndrome is reported. A 5-year-old boy was admitted for urinary and fecal incontinence which had persisted since his birth. Abdominal MRI and sacral CT showed a presacral cystic mass communicating with the spinal dural sac through a neck traversing a sacral bony defect and tethered spinal conus. Neurological examination showed that the patient had a neurogenic bladder, atrophy of the legs and anesthesia below the S3 level. Operative finding revealed a thickened filum terminale attached to the wall of the presacral meningocele. Agenesis of the nerve root below the S2 level was identified, and no neural elements entered into the sac. Untethering was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient is doing well with his neurogenic bladder gradually improving.
