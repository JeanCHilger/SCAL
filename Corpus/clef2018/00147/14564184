Clinicopathologic features and endoscopic resection of early primary nonampullary duodenal carcinoma. Early primary nonampullary duodenal carcinoma is an extremely rare disease with poorly defined clinicopathologic features early detection of this carcinoma is not common. To clarify the clinicopathologic characteristics of early primary nonampullary duodenal carcinoma and retrospectively analyze methods of treatment. Seventeen early duodenal carcinomas identified between 1994 and 2001 in 15 patients were studied. Lesions were divided into 2 groups: sporadic carcinoma (10 cases in 10 patients) and familial adenomatous polyposis associated carcinoma (7 cases in 5 patients). Clinicopathologic features and methods of treatment were compared between groups. The mean age of patients with sporadic carcinoma (63.8 years) was significantly higher than that of patients with FAP-associated carcinoma (34.9 years). The incidence of sporadic carcinoma was significantly higher in men that in women (M:F ratio 9:1)
