Gastroduodenal intussusception secondary to a gastric lipoma: a case report and review of the literature. Gastroduodenal intussusception is an extremely uncommon condition usually caused by the prolapse of a benign gastric tumor into the duodenum with subsequent invagination of a portion of the stomach wall. A rare case of this condition associated with a gastric lipoma is presented. Clinical manifestations may mimic many other disease entities and are nonspecific. Diagnosis, however, can often be made preoperatively with noninvasive tests, which are usually associated with more specific signs. Treatment involves reduction of the intussusception and surgical excision of the lead point, either endoscopically or through a formal laparotomy.
