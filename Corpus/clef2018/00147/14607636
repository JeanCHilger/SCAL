Non-image diagnosis of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To evaluate the role of simple non-image technique in intraoperative diagnosis of bile duct injury (BDI).BDI was highly suspected at the original laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) when the following 3 abnormal findings were noted: the "cystic duct" stump (the common bile duct stump actually) markedly retracted down to the duodenum bile leakage from the porta hepatisBDI in 4 of the 9 patients was suspected according to 1-3 abnormal intraoperative findings described above. The four patients were subjected immediately to converted laparotomy. Abnormal findings were not observed or misinterpreted in the other 5 misdiagnosed patients.Timely recognizing whether BDI occurs should be considered as a routine procedure of LC. Negligence of operators to the abnormalities of the original LC is the main cause of misdiagnosis for BDI. Simple non-Image approaches such as close observation of these abnormalities can make timely diagnosis for most BDIs during the original LC.
