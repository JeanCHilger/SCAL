Hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma: new tricks and tests. Hyperaldosteronism, previously thought to represent only 1% to 2% of cases of hypertension, may cause as much as 25% of hypertension in a primary care setting. The renin/aldosterone ratio is the best test for initial screening, followed by localization if possible. Aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone, and surgery are the mainstays of treatment. Pheochromocytomas are rare, but because they are a curable cause of hypertension and potentially fatal if not found, important to diagnose. Clinical presentation is variable however, if symptoms are present, they usually include hypertension, hyperhydrosis, headaches, or palpitations sometimes occurring in dramatic fashion. Once a diagnosis is entertained, appropriate laboratory confirmation is essential. Positive laboratory confirmation then leads to localization of the tumor for eventual surgical removal. New biochemical tests and imaging procedures are making the difficult job of diagnosing and finding these tumors.
