Acute "pseudo-angiocholitis" due to colonic adenocarcinoma in a man with primary sclerosis cholangitis and ulcerative colitis. We report the case of a 49-Year-old-man with primary sclerosis cholangitis (PSC) and ulcerative colitis who developed two acute episodes of pseudo-angiocholitis. Both episodes were triggered by septic hepatitis translocated from ulcerative colonic adenocarcinoma. The biliary MRI did not show any signs of lithiasis or cholangiocarcinoma. cholangiocarcinoma, intra-hepatic lithiasis and colonic cancer are potential diagnoses in patients with PSC who develop angiocholitis.
