MR imaging findings of clonorchiasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the MR spectrum and MR cholangiographic imaging findings of clonorchiasis.We reviewed 26 patients with confirmed clonorchiasis by either stool tests (n=24) or surgery (n=2). MR imaging was performed on a 1.5 T system (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) with a torso coil. Axial T1- and T2-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced dynamic images and MR cholangiography were obtained. Image analyses were used to identify abnormalities of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and the presence of hepatobiliary malignancy. All MR examinations were reviewed by the consensus of two abdominal radiologists.Intrahepatic bile duct abnormalities were seen in 23 (89%) of the 26 patients. The most common finding was mild dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct which was found in 21 (81%). "Too many intrahepatic ducts" were found in 16(62%), wall enhancement and thickening in 21 (81%) and filling defects and ductal stricture in the intrahepatic bile duct in 6 (24%) and 3 (12%) patients, respectively. Extrahepatic ductal dilation was found in 5 (19%) and 9 (35%) revealed hepatobiliary malignancy.MR imaging revealed various findings of clonorchiasis, including dilatation, wall enhancement, stricture of the intrahepatic ducts and filling defect within the intrahepatic bile duct.
