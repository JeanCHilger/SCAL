Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma treated with endoscopic hemostasis and resection. Gangliocytic paragangliomas are exceedingly rare tumors that arise in close proximity to the papilla of Vater. There are few reports of the endoscopic resection of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma. A 61-year-old woman was admitted with a complaint of melena. Endoscopic examination revealed a pedunculated submucosal tumor with erosion in the third portion of the duodenum. Hemostasis, using a gold probe, was performed. Nine days later, we successfully resected the tumor, using endoscopic polypectomy. To determine the depth of tumor invasion, endoscopic ultrasonography was used. The size of the tumor was 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. A total of 25 cases of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma have been reported in Japan. Generally, this tumor is considered benign. However, resection was performed in many patients because preoperative diagnosis was impossible. In Japan, no previous studies have reported using endoscopic hemostasis, to our knowledge. Our patient is the fourth in Japan to be treated by endoscopic resection. We report on our patient, with a review of the literature.
