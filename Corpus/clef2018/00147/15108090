Giant transdiaphragmatic duodenal duplication with an intraspinal neurenteric cyst as part of the split notochord syndrome: report of a case. We report the case of a 6-month-old girl with a giant transdiaphragmatic duodenal duplication connecting to a cervical intraspinal cyst, which compressed the heart and lung, causing severe respiratory distress. We removed the intraspinal neurenteric cyst through a posterior cervical incision at the C6 and C7 level, and the duodenal duplication cyst in the mediastinum was removed through a right thoracotomy. Her respiratory symptoms were completely resolved by these operations.
