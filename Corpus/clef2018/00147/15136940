Cholangiocellular and gallbladder carcinoma. Risk factors for cholangiocellular and gallbladder carcinomas are bile stones and chronic inflammation of the biliary system. Gallbladder cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinomas can be diagnosed with a high sensitivity by ultrasonography, CT and MRI, while the most sensitive diagnostic methods for perihilar or distal cholangiocellular carcinomas are ERC or MRC. The only curative option for patients with gallbladder- or bile duct cancer is surgical resection. Outside clinical studies there is currently no indication for neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy. Gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas are moderately chemotherapy-sensitive tumors. The objective response rates in phase II studies with 5-FU or gemcitabine monochemotherapy are between 10 - 30 %. Higher response rates between 20 - 50 % have been observed in phase II studies with combination chemotherapy, in particular with the combination of gemcitabine/cisplatin. Because of the low incidence of gallbladder and bile duct carcinomas there are currently no large phase III trails investigating the impact of chemotherapy on survival and quality of life or comparing the activity of different chemotherapy protocols. Patients in good general physical conditions or with tumor-associated symptoms should be treated with palliative chemotherapy (whenever possible in clinical studies), while chemotherapy should be avoided in patients with severe non-tumor-associated morbidity. Endoscopic procedures, such as PTC- or ERC-stenting and photodynamic therapy, are important supportive therapies which can help to maintain the bile flow and consequently improve survival and quality of life of patients with malignant bile duct obstructions.
