Intraoperative diagnosis of common biliary duct using laparoscopic ultrasonography. Of the study is to show the advantages and limits of laparoscopic echography in exploration and diagnosis of common biliary duct lithiasis, as it is evidenciated in the experience of our surgical department.Between 31.03.1997-31.12.2002 we have made 878 laparoscopic interventions to patients with hepatho-biliary pathology. We made a prospective study and performed 116 laparoscopic ultrasonography examinations for exploration of the liver and bile ducts. We used an Aloka SSD 2000 device with a linear laparoscopic flexible transductor.We obtained a very good visualization in 97 cases (83.6%) and medium visualization in 19 cases (16.4%). The medium time of the examination was 10 minutes (variations between 5-20 minutes). We discovered pathological modifications in principal bile duct and cystic using color Doppler examination in acute and chronic inflammatory lesions with important anatomical modifications.1. laparoscopic ultrasonography it is an ideal technique in common bile duct lithiasis diagnosis, with 90-98% precision. 2. intraoperative ultrasonography does not need preliminary dissection of cystic and offers the possibility of exploration of the liver and pancreas. 3. it needs a learning curve and collaboration between surgeon and ultrasonography specialist.
