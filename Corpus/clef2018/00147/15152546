Diagnostic imaging of the small bowel in a case of occult gastrointestinal bleeding. A case of a male patient with occult gastrointestinal bleeding and negative gastroscopy and colonoscopy is presented and discussed. Oral small bowel barium follow-through was performed upon the patient request. It documented a jejunal neoformation. The analysis of radiologic findings directed towards a probably extramucosal origin. Subsequent CT evaluation confirmed a neoformation inseparable from a jejunal loop with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement, therefore of suspected malignant nature. The histological examination on the surgical specimen documented the presence of a stromal tumor of indeterminate malignancy.
