MR cholangiopancreatography and MR imaging in the diagnosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. To evaluate the imaging features of MR Imaging (MRI) and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and their clinical value in the diagnosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.MRI was performed in 54 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma proved surgically and pathologically, MRCP in 44 patients, Gadolinium-enhanced in 29 patients. MRI, MRCP and pathological findings were analyzed retrospectively.By MRI, the mass was shown (n = 39) and all bile duct thickened (n = 13) in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Gadolinium-enhanced ones revealed calcified focus (n = 22). By MRCP, interrupted, abruptly cut-off or cone-like changes of the bile duct (n = 16), beak-like or mouse tail changes (n = 26) or tumbler mouth appearance (n = 2) were shown. The bile duct distal to the obstruction was observed in 29 patients. Of the 54 patients examined by MRI in combination with MRCP, correct tumor localization was made in 52 (96.3%) and correct judgement of tumor nature in 50 (92.6%).Conventional MRI is an effective supplement to MRCP in the diagnosis of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. MRCP combined with MRI is able to significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of MR examination.
