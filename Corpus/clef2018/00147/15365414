Hepatic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with hepatitis B virus infection. Primary hepatic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is an extremely rare disease. A 65-year-old female patient with chronic hepatitis B presented with multiple solid masses in segment (S) 4, S5, and S6 of the liver. The nodule in S5 was diagnosed preoperatively as hepatocellular carcinoma by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography. The nodule in S4 was initially interpreted as lymphoid follicles by needle biopsy. Segmentectomy of S5 and partial resection of S6 were performed. Microscopic examination of the S5 nodule revealed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The nodule from S6 showed nodular proliferation of atypical intermediate to medium-sized lymphoid cells in the portal area and lymph epithelial lesions of bile ducts. The atypical lymphoid cells were positive for LCA, L-26 and bcl-2 and negative for UCHL-1. These features were consistent with the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma. This is the first case report of synchronous hepatic MALT lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic hepatitis B.
