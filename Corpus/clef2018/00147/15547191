Early biliary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy: evaluation on T2-weighted MR cholangiography in conjunction with mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced 3D T1-weighted MR cholangiography. Our aim was to assess preliminary experience with combined conventional T2-weighted and mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP)-enhanced T1-weighted MR cholangiography in evaluating early biliary complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Conventional heavily T2-weighted MR cholangiography with MnDPDP-enhanced T1-weighted MR cholangiography and ERCP were performed in seven patients with high clinical suspicion of biliary complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The final diagnoses of complications were classified according to the presence and degree of bile duct injury, bile leakage, and retained stones.The diagnoses on MR cholangiography were as follows: complete transection and occlusion of the common bile duct with bile leakage (n = 3), partial strictures of the common bile duct with bile leakage (n = 1), cystic duct leakage (n = 1), partial ligation of an aberrant right hepatic duct (n = 1), and hemorrhage without biliary complication (n = 1). The final diagnoses at surgery (n = 2) and ERCP (n = 5) were as follows: complete transection and occlusion of the common bile duct with bile leakage (n = 2), partial strictures of the common bile duct with bile leakage (n = 2), cystic duct leakage (n = 1), partial ligation of an aberrant right hepatic duct (n = 1), and hemorrhage without biliary complication (n = 1). MR cholangiography accurately yielded the same findings as the final diagnoses, except in one case with partial stricture of the bile duct with bile leakage (overdiagnosed as complete occlusion on MR cholangiography).Combined conventional T2-weighted and MnDPDP-enhanced T1-weighted MR cholangiography may eliminate the use of other studies for the imaging of biliary complications after cholecystectomy if this preliminary data can be verified in a larger study.
