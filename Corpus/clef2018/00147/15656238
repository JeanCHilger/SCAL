Dynamic MRI in the preoperative management of genital prolapse. A prospective study. Forty-three patients with genital prolapse prospectively underwent blinded pre and postoperative MRI, with dynamic assessment of each compartment. MRI was significantly more accurate than physical examination for the diagnosis of posterior defects (rectocele, enterocele) but not for anterior defects or uterine prolapse (hysterocele, cystocele). Postoperative MRI confirmed the surgical outcome and also identified risk factors for recurrence. MRI was particularly reliable for recurrent prolapse and vault prolapse. The authors consider that dynamic MRI can advantageously replace colpocystodefecography, as it is rapid and well tolerated. Technical improvements should help to understand the role of muscular and fascia lesions.
