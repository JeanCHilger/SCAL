Diffuse hepatic hemangiomatosis--case report. Hemangiomatosis of the liver is growing in the last decades, because of the abdominal imaging progresses: brain CT scan, MRI. In the presented case, the onset was with symptoms and biochemical disorders characteristic for acute viral hepatitis, with negative serological markers for the A and B hepatitis viruses. The persistence of the clinical symptoms and of the hepatic and biliary retention tests, determined the abdominal echography which orient the diagnosis to vascular tumour with liver metastasis. Intraoperatively was found: diffuse hemangiomatosis of the liver. The patient didn't benefit from liver transplantation and died due to subfulminant hepatic failure.
