Hydatid cyst of the liver. Hydatid cyst of the liver is a parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The principal complications are infection, biliary duct fistula, and rupture into the peritoneum or chest. Diagnosis has become easier with advances in ultrasonic imaging and CT scanning. Surgery remains the most effective treatment but postoperative complications arise in 30% of cases, particularly when the surgical approach is conservative. Radical surgical approaches give better results and should be used in most cases. Biliocutaneous fistula and infection of the residual cavity are the most common postoperative complications and result in prolonged hospitalization and excess costs. New therapeutic strategies incorporate endoscopic, percutaneous, and medical therapies with surgery and have allowed an improvement in morbidity and mortality due to hydatid cysts of the liver. Until immunization becomes a possibility, preventive measures are necessary to avoid disease recurrence.
