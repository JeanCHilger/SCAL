Complete gallbladder and cystic pedicle torsion. Laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment. Complete gallbladder torsion is an unusual emergency that requires immediate surgical treatment. Since it was first reported in 1898, <400 cases have been described in the literature, and only three of them were diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our objective here is to describe an approach that allows a definitive diagnosis and treatment. First we present the case of a febrile 81-year-old woman with acute right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasound showed an alithiasic distended gallbladder with a multilayered wall and a transverse orientation. When exploratory laparoscopy was performed, a gangrenous gallbladder secondary to a 360 degrees clockwise cystic pedicle torsion was found. Laparoscopic decompression, detorsion, and cholecystectomy with an intraoperative cholangiogram were completed. The patient was discharged 72 h later. Next, several preoperative diagnostic methods are reviewed. We conclude that the laparoscopic treatment of this entity is feasible and obviates the performance of unnecessary and nonspecific tests. It offers a favorable and rapid postoperative recovery, in addition to the other well-known advantages of the minimally invasive surgical approach.
