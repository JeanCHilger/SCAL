Suture material as a nidus for common bile duct stones: taking a closer look. A 72-year-old female with recurrent biliary colic and abnormal liver function 27 years after open cholecystectomy, was investigated by abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance pancreatocholangiogram (MRCP), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The ultrasound scan demonstrated a polypoid filling defect in the common bile duct (confirmed at ERCP), thus raising the possibility of a common bile duct tumour. The MRCP was normal. Visual examination of the duct with a choledochoscope revealed two stones attached to the wall by black suture material. The role of suture material in the formation of common bile duct stones, and direct choledochoscopy, is reviewed.
