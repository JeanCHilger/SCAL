Diagnosis and surgical treatment of primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. To summarize the experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (PHCC).Forty-seven PHCC patients, who had undergone surgical treatment in our hospital from 1970 to 1999, were retrospectively analyzed with their clinicopathological features, surgical treatments and prognoses.1) PHCC patients lacked typical clinical manifestation, and some had an accompanying history of virus B hepatitis (36.2%, 17/47) and liver cirrhosis (46.8%, 23/47), and elevation of AFP (25.5%, 12/47). 2) The detection rates of BUS, CT, MRI and liver scintigraphy were 95.7% (45/47), 93.6% (44/47), 100% (23/23) and 100% (4/4), respectively. The lesions detected by those methods needed to differentiate with hepatocellular carcinoma. 3) The resection rate was 76.6% (36/47), the postoperative overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 54.1% (24/47), 34.0% (16/47), and 29.8% (14/47) in all patients, respectively, including the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 83.3% (30/36), 50.0% (18/36), and 38.9% (14/36) in hepatectomy cases, respectively. 4) All of the four patients who survived more than 5 years, including small liver cancer (< or = 3 cm) three cases and encapsulated large nodular lesion one case, received curable resection and postoperative adjuvant therapies.PHCC patients can obtain a better result by early detection and curative resection with adjuvant therapies.
