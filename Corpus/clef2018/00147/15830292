Primary malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumor of the common bile duct. Primary malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors of the common bile duct are extremely rare. To our knowledge, the published literature contains no previous case report of this disease. Here we report on a 58-year-old Japanese woman with a primary malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumor of the common bile duct, which was completely resected. A hypoechoic mass was identified in the hepatic hilus, using ultrasonography and computed tomography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a smooth stricture and deviation of the common bile duct. Laparotomy exposed a firm mass around the common bile duct that had not invaded the surrounding tissues. Partial resection of the common bile duct and cholecystectomy were performed as the treatment of choice. The final histopathological diagnosis was malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumor arising from the wall of the common bile duct.
