Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma: a radiological-pathological correlation. Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma is a rare tumor that characteristically occurs in the second portion of the duodenum and typically presents with gastrointestinal bleeding. Gangliocytic paragangliomas have a characteristic triphasic microscopic appearance with epithelioid cells, spindle cells, and ganglion cells, resulting in a complex histology with features of paraganglioma, carcinoid, and ganglioneuroma. Duodenal gangliocytic paragangliomas have an excellent prognosis after surgical resection but metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes and recurrence may rarely occur. We report a case of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma and discuss the radiological and pathological differential diagnosis of this rare entity.
