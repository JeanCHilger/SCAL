Radiological staging of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is an adenocarcinoma arising from the bile duct epithelium, at the confluence of the right and left intrahepatic bile ducts, within the porta hepatis. In most cases, hilar cholangiocarcinomas are locally invasive tumors which have dismal prognosis if left untreated, with mean survival of approximately three months after the initial presentation. Recently, preoperative assessment of resectability and staging of hilar cholangiocarcinoma has gained importance in better management of the patients. Non-invasive cross-sectional radiological imaging has made considerable advances, and staging of hilar cholangiocarcinomas using radiological examination became more accurate in recent years. In this review, staging of hilar cholangiocarcinoma using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and magnetic resonance angiography is described.
