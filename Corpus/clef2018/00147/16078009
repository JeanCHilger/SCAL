Sarcoma of the abdominal aorta involving marginal arteries of the small intestine: a case report. Primary sarcoma of the aorta is extremely rare. In the past, the disease was commonly diagnosed on autopsy. However, now it is possible to make a diagnosis preoperatively using various imaging studies such as computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging. The authors have experienced one case of abdominal aortic sarcoma in a patient who complained of the symptoms of typical intestinal angina. We diagnosed an aortic sarcoma preoperatively but failed to resect the tumor on thoracolaparotomy because of the tumor extension to marginal arteries of the whole small intestine. We recommend preoperative laparoscopy for evaluation of tumor extension to marginal arteries of the small intestine in a patient having aortic sarcoma and intestinal angina if the patient is considered to be a surgical candidate.
