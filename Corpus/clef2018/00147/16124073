Prenatal diagnosis of choledochal cyst using magnetic resonance imaging: a case report. Choledochal cysts are congenital anomalies of the biliary ducts, characterized by cystic dilatation of the ducts. Prenatal diagnosis of this anomaly using ultrasonography (US) has been well documented. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently become an important complement to US in prenatal diagnosis of fetal anomalies. We herein report a patient in whom at 24 wk' gestation US suggested a right upper quadrant abdominal cyst and in whom at 26 wk' gestation MRI more clearly delineated the cyst and its surrounding structures and suggested a choledochal cyst, which was confirmed at postnatal surgery and histopathology.
