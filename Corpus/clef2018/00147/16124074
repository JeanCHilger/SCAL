Cystic lymphangioma of the jejunal mesentery in an adult: a case report. We herein describe the case of a 27-year-old female, who presented with a large mass of the upper left abdominal cavity discovered incidentally, through an annual health examination. Preoperative studies including abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed, but they could not accurately determine the nature of the tumor. At laparotomy, a large cystic tumor of the small bowel mesentery was found. Histopathologic examination diagnosed the tumor as a cystic lymphangioma. Although lymphangiomas are rare, especially in the abdomen of adults, they may sometimes present as acute abdomen, causing complications that require emergent surgery.
