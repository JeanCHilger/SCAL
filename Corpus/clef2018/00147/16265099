Technology insight: Current status of endoscopic ultrasonography. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become the most accurate imaging modality for locoregional cancer staging of the gastrointestinal tract. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has added a new level of accuracy for EUS in nodal staging, with reported numbers in the 90% range for luminal and pancreaticobiliary disease. In addition, new non-gastrointestinal applications are being evaluated, such as the role of EUS-FNA for the staging of non-small-cell lung cancer and exploration of the posterior mediastinum. Furthermore, the same techniques that make safe tissue sampling possible are being explored for their use as interventional applications, such as EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis, fine-needle injection, EUS-guided pseudocyst drainage, and EUS-guided cholangiography and pancreatography. This review describes the current clinical status of EUS in gastrointestinal oncology, as well as future and novel indications and therapeutic strategies for this technology.
