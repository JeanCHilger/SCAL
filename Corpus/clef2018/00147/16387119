Interferon alpha-2B and liver resection to treat multifocal hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: a relevant approach to avoid liver transplantation. Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare malignant tumor of vascular origin with frequent multifocal appearance. Liver resection may cause tumor spread. Liver transplantation has been indicated for unresectable nodules. We hypothesized that adjuvant interferon treatment is effective to prevent metastasis after liver resection. We report a case of multifocal hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma successfully treated with interferon pulse therapy and bilobar hepatic resection.CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed three nodules in the liver (segments IV, VI and VII). Histopathology and specific immunostaining of a percutaneous nodule biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The treatment protocol included daily interferon alpha 2b 9 weeks before and 1 week after resection of liver segments IV, VI and VII.The postoperative outcome was complicated by a self-limited biliary fistula. The patient remains tumor free at 3 years after liver resection and currently enjoys excellent health.Interferon pulse therapy and hepatic resection was a good option to treat multifocal bilobar hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma it may prevent metastasis dissemination.
