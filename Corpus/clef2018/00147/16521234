Spontaneous rupture of a type IVA choledochal cyst in a young adult during radiological imaging. A case of a 24-year-old male with jaundice and epigastric pain is reported. The patient underwent a thorough clinical, laboratory, and imaging investigation. Computerized tomography revealed a 9 cm mult 10 cm choledochal cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic cholangiopancreatography were performed, during which he developed an "acute abdomen", with radiological evidence of biliary peritoneal leak. Urgent surgery revealed rupture of the distended malformed common bile duct. A peritoneal drain was instilled and a more definitive surgical procedure was accordingly scheduled. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy following surgery verified these findings, as well as confirmed the adequacy of the urgent surgery. A combination of radiological and nuclear medicine techniques substantially contributes to the diagnosis of choledochal cyst rupture and the adequacy of surgical intervention.
