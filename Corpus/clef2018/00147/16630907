Patterns of neuroaxis dissemination of gliomas: suggestion of a classification based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Local invasion is the hallmark of malignant glioma dissemination. Leptomeningeal dissemination, a serious complication of malignant gliomas, has been increasingly observed. To correlate the physiopathologic mechanisms and the magnetic resonance imaging patterns of neuroaxis dissemination, a classification of malignant glioma dissemination is proposed (Instituto de Neurologia de Curitiba Classification).This classification includes the following patterns of dissemination: leptomeningeal (type I), nodular (type Ia), diffuse (type Ib) subependymal (type II)The distribution of dissemination patterns was as follows: subependymal, 4 of 10 diffuse leptomeningeal, 1 of 10Improvements in our diagnostic imaging capabilities have contributed to a better understanding of the patterns of malignant glioma dissemination. Using this information, we present a useful classification scheme, applicable to patients with neuroaxis dissemination, which will help standardize future discussions aimed at understanding these patterns of tumor spread.
