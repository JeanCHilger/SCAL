Klatskin tumors: radiological and imaging findings in eleven patients. A retrospective study of 11 patients with Klatskin tumor is presented. The series includes 3 men and 8 women with a mean age of 71 years (range: 61-84 years). Histologic examination revealed a well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma in 7 cases, an undifferentiated type in 3 and a sclerosing type in one. Ultrasound plays an increasing role in setting a directive diagnosis. Preoperative localisation of the tumor and status of the intrahepatic bile ducts are best depicted with cholangiography. CT findings are non specific, but are useful for an adequate pre- and post-treatment staging.
