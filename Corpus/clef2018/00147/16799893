Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct extending superficially from the intrahepatic to extrahepatic bile duct. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) or liver is a recently noted rare disease, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we present a case of IPNB with an interesting morphology, which was treated by resection of the right hemiliver and extrahepatic bile duct. A 79-year-old woman was found to have a high alkaline phosphatase level and slight dilatation of the right intrahepatic bile duct on imaging studies. The right intrahepatic bile duct became dilated over a 2-year period however, no solid mass could be detected, and tumor markers were not elevated. Hepatic resection was scheduled because a mucin-producing bile duct carcinoma of the liver was suspected. A right hemihepatectomy was conducted, and the extrahepatic bile duct was also resected after malignant cells were found in the surgical stump of the right bile duct and in the bile itself. Macroscopically, diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct was noted, but no solid component or mucin within the duct was found. Histopathological findings revealed carcinoma in situ, IPNB, in the majority of intrahepatic bile ducts, with no lymph node metastasis, and it extended continuously to the epithelium of the common bile duct. No tumor recurrence or biliary dilatation was observed at follow-up 2 years after surgery. It is important to consider malignancy in the presence of a dilated bile duct and in the absence of any cause of occlusion. Complete resection of IPNB results in a good prognosis and no recurrence.
