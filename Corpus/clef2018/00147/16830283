An adult choledochocele case presented with gastric outlet obstruction: a rare presentation. Bile duct cyst is a biliary tract disease that is less common among adults compared to children, and it is accepted to have a congenital entity. The classical findings constitute a triad including abdominal pain, jaundice and abdominal mass. However, infective findings also occur in case of developed cholangitis, pancreatitis and cholecystitis. Duodenal obstruction leads to a rarely seen case in patients accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and it may easily be confused with other obstruction causes. We present a case report of an adult male patient with complaints of abdominal pain, and intermittent nausea and vomiting. Due to failure of attempted endoscopic approach for treatment, we performed transduodenal cyst excision during surgical procedure on the patient diagnosed to have type III biliary tract cyst. The complaints of the patient decreased significantly after the surgical therapy compared to the previous period and no complication was observed.
