Endoscopic palliation of cholangiocarcinoma. The current endoscopic palliative modalities for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma are reviewed, focusing on the emergent methods of endoscopic palliation.Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare malignant tumor arising from biliary epithelium. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography can provide histological diagnosis through brush cytology of the bile duct, and newer cytologic techniques such as digital image analysis and fluorescent in-situ hybridization may improve the cytologic accuracy for diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography can play an adjunctive role in the diagnosis and staging by facilitating tissue acquisition through fine needle aspiration of the tumor and surrounding lymph nodes. Most patients present with unresectable disease and features of biliary obstruction. This has led to an emphasis on the role of palliative care. Biliary stent placement is an effective method of palliating obstructive jaundice. Newer modalities such as photodynamic therapy, intraluminal brachytherapy, and high-intensity ultrasound therapy may result in improved survival and play a future role as an adjunctive therapy to surgical resection.Several endoscopic palliative modalities have recently emerged. Among these, photodynamic therapy in addition to biliary stent placement appears to be a promising step towards the management of locally unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. Randomized, controlled trials are required, however, to further evaluate these therapies.
