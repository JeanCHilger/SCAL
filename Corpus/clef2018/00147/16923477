EUS-guided FNA of proximal biliary strictures after negative ERCP brush cytology results. Accurate nonoperative diagnosis of proximal biliary strictures (PBSs) is often difficult.To report our experience with EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) of PBSs following negative or unsuccessful results with brush cytology during ERCP.Retrospective cohort study.Single, tertiary referral hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana.Consecutive subjects from January 2001 to November 2004 who underwent EUS-FNA of a PBS documented by ERCP.EUS-FNA of PBS.Performance of EUS-FNA, with the final diagnosis determined by surgical pathology study or the results of EUS-FNA and follow-up.A total of 291 biliary strictures undergoing EUS were identified. Of these, 26 (9%) had PBSs and 2 were excluded. EUS-FNA was not attempted in 1 because no mass was visualized. The second had a PBS seen on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, but no ERCP was performed. Twenty-four patients (14 men mean age, 68 years) underwent EUS-FNA of a PBS following ERCP brush cytology studies that were either negative/nondiagnostic (20) or unable to be performed (4). EUS visualized a mass in 23 (96%) patients, including 13 in whom previous imaging detected no lesion. EUS-FNA (median, 4 passesHistopathologic correlation of EUS-FNA findings was limited to 8 of 24 (33%) patients who underwent surgery.EUS-FNA is a sensitive method for the diagnosis of PBSs following negative results or unsuccessful ERCP brush cytology. The low negative predictive value does not permit reliable exclusion of malignancy following a negative biopsy.
