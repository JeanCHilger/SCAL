Clinical study of 18 vesicointestinal fistulas. We studied 18 cases of vesicointestinal fistula surgically treated between January 2001 and July 2005. The underlying'cause was an inflammatory disease in 12 cases, a carcinoma in 5 and injury (post-radiation therapy) in 1 case. The fistula was visualized by cystography in 2 cases and enterography in 4. Surgical procedures were cystectomy with enterectomy in 2 cases, partial cystectomy with enterectomy in 3, bladder wall overlay-suture with enterectomy in 6 and enterectomy alone in 4. In 3 cases, colostomy without enterectomy was performed for palliative surgery. In all cases the postoperative course was good and surgical treatment was effective. Surgical procedures varied in each case depending on the etiology and the patient's condition.
