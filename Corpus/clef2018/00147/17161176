Laparoscopic cystojejunostomy as a treatment option for pancreatic pseudocysts in children--a case report. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a rare entity in children for which many approaches have been described. We report on the case of a 5-year-old boy with a pancreatic pseudocyst after blunt abdominal trauma. The patient's clinical and laboratory examination findings had also revealed an acute pancreatitis. His diagnostic workup included ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Two large cysts were found at the tail of the pancreas. No injury of the pancreatic or bile duct was found. The child underwent successful laparoscopic cystojejunostomy. The patient was free of complaints after more than 2 years of follow-up. Laparoscopic cystojejunostomy in children with pancreatic pseudocysts may represent an alternative treatment option for large pancreatic pseudocysts.
