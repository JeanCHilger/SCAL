A case of recurrent gastric cancer with obstructive jaundice successfully treated by docetaxel. Recently, treatment by taxane regimen for advanced gastric cancer as second-line chemotherapy has been increasingly reported. A 58-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer on November 25, 2002. There was permeation through the duodenum side, and a Billroth II operation was done for repair. Although a relapse was not clear from the picture image, due to the tumor marker increase since July 2004, chemotherapy using TS-1 100 mg/day was given. On February 2005, liver dysfunction and obstructive jaundice appeared, and the patient was diagnosed with a recurrence in the hilar lymph node of the liver through PET and CT. Because of the Billroth II operation for repair, ERBD was impossible, and we performed PTCD to decrease jaundice. Treatment by docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) every three weeks was given since March 15. After two courses of chemotherapy with docetaxel, the insertion of the guide wire was possible from the part of PTCD. Implantation of the stent became possible after four courses. PTCD could be removed, and the patient QOL has effectively improved. Outpatient treatment became possible for him in January 2006.
