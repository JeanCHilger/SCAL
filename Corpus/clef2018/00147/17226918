Gallbladder lymphangioma: a case report and review of the literature. Lymphangiomas are rare, benign tumors of the lymphatic system, usually present in children aged 5 years and younger. Because they are asymptomatic until the mass enlarges to cause symptoms, most lymphangiomas are diagnosed at adulthood incidentally. We experienced a case of a 60-year-old man diagnosed with a cystic lymphangioma of the gallbladder, which was successfully resected without any complication. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were very helpful for the diagnosis of the cystic lesion around the gallbladder as were ultrasonography and computed tomography scan. These showed a multi-lobulated cystic mass with intact cystic duct and bile duct in the gallbladder fossa. The patient underwent an open cholecystectomy and the histological findings were consistent with a cystic lymphangioma of the gallbladder. We here report the case of cystic lymphangioma of the gallbladder with a review of the literature.
