The value of MRI 3D-VIBE systems applied to preoperative estimate of hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma. To explore the diagnostic value of the system serial of three-dimensional spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted MR imaging (three-dimensional volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination, 3D-VIBE) used to the preoperative assessment of hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma.31 surgically confirmed patients with hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma underwent the preoperative examination through MR imaging system serial that was including T2W, two dimension (2D) T1W plain scan, 2D magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and Gadolinium-enhanced 3D-VIBE triple-phase dynamic acquisitions followed by 2D T1W scanning at the equilibrium phase. Meanwhile, it was performed for focusing on assessing or judging the tumor morphological type, the longitudinal infiltration extent of the bile duct and the involvement of neighbor blood vessels. And the 3D-VIBE was compared with 2D T1W systems for assessing or judging the tumor resectability.(1) (3D-VIBE directly displayed the hepatic portal tumors and correctly classified the tumor morphological types in all patients, but 2D T1W systems missed to show 8 hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma of periductal-infiltrating type (25. 8%) (2) According to Bismuth-Corlette classification, 3D-VIBE was closed to MRCP in accuracy (93.5%) for showing the longitudinal infiltration extent of tumor, but 2D T1W system serial underestimated (32.3%) the extent. (3) 3D-VIBE showed more involvement of the main trunk of hepatic artery, portal vein and their branches than 2D T1W systems did. (4) The positive predicting value and accuracy for assessing tumor resectability were 84.0% and 90.0% for 3D-VIBE system, as 64.0% and 71.0% for 2D T1W systems.3D-VIBE system is superior to other MR imaging system serial in the preoperative assessment of the morphological type, the longitudinal infiltration extent and the tumor resectability of hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma.
