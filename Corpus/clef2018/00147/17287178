Bile duct hamartomas--the von Meyenburg complex. Hamartomas of the bile duct (von Meyenburg complex) are benign neoplasms of the liver, constituted histologically cystic dilatations of the bile duct, encompassed by fibrous stroma.

Magnetic resonance imaging and liver biopsy are the gold standards for diagnosis of this rare hepatobiliary condition.
