Renal agenesis associated with ipsilateral ectopic ureter entering a large seminal vesicle cyst. We describe a case of right renal agenesis with ipsilateral ectopic ureter opening into a large seminal vesicle cyst in a 24-year old man. The patient presented with left flank pain and the imaging studies showed absent right kidney and a large pelvic cyst possibly arising from seminal vesicle. The cyst was removed together with the right ureter and kidney remnant through a laparotomy.
