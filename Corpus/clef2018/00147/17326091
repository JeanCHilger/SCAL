Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the bile ducts. We present the case of a 63-year-old male with intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the bile ducts. We discuss the role of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced T1-weighted MRI in the visualization of mucin flow, localization of the papillary tumor, and confirming the diagnosis of this uncommon disease.
