Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of intraspinal enterogenous cysts. To describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations of intraspinal enterogenous cysts, and to provide reliable information for further clinical management.The MRI findings and related clinical data of 6 patients with surgically and pathologically confirmed intraspinal enterogenous cysts were retrospectively studied.Among the 6 patients, most enterogenous cysts were oval or fusiform in shape with well-defined margins. Five cysts were located in the subdural extramedullary space and one cyst was located intramedullary. The signals were hypo-or iso-intensity on T1W images and hyperintensity on T2W images. On the postcontrast images, five showed no enhancement, and one was enhanced peripherally.The MRI findings of intraspinal enterogenous cysts are specific and the correct preoperative diagnosis may be obtained by integrating MRI findings with clinical data.
