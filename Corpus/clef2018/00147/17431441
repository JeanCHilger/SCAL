Localization of pancreatic insulinoma with ultrasonography laparoscopy. The case of a 51-year-old woman with a clinical history of hipoglicemia caused by a presumed pancreatic insulinoma is reported. Laboratory tests pointed out for a insulinoma, but imaginologic studies could not locate the tumor. Under this circumstances, the patient was laparoscopically approached. By means of the ultrasonography device the tumor was located at the uncinate process of the pancreas and, eventually treated by laparoscopic enucleation.
