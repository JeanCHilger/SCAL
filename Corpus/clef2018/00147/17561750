Intramedullary mature teratoma of the cervical spinal cord at C1-2 associated with occult spinal dysraphism in an adult. Case report and review of the literature. There is a well-recognized association between dysontogenetic tumors of the spinal cord (including teratomas and enterogenous cysts) and dysraphic congenital spinal malformations. The authors present a case of an adult with an intramedullary mature teratoma (IMMT) at the level of C1-2 of the cord associated with dysraphic congenital spinal malformations. Intramedullary mature teratomas of the cervical region of the spinal cord are very rare in adults only four such lesions have been reported, two of which involved upper cervical segments. Despite the potentially critical location of the tumor, monitored microsurgery resulted in complete removal of the tumor with an intact surrounding capsule, associated fibrous tract, and ellipse of skin with a central dimple. There was an excellent postoperative neurological outcome. The clinical features, imaging studies, treatment options, postoperative outcome, and plausible pathological correlations of IMMTs are discussed.
