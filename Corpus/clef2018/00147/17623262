Unusual segmental stricture of the lower common bile duct mimicking bile duct cancer. In some cases of bile duct stricture, malignancy cannot be diagnosed preoperatively even with the use of various diagnostic imaging modalities and histologic examination. As long as malignancy cannot be ruled out completely, surgery can be undertaken for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment. We report a case of unusual segmental stricture of the lower common bile duct mimicking bile duct cancer and discuss the differential diagnosis.
