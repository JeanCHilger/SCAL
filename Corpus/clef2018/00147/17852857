A rare surgical case of metachronous double carcinoma of the biliary tract. We report on a rare case of metachronous double carcinoma of the biliary tract, occurring in a 65-year-old male. The patient was admitted to the hospital with jaundice in March 2004. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the abdomen showed a minimally dilated intrahepatic biliary tree with normal-appearing choledocus. Obstruction of the common hepatic duct was revealed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient underwent a resection of the middle third of the extrahepatic duct and cholecystectomy (cholangiocarcinoma, pT1N0M0), with the surgical margins of resection showing as negative. After 2 years, during follow-up, the findings of a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan suggested a possible cholangiocarcinoma of the distal part of the biliary tract CT and MRI scanning of the abdomen showed mild dilatation of the distal common hepatic duct
