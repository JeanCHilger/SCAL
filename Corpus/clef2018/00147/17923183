Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis associated with anomalous junction of the cystic duct in a child. We report an extremely rare case of cholelithiasis, presumably owing to cholestasis resulting from an anomalous course of the cystic duct. A 10-year-old girl visited our hospital because of right epigastric pain and fever. Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis were diagnosed by ultrasound examination. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed no pancreaticobiliary maljunction but confirmed a dilated, tortuous cystic duct anomalously draining into the right hepatic duct. Because cholangitis and obstructive jaundice progressed after admission, emergent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, and a common bile duct stone was removed endoscopically. It was a bilirubin stone. At a later date, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed for cholelithiasis. Preoperative 3-dimensional computed tomography and intraoperative cholangiography enabled us to treat the cystic duct safely.
