Adrenal masses: characterization with in vivo proton MR spectroscopy--initial experience. To prospectively determine the accuracy of in vivo proton ((1)H) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in distinguishing adrenal adenomas, pheochromocytomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and metastases, with histologic or computed tomographic findings and follow-up data as the reference standards.This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained. Sixty consecutive patients (24 male and 36 female patients mean age, 53 years) harboring adrenal tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter (mean diameter, 4.6 cm +/- 3.4 [standard deviation]) entered the study and were examined with a 1.5-T MR imaging system and point-resolved multivoxel (1)H MR spectroscopy. Thirty-eight patients had adenomasCutoff values of 1.20 for the choline-creatine ratio (92% sensitivity, 96% specificity P < .01), 0.38 for the choline-lipid ratio (92% sensitivity, 90% specificity(1)H MR spectroscopy can be used to characterize adrenal masses on the basis of spectral findings for benign adenomas, carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, and metastases.
