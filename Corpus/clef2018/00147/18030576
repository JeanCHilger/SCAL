Successful resection of an advanced duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor after down-staging with imatinib: report of a case. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) relies on a combination of the following criteria: anatomic location, typical histopathology, and the presence of CD 117-antigen (the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-kit) or CD 34-antigen. Imatinib mesylate, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is highly efficient against locally advanced or metastatic GIST. We report a case of unresectable duodenal GIST, which we were able to resect with curative intent after down-staging treatment with a dosage of imatinib 400 mg daily for 8 months. We performed Whipple's procedure combined with en bloc resection of the right kidney and adrenal gland. The patient was recurrence free at his 24-month follow-up examination. Down-staging treatment may be worthwhile in selected patients, but further prospective studies of imatinib in this setting are necessary. We think that imatinib should be continued postoperatively, as the risk of recurrence in these patients may be high.
