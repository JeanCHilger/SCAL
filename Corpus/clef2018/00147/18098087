Laparoscopic coincidental finding in a case of incomplete ileus: adenocarcinoma of the small intestine as first manifestation of Crohn's disease. The case-study reminds of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine as a rare complication of Crohn's disease. A few more than 100 of these cases have been published. Epidemiological studies concerning small bowel carcinoma showed consumption of sugar and carbohydrates as pathogenetic factors, other conditions like ileostoma, ileumconduit, Crohn's disease and coeliac disease have been identified to some extent. An adenoma-carcinoma sequence as in large intestine carcinoma has been discussed. Immunohistochemical and oncogenetic findings failed to demonstrate any result of practical clinical value. Diagnosis of early stages of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine is very difficult and thus might be impossible to differentiate from exacerbation or progressive stenosis of preexisting Crohn's disease. If non-invasive diagnostic measures (ultrasound, small bowel enema, CT-scan, intestinoscopy, radiography, NMR-Sellink, capsule-endoscopy) fail to clear the situation a diagnostic laparoscopy or even laparotomy should not be delayed. This constitutes the only chance to discover early stages which can possibly be cured in accordance with oncosurgical principles. Otherwise the prognosis remains poor with a high percentage of late stages and a 5-year-survival-rate between 20 and 50 percent.
