Solitary extra-hepatic hilar peribiliary cyst presenting with obstructive jaundice: a case report. Peribiliary cyst is a poorly recognized and under-reported clinico-pathologic entity around the biliary tree. Peribiliary cysts are cystic dilatations of obstructed peribiliary glands, which are normal elements of the biliary tract. They are generally asymptomatic and rarely cause biliary obstruction. They are usually discovered incidentally at autopsy or in explants following liver transplantation. A 59-year-old male patient presenting with obstructive jaundice due to a large extra-hepatic hilar peribiliary cyst is reported here. We briefly discuss its differential diagnoses such as bile duct cyst, liver cyst or lymph cyst, and its management. Radiological imaging demonstrated a solitary large (5 cm) well-defined, smooth, thin walled cystic lesion at the porta hepatis paralleling but not communicating with the bile duct. A wide cyst de-roofing was performed and histological examination of the cystic wall revealed an inflammatory cyst. The patient made an uneventful recovery and remained asymptomatic with normal liver function tests 36 months postoperatively.
