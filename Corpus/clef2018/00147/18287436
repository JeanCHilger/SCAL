Mucinous appendiceal neoplasms: preoperative MR staging and classification compared with surgical and histopathologic findings. The objective of our study was to determine the accuracy of MRI in the preoperative staging and classification of mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and to describe the MRI features that are useful for selecting patients for surgical resection.Twenty-two patients underwent preoperative MRI including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, immediate gadolinium-enhanced, and delayed gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Two observers reviewed the images for peritoneal tumor at 13 sites, tumor size and distribution, and degree of tumor enhancement. Peritoneal tumor sites were recorded at surgery. Cytoreduction was categorized as complete or suboptimal. Surgical specimens were classified as disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis tumors, intermediate-grade tumors, or peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis tumors.Surgery confirmed 232 tumor sites. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI was the most accurate of the MR techniques, with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 89%, 87%, and 89%, respectively, for observer 1 and 82%, 87%, and 83% for observer 2 (p < 0.001). Surgical cytoreduction was complete in 14 patients and suboptimal in eight. MRI findings predicting suboptimal cytoreduction included a large (> 5 cm) mesenteric mass, which was present in 75% of the patients in the suboptimal cytoreduction group and 0% of those in the complete cytoreduction group diffuse mesenteric tumor (88% and 0%, respectively)Of the MR techniques evaluated, delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI was the most accurate for the staging and classification of mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and provided prognostic information useful for patient selection.
