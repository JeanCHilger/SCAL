Maxillo-facial location of hydatic cyst. A maxillofacial location of a hydatid cyst is rare, accounting 2% of cases. The purpose of this study was to review clinical and radiological features by emphasizing diagnostic difficulties.Two observations of hydatid cyst with a maxillofacial location are presented. Two cases were investigated by panoramic dental radiography, an ultrasound and CT scan. MRI was done in one case.The first observation reports a 23-year-old woman who consulted for jugal tumefaction with pharyngeal extension evolving in spurts. The second observation was a 16-year-old girl, which consulted for a genian and masseter tumefaction with a tight trismus. In both cases, the imaging studies suggested the diagnosis of the hydatid cyst confirmed by the anatomopathologic exam.The hydatid cyst is an endemic parasitic pathology involving most often the lung and the liver. The maxillofacial location is exceptional. In cases of a cyst mass in an endemic zone, the diagnosis of the hydatid cyst must be entertained. CT scan and MRI provided a complete lesion workup. Treatment is surgical.
