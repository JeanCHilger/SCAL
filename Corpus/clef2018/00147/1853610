Impact of recent advances in hepatobiliary imaging techniques on the preoperative diagnosis of carcinoma of the gallbladder. Among 26 patients with gallbladder carcinoma, 11 resected cases were studied retrospectively with respect to the preoperative imaging techniques and the operative procedures employed. Ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography, and computed tomography were valuable in detecting gallbladder carcinoma preoperatively while direct cholangiography and angiography were helpful in designing operative strategy. The ultrasonographic findings were: a polypoid (fungating) mass protruding into the gallbladder lumen in 45%, abnormal thickening of the gallbladder wall in 18%, and a mass in the gallbladder invading adjacent organs in 18% of cases. Approximately 80% was diagnosed preoperatively by ultrasonography. Correct diagnosis was made by computed tomography in 60% of the cases. Endoscopic ultrasonography offered valuable information on the depth of tumor invasion. Direct cholangiography and angiography were useful in assessing the extent of the tumor spread. Recent advances in hepatobiliary imaging techniques, especially ultrasonography and computed tomography, contributed greatly to the detection and evaluation of gallbladder carcinoma at an early and resectable stage.
