Endoscopic management of biliary malignancies. The current status of endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of biliary malignancies is discussed. Three ways are now available to approach the bile duct endoscopically. Endoscopic diagnostic modalities are quite useful for the assessment of local changes because of their high spatial resolution and ability in tissue and bile acquisition for histologic, cytologic, and molecular biologic evaluations. Endoscopic biliary drainage is less invasive and beneficial for patients with obstructive jaundice compared with surgical or percutaneous transhepatic drainage. Continuous evolution should expand its indications.
