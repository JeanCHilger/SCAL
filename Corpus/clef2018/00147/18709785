Laparoscopic wedge resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumour of the duodenum. We report the case of a 40-year-old male patient who presented with melaena and acute anaemia. Endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a lesion with a central depression measuring 2.5 cm, arising from the lateral wall of the second portion of the duodenum. Because of this rare location, a very invasive procedure (duodenopancreatectomy) might have been required for tumour resection. We avoided this operation and implemented an alternative solution. A laparoscopic wedge resection of the duodenal tumour was successfully completed. Operating time was 200 min and blood loss 50 ml. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3, after an uneventful postoperative recovery. Histopathologically, the tumour was diagnosed as a low-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Despite the fact that laparoscopic surgery requires more complex technique than open surgery and the acquisition of advanced laparoscopic skills depending on prior laparoscopic experience, laparoscopic wedge resection should be considered as a valid treatment for duodenal stromal tumour.
