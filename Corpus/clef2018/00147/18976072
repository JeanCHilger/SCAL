Recurrence following neurosurgeon-determined gross-total resection of adult supratentorial low-grade glioma: results of a prospective clinical trial. In 1998, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group initiated a Phase II study of observation for adults < 40 years old with cerebral low-grade glioma who underwent a neurosurgeon-determined gross-total resection (GTR).Patient eligibility criteria included the presence of a World Health Organization Grade II astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, or mixed oligoastrocytoma confirmed histologically age 18-39 yearsBetween 1998 and 2002, 111 eligible patients were entered into the study. In these 111 patients, the overall survival rates at 2 and 5 years were 99 and 93%, respectively. The PFS rates in these 111 patients at 2 and 5 years were 82 and 48%, respectively. Three prognostic factors predicted significantly poorer PFS in univariate and multivariate analyses: 1) preoperative tumor diameter > or = 4 cm 2) astrocytoma/oligoastrocytoma histological typeThese data suggest that young adult patients with low-grade glioma who undergo a neurosurgeon-determined GTR have a > 50% risk of tumor progression 5-years postoperatively, warranting close follow-up and consideration for adjuvant treatment.
