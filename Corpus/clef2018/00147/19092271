Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography for diagnosis of hepatic malignancies: comparison with contrast-enhanced CT. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of hepatic malignancies in comparison with contrast-enhanced CT findings.A total of 74 patients with 113 hepatic tumors having or highly suspected of having malignancies were enrolled. These hepatic nodules were diagnosed by typical findings of imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT, dynamic MRI or Sonazoid-enhanced US, tumor markers and histological examinations after surgical resection or biopsy.108 nodules were diagnosed as malignant tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma: n = 90 metastasis: n = 16Sonazoid-enhanced US has a higher sensitivity and accuracy for the diagnosis of hepatic malignancies than contrast-enhanced CT.
