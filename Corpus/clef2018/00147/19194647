Eosinophilic cholangitis with obstructive jaundice mimicking bile duct carcinoma. A 55-year-old male who presented with obstructive jaundice and radiographically documented extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction is reported. Eosinophilic infiltration of the gallbladder, common bile duct, intrahepatic bile ducts, and bone marrow was observed. Eosinophilic cholangitis, a rare inflammatory condition that clinically resembles a biliary malignancy, should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis in the evaluation of presumed neoplasm of the bile ducts.
