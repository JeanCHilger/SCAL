One-trocar ileo-colic resection in a newborn infant with a cystic lymphangioma of the small-bowel mesentery. We report a case of a newborn with a cystic lymphangioma of the small-bowel mesentery discovered antenatally at ultrasound and confirmed postnatally at computed tomography scan. The lesion together with the caecum and the last centimeters of ileum were resected by using only one trocar positioned lateroumbilically. In this paper, we describe the advantages of MIS to treat newborn with abdominal masses.
