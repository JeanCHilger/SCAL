Eosinophilic gastroenteritis observed by double balloon enteroscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography in the whole gastrointestinal tract. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils. It is a rare disease. There are no reports in the history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis being consecutively observed in the whole gastrointestinal tract by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). A 66-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Laboratory findings included peripheral eosinophilia and a high serum immunoglobulin E level. We observed the whole gastrointestinal tract by EGD, DBE (antegrade and retrograde approaches), and EUS. DBE showed slightly edematous and reddish mucosa in the jejunum, ileum, and ascending colon, respectively. EUS in all portion of the gastrointestinal tract demonstrated almost normal five-layered structure without ascites. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimens from the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum revealed eosinophilic infiltration. No evidence of parasites, granulomas, malignancy, vasculitis or embolism was founded in any of the biopsy specimens. The patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic gastroenteritis with predominant mucosal layer form. She was treated with oral corticosteroid, and her symptoms subsided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in which the whole gastrointestinal tract was consecutively observed by EGD, DBE, and EUS.
