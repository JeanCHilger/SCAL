EUS-guided sampling of suspected GI stromal tumors. The diagnostic yield of EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) of suspected GI stromal tumors (GIST) has not been assessed in large series.Our purpose was to determine the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA of subepithelial lesions with EUS features suggestive of GIST.Retrospective database review.Tertiary care referral center and an urban Veterans Administration hospital.Consecutive patients referred for EUS evaluation of upper GI subepithelial lesions of the fourth endosonographic layer who underwent EUS-FNA.Proportion of patients whose cytopathologic examination was diagnostic (immunohistochemical stains establish a specific diagnosis), suspicious (spindle cells identified, quantity not sufficient for specific stains), or nondiagnostic.A total of 112 patients (45.5% female, mean age 61.6 years) underwent EUS-FNA (mean number of FNA passes 5.3). Tumor location was as follows: stomach 62.5%, esophagus 30.4%, and duodenum 7.1%. EUS-FNA was diagnostic in 61.6%, suspicious (spindle cells) in 22.3%, and nondiagnostic in 16.1%. The histologic results were 31.3% GIST, 26.8% leiomyomas, 22.3% spindle cell neoplasms, 3.5 % neural tumors, and 16.1% nondiagnostic. Fifteen (12.5%) patients also underwent EUS-guided core needle biopsy needle sampling 7 were diagnostic, 2 suspicious, and 6 nondiagnostic. Twenty-four (20.0%) patients underwent jumbo forceps samplingEUS-FNA sampling of subepithelial lesions was diagnostic in 61.6% and showed a spindle cell neoplasm ("suspicious") in another 22.3% (diagnostic yield 83.9%). Core needle biopsy needle sampling did not increase the yield, but in the setting of an ulcerated mass, forceps biopsy may be diagnostic.
