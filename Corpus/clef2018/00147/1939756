Biliary cystadenoma with intratumoral bleeding: radiologic-pathologic correlation. We report a case of a 35-year-old woman with a mucinous biliary cystadenoma of the liver. The patient presented with the acute onset of upper abdominal pain and jaundice, symptoms caused by bleeding into the cystadenoma. Findings of a variety of imaging modalities including ultrasound, CT angiography, MR imaging, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are correlated and verified by pathological studies performed on the material obtained surgically.
