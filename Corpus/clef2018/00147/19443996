Liver cyst with biliary communication successfully treated with laparoscopic deroofing: a case report. A 56-year-old woman visited our hospital because of high fever and right hypochondralgia. Abdominal computed tomography showed a liver cyst 10 cm in diameter and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. Percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the cyst guided by ultrasonography disclosed that the cyst contained a brown milky fluid, and cystography showed biliary communication. Thus, the cyst was diagnosed as an infectious hepatic cyst with biliary communication. Treatments for liver cysts include aspiration therapy, alcoholic sclerotherapy, laparoscopic fenestration, fenestration by laparotomy, cystojejunostomy, cystectomy, and hepatectomy. Because a simple liver cyst is benign, treatments should be low-risk and minimally invasive thus, we performed laparoscopic fenestration. Fenestration should not be performed if the case is complicated by infection or biliary communication. Although cystography showed biliary communication, the cyst was not visualized with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, and we concluded that the biliary communication was small. Operation time was 95 minutes, and blood loss was 10 g. Pathological findings of the liver cyst were consistent with a simple cyst. The postoperative course was good, and the patient left the hospital 10 days after the operation. Eighteen months have passed since the operation, and no recurrent cysts have been detected with computed tomography. This is the second report of liver cyst with biliary communication successfully treated with laparoscopic deroofing. Laparoscopic fenestration is a useful method for treating simple benign liver cysts because of its minimal invasiveness and may be useful in cases with small biliary communication.
