Diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma: a case series and literature review. Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare neoplasm of the bile ducts. Risk factors include primary sclerosing cholangitis, Caroli's disease, infection, liver flukes, and chronic typhoid. Improvements in imaging and surgical techniques may allow for earlier diagnosis and improvements in patient survival.A retrospective review of patients referred to a single center, and a literature review.Of 23 patients 14 were male, 9 female mean age 64 years. Mean survival time was 621 days. Stage I, II, III and IV patients had mean survival times of 1120.5, 117.5, 479.5, and 448.9 days, respectively. Patients with resectable disease had improved survival (964.5 days) compared to non-surgically treated (174.4 days) and unresectable patients (558.1 days).Despite advances in imaging techniques and surgical care, overall survival of cholangiocarcinoma remains poor. Early recognition and minimization of delay may allow for definitive surgical therapy (complete resection) and improved survival.
