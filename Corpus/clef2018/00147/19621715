Long-term outcome of laparoscopic deroofing for symptomatic nonparasitic liver cysts. The use of the laparoscopic procedure for managing symptomatic nonparasitic liver cysts has been documented to be feasible and safe in the short term however, the long-term outcomes of the procedure have not been well demonstrated. This study was initiated to review the long-term outcomes of this procedure.Preoperatively, diagnosis was established by ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography or magnetic resonance cholangiographic photograph. The long-term outcomes in 8 patients with symptomatic nonparasitic simple liver cysts treated by laparoscopic deroofing are presented. All patients were followed up, and morphologic evaluation was performed with repeated abdominal US and CT.All operations could be finished laparoscopically without converting to open laparotomy. Intra- and postoperative complications were not detected. The mean follow-up duration in all cases was 122.5 months (range: 79-149 months). Two patients exhibited morphologic recurrence within 6 months after surgery and required a second treatment.From the observation of long-term follow-up, we concluded that laparoscopic deroofing is a useful method for treating symptomatic nonparasitic liver cysts.
