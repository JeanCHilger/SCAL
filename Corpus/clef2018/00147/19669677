Endoscopic diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the bile duct. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the bile duct (IPMN-B) is considered an uncommon tumor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of endoscopic cholangiography (ERC) with subsequent peroral cholangioscopy (POCS) and/or intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) for this tumor.From December 1991 to November 2006, a retrospective analysis was made of eight patients with IPMN-B. Their clinical features and the endoscopic diagnostic strategy for POCS and IDUS were reviewed.In all the patients, ERC failed to show papillary tumors, due to coexisting mucin or biliary sludge. POCS was carried out after ERC and it showed the presence and locations of papillary tumors in all patients, except for one with a tumor in the peripheral intrahepatic bile duct (B3). IDUS was performed in seven of the eight patients in five of these patients, intraductal protruding tumors were clearly visualized, whereas flat tumors were not identified in the remaining two patients. In one of the eight patients, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage did not remove the huge amount of mucin. Hence, this patient required subsequent percutaneous biliary drainage. Six of the eight patients underwent surgical treatmentERC failed to delineate intraductal papillary tumors, due to coexisting mucin. The presence and location of papillary tumors were correctly diagnosed by both POCS and IDUS, but POCS may be better than IDUS to diagnose the extent of the tumor.
