Multicystic biliary hamartoma: imaging findings in four cases. Multicystic biliary hamartoma is a rare hamartomatous nodule of the liver, which has recently been described as a new category of hepatic nodular cystic lesion. The purpose of this study is to report the imaging findings in four cases of multicystic biliary hamartoma.US, CT, and MRI manifestation of four multicystic hamartoma were evaluated and correlated to pathological findings.The location of the lesion was near the liver surface. Localized multicystic areas with enhanced walls and septae were the common features of this disease. They had the so-called honeycomb-like appearance, and normal liver parenchyma often intermingled within the peripheral portion of the nodular lesion. Pathologically, these imaging features corresponded to multiple dilated hamartomatous bile ducts with fibrous cystic wall and/or septa.We should keep in mind this disease as one type of cystic liver disease and not confuse it with neoplasms such as cystadenoma of the liver.
