Gastric carcinoid presented as gastric outlet obstruction. Carcinoids are solid tumors of entero-chromaffin origin classified as neuroendocrine amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) cell tumors and are found throughout the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the rectum, with a predilection for the ileum. These tumors rarely occur in the stomach, constituting only 2% of gastric tumors and 3.3% of all carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Localization of gastric tumors can be done by ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, but endoscopic biopsy is required for confirmation demonstration of neurosecretory granules on microscopy is the most specific feature. Early resection is the treatment of choice. Prognosis of noninvasive tumors <2 cm in size in terms of 5-year survival rate is 100%. The 5-year survival rate declines and prognosis becomes poor with increase in size and with involvement of serosa, perineural infiltration, and lymph node metastasis.
