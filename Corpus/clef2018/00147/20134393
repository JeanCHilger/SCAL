Endoscopic removal of a brunneroma with EUS guidance. Brunner glands are compound tubular submucosal glands typically found in the duodenal bulb. The most common benign tumors of the small intestine are adenoma, and 25% of these occur in the duodenum. Among the benign tumors of the duodenum, 30-50% arise from the Brunner glands. Most of the literature describes their presentations as ranging from benign, nonspecific, epigastric discomfort to obstruction and intestinal bleeding. A good percentage of them are surgically resected however, there has been an advancement to remove them endoscopically. We present one of the first cases of an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) approach to the diagnosis and therapeutic removal of a brunneroma.
