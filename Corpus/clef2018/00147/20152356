Intraoperative endoscopy during choledochal cyst excision: extended long-term follow-up compared with recent cases. We routinely perform intraoperative endoscopy (IOE) of the intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) and intrapancreatic bile duct (IPBD) with a pediatric cystoscope during excision of choledochal cyst (CC). Here we compare extended long-term follow-up patients with a series of recent cases.We compared 25 CC patients treated over the past 5 years (group 1) with 69 CC patients treated between 1986 and 1998 and followed up for more than 10 years (group 2), focusing on stone formation.In group 1 (mean follow-up, 2.6 years) IOE identified IHBD debris in 7 (28%) of 25 and IPBD protein plugs in 9 (36%) of 25. In group 2 (mean follow-up, 14.6 years) IOE identified IHBD debris in 11 (16%) of 69 and IPBD protein plugs in 17 (25%) of 69. There was no relation between type of CC and incidence of IHBD debris or IPBD protein plugs. The incidence of postoperative stones to date is 0% in group 1 and 2.9% in group 2, rates far lower than those reported in the literature.We attribute our lower incidence of stones directly to IOE and recommend that it be performed routinely during cyst excision. It is simple, is effective, and improves outcome.
