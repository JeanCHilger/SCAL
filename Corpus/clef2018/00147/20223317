Laparoscopic repair for choledochal cyst: lessons learned from 190 cases. The aim of this study is to report the technical details, early outcomes, and lessons learned from laparoscopic repair of 190 cases of choledochal cyst.The operation was performed using 4 ports. The cystic duct was identified and divided. The liver was elevated by 2 stay-sutures: one on the round ligament and the other on the distal cystic duct. The choledochal cyst was isolated and removed completely, and then biliary-digestive continuity was reestablished.From January 2007 to April 2009, 190 patients were operated on. There were 144 girls and 46 boys. Ages ranged from 2 months to 16 years (mean, 46.9 +/- 29.3 months). Cyst diameter ranged from 10 to 184 mm. A total of 106 patients were classified as Todani type I cysts, and 84 were type IV. Cystic excision and hepaticoduodenostomy were performed in 133 patients and hepaticojejunostomy in 57 patients. The operating time varied from 70 to 505 minutes (mean, 186 minutes). Conversion to open surgery was required in 2 patients. Intraoperative blood transfusion was required in 4 patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Postoperative anastomotic leakage occurred in 7 patients, resolving spontaneously in 6 and requiring a second operation in 1. Postoperative hospital stay ranged from 5 to 27 days (mean, 7.2 +/- 3.3 days). Follow-up occurred between 1 and 24 months postdischarge (mean, 9 +/- 2.2 months) and was obtained in 161 patients (84.7%). Of these patients, cholangitis occurred in 4 patients (2.4%).Laparoscopic repair is a safe and effective procedure for choledochal cyst.
