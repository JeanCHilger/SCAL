Post-cholecystectomy syndrome: spectrum of biliary findings at magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is defined as a complex of heterogeneous symptoms, consisting of upper abdominal pain and dyspepsia, which recur and/or persist after cholecystectomy. Nevertheless, this term is inaccurate, as it encompasses biliary and non-biliary disorders, possibly unrelated to cholecystectomy. Biliary manifestations of PCS may occur early in the post-operative period, usually because of incomplete surgery (retained calculi in the cystic duct remnant or in the common bile duct) or operative complications, such as bile duct injury and/or bile leakage. A later onset is commonly caused by inflammatory scarring strictures involving the sphincter of Oddi or the common bile duct, recurrent calculi or biliary dyskinesia. The traditional imaging approach for PCS has involved ultrasound and/or CT followed by direct cholangiography, whereas manometry of the sphincter of Oddi and biliary scintigraphy have been reserved for cases of biliary dyskinesia. Because of its capability to provide non-invasive high-quality visualisation of the biliary tract, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has been advocated as a reliable imaging tool for assessing patients with suspected PCS and for guiding management decisions. This paper illustrates the rationale for using MRCP, together with the main MRCP biliary findings and diagnostic pitfalls.
