Imaging diagnosis of cancer of the gallbladder. Imaging modalities are used for diagnosis of cancer of the gallbladder. Ultrasound is most useful for early diagnosis of cancer of the gallbladder. Ultrasonic findings of cancer of the gallbladder are classified into 3 patterns: massive tumor, irregular thickness of wall and localized tumor. In advanced cancer of the gallbladder, ultrasound can make the definitive diagnosis. Early cancer of the gallbladder is reported as polypoid type or flat type. Ultrasound can visualize the abnormalities of the gallbladder in the polypoid type, but the flat type is difficult to detect by any methods. Other imaging modalities (color Doppler flow mapping, Endoscopic ultrasonography, Cholangiography, X-ray CT, Cholecytoscopy and Angiography) are also useful for diagnosis of cancer of the gallbladder or diagnosis of progress of the cancer.
