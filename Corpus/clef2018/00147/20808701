Imaging findings of intrahepatic bile duct adenoma (peribiliary gland hamartoma): a case report and literature review. Intrahepatic bile duct adenoma is a rare benign epithelial hepatic tumor derived from bile duct cells. We report the imaging findings of a patient with bile duct adenoma, which appeared as a small heterogeneously enhancing mass with focal small cystic change on CT and MRI. Follow-up images at seven months showed a slight increase in tumor size, which could be partly explained by intratumoral hemorrhage on pathologic examination. Although rare, bile duct adenoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis of a small hypervascular tumor located in the periphery of liver. Focal cystic change and intratumoral hemorrhage may occur.
