Malignant biliary tract obstruction: evaluation and therapy. Malignant biliary tract obstruction is a common clinical entity. Patients with tumors causing biliary tract obstruction are often asymptomatic until disease is significantly advanced. Symptoms of obstructive jaundice can significantly impair quality-of-life unless intervention to decompress the biliary tract, either curative or palliative, is performed. This article reviews the evaluation and management of patients with malignant biliary tract obstruction, including the available imaging and treatment modalities (endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical approach) for relieving malignant biliary tract obstruction.
