69 year-old patient with chronic abdominal pain and anemia in neurofibromatosis. The case of a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 with chronic abdominal pain and iron deficiency anemia is described. Diagnostic procedures including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and ileocolonoscopy did not disclose a definitive cause. CT scan and MRI revealed multiple intraluminal tumors in the small bowel, especially in the ileum. These findings were verified by double balloon enteroscopy. Endoscopic resection was not performed due to size and number of the polyps, and the patient was sent for diagnostic laparotomy. A conglomerate tumor of the ileum was resected. Histopathological analysis revealed 13 inflammatory polyps and 2 gastrointestinal stroma tumors.
