Klatskin-mimicking lesions--a case series and literature review. Obstruction of the hepatic hilum in patients without prior surgery is generally due to hilar adenocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor). However, not all the hilar strictures are malignant. Although uncommon, benign strictures of the proximal bile duct should be taken into consideration in differential diagnosis of Klatskin tumors, since the incidence could reach up to 25% of patients with presumed Klatskin tumor diagnosis. This group of benign proximal bile duct strictures (Klatskin-mimicking lesions) is usually represented by segmental fibrosis and non-specific chronic inflammation. The clinical and imaging features can not differentiate between benign and malignant strictures. Herein, we present a case series of three patients with benign proximal bile duct strictures (representing 4.1% of 73 patients resected with presumptive preoperative diagnosis of Klatskin tumor) and literature review. There are presented the clinical and biochemical features, imaging preoperative workup, surgical treatment and histological analysis of the specimen, along with postoperative outcome. For benign strictures of the hilum limited resections are curative. However, despite new diagnosis tools developed in the last years, patients with hilar obstructions still require unnecessary extensive resections due to impossibility of excluding the malignancy. In all cases of proximal bile duct obstruction presumed malignant, they should be managed accordingly, even with the risk of over-treatment for some benign lesions.
