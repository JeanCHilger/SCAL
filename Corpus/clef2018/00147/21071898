A case of jejunal adenocarcinoma with serum DUPAN-2 elevation. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting. Ileus with ulcerated jejunal tumor was diagnosed and biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Because her serum level of DUPAN-2 was high, she was examined by PET scan, which revealed that she had a left ovarian mass in addition to the jejunal tumor. Surgical resection was performed: both tumors were adenocarcinoma, but the ovarian tumor was considered to be metastatic clinically and histologically. Immunostaining for DUPAN-2 was positive in the both tumors. The serum level of DUPAN-2 returned to normal after the surgery, and has been within normal limits for about 3 years without any additional therapy. This case shows a possible relation between small bowel adenocarcinoma and DUPAN-2.
