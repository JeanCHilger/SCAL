Intestinal metastasis from non-small-cell lung cancer initially detected by ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is relatively rare. As most patients with GI metastasis are diagnosed on the occasion of serious complications, such as ileus or perforation, the appropriate diagnosis is important. Here, we report a case of NSCLC metastatic to the small intestine diagnosed at initial staging using ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.
