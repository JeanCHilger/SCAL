Endoscopic ultrasound-guided Trucut biopsy of gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumor. Data on the utility of endoscopic ultrasound-guided Trucut biopsy (EUS-TCB) for suspected gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumor (GIMT) are limited. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic yield and complications from EUS-TCB for GIMT.Consecutive patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal or rectal GIMT from the muscularis propria with a maximal diameter of 20 mm or more were enrolled in a prospective, single-center cohort. An EUS-TCB was performed when on-site fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology review of the lesion was deemed suboptimal. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and leiomyoma were defined by the presence or absence of positive immunochemistry (IC) for c-kit, respectively. All GIMTs with a nondiagnostic IC were considered as unspecified. The outcomes assessed included diagnostic pathologic and IC yield (when tested) and procedural complications.In this study, 38 patients (24 women median age, 62 years) with suspected GIMT (median maximal diameter, 42 mmIn this cohort, EUS-TCB provided diagnostic histology and IC for 79 and 97% of the patients, respectively. For the initial biopsy of GIMT, EUS-TCB may be considered an acceptable alternative to EUS-FNA.
