Biliary disease in children. Biliary diseases in children are infrequent however, they can be associated with high morbidity and mortality if an accurate diagnosis is not made and adequate treatment provided in a timely fashion. Biliary atresia, choledochal cysts, gallbladder disease, and Alagille syndrome can be associated with similar clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiographic findings, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. The correct treatment for each of these clinical entities is different and can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from these diseases. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology, approach to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment modalities for these four disease processes.
