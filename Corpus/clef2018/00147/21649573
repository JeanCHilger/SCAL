Mucocele of the cystic duct remnant after orthotopic liver transplant: a problem revisited. Mucocele of the cystic duct remnant is an uncommon hepatobiliary complication of a liver transplant. Current practice usually involves either excising the cystic duct, or incorporating the distal end of the transected cystic duct into the suture line of the biliary anastomosis to ensure drainage. We report a patient who developed cystic duct remnant mucocele after the latter approach was adopted. We believe that this is likely related to delayed anastomotic stricturing, which prevented draining from the remnant cystic duct. We also discuss the incidence, pathology, investigations, and treatment of this condition.
