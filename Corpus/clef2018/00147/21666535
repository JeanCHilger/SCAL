Association between high cytokine levels with white matter injury in preterm infants with sepsis. To examine the association among interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-10, and interleukin-1β and white matter injury in very-low-birth-weight infants with clinical sepsis and to help predict infants at risk for development of white matter injury.A prospective cohort study was carried out.Neonatal intensive care unit.Very low birth weight infants with clinical early-onset sepsis. Exclusion criteria were death before 14 days, major malformations, and congenital infections.Ultrasound brain scans were carried out on the third day and weekly until the sixth week of life or discharge and confirmed by a magnetic resonance image performed in the first year. Plasma was assayed for interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-10, and interleukin-1β in the same sample collected for sepsis work-up. Mann-Whitney, chi-square, t tests, multiple regression, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were applied.From July 2005 to October 2007 we studied 84 very-low-birth-weight infants, 27 (32%) with white matter injury, and 57 (68%) control subjects (with no white matter injury). Proven early-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis were high risk for white matter injury after adjustment for gestational age and birth weight (relative risk, 3.04 1.93-4.80 and relative risk, 2.2Very-low-birth-weight infants with proven early-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and high plasma levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α are at high risk for white matter injury.
