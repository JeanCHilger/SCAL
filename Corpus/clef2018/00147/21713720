Acute squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder: a rare cause of acute cholecystitis. A 54-year-old woman with signs of acute cholecystitis but no other relevant diseases was admitted into our hospital.The abdominal ultrasonography showed an acute cholecystitis with possibly an abscess in the bed of the gallbladder (DD gall bladder cancer). Therefore a laparoscopy was performed which revealed a tumorous infiltrating the adjacent organs. A R1 resection was performed.The histological examination revealed the rare finding of a squamous cell cancer of the gall bladder. On advice of our tumor board, chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-flourouracil was initiated. Tumor-associated bile duct stenosis required endoscopic stent implantation. Despite the poor prognosis the disease remained stable 18 month later, with a Karnofsky index of 100â€Š%.Squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder is rare and requires a good interdisciplinary management. In an individual setting it is possible to increase survival with interdisciplinary treatment and palliative chemotherapy.
