Preoperative assessment of longitudinal extent of bile duct cancers using MDCT with multiplanar reconstruction and minimum intensity projections: comparison with MR cholangiography. To compare the performance of MDCT, including multiplanar reformation (MPR) and minimum intensity projection (MinIP) images, with that of transaxial MDCT with MR cholangiography (MRC) in the preoperative evaluation of the longitudinal extent of bile duct cancer.Twenty-seven patients with surgically proven bile duct cancer, who had undergone preoperative multiphasic MDCT and MRC, were included. Two radiologists evaluated the MDCT set with MPR and MinIP images and the image set of transaxial MDCT with MRC, regarding the longitudinal extent of bile duct cancer. The results were compared with the surgical and pathology findings.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the MDCT set with MPR and MinIP images and the image set of transaxial MDCT with MRC for predicting the longitudinal extent of bile duct cancer, were 0.938, 0.923 and 0.839, 0.836 for both reviewers. The differences were not statistically significant for either image set or either reviewer. The sensitivity and specificity of the MDCT image set for detecting tumor involvement of the biliary second confluences or intrapancreatic segment were similar for both reviewers to those of transaxial MDCT with MRC.MDCT with MPR and MinIP images showed comparable diagnostic performance to that of transaxial MDCT with MRC for predicting the longitudinal extent of bile duct cancer.
