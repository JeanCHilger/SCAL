Robot-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer: initial experience. This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of robotic surgery in gastrectomy for gastric cancer.Between April and October 2009, 12 patients who were diagnosed with stage I gastric cancer underwent robot-assisted distal gastrectomy (RADG) using the da Vinci System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). The clinical and pathological characteristics of the patients and surgical outcome were analyzed.All procedures were completed successfully, with no laparoscopic or open conversion. The mean operating time was 253 minutes (range 170-365), and the mean blood loss was 135 mL (range 30-500). The resection margin was negative in all specimens, and a mean of 46 (range 21-115) lymph nodes was retrieved. The mean time to resume a soft diet and hospital stay was 4.6 and 6.6 days, respectively. Acute pancreatitis occurred in 1 patient and resolved with conservative management.In our initial experience, RADG was feasible, enabling a fast patient recovery and good operative outcome.
