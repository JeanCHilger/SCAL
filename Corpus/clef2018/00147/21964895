Gangliocytic paraganglioma--a rare differential diagnosis of a submucosal duodenal tumor. We report on the case of a 36-year-old male patient who was found to have a submucosal duodenal tumour during the diagnostic work-up of gastrointestinal bleeding. After exclusion of other tumour manifestations complete endoscopic resection was performed. Histologically a gangliocytic paraganglioma was diagnosed, a very rare type of a duodenal neuroendocrine tumour. This case report discusses the epidemiology, diagnostic work-up and therapeutic options for this rare tumour type.
