Small colorectal cystic metastases to the liver: still a diagnostic dilemma? A report of a case and a review of the literature. Although cystic colorectal metastases are rare (1.8%), they are still a crucial challenge for the surgeon especially in terms of detection and differential diagnosis. Since prognosis after resection is very good (40% 5-year survival), early diagnosis is essential.A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a suspected diagnosis of multiple small liver metastases. He had previously undergone left sided-cholectomy followed by chemotherapy for colonic carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple small (<15 mm) intrahepatic biliary cysts, suspected for cystic colorectal liver metastases.The diagnosis of cystic colorectal liver metastases is quite difficult and it is mostly based on the last-generation magnetic resonance (MR). In spite of this, we must often rely on histological results for a definitive diagnosis.
