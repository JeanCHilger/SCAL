Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma with lymph node metastasis and an 8-year follow-up:  a case report. Gangliocytic paraganglioma (GP) is a rare tumor, usually located in the second part of the duodenum. On pathological examination, GP is characterized by the association of the histological features of paragangliomas, ganglioneuromas, and carcinoid tumors. Classical clinical presentations are upper gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult because of the submucosal site of the tumor, with usually negative mucosal biopsies. Endoscopic ultrasound helps establish the diagnosis and allows lymph node staging, which will guide the choice of the treatment. If GPs usually follow a benign course, metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes treated by surgical resection alone has been reported. We report a case of GP with lymph node metastases treated by duodenopancreatectomy with long-term disease-free survival, suggesting that surgical resection is a reasonable approach for metastatic GPs.
