Transduodenal EUS-guided FNA of the right adrenal gland to diagnose lung cancer where percutaneous approach was not possible. Although endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-guided FNA) of the left adrenal gland is safe and accurate compared to the percutaneous approach, there are no reports to our knowledge about EUS-guided FNA of the right adrenal gland performed in Lebanon and the Middle East. We report the case of a 64-year-old male who presented with a swollen right calf and right flank pain and was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis with a right calf deep venous thrombosis. A computerized tomography of the chest and abdomen revealed a round solid mass of the right adrenal gland, a right upper lobe mass and centrilobular emphysema of both lungs. Percutaneous biopsy of the right adrenal gland was declined as the patient was quoted a high risk of bleeding. EUS-guided FNA of the right adrenal was performed via the transduodenal approach confirming the final diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer. This case shows that the right adrenal gland can be sampled with EUS-FNA via the duodenal approach to diagnose metastatic lung cancer, especially when the percutaneous approach is not feasible.
