Diagnosis and surgical treatment of mucin-producing bile duct tumors. To summarize the experience of diagnosis and surgical treatment of mucin-producing bile duct tumors (MPBTs).A retrospective analysis was undertaken to determine the radiography characteristics and results of surgical treatment of MPBTs over the past 9 years. Only eight patients underwent such treatment. The detailed data of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis were carefully studied.Intermittent jaundice was the most frequently clinical manifestation of MPBTs, with unique characteristics on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MPCP) when compared with gallbladder carcino-ma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma and distal bile duct can-cer. All the 8 patients with MPBTs received appropriate surgical procedure and were cured.Appropriate diagnosis and curative hepatectomy for MPBTs made it possible to achieve long-term survival.
