Is preoperative subclassification of type I choledochal cyst necessary? The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of postoperative biliary stricture and its risk factors in patients undergoing surgery for type I choledochal cyst.A total of 35 patients with type I choledochal cyst underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy between August 2004 and August 2011. Their medical records and radiologic images (including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, pancreatobiliary computed tomography, or ultrasound) were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the frequency of postoperative biliary stricture and its risk factors.Postoperative biliary stricture was found in 10 (28.6%) of 35 patients. It developed more frequently in patients with type Ia choledochal cyst (53.8%, 7 of 13 patients) than in patients with type Ic choledochal cyst (13.6%, 3 of 22 patients), which was statistically significant (p = 0.011). There were no significant associations between other factors and postoperative biliary stricture.Type Ia is a risk factor of postoperative anastomotic stricture. Therefore, preoperative radiologic subclassification of type Ia and Ic may be useful in predicting postoperative outcomes of choledochal cysts.
