Solitary hepatic granuloma preoperatively diagnosed as intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma: report of a case. We herein report the case of a 67-year-old female with a solitary hepatic granuloma preoperatively diagnosed as a mass-forming type of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging using gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid as a contrast medium is expected to be useful for making a differential diagnosis between hepatic granuloma and other hypovascular liver tumors, such as the mass-forming type of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver tumors.
