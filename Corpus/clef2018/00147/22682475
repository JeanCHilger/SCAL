Pyogenic spondylodiscitis after transoral surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. We report the case of a patient with pyogenic spondylodiscitis after transoral surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. The patient was a 66-year-old man with a history of hepatic cell carcinoma, alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic pancreatitis. The tumor was resected via a transoral approach with concurrent bilateral elective neck dissections. Although the initial postoperative course was uneventful, the patient experienced severe cervical pain because of which he revisited the hospital. The patient was diagnosed with pyogenic spondylodiscitis, according to the results of magnetic resonance imaging. Continuous treatment with parenteral antibiotics and a cervical brace was required for 2 months before all his symptoms and signs diminished. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pyogenic spondylodiscitis as a complication of transoral resection for head and neck cancer.
