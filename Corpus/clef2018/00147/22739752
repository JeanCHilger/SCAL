Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm of the extrahepatic bile duct: report of a case. We report a rare case of an intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm (IOPN) of the extrahepatic bile duct. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of right-sided back pain. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a papillary lesion, 3 cm in diameter, in the middle bile duct, invaginating into the cystic duct. We made a provisional diagnosis of middle bile duct cancer and performed substomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. Macroscopically, the middle bile duct contained a two-humped papillary tumor, one tip of which invaginated into the cystic duct. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of cuboidal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm resembling that of oncocytes and a fine fibrovascular core. The tumor cells were stained strongly with antimitochondria antibody. Based on these findings, the tumor was diagnosed histologically as IOPN of the extrahepatic bile duct. The patient died of prostate cancer 51 months after surgery, but without evidence of recurrence of the IOPN.
