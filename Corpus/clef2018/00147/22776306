Laparoscopy-assisted spleen-preserving pancreatic resection for epidermoid cyst in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. A rare case of an epidermoid cyst originating in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen in a 50-year-old Japanese female is reported. A hypoechoic cystic tumor was detected incidentally by abdominal ultrasonography. It appeared to be a single cyst in the pancreatic tail with a contrasted mass lesion beside it. Laparoscopy-assisted spleen-preserving pancreatic tail resection was performed. Microscopic examination revealed that the cyst was surrounded by fibrous tissue and a thin layer of splenic tissue, adjacent to normal pancreatic parenchyma. The inner surface of the cyst was lined with non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. The diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst occurring in an intrapancreatic accessory spleen was confirmed. Laparoscopy-assisted spleen-preserving pancreatic resection is a safe and effective procedure for benign or low-grade malignant cystic diseases in the pancreas.
