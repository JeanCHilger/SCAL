Impact of magnetic resonance in the preoperative staging and the surgical planning for treating small bowel neoplasms. The role of MR enteroclysis/enterography (MRE) in the diagnosis of small bowel (SB) tumor has not been fully evaluated. The aims of this study were to assess the capability of MRE correctly identifying the site, stage and histology of such neoplasms.MR enteroclysis/enterography was employed in consecutive patients suspected of having an SB tumor following negative upper and lower endoscopies. The SB was subdivided into proximal jejunum, middle SB and distal ileum. The histological examination (HE) of the surgical specimen was the reference standard.One hundred and fifty-eight patients were examined. Thirty-one out of 32 (96.9 %) SB detected by HE were correctly identified by MRE. The concordance rate between MRE and HE was 100 % for localization, and 87.1, 80.6 and 96.8 % for T, N and M stages, respectively. The concordance rate was 62.2 % for histological diagnosis.The high concordance rates between MRE and HE for the localization of SB tumors and for their staging have a significant impact upon surgical planning, particularly if laparoscopy is being considered. A preoperative histological diagnosis is not sufficiently reliable.
