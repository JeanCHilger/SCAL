Hepatic hydatid cyst: a non-surgical approach. Echinococcosis/hydatidosis is common in societies where agriculture and livestock are frequent, and represents a public health problem. The therapeutic management depends on the cyst's characteristics, the patient, and surgical contraindications. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment of complicated hepatic hydatid disease. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up tool. The authors report a case of a 56 years old patient who was diagnosed with a hepatic hydatid cyst in the IVa/VIII segments, describe the therapeutic options and 50 months of disease-free follow-up.
