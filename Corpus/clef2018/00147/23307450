Gallbladder agenesis with choledochal cyst--a rare association: a case report and review of possible genetic or embryological links. Gallbladder agenesis is a rare congenital anomaly. Choledochal cysts are uncommon. The combination of both these entities in a 56-year-old woman is reported. A previously fit and well woman, presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of abdominal pain. Preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings confirmed gallbladder agenesis and a type I choledochal cyst. There were no other anomalies. She underwent a resection of the choledochal cyst and reconstruction by hepaticojejunostomy.
