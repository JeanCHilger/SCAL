Intussusception: as the cause of mechanical bowel obstruction in adults. Intussusception in adults is rarely seen and causes misdiagnosis due to its appearance with various clinical findings. The cause of intussusception in adults is frequently organic lesions. In this study, the underlying etiologic factors, diagnostic methods and alternative methods of treatment are discussed in the light of the literature.In this study, a retrospective evaluation was performed on 47 cases with the diagnoses of intussusception, who were operated on for bowel obstruction between 1990-2011 in Department of Surgery of Necmettin Erbakan University Meram Medical Faculty. Data related to presentation, diagnosis, treatment and pathology were analyzed.Twenty-four of the patients (51%) were female, and 23 were male (49%). Mean age (year) was 49 (range: 23-78) in female group, and 50 (range: 17-72) in male group. All patients presented mechanical bowel obstruction findings and underwent operation. Intussusception was caused by benign and malignant tumors in 38 patients, and other reasons in 3 cases. No reason could be determined in the other 6 cases. Only small intestine resection was applied in 29 cases, and large intestine resection was also applied in 17 cases. Reduction and fixation surgery was performed in one patient. No postoperative mortality was observed.Adult intussusception remains a rare cause of abdominal pain. Diagnosis of intussusception in adults is still difficult. Main treatment was surgical in most cases.
