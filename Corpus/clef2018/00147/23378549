Stump stone 6 years after cholecystectomy: a possibility. Calculi in the cystic duct remnant are one of the causes of postcholecystectomy syndrome. A 36-year-old woman presented thrice to the casualty department with right upper quadrant pain at an interval of 2 months every time. Ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen was normal except for echoes in the gallbladder region may be clips. She was treated conservatively and discharged the first two times. The second time, the MR cholangiopancreatography was normal. She had undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy with stent in situ outside elsewhere before presenting to us for the third time, which was removed after 6-weeks. The third time, she was taken up for laparoscopic stump exploration, which revealed a stone, which was the cause of her pain. To conclude, stump stone can be a possibility of post cholecystectomy syndrome even after 6 years, and surgeons should be aware of it.
