Surveillance MR imaging is superior to serum tumor markers for detecting early tumor recurrence in patients with appendiceal cancer treated with surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC. The purpose of this study was to determine if MRI surveillance is better than serum tumor makers in detecting early recurrence in patients with mucinous appendiceal neoplasm.A total of 50 patients with appendiceal neoplasm (DPAM 11, PMCA 39) underwent abdominal and pelvic MRI prior to surgical cytoreduction and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Patients then entered follow-up surveillance with serial MRI every 6 months and serial laboratory studies including CA 125, CEA, and CA19-9. Written reports for surveillance MRI exams were reviewed for tumor recurrence and compared with results of serial laboratory tests. Proof of tumor recurrence was by a consensus of surgery and histopathology, as well as clinical and imaging findings on serial examinations.During surveillance tumor recurrence was documented in 30 patients (60 %) with median time to recurrence of 13 months (range 3-56 months). MRI detected recurrent tumor in 28 patients, including 11 patients with normal laboratory values (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.95, accuracy 0.94, PPV 0.97, and NPV 0.90). Serial laboratory values showed tumor recurrence in 14 patients (sensitivity 0.48, specificity 1.00, accuracy 0.69, PPV 1.0, and NPV 0.57). Median survival was 50 months for 11 patients with earlier MRI detection of recurrence vs 33 months for the other 19 patients with recurrence.Following cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC MRI detects tumor recurrence earlier and with greater accuracy than serial tumor markers alone.
