Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts: description of MRI and added value of diffusion-weighted MRI. To evaluate MRI features of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) and to determine added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI).Twenty-three patients with surgically confirmed invasive (n = 12) and non-invasive (n = 11) IPNB, who underwent preoperative liver MRI were included. Two observers performed consensus review of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and combined gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI including DWI separately, with regard to conspicuity of intraductal tumor using five point scales, extent of tumors, and the presence of invasiveness.On MRI, there was no significant difference in the conspicuity of intraductal tumors between gadoxetic acid MRI (mean, 4.35) and combined MRI (mean, 4.65) (P = 0.09). However, addition of DWI led seven cases revealed excellent conspicuity as compared with good or moderate conspicuity on gadoxetic acid MRI. With regard to invasiveness, 11 cases (48 %) and 17 (74 %) were correctly diagnosed with gadoxetic acid MRI and combined MRI, respectively (P = 0.06). In invasive tumors, both of the two image sets did not help assess accurate extent of the tumor.The addition of DWI to gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI has a potency to improve conspicuity for intraductal tumors of IPNB and is helpful in determining tumor invasiveness, but not tumor extent.
