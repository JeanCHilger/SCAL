Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: clinical features and diagnosis. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare, usually sporadic, and mainly located in the stomach or small bowel. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the main presenting symptom. GIST are discovered incidentally in 20% of cases. Endoscopy, and endosonography when possible, are the diagnostic procedures of choice for small GIST, while CT is used for larger tumors. Pathologic diagnosis can be obtained by fine-needle aspiration, but its indications must be discussed on an individual basis.
