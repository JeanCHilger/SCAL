Obstructive jaundice and melena caused by hemocholecyst: a case report. A hemocholecyst (HC) is a clot-filled gallbladder caused by bleeding into its lumen. Obstructive jaundice caused by the compression of HC to the hilar biliary tract is likely to be misdiagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma and is extremely rare. We herein report a case of obstructive jaundice and melena caused by HC. A 57-year-old male patient presented with right upper quadrant pain associated with icteric sclera and melena was suspiciously diagnosed as having malignant cholangiocarcinmoa by abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Laparotomy found a hematoma in the gallbladder. The hematoma spread to the left hepatic lobe forming an exogenous mass which compressed the hilar biliary tract. Radical cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration with T-tube drainage were performed. Histopathological examination revealed massive necrosis of the gallbladder mucosa with inflammatory cells infiltration as well as intraluminal hematoma formation. One month after operation, a T-tube cholangiography revealed a normal biliary tree. We suggest that HC should be considered in patients with obstructive jaundice and melena after common causes are ruled out.
