Does an isolated benign choledochal stricture hide a PSC? Strictures of the extra-hepatic biliary tree are rare in children and have a benign non-traumatic inflammatory origin or are related to idiopathic fibrosing pancreatitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) can manifest as multiple biliary strictures or as a single dominant stricture. We describe the presentation, treatment, and outcome of six cases of isolated benign choledochal stricture (IBCS).All patients underwent magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC). Five patients underwent diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP, and 4 patients underwent intra-choledochal mini-probe EUS and biopsy. Colonoscopy was performed in suspected ulcerative colitis (UC).We report 6 patients (mean age at diagnosis: four males, 12.1 years two females, 14.2 years) with IBCS. Clinical onset included 3 cases of acute biliary pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice, one obstructive jaundice, one cholestasis, and one pancreatitis. At diagnosis, MRC confirmed IBCS in all patients. Biliary sphincterotomy, stricture dilation, and stenting were performed in 4 patients. One child underwent hepaticojejunostomy for a type I choledocal cyst. During follow-up (mean: 21 monthsIBCS can be successfully treated by therapeutic ERCP. The occurrence of UC could suggest that IBCS is a form of PSC.
