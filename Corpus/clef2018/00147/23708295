The future of capsule endoscopy. Small-bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) was introduced 11 years ago by Given Imaging and is becoming the gold standard for small-bowel examination. This major step in the field of digestive medicine has opened the possibility of promising non-invasive explorations of the esophagus, stomach, and colon. SBCE can be used to overcome the inherent limitations of enteroscopy, especially in the West, where the capsule has been available since 2001. Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with normal findings on upper and lower endoscopy remains the most important indication, and suspected Crohn's disease is also a well-accepted indication. Findings from a capsule investigation may warrant therapeutic endoscopy, but in many cases, SBCE avoids this useful but time-consuming endoscopic procedure. The use of a colon capsule for colorectal cancer screening when traditional colonoscopy is contraindicated or impossible is undergoing clinical trials. Early results seem promising, but control of colonic motility is still cumbersome, and patient preparation remains the most important drawback. We performed the first clinical trial in humans of a magnetically guided gastric capsule that offers the possibility of investigation with a capsule that can be controlled spatially. To date, we have carried out procedures in more than 400 patients and volunteers, with impressive results compared with high-definition gastroscopy. Even though endoscopy remains the most important tool in the GI field, capsules offer promising new possibilities.
