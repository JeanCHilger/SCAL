Biliary-enteric anastomoses: spectrum of findings on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR cholangiography. Biliary-enteric anastomosis is a common surgical procedure performed for the management of a variety of benign and malignant diseases. This procedure presents a high risk of developing complications such as anastomotic leak, hemorrhage, cholangitis, stones, stricture formation, that have been reported as ranging from 3 % to 43 %. Because the endoscopic approach of the biliary tract is generally precluded in this setting, there is clearly a role for a non-invasive imaging technique to follow up these patients and to detect the possible complications. T2-weighted MR cholangiography has been shown to be effective in the evaluation of patients with biliary-enteric anastomosis. Some of these patients may have mild duct dilatation in spite of a patent anastomosis, and stenosis should be considered only when duct dilatation is associated with narrowing of the anastomotic site. T2-weighted MRC depicts the site of biliary-enteric anastomosis, the cause of obstruction, and the status of the biliary ducts upstream. However, the disadvantages of conventional MRC are that it lacks functional information and so, differentiation between obstructive and non-obstructive dilatation of the bile ducts is often extremely difficult. T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MR cholangiography using Gd-EOB-DTPA is a recently emerging technique that is useful for delineating the anatomy of biliary-enteric anastomoses and detecting complications such as strictures, intraductal stones, and biliary leaks besides, this technique can provide functional information that are extremely promising in the grading of biliary obstruction. We present the spectrum of findings of biliary-enteric anastomoses on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR cholangiography focusing on the main clinical applications.
