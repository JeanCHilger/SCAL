18F-FDG PET/CT in staging and restaging cholangiocarcinoma. The prognosis for hepatobiliary malignancies is dismal. Surgery remains the primary curative option. The positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) provides simultaneous metabolic and anatomic information on tumors in the same imaging session. The role of PET/CT in detecting hepatobiliary malignancies has not yet been established. The purpose of this review was to examine the literature on the use of PET/CT in cholangiocarcinomas, also in order to improve the preoperative staging and the restaging, for a proper oncology management of patients.
