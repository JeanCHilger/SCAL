Resection of a giant hepatic adenoma in an eight-year-old girl. Hepatic adenomas are benign tumors typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age, however, these tumors occur in the pediatric population although rare. We present the case of a giant hepatic adenoma in an 8-year-old female without established risk factors with progressive abdominal pain, and po intolerance, biliary obstruction, anemia, and fever. Right trisegmentectomy afforded extirpation of the 16 × 14.5 × 8.5 cm mass. The postoperative course was complicated by transient encephalopathy and a bile leak which resolved with appropriate care. The patient is well over 1 year from resection. She demonstrates age appropriate mental and physical function without disease recurrence or complication.
