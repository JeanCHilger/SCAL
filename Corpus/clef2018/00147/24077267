Skull metastasis from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of 3 cases and review of the literature. Skull metastases occur in patients with various malignancies however, those resulting from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have been rarely reported. In our hospital, 324 patients were diagnosed with metastatic brain or skull tumors from June 1969 to June 2011, but only 3 of them (0.9%) developed skull metastases from ICC. We report the case of 3 patients with skull metastases from ICC. A combination of computed tomography (CT), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and methionine-PET were used for imaging. Sites of tumors were the lateral left orbit and right parietal bone in case 1, the left parietal bone, left temporal bone, and lateral left orbit in case 2, the right petrous bone, right occipital bone, and upper cervical vertebra in case 3. The metastases were confirmed to have originated from ICC by biopsy in two of the cases and diagnosed by MRI and FDG-PET in case 2. Radiosurgery and radiotherapy had positive effects on symptom improvement and cosmetic problems.
