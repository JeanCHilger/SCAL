How can an endosonographer assess for diagnostic sufficiency and options for handling the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration specimen and ancillary studies. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has become well established as a minimally invasive technique in diagnosing and staging various gastrointestinal, pancreaticobiliary, and retroperitoneal malignancies. The diagnostic accuracy of this procedure is significantly enhanced by the presence of on-site cytopathology. However, in many EUS centers, cytopathology is not readily available for on-site evaluation. This article is intended to assist the independent endosonographer in the assessment of diagnostic sufficiency and in specimen handling.
