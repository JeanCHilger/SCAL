Management of biliary cystic tumors: a multi-institutional analysis of a rare liver tumor. To characterize clinical and radiological features associated with biliary cystic tumors (BCTs) of the liver, and to define recurrence-free and overall survival.Biliary cystadenoma (BCA) and biliary cystadenocarcinoma (BCAC) are rare tumors that arise in the liver.Between 1984 and 2013, 248 patients who underwent surgical resection of BCA or BCAC were identified. Clinical and outcome data were analyzed.Median total bilirubin, CA19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were 0.6 mg/dL, 15.0 U/mL, and 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. Preoperative imaging included computed tomography only (62.5%), magnetic resonance imaging only (6.9%), or CT + MRI (18.5%). Features on cross-sectional imaging included multiloculation (56.9%), mural nodularity (16.5%), and biliary ductal dilatation (17.7%). The presence of these factors did not reliably predict BCAC versus BCA (sensitivity, 81% specificity, 21%). Median biliary cyst size was 10.0 cm (interquartile range, 7-13 cm). Operative interventions included unroofing/partial excision of the lesion (14.1%), less than hemihepatectomy (48.8%), or hemi-/extended hepatectomy (36.3%). On pathology most lesions were BCA (89.1%), whereas 27 (10.9%) were BCAC. At last follow-up, there were 46 (18.3%) recurrencesAmong patients undergoing surgery for BCT, associated malignancy was uncommon (10%) and no preoperative findings reliably predicted underlying BCAC. After excision of BCA, long-term outcomes were good however, patients with BCAC had a worse long-term prognosis.
