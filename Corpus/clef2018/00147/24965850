Performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT as a postoperative surveillance imaging modality for asymptomatic advanced gastric cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of postoperative fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a surveillance modality for advanced gastric cancer patients who were asymptomatic and negative by conventional follow-up.We retrospectively collected 46 advanced gastric cancer patients who received approximately 1-year-postoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT surveillance following curative resection (mean age 60.6 Â± 11.5 years). (18)F-FDG PET/CT was interpreted by nuclear medicine physicians who were blind to the clinical information. Final confirmation was determined by clinical follow-up using tumor markers, conventional CT scan, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and with/without subsequent histopathologic diagnosis.Four patients developed recurrence (8.7 % 1 local and 3 distant recurrences). For local recurrence, (18)F-FDG PET/CT found four hypermetabolic lesions and one was local recurrence. For distant recurrence, seven hypermetabolic lesions were found in six patients and true-positive was three lesions. False-positive cases were mainly turned out to be physiologic small bowel uptake. Regardless of the recurrence site, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET/CT were 100 % (4/4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 39.6-100 %), 88.1 % (37/42, 95 % CI 73.6-95.5 %), 44.4 % (4/9, 95 % CI 15.3-77.3 %) and 100 % (37/37, 95 % CI 88.3-100 %), respectively in the patient-based analysis.Our study showed good specificity of postoperative surveillance (18)F-FDG PET/CT for detecting recurrence. Careful caution should be made for interpreting some false-positive hypermetabolic lesions in postoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT, especially at the local anastomosis site.
