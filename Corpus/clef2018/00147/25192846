Adult intussusception: a retrospective review. Intussusception is common in children but rare in adults. The goal of this study was to review retrospectively the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of intussusception in adults.From 1997 to 2013, we experienced 44 patients of intussusception in patients older than 18 years. The patients were divided into enteric, ileocolic, ileocecal, and colocolonic (rectal) types. The diagnosis and treatment of these patients were reviewed.Of the 44 patients of adult intussusception, 42 were diagnosed with abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography. There were 12 patients of enteric intussusception, six patients of ileocolic intussusception, 16 patients of ileocecal type intussusception, and 10 patients of colonic (rectal) intussusception. Among them, 77.3 % were associated with a tumor. Among 12 patients of enteric intussusception, three were associated with a metastatic intestinal tumor, and one was associated with a benign tumor. Among six patients of ileocolic intussusception, two patients were associated with malignant disease. Also, 93.8 % of ileocecal intussusceptions were associated with tumors, 80.0 % of which were malignant. Similarly, 90.0 % of colonic intussusceptions were associated with malignant tumors. Intussusception was reduced before or during surgery in 28 patients. Surgery was performed in 41 patients, and laparoscopy-assisted surgery was performed for ab underlying disease in 12 patients.Preoperative diagnoses were possible in almost all patients. Reduction greatly benefited any surgery required and the extent of the resection regardless of the underlying disease and surgical site.
