Mirizzi's syndrome. Six cases of Mirizzi syndrome are reported. The syndrome consists of a special anatomical variant of the cystic duct, which has a low opening but runs side-by-side with the common bile duct, associated with entrapment of a gallstone in the cystic duct or the neck of the gallbladder, partial or total obstruction of the hepatic duct by the stone and by inflammatory lesions, and recurrent cholangitis. Clinical signs are non-specific and suggest at first sight an obstructive jaundice. Pre-operative morphological examination seldom provide a diagnosis before surgery. In the most typical cases ultrasonography shows dilatation of the upper biliary tract with narrowing of the hepatic duct below the dilatation, due to a stone located outside the common bile duct. Opacification of the biliary tract by endoscopic retrograde catheterization of the papilla duodeni or by transparietohepatic puncture give suggestive images (non-opacification of the cystic duct, narrowing of the hepatic duct opposite the extrinsic compression, with overlying dilatation), but these images are not specific. The per-operative diagnosis is difficult owing to the inflammatory lesions, and a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma may be envisaged. Cholecystectomy with recanalization of the cystic duct suppresses the extrinsic compression and helps the inflammatory lesions to regress. However, opening and draining the common bile duct is often necessary.
