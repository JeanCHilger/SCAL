Bleeding gastric metastases from cutaneous melanoma. 7% of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) involvements with metastatic cutaneous melanoma concerns the stomach. The aim of the study was to describe a rare case of the cutaneous melanoma metastazing to the stomach.. Bearing in mind the rarity of such cases, we present our experiences based on the history of 42-year-old woman, who underwent surgical excision of skin tumour located on the trunk.Histopathological examination of the skin tumor led to the diagnosis of melanoma (Clark IV, Breslow 5mm) with ulceration and a number of mitoses 40/10 HPF. PET-CT demonstrated multiple organ dissemination. Patient was admitted to the hospital due to severe, symptomatic anaemia. RBC and FFP transfusions were necessary. Gastroscopy revealed multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers and histopathology confirmed metastatic melanoma. Attempts to achieve endoscopic hemostasis were ineffective due to the extent of lesions.In the presence of any alarming GIT symptoms or unclear anaemia, any physician treating patient with a history of melanoma should exclude metastatic tumour. Endoscopy may be useful both for the diagnosis and local treatment of gastric metastases and should be routinely and cautiously conducted.
