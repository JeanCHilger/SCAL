Salvage gastrectomy and radiotherapy for R-CHOP-refractory gastric malignant lymphoma. A man in his seventies presented with a stomach abnormality that was revealed upon physical examination.Following workup, he was diagnosed with gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)StageII1 (Lugano staging system for gastrointestinal lymphoma) with low risk as defined by the International Prognostic Index criteria.The entire stomach showed an intense, abnormal FDG uptake by FDG-PET evaluation.He was treated with rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP).The patient's body weight decreased by 12 kg during the treatment period.Post -treatment evaluation by gastroscopy and FDG-PET following 5 courses of R-CHOP therapy revealed a residual lesion in the stomach.Total gastrectomy was performed for R-CHOP refractory gastric DLBCL.The pathological diagnosis was DLBCL, and the pathological therapeutic effect was Grade 1a.Lymphoma cells were detected at the duodenal margin of the resected specimen, and an FDG-PET scan showed abnormal FDG uptake in the duodenal stump necessitating salvage chemotherapy (DeVIC therapy)and radiotherapy.The patient's body weight increased by 5 kg after gastrectomy and there were no signs of relapse for 14 months after the operation.Salvage therapy including gastrectomy may be effective for chemotherapy-resistant gastric DLBCL.
