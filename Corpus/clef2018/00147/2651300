Radiologic approach to choledochal cysts. Choledochal cysts, being uncommon and having a nonspecific presentation, require a high index of suspicion for their diagnosis. In this series of 11 patients, the correct diagnosis was established in all using a combination of real-time ultrasound (US) scanning (9 positive) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP 10 positive). Real-time US is suitable as the initial imaging modality and ERCP is complementary.
