A case of giant leiomyosarcoma that grew exogastrically in a year and four months. Presented is a 69-year-old female who had gigantic leiomyosarcoma showing a pedunculated and exogastric growth. Though the patient had been diagnosed as having a gastric submucosal tumor (SMT) on being given an upper GI series and an endoscopical examination, she did not enter hospital until a year and 4 months later. On admission, a large SMT was suspected after an upper GI series and an endoscopic examination. Computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and angiography revealed a gastric SMT that had grown exogastrically. Subsequently, this tumor was resected with the gastric wall. Histologically, tumor was determined as being a leiomyosarcoma. CT and US were found useful in demonstrating the SMT with its exogastric growth.
