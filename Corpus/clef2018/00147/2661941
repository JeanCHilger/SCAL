Severe cholestasis in congenital choledochus cyst. A nineteen year old female was admitted to the hospital presenting with sudden onset of severe jaundice and the biochemical constellation of cholestasis. The sonographically and radiologically diagnosis of choledochal cyst was confirmed intraoperatively. The choledochal cyst of type IVa reached from the papilla until the hepatocholedochal junction. A lateroterminal choledochojejunostomy with a Y-Roux-anastomosis was constructed. The patient became symptom-free after the operation.
