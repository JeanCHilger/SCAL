Mesenteric fibromatosis in Gardner's syndrome. Gardner's syndrome, first described in the 1950s, is a composite clinical entity characterized by intestinal polyps, osteomas, fibromas, and epidermal cysts. A case of mesenteric fibromatosis in Gardner's syndrome is presented. Whereas most of the literature on this subject stresses the significance of the intestinal polyposis and its premalignant potential, in this paper the serious significance of the intraabdominal fibromas is stressed. This case demonstrates an unusual complication of erosion of this tumor into the small intestine, resulting in multiple intestinal fistulae with abscess formation. Surgical management of this problem necessitated resection of the fibroma and involved small intestine. A review of the literature is presented.
