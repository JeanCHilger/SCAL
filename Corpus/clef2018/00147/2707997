Obstructive jaundice secondary to intra-biliary rupture of hepatic hydatid cyst. Of 58 cases of obstructive jaundice treated in a three year period, six were due to the intrabiliary rupture of hydatid cysts of the liver. Eosinophilia of more than 10%, raised alkaline phosphatase, positive indirect haemagglutination test were noted in all six cases. Plain X-ray of the abdomen, ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography and CT scan were useful modalities for definite pre-operative diagnosis. All patients had operative treatment which consisted of cyst drainage, partial pericystectomy, curettage of the remaining cavity which was stitched with tube drain, cholecystectomies, choledochotomy and T-tube drainage. They all recovered satisfactorily and without complications in a follow-up period of two years.
