Giant Brunneroma of the duodenum. A case of giant hyperplasia of Brunner's glands in the duodenum is reported. Recurrent vomiting due to stenosis of the duodenum was the leading symptom. Endoscopy, ultrasound and histological examination were employed as complementary methods to establish the diagnosis. The 5 X 7 cm large tumor was surgically excised. Brunneromas are always benign and their incidence is about 0.08% in upper GI-tract endoscopy.
