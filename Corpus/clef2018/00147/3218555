The combined supra-infratentorial pre-sigmoid sinus avenue to the petro-clival region. Surgical technique and clinical applications. Nine patients with tumours located at the petro-clival region were operated upon from June 1985 to June 1988 using a combined supra- and infratentorial approach anterior to the sigmoid sinus. Two patients had petroclival meningiomas. 4 foramen jugulare neurinomas and 3 glomus jugulare tumours. There was no mortality. Total tumour removal was accomplished in all the patients. All patients remained independent postoperatively. The surgical approach used involves a temporal craniotomy, a suboccipital craniectomy, an extensive mastoidectomy and petrous pyramid drilling without entering the bony labyrinth, the middle ear or the Fallopian canal. The dura is incised supratentorially over the posterior temporal lobe and infratentorially in front of the sigmoid sinus. The temporal lobe is retracted superiorly and the cerebellum and the sigmoid sinus medially. This approach makes use of a very short distance to the petroclival area, offers a multiangled exposure, preserves the dural sinuses, does not iatrogenically impair hearing and minimizes temporal lobe retraction. This exposure is particularly useful in large tumours.
