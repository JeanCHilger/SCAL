Multidisciplinary approach to the management of complex bony and soft tissue orbitocranial disorders. Orbital reconstructive surgery is entering a new age as progress in surgical techniques and diagnostic imaging are applied to the patient with severe acquired orbital and periorbital deformities. The authors present a series of six patients with orbitocranial neoplasms and congenital and traumatic deformities whose management involved a multidisciplinary approach. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of reformatting two-dimensional orbital scans into three-dimensional images and surgical techniques using composite flaps and periorbital microsurgical vascular anastomoses. Advancements in technology and sophisticated reconstructive surgical techniques have exciting potential. Ophthalmologists can play an important role in this expanding field since they frequently serve as the entry point or provide long-term follow-up to patients with these complex problems.
