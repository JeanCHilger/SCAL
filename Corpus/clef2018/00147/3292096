Acute intrahepatic biliary obstruction caused by hydatid cysts. Correlation between various imaging techniques. An 18-year-old male was evaluated for recurrent attacks of right abdominal pain and intermittent jaundice caused by hydatid cysts of the liver. The case illustrates the value of dynamic functional information provided by Tc-99m-HIDA imaging over noninvasive modalities that demonstrate structural changes, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and tin colloid liver imaging.
