Cystic dilatation of the choledocus. Choledochal cyst is an uncommon congenital lesion of the pancreatobiliary system. The pathologic features are cystic dilatation of the common bile duct, normal liver parenchyma, a normal intrahepatic biliary system and partial obstruction of the terminal common bile duct. More than 1400 cases have been reported in tre literature, 83 per cent of which have been diagnosed in patients below the age of 30. A triad of abdominal pain, jaundice and a palpable abdominal mass in the right hypocondrium has been classically associated with this condition. Ultrasonography and CT scanning are usually successful in demonstrating the mass. Cholangiography by the endoscopic retrograde approach may demonstrate the cystic dilatation of the common bile duct. The precise relation ship of the cyst to the biliary tree should be demonstrated by cholangiography at operation. The common type I fusiform cyst is currently treated either by excision combined with a biliary intestinal anastomosis of by anastomosis of the cyst to the intestinal tract. Treatment of the rare type II diverticulum consist of simple excision, while the rare type III choledococele is treated by transduodenal excision of the cyst wall. The current mortality rate of choledochal cyst treated by surgical decompression is 5 to 10 per cent. A case of choledochal cyst in a 58 years old woman is described. The anatomopathologic, clinic features and therapeutic lines are pointed out.
