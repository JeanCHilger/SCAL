Relapsing pancreatitis associated with duodenal wall cysts. Diagnostic approach and treatment. A case of enterogenous cysts of the duodenum in a 44-yr-old man complicated by duodenal obstruction and relapsing pancreatitis is presented. The cystic duodenal lesions were visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and for the first time by computed tomography and abdominal sonography. Thus, the diagnosis was made preoperatively. The cysts were excised successfully during a Whipple procedure. Awareness of this rare condition combined with modern x-ray, sonographic, and endoscopic techniques permit accurate preoperative diagnosis.
