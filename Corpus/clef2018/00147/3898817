Asymptomatic choledochal cyst. Choledochal cyst is a rare cystic malformation of the extrahepatic bile ducts. In all previous reports patients were investigated either for symptoms suggesting hepatobiliary disease or for laboratory data suggestive of biliary obstruction. We report a completely asymptomatic patient with normal hepatic function whose cyst was discovered serendipitously during sonogram to determine renal size.
