A case report of cystadenocarcinoma of the liver. A 65-year-old woman with cystadenocarcinoma of the liver is reported, and 21 Japanese patients cited in the previous literature are reviewed. In our case, CT and US demonstrated a huge solid tumor with calcification in the right lobe of the liver. Angiograms showed a hypovascular tumor with peripheral irregular neovascularity. ERCP showed compression of the extrahepatic bile duct. Right lobectomy of the liver was performed. The pathological diagnosis was cystadenocarcinoma of the liver. In our case, it was difficult to diagnose cystadenocarcinoma because the cystic mass had viscious contents and necrotic tissues, so CT and US showed findings of a solid tumor.
