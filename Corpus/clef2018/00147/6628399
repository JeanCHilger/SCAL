Comparative study of ultrasound and ERCP in the diagnosis of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic diseases: a prospective study based on a continuous series of 424 patients. A prospective study of the diagnostic yield of ultrasound (US) and ERCP was made on a continuous series of 424 patients. Technical failures were slightly more frequent with US (11%) than with ERCP (8%), while US proved more accurate than ERCP in the diagnosis of focal hepatic disease--94% of correct diagnosis versus 41% (n = 17). In diffuse hepatic disease (n = 63) the accuracy of both methods was the same--87% of correct diagnosis with US, 83% with ERCP. US had better performances (91%), while ERCP was more accurate in the diagnosis of common duct lithiasis or tumour (98% for ERCP, 36% for US). Although ERCP has a better diagnostic yield for pancreatic diseases (92% to 100% of correct diagnosis according to the lesions) associate complications, such as pseudo-cysts, abscess formation and extravasations are better demonstrated by US (95% of correct diagnosis versus 73%). The two methods thus prove to be complementary.
