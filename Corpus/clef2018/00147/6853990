Heterotopic pancreas mimicking carcinoma of the head of the pancreas: a rare cause of obstructive jaundice. A 61-year-old man developed obstructive jaundice and had ultrasonographic and cholangiopancreatographic findings consistent with carcinoma of the pancreas. However, pathologically the obstruction proved to be from heterotopic pancreatic tissue compressing the common bile duct. This patient and eight previously reported patients with a similar problem are the subjects of this report.
