Choledochal cysts in children: radiologic features. Choledochal cysts, although uncommon, are found most frequently in children. Radiologic studies have always played an important role in diagnosis because of the nonspecific clinical features. The abdominal roentgenogram may show in the right upper abdomen a mass, the cystic nature of which can be demonstrated by intravenous urography, hepatic angiography, sonography, and computerized tomography. Large choledochal cysts will displace the duodenal loop inferiorly and to the left, as seen on upper gastrointestinal contrast studies. Oral cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography are currently not indicated because of the poor diagnostic yield and the significant toxicity of intravenous media in children. Operative cholangiography is desired by the surgeon for demonstration of the pathologic anatomy. Real-time sonography and cholescintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m iminodiacetic acid derivative allow specific preoperative diagnosis and will eliminate the need for more invasive studies, such as arteriography, endoscopic cholangiopancreatography, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The radiologic findings in six patients are summarized.
