Spheric duodenal duplication in a 13-year-old child. Duodenal duplications are rare. Modern imaging procedures demonstrate the relation of the duplication to the duodenum and the adjacent organs. Thus the surgical procedure can be selected preoperatively. Endoscopic ultrasound is an excellent technique for visualizing a duodenal duplication. A cystic duodenal duplication measuring 6 cm in diameter was resected in a 13-year-old boy.
