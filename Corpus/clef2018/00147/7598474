Management of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is caused by gastrin-secreting tumors called gastrinomas. Patients commonly present with peptic ulcer disease and may have recurrent, multiple, and atypically located ulcers, e.g. in the jejunum. Alternatively, severe diarrhea may be the only presenting symptom. Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia Type I (MEN-I) and ZES become symptomatic at an earlier age than patients with sporadic ZES. Patients with ZES have elevated fasting serum gastrin concentrations (> 100 pg/ml) and basal gastric acid hypersecretion (> 15 mEq/h). The secretin stimulation test is the best test to distinguish ZES from other conditions resulting in elevated gastrin levels. Gastric acid hypersecretion can be controlled in virtually all patients with H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole, thus rendering total gastrectomy unnecessary. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide octreotide scanning, endoscopic ultrasound, and the selective arterial secretin injection test are the recommended imaging studies for localization of gastrinoma nevertheless, 50% of gastrinomas are not evident on preoperative imaging studies. All patients with sporadic gastrinoma who do not have unresectable metastatic disease should undergo exploratory laparotomy for potential curative resection. With increased awareness of duodenal tumors, gastrinoma can be found in 80-90% of patients. Surgery may be the most effective treatment for metastatic gastrinoma if most or all of the tumor can be resected. The management of patients with MEN-I and ZES remains controversial. Some clinicians advocate an aggressive surgical approach, whereas others have had little success in rendering patients eugastrinemic.
