Radiological diagnosis before and after laparoscopic cholecystectomies. To study the diagnostic value of radiological imaging modalities in patients undergoing endoscopic cholecystectomy.In 286 patients with endoscopic cholecystectomy ultrasound and intravenous cholecystography was performed for preoperative work-up. Postoperatively all patients were examined with ultrasound.ERCP showed a stone in the common bile duct in 12 patients with suspected stones on ultrasound, cholecystography or laboratory values. All 12 patients were treated with papillotomy. Postoperative ultrasound detected increasing fluid in the peritoneal cavity in three patients. Laparotomy of one patient showed bleeding from the cystic artery, in the second patient, injury of the right bile duct. One patient showed an accessory hepatic duct, another patient demonstrated pancreatitis.Ultrasound and intravenous cholecystography are suitable for preoperative imaging. Postoperative ultrasound is useful in detecting complications.
