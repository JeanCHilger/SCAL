To avoid complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now becoming a safe procedure for the benign cholecystic diseases. But the differences, for example in the method of access to peritoneal cavity, visual field, and tools, between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery results in different complications. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how to avoid complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A hundred consecutive patients were expected to receive an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy from April 1991 to November 1992 in our clinic. Two patients were converted to open cholecystectomy. The reasons for conversion were uncontrollable bleeding from cystic artery and common-bile duct injury. Two other patients were obliged to undergo laparotomy due to post-operative bile leakage. Arterial bleeding from abdominal wall caused by inserting trocar was experienced in one case. Improvement of the equipment and surgical technique have got rid of these complications. We think it is still necessary to do intra-operative examinations such as cholangiography or ultrasonography. The previous two cases with complication of biliary injury underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy without intraoperative examinations. We could have avoided these complications if intraoperative examinations were used. To prevent the complication of bleeding from abdominal wall, we have been carrying out a unique method. After the introduction of these procedures, we have never experienced any of these complications.
