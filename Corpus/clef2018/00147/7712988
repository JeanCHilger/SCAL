Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes. The recent introduction of convex linear array echoendoscopes equipped with a biopsy channel has made fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) under direct endosonographic guidance possible. Because the imaging and instrumentation planes overlap, the operator can visualize a biopsy needle lengthwise as it enters the sector-shaped sound field. We performed EUS-guided FNAB of lymph nodes in seven patients who met the following criteria: (1) Lymph node size over > 1 cm (2) no endoscopic or endosonographic evidence for tumor involvement of bowel wall interposed between the lymph node and the transducer
