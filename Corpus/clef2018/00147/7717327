Duodenal carcinoid tumor: endosonographic imaging and endoscopic resection. A 75-yr-old Japanese woman was shown by endoscopy to have a sessile polyp in the duodenal bulb. Endoscopic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of carcinoid tumor. The endoscopic ultrasound probe showed a 6-mm hypoechoic tumor that was confined to the submucosal layer the underlying muscularis propria layer was intact. On the basis of these findings, endoscopic resection was chosen, and the tumor was completely resected by the strip biopsy technique with prior hypertonic saline and epinephrine injection
