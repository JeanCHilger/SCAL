Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: pathologic correlation study. The authors describe the enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The MR images of eight patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who underwent MR examination within 3 weeks before partial hepatectomy were retrospectively studied. The MR images, including a dynamic study, were compared directly with pathologic and histologic findings. The peripheral region of the medullary subtype of cholangiocarcinoma, with many tumor cells, showed greater enhancement relative to liver parenchyma in the early phase. The peripheral region of the scirrhous subtype, with fewer tumor cells showed less enhancement in the early phase. In one patient, the thin rim of the medullary tumor showed less enhancement in the late phase, and this rim corresponded to the peripheral region of the medullary tumor with many tumor cells. The central region of tumors with a large amount of fibrous tissue showed prolonged enhancement in the late and delayed phases. The thin rim of liver parenchyma around the tumor showed less enhancement in the early phase and greater enhancement in the late phase this rim corresponded to congestive liver parenchyma with dilated sinusoids. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma shows various enhancement patterns, which depend on both the histologic subtype and the degree and distribution of fibrosis within the tumor.
