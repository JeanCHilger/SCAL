Agenesis of the gallbladder found at laparoscopy for cholecystectomy: an unpleasant surprise. Gallbladder agenesis is a rare condition that results from the failure of the cystic bud to develop in the 4th wk of intrauterine life. Agenesis is usually discovered at laparotomy for cholecystectomy since ultrasound examination of a patient with suggestive symptoms not visualizing the gallbladder is compatible with chronic cholecystitis (shrunken gallbladder). The surgeon must prove agenesis by thoroughly examining the most common sites for ectopic gallbladders and by performing intraoperative cholangiograms. For unexplained reasons, most of the patients become asymptomatic after the operation. We present a new case of adult agenesis of the gallbladder in a patient who was taken to laparoscopic cholecystectomy for presumptive cholelithiasis.
