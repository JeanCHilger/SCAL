Spinal intradural extramedullary enterogenous cysts. Report of two cases and review of literature. Two patients with intradural extramedullary cysts of the spinal canal are described. Both presented with slowly progressive myelo-radiculopathy caused by mucin-producing epithelial-lined cysts in cervical and upper thoracic region. Histologically, both lesions were considered to be neurenteric cysts with an endodermal origin. Radiographic diagnosis was made by a combination of myelography, computed tomographic scan with myelography (CTM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete surgical resection was curative in both cases. Clinical presentation, histological characteristics, imaging findings and surgical management of this rare lesion are highlighted.
