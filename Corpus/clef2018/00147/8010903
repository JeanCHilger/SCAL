Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred method of treatment for symptomatic choledocholithiasis. Since its introduction there has been an increase in postoperative diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The aim of this study was to assess the indications and results of ERCP following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-one patients had an ERCP following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two broad groups were identified: Group 1 (35 patients) had filling defects (consistent with stones) noted on operative cholangiography, which were not successfully flushed or extracted at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy Group 2 consisted of patients who developed problems following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Nine patients had post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain with abnormal liver function tests (LFT), four of whom had common bile duct (CBD) injuries and three had CBD stones. Eleven patients had post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain with a normal diameter common bile duct on ultrasound and normal LFT
