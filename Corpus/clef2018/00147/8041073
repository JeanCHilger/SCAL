Duodenal cancer. Primary duodenal carcinoma is a relatively rare oncological disease and accounts for 0.04-0.5% of all tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The absence of pathognomonic symptoms and insufficient knowledge and watchfulness on the part of doctors in relation to this pathological condition are the main causes of the difficult diagnosis and early detection of the disease. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, radiological duodenography, ultrasonic examination, and computered tomography of the abdominal organs play the main role in timely diagnosis of primary duodenal carcinoma. Pancreatoduodenal resection is the optimal method of treatment.
