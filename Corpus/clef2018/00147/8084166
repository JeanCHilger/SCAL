Surgical treatment of diseases of the small intestine. The article deals with experience in surgical treatment of 375 patients with various diseases of the small intestine, rare diseases (tuberculosis, enterolithiasis, tumors, etc.) among others. These diseases were usually manifested clinically in the late stages by ileus, peritonitis or bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. Most patients with surgical diseases of the small intestine were subjected to operation for emergency indications. Such instrumental methods as laparoscopy, selective endoscopic radiocontrast study of the small intestine, angiography, etc. are important in the diagnosis of the diseases. The authors emphasize the high diagnostic efficacy of a special method of selective endoscopic radiocontrast study, especially in tumors of the small intestine. According to the authors, general mortality rate in diseases of the small intestine is high (13%) and is mainly due to such diseases as disorders of mesenteric blood circulation, incarceration of the intestine in a hernia, adhesive obstruction, volvulus, etc. The authors claim that mortality in diseases of the small intestine can be reduced if early diagnosis, early hospitalization, and adequate surgical interventions are ensured. Among the factors contributing to increase of the efficacy of surgical operations the authors indicate efficacy of surgical operations the authors indicate precision techniques of intestinal suture application with atraumatic suture material, the use of complex biological protection of the anastomosis including treatment with low-frequency ultrasound and subsequent application of collagenic films in which antibacterial agents are deposited, and measures for stimulating reparative regeneration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
