Magnetic resonance scans should replace biopsies for the diagnosis of diffuse brain stem gliomas: a report from the Children's Cancer Group. Children's Cancer Group Protocol CCG-9882 was designed to determine the effectiveness of hyperfractionated radiation for the treatment of children and young adults with brain stem gliomas. The study opened for the accrual of patients on September 21, 1988, and was closed on June 30, 1991. The first 54 children in the study were treated with irradiation doses of 100 cGy given twice daily to a total dosage of 7200 cGy. The next 66 children were treated with a similar daily regimens to a total of 7800 cGy. Tumors were diagnosed by clinical and radiographic criteria. Decisions about the need for surgery were left to the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon tissue diagnosis did not alter the therapy in patients with diffuse infiltrating tumors. We reviewed the neuroradiology and neurosurgery reports as well as the pathological specimens of children entered on the study. By magnetic resonance (MR) imaging criteria, tumors involved the majority of the brain stem in 76% of cases
