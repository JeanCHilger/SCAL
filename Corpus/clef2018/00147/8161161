Tumors of the mesentery. Apropos of 102 cases. One hundred and two mesenteric tumours or masses are reported, and their histologic, clinical and therapeutic aspects are described: 28 cystic tumours, 38 mesenchymatous and 3 neurogenic tumours, 27 miscellaneous tumours, including 17 lymphomas, 2 hematomas and lymphoid or inflammatory masses. Seventy-four patients presented with an abdominal mass, 41 with pain and 28 with acute abdominal syndrome, including 16 with intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and computerised tomography were performed in 31 patients, RMI in 8 patients: these investigations are useful in establishing the diagnosis but surgical exploration and biopsies remain necessary for the pathology. One hundred and one patients required operation: 45 biopsies with 5 by-passes, and 56 resections, 32 localized tumour resections and 24 extended to the small bowel. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy have little or no effect.
