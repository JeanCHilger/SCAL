Imaging of gallbladder carcinoma. Although carcinoma of the gallbladder has a low overall prevalence, it is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary tract. Retrospectively, 59 cases of histologically proved gallbladder carcinoma were reviewed. The series consisted of 42 women and 17 men, ranging in age from 35 to 86 years. Clinical manifestations of gallbladder carcinoma include right upper quadrant pain, anorexia, weight loss, and jaundice. Radiologic findings included focal or diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall (49%), a mass in the gallbladder fossa (37%), and an intraluminal mass (14%). Associated findings were cholelithiasis (64%), biliary duct dilatation (38%), invasion of the adjacent structures (67%), distant metastases other than those of the liver (3%), and porcelain gallbladder (4%). The histologic diagnoses were adenocarcinoma (90%) and squamous cell carcinoma (10%). Differential diagnoses include all conditions in which the gallbladder wall appears thickened. A general awareness of the radiologic features of gallbladder carcinoma enhances preoperative diagnoses.
