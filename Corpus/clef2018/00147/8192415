Intraluminal polyp of the common bile duct corresponding to a metastasis of cancer of the kidney. The authors report the second case to date of metastatic carcinoma of the common bile-duct from renal cell cancer presenting as an intraluminal polypoid mass. Obstructive jaundice developed in a 55-year old woman 14 years after nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. The diagnosis of polypoid tumor of the common bile-duct was established by sonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and CT-scan. Palliative resection was performed. Postoperative histological examination revealed the resected tumor to be identical to the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma. The postoperative course was marked by the development of distant metastases 6 months later. Diagnosis and therapeutic features of metastatic malignant biliary obstruction are discussed.
