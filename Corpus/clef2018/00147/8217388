Cancer of the middle third of the choledochus: an infrequent diagnosis. We report the case of an 80-year-old woman with a previous history of HBP, hysterectomy due to cancer of the uterus and cholelithiasis, who was admitted in our hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain, marked jaundice, choluria and acholia during one week, together with anorexia and loss of weight. Blood chemistry results disclosed a total bilirubin of 11 mg/dl, a direct bilirubin of 8 mg/dl, GGTP 826 U/I, alkaline phosphatase 287 U/I, AST 285 U/I, ALT 837 U/I and LDH 242 U/I. The CA 19-9 marker was higher than 500 U/ml. The abdominal ultrasound examination did not show any space-occupying lesions the extra and intrahepatic bile ducts were very dilated and the gall bladder showed multiple stones within its contents. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a homogeneous filiform defect at the middle third of the common bile duct of approximately 1 cm in length and with a marked dilatation of the bile ducts. A percutaneous drainage of the bile tree was performed, but the patient died.
