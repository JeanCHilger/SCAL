Leiomyosarcoma of the small intestine presenting as an isolated lower digestive tract hemorrhage. Report of 2 cases. The authors report two cases of leiomyosarcoma of the small intestine revealed by lower and isolated digestive bleeding. In both cases, only the pelvic examinations by means of ultrasonography and/or CT scan have shown a mass which corresponded to the small intestine tumor. The authors underlined the necessity of US and/or CT scan pelvic when faced with a lower digestive bleeding whose etiology cannot be determined by the endoscopic or radiologic intestinal examinations.
