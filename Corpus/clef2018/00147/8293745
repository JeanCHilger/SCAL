Radiological findings in cases of gallbladder carcinoma. Radiological findings in 80 cases of gallbladder carcinoma are analysed retrospectively. Seventy-nine of the patients had been examined by US (ultrasonography), 37 by CT (computed tomography), 26 by PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography), 17 by ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography), nine by angiography and 27 by US-guided FNB (fine needle biopsy). US showed the primary tumour in 68% and CT in 57%. In 67 cases the tumour had spread outside the gallbladder area, causing bile duct obstruction in 41. US showed the bile duct obstruction in 39 of these cases and CT in 20 out of 22 cases. US showed 73% of the cases that had spread to the liver the sensitivity being 68% for direct invasion and 88% for peripheral liver metastases. The corresponding percentages for CT were 68, 67 and 75%, respectively. In lymph node enlargement, US showed the nodes in 70% of cases and CT in 52%. PTC showed either stenosis or total obstruction in 25 cases and failed in one case. ERCP showed a tumour in 76% and failed in 24%. Angiography failed to show the primary tumour in two instances out of nine. The results indicate that current imaging methods are insufficient for the accurate staging of gallbladder carcinoma.
