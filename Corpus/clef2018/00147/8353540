Echo-guided puncture of intraprostatic cysts. The occurrence of an obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts, in spite of its rarity, must be considered by the Urologists in the screening of the etiologic causes of obstructive azoospermia. Nowadays, the diagnostic approach, which includes the biochemical study of seminal plasma and prostatic ultrasound, often leads to the preoperative recognition of the site of obstruction. Various surgical and endoscopic techniques have been adopted for the treatment of ejaculatory duct obstructions in different historical periods. Herein we describe our experience that starts from 1979. 17 infertile patients with intraprostatic cysts and 2 with a stenosis of the veru montanum were treated by us following these criteria: 9 azoospermic patients underwent scrototomy and endoscopy 10 patients with a severe oligozoospermia underwent echo-guided puncture of an intraprostatic cyst. The patients were placed in the lithotomy position, a 16 G needle was adopted and by means ultrasound was possible to follow the needle entering the cyst. When no spermatozoa was detected in the cystic liquid, sclerosing agents (Sodium-tetradecyl-sulphate 30 mg in 1 l.) was introduced. This easy procedure was carried out on outpatients in local anaesthesia. One out of ten oligozoospermic patients had to repeat the echo-guided puncture of intraprostatic cyst as the first attempt had been followed by recurrence. Eight out of ten subfertile patients who had undergone percutaneous echo-guided treatment had longer than 1 year follow-up: in seven cases an increase in sperms number and motility was obtained
