Congenital post-traumatic aggravated choledochal cyst. We present a case of congenital choledochal cyst with late aggravation after an abdominal trauma, which needed surgical resection of the cyst and cholecystectomy followed by hepato-digestive porto-jejunal anastomosis. This case shows, that inspite of minimal changes in the beginning later aggravation-for example after trauma-can be observed. Sonography is a noninvasive, non-ironising method and appears to be adequate for diagnosis and pre- and postoperative monitoring, but can not replace endoscopic, retrograde-choledochopancreaticography.
