Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy biliary complications. Radiological imaging and therapeutic interventions were performed in eight patients with biliary complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The diagnostic approach and the outcome of the therapeutic procedures were evaluated. Complications observed were bile leakage from the cystic duct stump (n = 2) erroneous identification of the cystic duct leading to common hepatic duct transection (n = 1) and hepatic duct ligation (n = 2)
