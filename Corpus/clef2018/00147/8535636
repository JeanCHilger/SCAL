Laparoscopic ultrasonography. Has it extended the horizon? Laparoscopic ultrasonography complements conventional radiologic evaluation of the biliary system at cholecystectomy. Addition of laparoscopic ultrasonography for staging patients with hepatic and pancreatic cancer improves accuracy and minimizes futile laparotomy. Dedicated laparoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy devices facilitate tissue sampling. Ultrasonography will play an increasingly important role in laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment.
