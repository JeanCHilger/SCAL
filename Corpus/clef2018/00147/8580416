Cystic lymphangioma of the gall-bladder: a case report. Intra-abdominal cystic lymphangiomas are rare lesions that can be difficult to diagnose. We present a report of a patient with a giant multilocular cystic lesion in the abdomen. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scans of the abdomen revealed that the cyst had originated in the gall-bladder fossa. There was some calcification and thickening of the cyst wall. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a medially deviated common bile duct, an elongated cystic duct and an inferior compressed gallbladder. There was no apparent communication between the cyst and the biliary tract however, an abdominal angiogram revealed that the lesion was supplied by a branch of the cystic artery. Histological findings obtained intra-operatively were consistent with a cystic lymphangioma. Its characteristic histology was observed in the subserous layer of the gall-bladder. This case is a rare instance of a cystic lymphangioma originating in the gall-bladder.
