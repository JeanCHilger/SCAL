Radiologic features of papillary adenoma and papillomatosis of the biliary tract. The purpose of this study was to describe the imaging findings of papillary adenoma of the bile ducts.Imaging modalities including sonography, computed tomography, cholangiography, and endoscopic sonography obtained in five patients with papillary adenoma of the bile duct were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with pathologic findings.In four cases, imaging findings were a dilatation of the bile ducts due to a protruding mass within the lumen of the common bile duct. In one case, the biliary tract obstruction was not due to the mass but to mucus secretion that was detected at sonography, endoscopic sonography, and cholangiography. Multiple lesions were observed in two cases at pathology and not detected preoperatively. All the lesions contained foci of in situ carcinoma or mild dysplasia.Imaging is useful in detecting bile duct tumors. Hypersecretion of mucus is rare but highly characteristic of bile duct adenoma.
