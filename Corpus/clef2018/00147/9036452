Usefulness of the new sequences of magnetic resonance in the study of hepatic hydatidosis. We investigated the role of new MR Imaging techniques for the diagnosis, characterization and staging of hepatic hydatid disease. We examined 21 patients (30 hydatid cysts), 7 men and 14 women, ranging in age 26 to 74 years, with known hydatid disease. MR examinations were carried out on a 0.5T superconductive magnet (Philips Gyroscan T5, Philips Medical System) with the following imaging protocol: T1w (TR/TE/NEX: 300/10/4) SE, T2w (TR/TE/NEX: 3000/120/6) TSE and fat suppressed (SPIR technique) T2w (TR/TE/NEX: 3000/120/6) sequences. MR Angiography examinations were performed with 2D Time of Flight sequences (TR = 33 ms TE = 6.9 ms
