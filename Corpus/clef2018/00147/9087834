Postcholecystectomy biliary leaks in the laparoscopic era: risk factors, presentation, and management. McGill Gallstone Treatment Group. The management of bile leaks has evolved in the laparoscopic era. This study characterizes risk factors for their developmental and their clinical course and management.Data on a cohort of patients who developed bile leaks after cholecystectomy in the laparoscopic era were gathered prospectively and retrospectively from an ongoing surgical database and following a review of hospital charts.Sixty-four patients (mean age 56 +/- 17.1 years, 72% women) were included over a 5-year study period. The incidence of leaks was 1.1% among patients entered in a laparoscopic cholecystectomy database. Intraoperative complications were encountered in 36%. Rates of intraoperative complication and conversion to open surgery were greater among patients who developed leaks (5.2% vs 0.6% and 33% vs 6.3%, respectively, p < 0.00001). Patients presented 5.3 +/- 4.2 days following surgery with abdominal pain (89%), fever (74%), and tenderness (81%). Ultrasound diagnosed a suspected leak in 73%, which ERCP showed as originating from the cystic duct stump in 77%. Biliary obstruction was noted in 20 (31%) patients (14 with stones). Treatments included percutaneous (13%), endoscopic (28%), primary or secondary operative procedures (14%), or a combination thereof (45%).A complication at laparoscopic cholecystectomy increases the likelihood of a subsequent bile leak. Most patients present early with a patent cystic duct stump in the absence of biliary obstruction. Endoscopic therapy is successful in the majority of cases, but otherwise percutaneous or operative procedures may be needed.
