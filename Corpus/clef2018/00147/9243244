A 7-year-old child with primary tumour localisation in the distal duodenum--new imaging procedures for an improved diagnosis. Duodenal gastrinomas in childhood are extremely rare and often missed at first medical consultation. We report on a 7-year-old child with sporadic gastrinoma of primary localisation in the distal duodenum. Small metastases in the liver and regional nodes were detected pre-operatively by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) but not by other conventional imaging procedures. Diagnostic procedures include pre-operative SRS, endoscopic ultrasound and intra-operative endoscopic transillumination.Gastrinomas are rare abdominal tumours in childhood. Pre-operative tumour-specific diagnosis is possible by 111indium pentreotide SRS.
