Gastroduodenal invagination and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to gastric lipoma. A patient with a history of epigastric abdominal pain and occasional vomiting is presented. During the study of an upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastroduodenal invagination secondary to a gastric lipoma of 5.5 cm in diameter was diagnosed. Upper digestive endoscopy and gastroduodenal study were not diagnostic. Echography detected a duodenal mass suspect of invagination. CAT diagnosed the lipomatous nature of the tumor. Surgery confirmed gastroduodenal invagination with a gastric lipoma with ulceration in the mucosa which covered the same. Enucleation of the tumor was performed. Histologic study established the diagnosis of gastric lipoma. The post operative period was uneventful. A review of the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of this rare disease is reported.
