Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus. A 48-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia, often associated with retrosternal chest pain. Upper endoscopy revealed an unusual pigmented lesion within the middle portion of the esophagus, and multiple biopsies were obtained. The histopathology and immunohistochemical profile of the tissue specimens were diagnostic of malignant melanoma. A thorough clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed, providing no additional findings or alternative primary source. Of approximately 11,500 melanoma patients entered in the Duke University melanoma database since 1970, this represents the only case of primary esophageal melanoma. The case is described and a review of the literature is presented.
