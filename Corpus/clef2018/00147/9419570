Disorders of lymph flow. Disturbances in blood capillary exchange of fluid, macromolecules, and cells across intact and abnormal microvessels and deranged lymphatic transport are integral, interacting components in disorders of tissue swelling. Lymphedema or low-output failure of the lymph circulation is often indolent for many years before lymphatic insufficiency (failure) and tissue swelling emerge and persist. Superimposed occult or overt infection (lymphangitis) are probably major contributors to progressive limb deformity (elephantiasis). Long-standing lymphedema is characterized by trapping in the skin and subcutaneous tissue of fluid, extravasated plasma proteins, and other macromolecules: impaired immune cell trafficking abnormal processing of autologous and foreign antigens
