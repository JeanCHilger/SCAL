Hemorrhage into a simple liver cyst: diagnostic implications of a recent case. Hemorrhage complicating simple liver cyst is rare. On imaging studies, the differential diagnosis between intracystic hemorrhage and cystadenocarcinoma of the liver is unreliable, and hepatectomy has been performed for benign liver cyst in this situation. We describe the characteristics of hemorrhage into a liver cyst in a patient who underwent dome resection of the cyst. In our patient, important diagnostic findings included benign cytologic features in a cyst fluid specimen aspirated with ultrasonographic guidance and a fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggestive of hemorrhage. Other informative features were absence of communication between the intrahepatic bile ducts and the cystic liver lesion upon endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, as well as benign intraoperative frozen-section histology.
