Prospective study on the value of endosonographic follow-up after surgery for esophageal carcinoma. Half of the patients who undergo surgery for cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia present with recurrent disease within 2 years after the operation. We investigated the value of endosonography for the early detection of recurrent disease.Forty-three patients entered a follow-up protocol in which endosonography was performed every 6 months within the first 2 years after resection.During 16 of a total of 66 examinations, suspicious abnormalities were found. In three patients free fluid was seen, but recurrence could not be confirmed during follow-up. In eight patients suspicious lymph nodes were seen six died within 6 months, one was alive with a proven recurrence at 6 months, and one was alive without recurrence at 22 months. In five patients focal wall-thickening or a mass was seenEndosonography, performed at 6-month intervals after resection of cancer of the esophagus or gastric cardia, is accurate in the early detection of locoregional recurrent disease. Two thirds of the patients were still without symptoms when the recurrence was found.
