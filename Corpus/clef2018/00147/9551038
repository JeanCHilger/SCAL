Polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract as a manifestation of diffuse follicular lymphatic hyperplasia. A 21-year-old previously healthy Turkish man who had been living in Germany for 15 years was admitted because of worsening cramp-like abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhoea. Palpation elicited diffuse muscular guarding over the entire abdomen and a mass of about 8 cm in the right lower abdomen.Abnormal laboratory results were erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55 mm), C-reactive protein (6.2 mg/dl), total bilirubin (2.1 mg/dl), creatine kinase (137 U/l) and thymidine kinase (5.5 U/l). There was a slight leucocytosis (13,700/microliter) and mild anaemia (haemoglobin 13.4 g/dl) with a normal differential count. Listeria ivanovii was repeatedly cultured from stool. Ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a 6 cm mass in the right lower abdomen, splenomegaly (15.5 x 5 cm) and several lymphomas, up to 1.8 cm in diameter. Endoscopy revealed dense, in part grass-like, polyps, 3 to 6 mm deep, in the mucosa from the terminal ileum to the rectum, and to a lesser extent also in the duodenum. Histological examination of the polyps demonstrated diffuse follicular hyperplasia without evidence of malignancy.On antibiotic treatment with ofloxacin (2 x 400 mg intravenously) the symptoms quickly regressed, but the endoscopic findings remained unchanged.Diffuse follicular lymphatic hyperplasia manifested itself in this patient as diffuse gastrointestinal polyposis. Listeria ivanovii cannot be ruled out as a causative factor.
