Familial occurrence of congenital bile duct cysts. Congenital bile duct cysts are now a well-documented anomaly of the biliary tree, and have become more common in Japan. Familial occurrence of congenital bile duct cysts, however, is extremely rare, with only six reported cases in the literature. We report a familial pattern of congenital bile duct cysts in a mother and her daughter. A 33-year-old female was admitted for evaluation of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and fever 6 days after an uneventful delivery of her second child. A computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound scan (US) revealed an obstructed biliary tract. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was then performed, and a cholangiogram revealed a Scholtz type B choledochocele without an anomalous connection of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. Endoscopic US demonstrated that the choledochocele was associated with a stone in the cyst. A pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenal resection was performed, and a histological study revealed that the choledochocele was lined by biliary mucosa without evidence of malignancy. The newborn infant had an abdominal tumour. An US and CT revealed a congenital bile duct cyst. An operation was performed and the intraoperative cholangiogram showed an Alonso-Lej type I congenital bile duct cyst with an anomalous connection of the pancreaticobiliary ducts. Whether congenital bile duct cysts are hereditary remains to be elucidated.
