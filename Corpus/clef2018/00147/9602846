Intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound. Intraoperative ultrasound, whether during celiotomy or laparoscopy, plays an important role in assisting the surgeon in directing appropriate therapy for intra-abdominal diseases, particularly primary or metastatic malignancies involving the liver and primary malignancies of the pancreas and upper gastrointestinal tract. It is the most sensitive imaging technique for detecting small intraparenchymal lesions of the liver, pancreas, and other solid organs. Owing to its increased sensitivity over all commonly used preoperative imaging studies, it is responsible for changing the intraoperative treatment plan of these tumors in a significant percentage of cases. This is particularly true with respect to resectability. In the era of laparoscopic surgery, it replaces the surgeon's inability to palpate the liver and other organs during surgery. As surgeons use a laparoscopic approach with increasing frequency to treat intra-abdominal disease, they will have an increasing need to master the use of intraoperative ultrasound in order to render optimal care to their patients.
