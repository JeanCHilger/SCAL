Laparoscopic ultrasound in abdominal surgery. Laparoscopic ultrasound combines the advantages of diagnostic laparoscopy with peroperative ultrasonography. This new technique allows visualization of deep structures that are not palpable. The technical aspects of this technique and its applications in abdominal surgery are described. The main indications are the search for common bile duct stones during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the assessment of the spread of abdominal cancers. The information obtained from laparoscopic ultrasound can influence the therapeutic management.
