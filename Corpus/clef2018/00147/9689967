Late liver metastases of small bowel leiomyoma. The difficulty in assessing malignancy in gastro-intestinal smooth muscle tumours. Two cases of small bowel tumour, resected and considered as benign leiomyomas, are reported. Both developed late hepatic metastases, 6 and 8 years after surgery respectively, diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma. Emphasizing the difficulties in assessing malignancy of these tumours and considering local and far dissemination, a long-term follow-up is recommended after surgical resection.
