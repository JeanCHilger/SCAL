Endosonographic diagnosis of intraluminal diverticulum. After a long symptom period of 19 years a submucosal tumor was suspected on endoscopy to account for the patient's intermittent nausea and abdominal pain. Duodenal waterfilling during endoscopic ultrasound led to the endosonographic diagnosis of an intraluminal duodenal diverticulum which was removed surgically. The patient became completely asymptomatic.
