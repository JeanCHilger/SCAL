Intraoperative and laparoscopic ultrasound. The instruments, techniques, clinical applications and results, advantages and limitations of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) in general surgical oncology are presented based on our experiences and review of publications. IOUS provides remarkable benefits in acquisition of accurate diagnostic information, particularly in tumor staging and resectability, and thereby in intraoperative decision making during hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and endocrine surgery. In addition, various surgical procedures are guided or assisted by IOUS. A latest modality of IOUS is LUS, which can provide similar valuable information and compensate for the limitation of laparoscopy. LUS will demonstrate great promise as an adjunct to laparoscopic exploration or surgery.
