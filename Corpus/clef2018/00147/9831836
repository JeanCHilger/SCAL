Clinical implications of endoluminal ultrasonography using through-the-scope catheter probes. Ultrasound catheter probe-assisted endosonography is a relatively new technique. The aim of this prospective multicenter study was to determine its potential clinical impact by assessing changes in diagnostic and therapeutic management affected by catheter probes compared with ultrasound endoscopes.Endosonographers at three centers selected theoretic diagnostic and therapeutic plans that would be followed if neither catheter probes nor ultrasound endoscopes were available. Patients with suitable lesions underwent endosonography with catheter probes followed by an ultrasound endoscope. Diagnostic and therapeutic plans were noted after each examination.Sixty-six patients, of whom 15 had a stenotic esophageal cancer, 39 had a mucosal or submucosal lesion, and 12 had a stricture of the pancreaticobiliary system or the gastrointestinal tract, were enrolled. If neither form of endosonography were available, invasive or surgical diagnostic procedures would have been performed on 23 (35%) patients and surgical therapy would have been planned in 31 (47%) patients. Catheter probe-assisted ultrasonography and endoscopic ultrasonography led to a less invasive diagnostic plan in 11 (16%) and 12 (18%) patients and a less invasive therapeutic plan in 10 (15%) and 14 (21%) patients, respectively (p > 0.1 for differences).Catheter probe-assisted endosonography has a modest effect on diagnostic and therapeutic management, comparable with endoscopic ultrasonography in the same patients. The vast majority of effected changes are toward less invasive management.
