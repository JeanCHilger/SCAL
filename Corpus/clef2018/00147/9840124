Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of jejunal leiomyoblastoma. We report a case of large leiomyoblastoma of the jejunum. The sagittal views in pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that a cystic tumor with solid component was present, sequential from the small bowel. We suspected a smooth muscle tumor of the small bowel, but did not rule out the malignancy. The operative diagnosis was smooth muscle tumor of the proximal jejunum, and partial resection of the small bowel was performed. The pathological examination revealed benign leiomyoblastoma of the jejunum without metastasis. MRI contributed to the pre-operative diagnosis of the origin of this rare tumor, in a non-invasive fashion.
