Spontaneous rupture of the bladder. Apropos of 2 cases with an unusual presentation. Spontaneous bladder ruptures is the accepted term of bladder rupture not associated with trauma. This rare condition occurs when an obstacle to urinary outflow is associated with a diseased bladder wall. The diagnosis is usually made on the retrograde cystogram. We report two cases of atypical spontaneous bladder rupture with intravesical herniation of the small bowel. The diagnosis was not suspected clinically but was made on CT and MRI.
