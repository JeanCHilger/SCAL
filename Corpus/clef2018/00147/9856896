Virtual intraluminal endoscopy: a new method for evaluation and management of choledochal cyst. A 12-year-old girl who suffered from cholangitis was treated successfully with appropriate antibiotics. She had undergone an operation in mainland China, the exact nature of which was unknown. After an ultrasound study, she underwent a helical computed tomography (CT) cholangiogram using intravenous meglumine iodoxamine. The volume data were transferred to a workstation and virtual endoscopy rendering reconstruction of bile ducts was performed. Findings of this study showed that she had cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), and her intrahepatic ducts were packed with stones. Virtual endoscopy gave the impression that the examiner was flying inside the lumen and showed the stricture at the HJ anastomosis, the inner surface of the bile ducts, areas of dilated intrahepatic ducts, and the intrahepatic stones. The study overcame the need for an invasive study such as a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and also facilitated appropriate surgical treatment in a timely fashion. It is believed that virtual intraluminal endoscopy (VIE) is helpful in the evaluation and management of selected cases of choledochal cyst.
