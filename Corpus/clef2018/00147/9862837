Use of magnetic resonance cholangiography in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis: prospective comparison with a reference imaging method. Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is a new technique for non-invasive imaging of the biliary tract.To assess the results of MRC in patients with suspected bile duct stones as compared with those obtained with reference imaging methods.70 patients (34 men and 36 women, mean (SD) age 71 (15.5) years median 75) with suspected bile duct stones were included (cholangitis, 3349 patients (70%) had bile duct stones on reference imaging (common bile duct, 44, six of which impacted in the papilla intrahepatic, fourStones smaller than 6 mm are still often missed by MRC when standard equipment is used. The general introduction of new technical improvements is needed before this method can be considered reliable for the diagnosis of bile duct stones.
