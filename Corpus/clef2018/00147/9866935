An update in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors of the hepatic portal. Cholangiocarcinoma affecting the cross of the bile ducts is a tumour which has, although treatments, a high rate of mortality.Between January 1986 and January 1996 six patients affected by Klatskin's tumor were studied three of them underwent operation and were treated with insertion of a T tube (Kerr), whereas the other three were managed endoscopically with trans-tumoral stenting.The survival rate was about seven months for patients who underwent operation and fifteen months for patients managed with endoscopic stenting.After a review of the literature and according to personal experience, it is underlined that only an early diagnosis can achieve best results, since the latest knowledge about hepatic anatomy derived from transplants allows more extensive resections.
