Bone metastases from a paraganglioma. A review of five cases. Paragangliomas are infrequent, usually benign tumors developed from neuroectoderm cells. The neck is the most common location, although some cases arise within the abdominal cavity, usually in the retroperitoneal space. We report five cases with bone metastases. In three patients, convincing evidence was obtained that the primary was in the retroperitoneal space. Clinical manifestations of metastatic bone disease occurred up to 17 years after the diagnosis of paraganglioma. Useful data were obtained from plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, serum and urine catecholamine assays, and above all meta 123iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies of the lesion yielded the definite diagnosis. Surgery and radiation therapy are the two mainstays of therapy. Although rare, metastatic forms of paraganglioma should be borne in mind. This diagnosis should be entertained in patients with bone lesions and recent-onset arterial hypertension, irrespective of whether they report a history of surgery for a tumor, and even if this tumor was removed many years earlier and labeled benign.
