Splenosis presenting as an ulcerated gastric mass: endoscopic and endoscopic ultrasonographic imaging. A case of an ulcerated gastric wall mass ultimately found to be splenosis is presented in which the index patient had endoscopic and endoscopic ultrasonographic evaluation prior to resection. Although no visual features identified this mass as a splenic implant preoperatively, the lesion appeared to be atypical for leiomyoma, which led to surgical intervention. The role of endoscopic ultrasonography in assessing isolated gastric masses is discussed.
