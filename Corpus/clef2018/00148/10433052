Laparoendoscopic excision of a duodenal mass. Large sessile lipomas, adenomas, and other tumors are often not amenable to endoscopic excision, due to the risk of bleeding or perforation. Resection of these lesions has traditionally required laparotomy with enterotomy for complete removal. A novel technique, described here, is the combination of laparoscopy and simultaneous endoscopy, allowing for complete removal of these lesions while preserving the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.
