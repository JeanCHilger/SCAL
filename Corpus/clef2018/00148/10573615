The radical treatment of hepatic hydatidosis with deep and multiple locations. The role of new technologies particularly in the case of multiple locations. Advanced technologies (intraoperative ultrasonography, CT scan, argon coagulator ...) have changed the surgical approach of liver hydatid disease, allowing even multiple or deeply located cysts to be detected and treated successfully. Authors report a series of 4 patients with single (3) or multiple (1) unilocular hepatic cysts and 1 patient with thoraco-pulmonary hydatid recurrent disease. Treatments of choice and surgical techniques are described. No infective compliances occurred. The mean period of hospitalization was 19 days (ranging between 10 days and 4 weeks). The longest hospitalization was observed in a patient with a post-operative biliary fistula at low out put. Total cysto-pericystectomy is emphasized as the gold standard procedure in the treatment of non complicated unilocular hydatid cysts of the liver. Modern means of investigation and technical equipment make it feasible and safe even in unfavorable localizations, allowing radical removal of the cysts preserving in the meantime all the surrounding liver parenchyma.
