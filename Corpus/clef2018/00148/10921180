Substernal goiter. Report of 212 cases. The aim of this retrospective study was to report the results of the surgical treatment in a series of 210 patients operated on for substernal goiters.From 1982 to 1996, 210 patients with substernal goiters, including 80% of women, were operated on via a cervical approach in 208 cases, via a sternotomy in two cases. Two patients with operative contra-indications were not operated on. Twenty-five were operated on for a substernal recurrence of a goiter. In 160 cases, extraction of the substernal portion was easy. In 48 cases, removal of the substernal portion was facilitated by the discovery of the recurrent nerve at its entering into the larynx and a downward dissection of the tracheal attachments of the lobe. The complete dissection of the cervical portion made easier the ascension of the substernal portion even in very large substernal components.Three papillary carcinomas were diagnosed. A transient laryngeal nerve palsy occurred in 7.2% of the patients and a transient hypoparathyroidism in 13.4%, A definitive laryngeal nerve palsy occurred in 1.2% of the patients, and a persistent hypoparathyroidism in 2.1%. Of the 25 patients who underwent surgery for recurrence of a goiter, three (12%) developed a transient laryngeal nerve palsy, one (4%) a permanent nerve palsy, four (20%) a transient hypoparathyroidism and one (4%) a persistent hypocalcemia.CT scan and MRI are the best explorations to evaluate intrathoracic extension of substernal goiters. Thyroidectomy was performed via a cervical incision in 208 patients and via a sternotomy in two patients only. The complete dissection of the cervical portion with discovery of the recurrent nerve at its entering into the larynx, facilitates the ascension of the substernal portion even in very large substernal goiters.
