Multifocal epithelioid angiosarcoma of the small intestine. A 67-year-old man presented with weight loss, intermittent severe abdominal pain and melaena. Initial radiology (including abdominal ultrasonography), gastroscopy and colonoscopy did not demonstrate any lesions that could explain the complaints. Three weeks later, upper gastrointestinal and small-bowel barium studies revealed two areas in the small intestine with an abnormal mucosal pattern. Explorative laparotomy revealed three tumoral lesions. Three partial enterectomies were performed. Gross examination showed centrally depressed dark reddish tumoral lesions extending from the mucosa throughout the full thickness of the bowel wall (diameter varying between 1.6 cm and 2.2 cm). The tumours, composed of large, plump, polygonal cells showing little architectural differentiation, were mainly situated in submucosa and muscularis propria. The growth pattern appeared rather solid. The epithelioid cells showed pronounced nuclear pleomorphism and atypia with central large nucleoli. There were several small blood vessels with occasional anaplastic endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated an intense expression of CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII related antigen and keratin. This supported the diagnosis of an epithelioid angiosarcoma. The patient died 3 months after diagnosis. Tumours of the small intestine are very rare, and angiosarcomas of the small intestine are even more rare. Epithelioid variants have only been described in two patients and only one of these had a multifocal presentation. The prognosis is very poor. Because of the epithelioid growth pattern and the cytokeratin expression, these tumours may erroneously be diagnosed as a carcinoma.
