Laparoscopic ultrasound in predicting resectability of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for about 1% of all malignant tumors. They are difficult to diagnose because of their small size and their location. Although surgical resection is the best therapeutic approach, most patients undergo unnecessary exploratory laparotomy due to incorrect preoperative diagnosis. We present our experience with laparoscopic ultrasound (LU) in the evaluation of cholangiocarcinoma and determination of tumor spread and vascular involvement. Of 25 patients referred for surgery, 6 were excluded following LU and were referred instead for palliative treatment. Diagnosis of the tumor was successful in 92%, and vascular involvement was diagnosed in 46%. LU should be an integral diagnostic test in the evaluation of choriocarcinoma.
