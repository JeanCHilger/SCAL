Biliary tract surgery. The use of the laparoscope in biliary tract surgery continues to play a major role in improving the operative management of patients with biliary diseases. Laparascopic cholecystectomy has been safely performed as a day-case procedure and has lowered the morbidity of cholecystectomy in the setting of acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration allows cholecystectomy and the removal of common bile duct stones to be performed during the same procedure, thereby decreasing hospital stay. Several new noninvasive modalities have been recently developed to image the biliary tract. In addition, laparoscopic ultrasound has led to rapid intraoperative imaging of the extrahepatic biliary tree. The long-term results of laparoscopic bile duct injuries have been better defined during the past several years. Finally, the role of surgical resection for gallbladder cancer detected during or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy has recently been evaluated.
