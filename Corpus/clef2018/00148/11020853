Gallbladder hematoma in a patient with hemophilia B, report of a case. The authors report the case of a 49-year-old man, hematoma of the gallbladder associated with hemophilia B. The patient was diagnosed incidentally by abdominal computed tomography with a gallbladder tumor. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed negative gallbladder and angiography showed no obvious abnormality in the cystic artery. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass of mixed intensity on T2-weighted image and a mass of mixed intensity on the lining of the gallbladder wall. Hemorrhage in the gallbladder was thought to be most likely, however, the gallbladder tumor could not to be neglected. Cholecystectomy was performed on the patient and the pathological diagnosis was of a hemorrhage in the gallbladder. Hematoma of the gallbladder is a rare complication in patients with hemophilia B, however, it leads sometimes to a fatal course and magnetic resonance imaging is very useful to diagnose hemorrhage in the gallbladder.
