Changing strategies in diagnosis and management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is one of the most difficult tumors to stage and treat. This study aims to evaluate (1) the best diagnostic imaging, (2) the usefulness of preoperative biliary drainage, (3) the resectability rate, and (4) the results of palliative treatments and surgical resection. Seventy-six patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma with a mean age of 64 +/- 11 years were treated at our institution from 1989 to 1999. Patients were studied preoperatively using ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and percutaneous cholangiography or magnetic resonance cholangiography. Forty-eight patients (63%) underwent palliative treatment. Twenty-eight patients underwent surgical curative therapy 20 resections and 8 orthotopic liver transplantations (OLTs). Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography was performed in 18 of 28 patients (64%), and magnetic resonance cholangiography in 5 patients
