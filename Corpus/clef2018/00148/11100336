Benign duodenal tumors. Benign duodenal tumors are rare and less common than malignant tumors. They comprise a wide variety of pathologies. Treatment is by endoscopic excision or surgical resection. In this report, we aim to review the management of benign tumors located in the proximal duodenum.A retrospective review of 11 patients with benign duodenal tumors treated in a single institution was performed over 10 years. Malignant tumors and periampullary tumors were excluded from the study.The most common presentations were abdominal pain and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis was established by gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. Seven tumors were located in the first part of the duodenum. The mean size of the tumors was 2.8 cm. Three patients with bleeding tumors were treated with endoscopic hemostasis and underwent surgery because the tumors were larger than 2 cm. Four patients had endoscopic polypectomies and 5 patients had surgical excision. The histological types included 6 adenomas, 3 Brunner's gland adenomas or harmatoma, 1 schwannoma and 1 leiomyoma. The results were good with only 1 case of recurrence.The presentation of benign duodenal tumors is non-specific. They are diagnosed by gastroduodenoscopy and the tumors can be removed if small and pedunculated. Endoscopic ultrasound is useful in detecting submucosal involvement of sessile tumors. In such cases and large tumors (> 2 cm), surgical excision by laparotomy or laparoscopy should be undertaken.
