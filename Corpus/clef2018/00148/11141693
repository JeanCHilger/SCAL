ACTH-producing pituitary cancer: experience at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre. Pituitary gland is an uncommon site of a primary cancer. Of more than 600 cases of pituitary tumors seen at the KFSH&RC between 1975 to 1998 only 3 patients had primary pituitary cancer. We have previously reported a case of pituitary fibrosarcoma arising as a rare complication of external radiotherapy (ERT) for GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (PA) [1]. We report now 2 cases of ACTH-producing primary pituitary carcinoma (ACTH-PPC) their follow-up data provide information on the natural history of this cancer. Patient #1
