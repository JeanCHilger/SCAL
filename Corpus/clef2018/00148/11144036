Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Clinical presentation in 261 patients. We prospectively evaluated the initial presenting symptoms in 261 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) over a 25-year period. Twenty-two percent of the patients had multiple endocrine neoplasia-type 1 (MEN-1) with ZES. Mean age at onset was 41.1 +/- 0.7 years, with MEN-1 patients presenting at a younger age than those with sporadic ZES (p < 0.0001). Three percent of the patients had onset of the disease < age 20 years, and 7% > 60 years. A mean delay to diagnosis of 5.2 +/- 0.4 years occurred in all patients. A shorter duration of symptoms was noted in female patients and in patients with liver metastases. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were the most common symptoms, present in 75% and 73% of patients, respectively. Heartburn and weight loss, which were uncommonly reported in early series, were present in 44% and 17% of patients, respectively. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the initial presentation in a quarter of the patients. Patients rarely presented with only 1 symptom (11%) pain and diarrhea was the most frequent combination, occurring in 55% of patients. An important presenting sign that should suggest ZES is prominent gastric body folds, which were noted on endoscopy in 94% of patients
