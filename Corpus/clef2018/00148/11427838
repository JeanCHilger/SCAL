Wire-guided intraductal US: an adjunct to ERCP in the management of bile duct stones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) may misdiagnose bile duct stones if air bubbles are introduced during contrast injection, and it may also fail to diagnose stones in the presence of bile duct dilation.Our aim was to determine whether intraductal US (IDUS) improves the accuracy of cholangiography and whether it is a useful adjunct in the management of bile duct stones. IDUS with a wire-guided US probe was performed after initial ERC in patients in whom bile duct stones were suspected. The diagnostic accuracy of ERC alone was compared with that of ERC plus IDUS.ERC with IDUS was performed in 62 patients who were suspected to have bile duct stones. Both IDUS and ERC were performed by the same endoscopist, and ERC was performed with a C-arm fluoroscope. The presence of bile duct stones and/or sludge were confirmed after sphincterotomy and extraction in 34 patients. Overall, the accuracy of ERC combined with IDUS in the diagnosis of bile duct stone and/or sludge was higher than that of ERC alone (97% vs. 87%, p < 0.05). With dilated bile ducts, the diagnostic accuracy of ERC combined with IDUS was also higher than that of ERC alone (95.5% vs. 72.7%, p < 0.05). Additional diagnostic information provided by IDUS included identification of cystic duct stones in 5 patients, characterization of bile duct strictures in 2 patients, and choledochal varices in 1 patient. Performance of wire-guided IDUS required 5% of the total procedure time.IDUS improves diagnostic accuracy of ERC and is a useful adjunct to ERC when bile duct stones are suspected.
