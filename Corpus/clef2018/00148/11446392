Familial adenomatous polyposis: a case report and review of the literature. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by diffuse intestinal polyposis, specific gene mutation, and predisposition for developing colon cancer. Left untreated, patients with FAP will develop colorectal carcinoma during early adulthood. Hence, early detection and surgical intervention are of the utmost importance. Colectomy is required and may include an ileal pouch with ileoanal anastomosis, which eliminates the colon and rectal disease while preserving fecal continence and avoidance of a permanent ileostomy. Advances in the treatment of FAP with associated reduction in mortality from colorectal carcinoma make extracolonic manifestations of the disease more common and life-long surveillance is mandatory. The most life-threatening extracolonic manifestations of FAP are periampullary carcinoma and desmoid tumors. The upper gastrointestinal tract should be monitored endoscopically at the time of diagnosis and assessed regularly thereafter. Duodenal adenomas should be resected so as to avoid the devastating effects of invasive periampullary carcinoma. Additionally, the development of desmoid tumors needs to be monitored (by CT or MRI), so as to avoid the severe complications of local invasion. Further research is indicated in the development of effective screening and treatment for this condition.
