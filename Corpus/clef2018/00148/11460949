Hemobilia: four case reports and review of the literature. In this report, we present four cases of hemobilia. Hemobilia occurs when conditions produce an abnormal communication between blood vessels and bile ducts. Although iatrogenic procedures as causes of hemobilia have been reported with increasing frequency, non-iatrogenic etiologies are still quite rare. We, therefore, report 4 cases of hemobilia secondary to different etiologies found in our institution from 1996 to 1998, that are non-iatrogenic. The first patient was a case of congenital aneurysm, the second pseudoaneurysm from trauma, the third cholangiocarcinoma and the fourth hepatocellular carcinoma. The classical triad consists of melena, jaundice and abdominal pain. Direct observation of blood flowing from the Ampulla of Vater by endoscopy was the initial diagnostic procedure in all four cases. Diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography, computerized tomography, angiography or surgery. Transcatheter selective embolization as a noninvasive treatment for hepatic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm is emphasized.
