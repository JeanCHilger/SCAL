Pelvic organ prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse of the female is a common disease with age dependent increase in incidence. The committee for standardisation of the International Continence Society recently suggested to avoid classical terms such as cystocele, rectocele or enterocele for the description of prolapse and to replace them by defined landmarks. The "Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification" (POPQ) was developed and five different grades of prolapse were defined. This is a true gain for scientific documentation but needs some effort to be implemented in routine practical work. Previous normal vaginal delivery is statistically highly correlated with prolapse, followed by climacteric involution, constitutional factors, physical work, chronic bronchitis, and overweight respectively. The diagnosis is confirmed by clinical examination. Defects of the supportive structures can be precisely assessed with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging. Time will show whether this costly method will become part of routine diagnostic procedures. A patient with moderate prolapse or few complaints may be treated conservatively with pelvic floor training or electrotherapy. Modern pessaries are tried as first line therapy or for patients unwilling to undergo surgery. Local estrogen application should routinely be prescribed for perimenopausal patients. In the last decade laparoscopic techniques have been established in addition to standard methods of pelvic floor reconstruction. These techniques do not follow a new surgical strategy but realise the minimal invasive approach to established methods of pelvic floor reconstruction. Of note, laparoscopic fixation is very convenient for young women who want to preserve their uterus. Long time follow up is not available for most techniques.
