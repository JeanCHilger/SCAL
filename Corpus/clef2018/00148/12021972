Choledochal cyst sans cyst--experience with six "forme fruste" cases. Six children presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of a choledochal cyst (CC), but were found to have only mild dilatation of the common bile duct. Further imaging revealed a long common pancreaticobiliary channel in all cases. There was complete relief after surgery provided a pancreaticobiliary disconnection was incorporated in the operative management. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose this condition, which has been previously reported as "forme fruste CC".
