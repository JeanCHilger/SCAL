Magnetic resonance-guided biliary drainage in a patient with malignant obstructive jaundice and thrombocytopenia. In a patient suffering from malignant obstructive jaundice and thrombocytopenia, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to guide percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, to avoid blind puncture of the bile ducts using fluoroscopy. The first puncture approach was successful, and an MRI-visible guide wire and drainage catheter were inserted successfully within 35 min. The course after the intervention was uneventful, and the patient's fever and itching improved. MRI guidance facilitated optimal procedure planning and high puncture accuracy.
