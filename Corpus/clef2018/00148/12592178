Imaging pelvic floor prolapse. Dynamic MR imaging (MRI) may be used as an alternative to dynamic cystoproctography for the evaluation of pelvic floor prolapse. Our study aimed to define the range of dynamic pelvic MRI aspects observed during the exploration of pelvic prolapse.Fascial and anatomic defects can include a combinaison of cystocele, rectocele, uterine prolapse, enterocele and vault prolapse. Acute diagnosis of the coexisting abnormalities is essential in planning reconstructive procedures so that the risks of recurrence and reoperation can be minimized. At this time colpocystography is the study of choice to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging for exploration of pelvic floor dysfunction is under evaluation.Pubococcygeal line and puborectalis muscle were the references points. The grading system is based on degree of organ prolapse through the hiatus and the degree of pubo-rectalis descent and hiatal enlargement. Unfortunately, there is a real discordance between the reality of the prolapse and its imaging. However, a new reference line, the mid pubic line, was drawn on the magnetic resonance image to correspond to the hymeneal ring marker used in clinical staging. Intra-operative findings were considered the gold standard against which physical examination, dynamic colpocystodefecography and MRI were compared. Using these criteria the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of MRI were 70%, 100%, 100% for cystocele 42%, 81%, 60% for vaginal vault or uterine prolapseMRI appears to be an important adjunct in the comprehensive evaluation of the female pelvis. Except for vaginal vault, pelvic prolapse is accurately staged and pelvic organ prolapse reliably detected. The technique is rapid, non invasive and cost effective, it allows the clinician to visualize the whole pelvis using a single dynamic study that provides anatomical details.
