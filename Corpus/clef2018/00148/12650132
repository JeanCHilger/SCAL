Benign hepatic tumours. Benign hepatic tumours include a broad spectrum of regenerative and true neoplastic processes. Due to advances in imaging procedures like MRI, Cf-scan and ultrasound as well as progress in immunohistochemistry, the appropriate diagnosis is made ina high percentage of patients without laparotomy and resection. Most important in clinical practice is the differential diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma because of the risk of rupture and bleeding in the latter. Cavernous haemangioma, the most common benign hepatic tumour, rarely needs treatment. The diagnosis of nodular regenerative hyperplasia is often missed and patients present with secondary complications and signs of portal hypertension that necessitate treatment. The main problem in angiomyolipoma is to distinguish it from malignant processes which do require treatment. Because of its clinical presentation, inflammatory pseudotumour is also sometimes confused with a malignant tumour. Therapeutic options are drug therapy or surgical resection. Benign haemangioendothelioma of the infant is rare but may cause life-threatening complications. Bile duct adenoma is an incidental finding that is not known to cause any symptoms whereas biliary cystadenoma is often symptomatic and may progress to cystadenocarcinoma and therefore needs resection.
