The capacity of preoperative ultrasonography in predicting technical challenges in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ultrasonography is a nonsophisticated, cheap and safe exploration, that makes it the most used non-invasive method in the diagnosis of biliary diseases. Present study aims to evaluate preoperative ultrasonography's capacity of predicting technical challanges in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).The trial is represented by a sequence of 100 patients undergoing LC in 2001. The conversions to open procedure were excluded. Patients with certified lithaisis were re-examined by ultrasonography the day before surgery. The sonographic features as size, volume (scleroatrophic gallbladder), function (distension, contraction), wall thickness, hydrops, number and size of stones, infundibular position (impactation) of the stones, perivesicular liquid collections hepatic and pancreatic aspects, main bile duct caliber were registered. During LC, the difficulty in performing the procedure was measured using a 10 points-score of following parameters: 1 peritoneal and perivesicular adhesions 2. Difficult grasping of the gallbladderGallbladder's and the number, the size and infundibular impactation of the stones was significantly associated to ultraoperative difficulties (p < 0.05), the other parameters having not a sensitive influence upon LC procedure.Preoperative ultrasonography is able to furnish valuable data in predicting LC challenges.
