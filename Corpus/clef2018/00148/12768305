Three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound of the subendometrial blood flow under the administration of a contrast agent (Levovist). Based on the results from 42 IVF patients on the day of oocyte aspiration, our study tested the hypothesis that 3-D Doppler ultrasound of the endometrium supported by a contrast agent possesses advantages over a conventional 3-D Doppler ultrasound examination. We also determined whether the subendometrial blood flow indices measured under continuous infusion of Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) were an indicator of a successful implantation.It was demonstrated that, after the administration of Levovist, all subendometrial blood flow parameters (e.g., vascularization index [VI: 8.82+/-16.64], flow index [FI: 35.67+/-9.33], and vascularization flow index [VFI: 3.99+/-8.80]) were significantly higher than without the contrast agent ( p<0.001 VI: 3.09+/-7.11In summary, quantitative 3-D Doppler ultrasound employing Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) is significantly more sensitive when compared to conventional 3-D Doppler examination. For the first time this was demonstrated on 42 IVF patients on the day of oocyte aspiration. However, no correlation with outcome of the IVF-treatment could be found.
