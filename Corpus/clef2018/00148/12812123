Hyperplasia of adrenal rests in the testicle: a rare cause of male infertility. We report the case of a 37-year-old man with infertility caused by bilateral testicular masses secondary to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency). Testicular biopsy was done and its was initially interpreted as Leydig cell tumor but after clinical information was histologically reclassified as tumor of the adrenogenital syndrome. The differential diagnosis with Leydig cell tumor is discussed and it must be established through the clinical, biochemical, radiological and pathological features.
