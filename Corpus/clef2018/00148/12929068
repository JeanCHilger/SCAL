Schwannoma of the common bile duct: a rare cause of obstructive jaundice. The endoscopic diagnosis of bile duct lesions has improved over recent years through the introduction of cholangioscopy and intraductal ultrasound. Combining this with biopsies examined using routinely administered immunohistochemical markers, the diagnosis of tumors of the extrahepatic bile duct can be improved substantially. We report a rare case of a schwannoma of the bile duct causing obstructive jaundice.
