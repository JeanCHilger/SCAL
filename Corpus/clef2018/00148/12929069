Inflammatory pseudotumor of the common bile duct. An exceptional cause of obstructive jaundice is reported in the present case. A 51-year-old woman progressively developed jaundice with pruritus, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and endoscopic ultrasonography showed a tumor in the distal common bile duct, but failed to determine the nature of the lesion, and the patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. The final diagnosis was an inflammatory pseudotumor of the common bile duct. Inflammatory pseudotumors are uncommon, without evident pathogenesis, and are described in many organs. The localization in the common bile duct is exceptional. The prognosis is good, and a more conservative approach is possible if the diagnosis is certain before surgery.
