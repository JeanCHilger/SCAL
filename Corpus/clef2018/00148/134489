Cancer of the gallbladder. The problems of diagnosis and treatment of the disease are analysed basing on the experience with 26 observations of gallbladder cancer. According to the authors' opinion the progress could be achieved only in the complex exploration, including roentgenocontrast examination of biliary passages, duodenography under conditions of artificial hypotension, ultrasonic biolocation of the gallbladder, hepatoscanning, dynamic scannography, selective angiography and combined laparoscopy. As a result of the performed combined laparoscopy cancer of the gallbladder was diagnosed in 11 of 15 examined patients. Recommendations for surgical therapy are given.
