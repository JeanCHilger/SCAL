Bony fragments in the uterus: an association with secondary subfertility. Bone within the uterine cavity is an unusual finding in women with secondary subfertility, and is usually associated with a past history of termination of pregnancy. The etiology is unknown, but theories include retained fetal bone and osseous metaplasia of endometrial tissue. We describe the cases of three subfertility patients, all with a history of surgical termination of pregnancy. Each patient underwent a hysteroscopy after highly echogenic foci were seen in the uterus on transvaginal ultrasound examination. During hysteroscopy, several coral-like bony fragments were seen and removed by sharp curettage. On histological examination, these fragments were found to be mature, necrotic bone. This case report confirms the importance of routine baseline evaluation of the endometrium in subfertile women with a history of termination of pregnancy.
