Intramural pregnancy with negative maternal serum b-HCG. We report an extremely rare case of intramural pregnancy with negative maternal b-HCG value. The patient underwent a "myomectomy" but the pathology examination revealed chorionic villi consistent with ectopic pregnancy. Diagnosis is very difficult in cases with menorrhagia and especially when pregnancy is not suspected.
