Uterine fibroids embolization: results about 454 cases. To determine the effectiveness of uterine arterial embolization (UAE) as primary treatment in the management of symptomatic leiomyomas.UAE was performed on 454 patients (age range: 21-68) with menorrhagia, bulk-related symptoms or both, due to leiomyomas. The effectiveness of this therapy in the control of symptoms and reduction of uterine and leiomyoma volume was measured by clinical and imaging controls at 3, 6 and 9 months after the procedure.Four hundred and thirty-three patients were evaluated, and 42 failures were observed (9.6%). Six months after the procedure, 391 patients were symptom-free. Follow-up ultrasonic examination showed an average reduction of 55% in dominant myoma volume at 6 months, 70% at 1 year. Twenty-seven women became pregnant (30 pregnancies). Complications related to procedure, and requiring surgery, occurred in three cases. Principal complications are amenorrhoea and fibroid sloughs. Severe complications are rarely found.UAE is an efficient therapy in the management of symptomatic myomas and proves to be a valid alternative to surgical procedure. The future of this mini-invasive and conservative technique appears to be a very promising one.
