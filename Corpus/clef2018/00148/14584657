Is pretreatment hemoglobin level a predictor of complete response to salvage chemotherapy for recurrent platinum-pretreated ovarian carcinoma? The aim of this retrospective study was to correlate some patient characteristics at relapse, including also baseline hemoglobin levels, with complete response rate and survival following second-line chemotherapy for recurrent platinum-pretreated ovarian carcinoma.The investigation was conducted on 63 patients who received salvage chemotherapy with different agents for clinically detectable recurrent ovarian carcinoma following initial surgery and first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Some patient characteristics at relapse (patient age, serum CA 125 level, baseline hemoglobin level, number of recurrence sites, ascites, platinum-free interval, and treatment-free interval) were related to complete response rate to salvage chemotherapy and survival after recurrence. Median baseline hemoglobin level was 11.6 g/dl (range, 7.5-15.0 g/dl).Second-line chemotherapy obtained a complete response in 17 (27.0%) patients and a partial response in 11 (17.5%), whereas stable disease and progressive disease were detected in 19 (30.1%) and 16 (25.4%) patients, respectively. By univariate analysis, complete response rate was related to baseline hemoglobin level (p = 0.0019), platinum-free interval (p = 0.0012) and treatment-free interval (p = 0.0048). Multiple logistic regression showed that platinum-free interval (p = 0.0107) and baseline hemoglobin level (0.0312) were independent predictors of complete response. Patients with baseline hemoglobin levels >11.6 g/dl had a 5.338 higher chance of obtaining a complete response when compared to those with lower hemoglobin values. The platinum-free interval was the only independent prognostic variable for survival after recurrence (p = 0.0141), whereas baseline hemoglobin level was not related to survival at univariate nor at multivariate analysis.Baseline hemoglobin level is an independent predictor of complete response to salvage chemotherapy in patients with recurrent platinum-pretreated ovarian carcinoma. Attention must be paid to anemia correction in these patients, with the aim of improving both the chance of response to salvage treatment and the quality of life.
