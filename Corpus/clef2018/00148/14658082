Sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration of breast abscesses - a minimal-invasive alternative to surgical incision. The current standard treatment of breast abscesses is surgical incision and drainage. This method, however, frequently yields poor cosmetic results. Sonographically guided percutaneous aspiration of breast abscesses and local antibiotic treatment need to be considered as an interesting alternative. The present study aimed to compare these treatment alternatives.The patient population analysed comprised 24 patients with 28 breast abscesses who presented to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Munich University Hospital Grosshadern between 12/1997 and 9/2002. 25 % of these patients (6/24) suffered from a puerperal and 75 % (18/24) from a non-puerperal breast abscess. The study group of surgically treated patients comprised 15 women (16 abscesses). Ten patients (10 abscesses) were treated with the novel, minimally invasive method. The treatment success was statistically analysed using chi (2)- and t-Tests (p < 0,05).The minimally invasive approach did not extend the length of intravenous antibiotic treatment or hospital stay and did not lead to an increase in the need for analgesic drugs. We encountered recurrent abscesses in 31 % (5/16) of the surgical treatment group, yet none in the group undergoing minimally invasive treatment. The aesthetic-cosmetic as well as the functional result in lactating patients was satisfactory in all cases.Sonographically guided percutaneous aspiration of breast abscesses represents a less invasive and very promising alternative to surgical incision, showing the following advantages: no general anaesthesia required, a superior cosmetic result and shorter hospitalisation. The method was highly accepted by all patients treated.
