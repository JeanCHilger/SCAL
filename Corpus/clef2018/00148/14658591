Hormonal replacement therapy and evaluation of intrauterine pathology in postmenopausal women: a ten-year study. To evaluate the role of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in determining: a) abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) b) increased endometrial thickness at transvaginal sonography (TVS)Between April 1991 and April 2001 a group of 3,400 postmenopausal women was referred to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Rome University "La Sapienza" 16.7% of them had received HRT. 587 out of the 3,400 women were recruited for a comparative study, including four groups. To assess statistical significance of HRT in determining AUB, and/or endometrial thickness related to malignant disease the chi-square test was usedAn increase in the endometrial thickness occurred significantly more often in women on HRT (p < 0.03) as well as the percentage of AUB (p < 0.0001). No difference in the incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma was reported between the HRT and the non HRT groups.In postmenopausal women using HRT we can confirm that a higher incidence of signs (AUB, endometrial thickness > or = 5 mm) does not coincide with a higher incidence of malignant pathology. The data obtained from the recruited patients was arranged and evaluated by the most suitable methods for screening endometrial adenocarcinoma. According to our experience, we believe a cut-off point of 8 mm to be significant (p < 0.001) to perform an hysteroscopy and biopsy except for asymptomatic patients on HRT.
