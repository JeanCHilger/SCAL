Mucin-producing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with portal vein thrombosis. Mucin-producing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is rare. Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-defined tumor with marked dilatation of the left intrahepatic bile duct and portal vein thrombosis. We performed extended left hepatectomy and portal vein thrombectomy. A massive amount of mucin was observed in the left intrahepatic bile duct. Histological examination revealed noninvasive and well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma.
