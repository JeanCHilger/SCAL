The influence of the clinical course and diagnosis on the length of surgical stays. The length of stay (LOS) is one of the major determinants of rising costs in surgical patient care. We studied the timing of the diagnostic procedures performed in 323 surgical patients admitted to 8 surgical departments of a large hospital. Of these: 50 underwent gastrectomy, 28 colectomy, 90 biliary tract (BT) operation, 94 appendectomy and 61 saphenectomy. The average total and preoperative LOS were respectively 27 and 11 days in the gastrectomy group, 26 and 10 in the colectomy group, 10 and 4 in the appendectomy group, 20 and 11 in the BT group, 12 and 6 in the saphenectomy group. The LOS was not affected by the presence of a benign or malignant lesion in gastrectomy and colectomy. In the appendectomy and BT groups, patients admitted from the emergency room had a significantly lower total LOS when compared to elective admissions (8 vs 12 and 9 vs 21 days respectively, p < 0.01). The multiple regression model showed that global and preoperative LOS were influenced by the number of instrumental exams (contrastographic, endoscopic, echographic).
