Anti-Müllerian hormone serum concentrations in normoovulatory and anovulatory women of reproductive age. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations correlate with the number of antral follicles as well as age and constitute an endocrine marker for ovarian aging. In normogonadotropic anovulatory infertile women [World Health Organization (WHO) class 2], the number of early antral follicles is usually increased. To investigate whether AMH concentrations are increased, serum levels in 128 WHO 2 women were compared with those in 41 normoovulatory premenopausal women of similar age. Serum AMH concentrations are significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in WHO 2 patients [median, 7.6 micro g/liter (range, 0.1-40.0)], compared with controls [median, 2.1 micro g/liter (0.1-7.4)]. In 106 patients presenting with polycystic ovaries (PCOs) (>/==" BORDER="0">12 follicles/ovary measuring 2-9 mm and/or an ovarian volume > 10 ml), AMH levels were elevated [9.3 micro g/liter (1.8-40.0)], compared with 22 patients without PCOs [6.4 micro g/liter (0.1-22.1)] (P < 0.0001). In WHO 2 patients, AMH concentrations correlated with features characteristic for polycystic ovary syndrome such as LH concentrations (r = 0.331 P = 0.0001), testosterone levels (r = 0.477, P = 0.0001), mean ovarian volume (r = 0.421
