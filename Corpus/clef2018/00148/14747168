Heterotopic Caesarean scar pregnancy combined with intrauterine pregnancy successfully treated with embryo aspiration for selective embryo reduction: case report. Ectopic pregnancy situated in a Caesarean section scar is a rare but potentially life-threatening event. Because of its rarity, there are no universal treatment guidelines to manage this condition. We report a case of IVF-induced triplet heterotopic pregnancy of early gestational age that included one Caesarean scar pregnancy diagnosed as early as 6 weeks gestation. Treatment with embryo aspiration under vaginal ultrasonography for selective embryo reduction was given and the concurrent intrauterine twin pregnancy was preserved successfully.
