Pre-operative endoscopic ultrasonography can optimise the management of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with abnormal liver function tests as the sole risk factor for choledocholithiasis: a prospective study. Pre-operative endosonography has been proposed as a cost-effective procedure in the management of patients who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy having an intermediate risk of common bile duct stones. We prospectively evaluated the impact of pre-operative endosonography on the management of patients facing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with abnormal liver function tests as the sole risk factor for choledocolithiasis.Among 587 consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 47 (8%) patients having one or more abnormal liver function tests but a normal appearance of common bile duct at abdominal ultrasound, underwent pre-operative endosonography. In patients with endosonography-detected common bile duct stones, a pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed, or an intra-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was scheduled. In all endosonography-negative patients, an intra-operative trans-cystic cholangiography was performed.Endosonography detected common bile duct stones in nine patients (19%) but only in five of them stones were radiologically confirmed (PPV 0.55). Endosonography-detected stones were confirmed in four of four (100%) patients in whom cholangiography was performed within 1 week, but only in one of five (20%) patients in whom radiology was further delayed (P < 0.05). In three of four cases (75%), stones detected at endosonography but not confirmed at X-rays, were smaller than 2.0 mm. Among 38 patients with negative endosonography, common bile duct stones were found in two patients (NPV 0.95), whereas unplanned endoscopic stone extraction was needed only in one patient (NPV 0.97).Pre-operative endosonography can spare unnecessary pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography as well as inappropriate scheduling of intra-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiography in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with abnormal liver function tests. To maximise the impact of endosonography on the management of these patients, the procedure should be performed immediately before laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
