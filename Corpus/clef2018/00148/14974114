Prenatal diagnosis of enteric duplication cyst of the tongue. Cysts located on the tongue are rare and usually diagnosed in childhood. Here we report on the prenatal diagnosis of an unusual cystic malformation of the tongue with heterotopic intestinal tissue explored by prenatal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and on its surgical treatment and histological examination. The prenatal differential diagnoses as well as perinatal management of cystic lesions of the tongue are reviewed.
