CT biliary cystoscopy of gallbladder polyps. CT virtual endoscopy has been used in the study of various organs of body including the biliary tract, however, CT virtual endoscopy in diagnosis of gallbladder polyps has not yet been reported. This study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of CT virtual endoscopy in polyps of the gallbladder.Thirty-two cases of gallbladder polyps were examined by CT virtual endoscopy, ultrasound, CT scan with oral biliary contrast separately and confirmed by operation and pathology. CT biliary cystoscopic findings were analyzed and compared with those of ultrasound and CT scan with oral biliary contrast, and evaluated in comparison with operative and pathologic findings in all cases.The detection rate of gallbladder polyps was 93.8%(90/96), 96.9%(93/96) and 79.2%(76/96) for CT cystoscopy, ultrasound and CT scan with oral contrast, respectively. CT biliary cystoscopy corresponded well with ultrasound as well as pathology in demonstrating the location, size and configuration of polyps. CT endoscopy was superior to ultrasound in viewing the polyps in a more precise way, 3 dimensionally from any angle in space, and showing the surface in details. CT biliary cystoscopy was also superior to CT scan with oral biliary contrast in terms of observation of the base of polyps for the presence of a pedicle, detection rates as well as image quality. The smallest polyp detected by CT biliary cystoscopy was measured 1.5 mm x 2.2 mm x 2.5 mm.CT biliary cystoscopy is a non-invasive and accurate technique for diagnosis and management of gallbladder polyps.
