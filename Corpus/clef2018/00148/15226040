Clinical, demographic, and psychological characteristics of new, asymptomatic participants in a transvaginal ultrasound screening program for ovarian cancer. Attitudinal, mood, and personality variables have been identified as predictors of uptake of routine screening for a variety of cancers, including those of the breast, cervix, and colon. Little information exists, however, regarding characteristics of participants in ovarian cancer (OC) screening.Asymptomatic women (n = 312 mean age = 57.45 yearsAnalyses revealed the OCS group was characterized not only by more OC-specific distress and a more extensive family history of OC but also by less optimism and less knowledge of OC risk factors. Group membership was unrelated to beliefs about the efficacy of TVS screening.Results have implications for development of programs to increase appropriate participation in OC screening programs.
