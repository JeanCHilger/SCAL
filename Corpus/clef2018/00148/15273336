Intraoperative US in patients undergoing surgery for liver neoplasms: comparison with MR imaging. To retrospectively compare intraoperative ultrasonography (US) and preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with contrast material enhancement for the depiction of liver lesions in patients undergoing hepatic resection.A radiologist (D.V.S.) and a surgeon (K.K.T.) retrospectively identified 79 patients (36 female and 43 male patients age range, 10-78 yearsOf 159 lesions, 138 (86.7%) were identified at both MR imaging and intraoperative US. Twelve additional lesions (7.5%) in 10 patients were detected only at intraoperative US (eight metastases, one hepatocellular carcinoma, one cholangiocarcinoma, one hemangioma, and one biliary hamartoma). Both modalities failed to depict nine lesions (5.6%) (four metastases, four hepatocellular carcinomas, and one cholangiocarcinoma). The sensitivities of MR imaging and intraoperative US for liver lesion depiction were 86.7% and 94.3%, respectively. Surgical management was altered on the basis of the intraoperative US findings in only three of 10 patients (4%).Contrast-enhanced MR imaging is as sensitive as intraoperative US in depicting liver lesions before hepatic resection.
