Endometrial and subendometrial perfusion are impaired in women with unexplained subfertility. We used three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) to examine the periodic changes in endometrial development and subendometrial vascularity during the normal menstrual cycle in 29 women with unexplained subfertility and 19 controls.3D-PDA was performed on alternate days from day 3 of the cycle until ovulation and then every 4 days until menses. VOCAL (Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis) and shell-imaging were used to define and to quantify the power Doppler signal within the endometrial and subendometrial regions producing indices of their relative vascularity.Women with unexplained subfertility demonstrated significant changes with time (P<0.001) in the indices of vascularity within the endometrium and subendometrium during the menstrual cycle characterized by a pre-ovulatory peak and post-ovulatory fall. These changes mirrored those observed in the control group but were significantly reduced in the endometrium and subendometrium during the mid-late follicular phase and early luteal phase. There were no differences in endometrial thickness or volume between the groups or in the plasma concentrations of estradiol or progesterone.Endometrial and subendometrial vascularity are significantly reduced in women with unexplained subfertility during the mid-late follicular phase irrespective of estradiol or progesterone concentrations and endometrial morphometry.
