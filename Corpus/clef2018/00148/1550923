Comparison of ultrasound and E.R.C.P. in the detection of the cause of obstructive biliary disease. The value of ultrasound (US) in determining the cause and site of biliary obstruction was critically evaluated and compared to endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP), in a prospective study performed on 120 consecutive patients. The final diagnosis was based on surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography or a combination of other examinations. Ultrasound successfully differentiated obstructive from non obstructive jaundice in 96% of the patients, comparing well with the results ERCP. US correctly defined the cause of obstruction in 71% of the patients with ductal stones, in 90% of the patients with tumoural bile duct obstruction, but only in 59% of the patients with chronic pancreatitis.
