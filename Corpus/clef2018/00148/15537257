Cervical ultrasound assessment for predicting the risk of premature delivery. Cervix is very important structure that separates the fetus from external environment, it can be visualized very precisely by transvaginal ultrasonography. Cervical length in the pregnancy is one of the predictors of preterm delivery and diagnosis of cervical incompetence.We have investigated 119 pregnant women with diagnosis of preterm labor(n-62), with preterm labor complicated by diabetes mellitus(41) and hypertension (16). Transvaginal sonography was used to measure cervical length between 23 and 29 weeks gestation. Ultrasound examination was performed using 2000 with 5.0 MHz transvaginal transducer. The following measurements were obtained: endocervical canal length between the internal and external os, funneling of the cervix, funnel width, funnel length.The mean endocervical length was 16.3 +/- 0.5 mm in pregnancies delivered before term (n = 19) and 30.1 +/- 0.6 mm in pregnancies delivered at term (n = 100). The mean endocervical length measured in pregnant women without pregnancy complications other than preterm labor was 15.2 +/- 0.6 mm, in women with diagnosis of preterm labour complicated by diabetes mellitus was 16.7 mm + 1.0 and complicated by hypertension 15.9 mm + 0.8. No significant relationships were shown between length of the cervix in pregnancy complicated by diabetes mellitus, hypertension and uncomplicated pregnancy. The mean endocervical length in diabetic pregnancy was 34.7 +/- 4.7 mm pregnancy with hypertension 32.9 +/- 5.8 mm and uncomplicated pregnancy 35.6 +/- 3.8 mm.Cervical length measured by ultrasonography between 23 and 29 week of pregnancy is very important predictor of preterm delivery. We found significant relationships between cervical length in pregnancies delivered before and at term. No significant relationships were shown between the length of the cervix and investigated pregnancy complications.
