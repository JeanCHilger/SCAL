Ovarian masses during adolescence: clinical, ultrasonographic and pathologic findings, serum tumor markers and endocrinological profile. This retrospective study was undertaken to assess the epidemiological and clinical features, laboratory findings, preoperative work-up, surgical treatment and pathologic findings in adolescents with ovarian cysts. All adolescents who were referred to our institution and had been operated on because of a diagnosed ovarian mass, from January 1997 to June 2003, were included in this study. Forty-four cases of women with an ovarian mass were retrospectively analyzed. These patients, aged between 12 and 21 years, had 47 ovarian masses (three patients had bilateral lesions), of which 49% were non-neoplastic and 51% were neoplastic. Of the neoplastic lesions, 62.5% were germ cell tumors, 20.8% were epithelial and 16.7% were sex cord-stromal tumors. Of the neoplastic tumors, 95.8% were benign while 4.2% were malignant. Procedures included 30 operative laparoscopies (68.20%) and 14 exploratory laparotomies (31.8%). Simple excision of the ovarian cyst was performed in 39 cases (88.6%). According to our study, most of the adolescents with an ovarian cyst underwent an operation because of a neoplastic lesion. The majority of ovarian tumors occurring in adolescents are non-epithelial in origin, and germ cell tumors are the most common histological type. Ultrasound examination is one of the most important diagnostic tools. Preoperative diagnostic approach of these patients should always include careful history taking, physical examination, imaging and evaluation of serum assays. Gynecologists who care for young girls must be familiar with the differential diagnosis of ovarian masses whose surgical treatment should be conservative when appropriate, so that hormonal status and future fertility are not compromised in this group of patients.
