The significance of intrauterine lesions detected by ultrasound in asymptomatic postmenopausal patients. A retrospective study on 82 women with an incidental sonographic finding suspected to be intrauterine polyps was undertaken to assess the histopathologic characteristics of such polyps utilising operative hysteroscopy. Endometrial polyps were found in 68 patients, submucousal myomas in 7, atrophic endometrium in 6 and thickened proliferative endometrium was found in 1 patient. Simple hyperplasia was found in one polyp but neither endometrial carcinoma nor complex hyperplasia was found. The total complication rate was 3.6%. It appears that the risk of endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women with asymptomatic endometrial polyps is low, although a larger series is required to confirm this finding.
