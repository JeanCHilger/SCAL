Polyp detection with MDCT: a phantom-based evaluation of the impact of dose and spatial resolution. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of dose and spatial resolution on the detection of colonic polyps using a 4-MDCT scanner.Twenty-four latex phantoms that simulate the large bowel and contain artificial polyps of different sizes and shapes were constructed. The polyps were divided into three size groups (diameter, 0-2, 2-5, and 5-10 mm) and were classified into four shape groups: pedunculated broad-basedAt a constant dose (i.e., dose-length product [DLP]), the polyp detection rate increased with increasing axial spatial resolution. For the standard protocol (2.50-mm slice thickness, 1.5 pitch), the detection rate for all polyp sizes decreased from approximately 70% at 100 mA to 55% at 40 mA. Between a 60- and 100-mA tube current, the detection rate for the largest polyps (> 5 mm) was almost constant, close to 90%.The detection of polyps in the large bowel using a standard protocol can be improved without dose penalty by increasing the axial spatial resolution of the image acquisition and adjusting the tube current setting. If the analysis can be restricted to polyps larger than 5 mm, the dose can be substantially reduced without compromising the detection rate.
