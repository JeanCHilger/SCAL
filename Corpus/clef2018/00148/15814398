Follicle tracking of women receiving clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction. Forty-five cycles of forty subfertile women were monitored with follicle tracking. Thirty women were anovulatory and 10 had unexplained infertility. Thirty women responded to the initial dose of Clomiphene Citrate (CC) and 10 remained anovulatory. Of those who ovulated with the first dose of CC, 25 developed one follicle, 2 developed 2 follicles and 3 developed three follicles. All the women that produced three follicles belonged in the unexplained infertility group. Eight women from the anovulatory group developed 1 follicle, two developed 2 follicles and 8 failed to respond. Provision of universal follicle tracking proved to be time consuming and required significant resources. Our results indicate that if there is a place for selective monitoring that should include women with unexplained infertility. We should also offer the first scan at around day 12 of the cycle as this could detect multiple follicle development. Patients with Polycystic Ovaries that start on 50 mgs of CC may not necessarily need follicle tracking as they usually do not respond to that dose.
