Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma. We present the case of an 85 year old male who was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain and jaundice. Different explorations were performed for this reason, with a mass observed in his 2nd duodenal portion. Histological study showed that it was a duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma. The clinical characteristics of this infrequent tumour are described and we review the diagnosis and treatment.
