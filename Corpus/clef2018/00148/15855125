Imaging of transposed ovaries in patients with cervical carcinoma. Lateral ovarian transposition is a surgical procedure performed in premenopausal women with pelvic malignancies in which the ovaries are surgically displaced from the pelvis, before radiation therapy. In this article, we present the imaging features of normal transposed ovaries as well as the spectrum of abnormalities associated with lateral ovarian transposition.After lateral ovarian transposition, it is important to recognize the ovaries to avoid confusing them with peritoneal implants. In addition, benign ovarian lesions must be distinguished from primary and secondary malignancies.
