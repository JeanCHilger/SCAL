Outcome of surveillance and prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy in asymptomatic women at high risk for ovarian cancer. Women at high risk of ovarian cancer are currently offered two options: either surveillance or prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The efficacy and outcome of surveillance remain unclear.We performed a retrospective study. Between 1994 and 2000, we screened 383 high-risk women, of which 152 were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Surveillance consisted of annual gynecological examination, transvaginal ultrasound, and serum CA125 measurement. Exploratory or prophylactic surgery was performed in selected cases.There were no screen-detected primary ovarian cancers. Abnormal results at surveillance were observed in 74 (19.3%) of women in 47 (63.5%), the abnormalities disappeared spontaneously. Exploratory surgery was performed in 20 (27.0%) women in whom one malignancy was found (metastatic breast cancer in the ovary). A rising CA125 value prompted further (non-surgical) evaluation in three women with a history of breast cancer: recurrent breast cancer was diagnosed in two womenOvarian cancer surveillance has limited sensitivity, and a high number of false positive findings. This can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, possibly resulting in surgery-related complications. It is important to inform high-risk women of these limitations. For now, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy remains the optimal risk-reducing strategy for women at high risk.
