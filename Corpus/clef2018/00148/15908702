Lebanese guidelines for osteoporosis assessment and treatment: who to test? What measures to use? When to treat? With the demographic explosion of the population worldwide, the human, social, and economic costs of osteoporosis will continue to rise. It is estimated that the magnitude of the problem might be even larger in developing countries, including those in the Middle East. Although several organizations and countries have developed or adapted guidelines to their local needs, as of today there are no guidelines for osteoporosis assessment in the Middle East. In April 2002, a panel of osteoporosis experts met and discussed practice guidelines for osteoporosis assessment and treatment in Lebanon. The process, which involved an overview of international guidelines as well as local data on osteoporosis, resulted in a draft for Lebanese guidelines that addressed three main questions: "Who to test?" "What measures to use?" and "When to treat?". Representatives from five major Lebanese societies (Endocrinology, Rheumatology, Orthopedics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Radiology) subsequently reviewed, discussed, and officially endorsed the guidelines after revisions. The Lebanese guidelines were also endorsed by the Eastern Mediterranean branch of the World Health Organization.
