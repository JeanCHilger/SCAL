Endometrial lesions causing uterine bleeding in postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. It is generally accepted, that raloxifene administration does not have adverse effects on the uterus. We report the cases of two relatively young postmenopausal patients, who presented with vaginal bleeding, due to endometrial pathology, approximately 1 year after the initiation of raloxifene administration. The women were 43 and 44 years old, and received 60 mg/day of oral raloxifene for 11.5 and 10.5 months, respectively. In both cases, raloxifene was given for osteoporosis prevention in the absence of vasomotor symptoms. The first patient underwent Pipelle-biopsy and hysteroscopy with histopathology revealing simple endometrial hyperplasia. The second patient underwent hysteroscopy with removal of an endometrial polyp, with no histopathological signs of malignancy. Continuation of raloxifene administration was decided in both cases, and follow-up did not reveal any sign of recurrence. Uterine bleeding may rarely occur in postmenopausal women under raloxifene therapy. Patients should be encouraged to report bleeding or spotting and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic management should follow as in any other case.
