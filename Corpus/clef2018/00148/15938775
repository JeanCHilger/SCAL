Treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome with anovulatory infertility by ultrasound-guided immature follicle aspiration. To investigate the effect of ultrasound-guided immature follicle aspiration (IMFA) on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in women with anovulatory infertility, such as the endocrinology of the patients and the basic follicles number in the ovaries, and to observe the ovarian response to human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) stimulation and pregnancy after the therapy.Seventy-one PCOS patients were involved in this trial, and divided into 2 groups. Thirty-seven patients of group I were primed with slight amount of hMG, the other 34 patients did not use hMG. Ultrasound-guided IMFA was performed 36 hour after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. In the next cycle, the basal endocrinology and the basic number of follicles were checked, then IMFA were performed continuously until the basic number of follicles were under 10 per ovary. Afterwards, hMG were used to stimulate ovulation and the pregnant results were followed up.There were 37 cases (88 cycles) of PCOS patients in group I and 34 cases (87 cycles) in group II. After 2 to 3 treatment cycles, the testosterone level became normal in all of patients. The basic follicle number decreased to less than 10 per ovary in 33 cases (89%) in group I and 28 cases (82%) in group II. After hCG stimulation, all of them ovulated. Only 2 patients developed slight ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Within 3 months after the procedure, 36 patients (51%) became pregnant by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocol after IMFA.Immature follicle aspiration treatment can improve the abnormal endocrinology, decrease the basic follicle number of the ovary, and achieve pregnancy in following COH cycles, meanwhile, avoid OHSS in PCOS patients.
