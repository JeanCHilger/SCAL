The value of ultrasound harmonic imaging in the diagnostics of gall bladder cholesterol polyps. The aim of the study was to assess the value of harmonic imaging in US evaluation of gall bladder cholesterol polyps. Material comprises 40 patients with pathology of gall bladder diagnosed in US examination. 10 patients from this group with gall bladder cholesterol polyps diagnosed in US were included into the study. In each patient supplementary US examination in the harmonic mode was performed. The quality of images in the harmonic mode was better. The walls of the gall bladder were more distinct. The polyps were more evident on harmonic images. THI enable more precise measurements of the polyps. In three cases in the standard mode the inspissated bile was found in gall bladder, and in those patients polyps were difficult to assess. Examination of those patients in the harmonic mode excluded the presence of the bile sludge, and facilitates the assessment of the polyps. In four patients on harmonic images more polyps were found than in the standard mode. In the harmonic mode the level of artifacts generated by the body wall is reduced and contrast resolution is increased due to reduction in noise level. The visualization of gallbladder is improved in the harmonic mode. The assessment of gallbladder polyps in the harmonic mode is easier. The polyps are easily seen, assessment of their margins and size is facilitated by harmonic imaging. The number of polyps revealed in US examination is larger in the harmonic mode.
