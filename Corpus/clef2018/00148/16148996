Diagnosis and treatment of benign duodenal tumor. To investigate the diagnosis and treatment of benign duodenal tumor.Clinical data of 14 patients with benign duodenal tumor confirmed pathologically or by operation from Oct.1988 to Oct.2001 were analyzed retrospectively.Of 14 patients, 5 had Brunner's grand adenoma, 4 mesenchymoma, 2 leiomyoma, 2 hemangioma, 1 lipoma. Upper abdominal discomfort (64% ), gastrointestinal bleeding(50% ) and abdominal pain(20% ) were common manifestations. All cases received gastroscopy and only one case was diagnosed. Five cases received duodenoscope and the diagnosis was confirmed in 4 cases. Nine cases received hypotonic duodenography and lesions were found in 8 cases. Digital subtraction angiography was performed in 3 cases and detected all lesions. Computed tomographic scan and B-ultrasound were performed in 2 cases and only one case was diagnosed. Eleven cases (79% ) got definite diagnosis before operation. Tumor resection was performed in all patients. Perioperative death occurred in one patient. No recurrence occurred in 13 cases after following up from 2 to 11 years.Upper abdominal discomfort and gastrointestinal bleeding are common features in patients with benign duodenal tumor.
