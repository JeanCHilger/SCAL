Ultrasonographical predictive factors of ovarian response to stimulation prior to in vitro fertilization. Evaluate whether ovarian antral follicles number, ovarian volume and ovarian area are predictive of ovarian response.Prospective cohort analysis of 41 women with normal basal serum FSH concentration, who were undergoing their IVF cycle. The ovarian antral follicle number, the ovarian volume and area were determined by transvaginal ultrasonography on the third menstrual day for 20 women, and after pituitary suppression for 21 women. The main outcome measures are the number of follicles the day of HCG with a diameter >or=14 mm, the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of embryos.The antral follicle count was significantly correlated to the number of follicles (R=0.7 P<0.001), to the number of oocytes retrieved (R=0.46The total antral follicle number on day 3 has a predictive value for favourable IVF outcome. Because this sonographic count is easy, safe and inexpensive it should be performed prior every IVF cycle.
