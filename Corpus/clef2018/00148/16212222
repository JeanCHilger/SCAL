Normal uterine size in women of reproductive age in northern Islamic Republic of Iran. To determine the efficacy of ultrasonographic assessment of uterus size in women of reproductive age, we conducted a cross-sectional analytic study of 231 women aged 15-45 years in Babol, northern Islamic Republic of Iran. Mean uterus size was 86.6 mm x 49.6 mm x 40.6 mm overall, 72.8 mm x 42.8 mm x 32.4 mm for nulliparous women and 90.8 mm x 51.7 mm x 43.0 mm for multiparous women. Mean age was 31.7 +/- 9.6 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.7 +/- 4.0 kg/m2. Uterus size was significantly associated with parity and age but not with BMI. Our findings show a greater mean uterus size than reported by others. Ultrasonographic measurement of uterus size is valuable for predicting pathologies associated with abnormal uterine size.
