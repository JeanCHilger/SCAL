Laparoscopic cholecystocholangiography as an effective alternative exploratory laparotomy for the differentiation of biliary atresia. Exploratory laparotomy with cholecystocholangiography is often performed for the definitive diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA) when radiological and biochemical studies are inconclusive. Laparoscopic cholecystocholangiography (LCC) has recently been introduced as an alternative procedure to avoid unnecessary laparotomy. We discuss the advantages and indications of LCC based on our experience of performing this diagnostic procedure in four infants with prolonged direct hyperbilirubinemia.We performed LCC in four infants by direct percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder by inserting a cholangiocatheter into the gallbladder or cystic duct. The decision to perform LCC was based on ultrasonography and computed tomography findings of an atrophic gallbladder with a patent lumen, although analysis of duodenal juice and hepatobiliary scintigraphy showed no sign of the excretion of bile into the small intestine.In three infants, LCC did not show the entire biliary system, and laparotomy was necessary to confirm the diagnosis of BA. However, in the other patient LCC showed a normal biliary system and BA was excluded.Laparoscopic cholecystocholangiography may be useful for the differential diagnosis of BA in patients with a patent gallbladder when imaging and biochemical findings are inconclusive. Furthermore, unnecessary exploratory laparotomy may be avoided in patients without BA.
