High-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia in a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and is characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and tumors of other organs and sites. A 58-year-old woman with FAP syndrome and previous total colectomy presented for routine follow-up examination. Abdominal ultrasound and subsequent endoscopic evaluation revealed ampullary and duodenal polyps, as well as inhomogeneity of the pancreatic head. A pancreaticoduodenectomy confirmed multiple duodenal adenomas. In addition, high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN-3) was found in the smaller pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic precancerous lesions have only rarely been described in FAP, including 2 pancreatic duct adenomas and 2 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. A review of the world English literature revealed no reports of PanIN-3 in association with FAP. Further studies are required to determine if patients with FAP are at increased risk for pancreatic premalignant lesions.
