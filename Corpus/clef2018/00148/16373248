Cerebral artery hemodynamics in polycystic ovary syndrome. The aim of the present study was to investigate hemodynamic changes in the medial cerebral artery and also the internal carotid artery in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and polycystic ovaries (PCO).Twenty-eight patients with PCOS, 16 patients with PCO and 24 healthy control subjects were included in the study. Blood flow rate, pulsatility index and back pressure of both the medial cerebral artery and the internal carotid artery were determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and the results compared between groups.There were no significant differences between the groups in bilateral medial cerebral artery and internal carotid artery blood flow rate, pulsatility index and back pressure.Our results do not indicate whether the risk of cerebrovascular events will increase for PCOS patients in middle and advanced age, but do show that changes in cerebral hemodynamics are not likely in PCOS at an early stage.
