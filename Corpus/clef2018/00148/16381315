Oxidative metabolism of uterine smooth muscular tissue in norm and neoplastic growth (clinical and experimental studies). Complex echoscopic, histological and EPR- (electron paramagnetic resonance)-spectroscopic study of uterine smooth muscular tissue was performed using normal and neoplastic samples obtained from women of reproductive age as well as from experimental animals (guinea pigs) with normo- and hyperestrogenemia. It was found that as compared with normal myometrium, the proliferating uterine myoma had an extensive peripheral vascularization of myomatous nodule with a decreased resistance index, which is a marker of myocyte proliferative activity in the myomatous nodule. These data were supported by histological findings in material obtained at operations, which demonstrated the signs of proliferative growth. Using EPR, it was shown that uterine myoma was characterized by an estrogen-dependent intensification of the processes of free-radical oxidation, which correlated with a degree of hormonal changes. Accumulation of free-radical oxidation activators and of ions of ferritin-unbound iron in the tumor tissue is indicative of the intensification of proliferative activity of the cells of uterine myoma and is one of the risk factors of neoplastic growth. Hyperestrogenemia, characteristic for the myoma development, is one of the reasons for NO synthesis activation, which, in the oxidative stress, is transformed into cytotoxic peroxinitrite, contributing to further intensification of an oxidative stress and malignant transformation of tissues.
