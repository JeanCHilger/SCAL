Unstable thorax after a coughing fit in a 70-year-old adipose patient. Lung herniation is uncommon and has been defined as the protrusion of pulmonary tissue and pleural membranes through defects of the thoracic wall. In combination with rib fractures caused by single massive coughing fit, spontaneous lung herniation has previously been reported only three times. To our knowledge, in combination with multiple rib fractures and flail chest, as in the case presented, it has never been reported. Large lung hernias should be treated with prosthetic patches because of unlikely spontaneous recovery and the risk of incarceration. In our case, an anterolateral thoracotomy was performed. After resection of the herniated pleural membrane, a 30 x 30-cm polypropylene mesh was fixed to the diaphragm and with nonresorbable pericostal sutures to the thoracic wall. With this procedure, the loss in stability caused by the ruptured anterior intercostal muscular system could be restored. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was dismissed on day 12.
