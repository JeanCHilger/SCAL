The approach diagnoses of ovarian tumors by echography. In more of positive diagnosis, echography makes it possible to approach the histological nature of ovarian tumors. From a series of 106 cases of ovarian tumours, we propose to evaluate this approach by analysing the various echographic signs according to histological types'. The serous cysts are anechogen in 77,7% of the cases. The mucinous cysts are anechogen in 71,4% and finely echogen in 28,5% of the cases. The dermoid cysts are echogen in 47,3% and heterogeneous in 26,3%. The endometriosic cysts can be finely echogen (45%), heterogeneous (25%) or echogen (20%). The malignant tumors are of mixed aspect in 54,55% of the cases. The sensitivity of echography for the malignant tumors is 81,82% whereas specificity is 75,79%. The negative predictive value is 97,3%, and the positive predictive value is 28,13%. The size of the tumor, the vegetations and the partitions are also studied: a size lower than 5 cm and the absence of partition and vegetation are synonymous with benignity in all the cases.
