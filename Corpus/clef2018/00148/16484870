A case of postoperative liver metastasis from bile duct carcinoma responding to transarterial chemoembolization. A 77-year-old man underwent pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for bile duct carcinoma in October 2000. Histological diagnosis was moderately-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, pT 2 (ss, pHinf 0, pPanc 1, pPV 0, pA 0), pN 0, and final Stage II. The patient was periodically observed after operation. In September 2003, follow-up abdominal CT examinations revealed a liver tumor, 89 x 62 x 60 mm in size, at the anterior segment. Transarterial chemoembolization with 5-FU, epirubicin, mitomycin C and superabsorbent polymer microsphere was initiated under the diagnosis of liver metastasis. After completion of 4 chemoembolizations, the tumor responded partially and diminished to 50 x 16 x 14 mm in CT and superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MRI. Currently, the patient is free from any signs of relapse.
