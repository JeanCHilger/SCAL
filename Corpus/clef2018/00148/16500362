High plasma concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls and phthalate esters in women with endometriosis: a prospective case control study. The objective of this study was to detect the probable association between polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phthalate esters (PEs), and the occurrence of endometriosis in a prospective case control study. We found that PCBs and PEs may be instrumental in the etiology of endometriosis.
