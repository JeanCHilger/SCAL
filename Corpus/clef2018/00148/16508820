Complications in laparoscopic myomectomy. An increasing number of patients with fibroids wish to retain their uterus without improving fertility. We evaluated the rate of complications in our teaching hospital and its association with patients' age.Chart records of 351 patients were evaluated according to patients' age.A total of 654 fibroids were removed. Mean size of fibroids was 5.3 cm mean duration of surgery was 113.2 min. Blood transfusion was necessary in one patient. The intraoperative complication rate was 2.6% and postoperative complications occurred in 5.7% of patients. Sonographic evaluation showed a hyperechogenic scar in 29.2%. A total of 57.1% pregnancies ended in term infants. No uterine rupture was reported. As a sign of contentment, 87% of patients would choose the same procedure again. Indication for myomectomy in elder women was more often associated with uncertain sonographic findings due to intraligamentary localization.Morbidity was low. Age had no impact. Laparoscopic myomectomy can be offered to all women.
