Adenomyosis: not such an elusive diagnosis any longer. Adenomyosis has been an elusive diagnosis until recently due to the need for a histological confirmation of diagnosis post-hysterectomy. This commentary focuses on the role of non-invasive imaging techniques that have become available for use in the diagnosis of adenomyosis in women with an intact uterus. These include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). With improvements in imaging modalities it has now become feasible to establish a diagnosis of adenomyosis without hysterectomy, to exclude additional pathology and to institute conservative symptomatic treatment and monitoring.
