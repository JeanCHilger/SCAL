Precocious puberty caused by McCune-Albright syndrome in a girl aged 6 years and 9 months. The McCune-Albright syndrome is characterised by polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, "cafe-au-lait" spots and autonomous hyperfunction of various endocrine organs. The authors present the case of a girl at the age of 6 years 9 months with precocious puberty (thelarche III, menarche). High estradiol level (204 pg/ml) and low gonadoptopins concentration as well as their level after GnRH administration suggested ovarian autonomy. Ovarian cysts were found on pelvic ultrasound. Other endocrine abnormalities were excluded. Single "cafe-au-lait" spot was found on the patient skin. Scintigraphy, radiography and computed tomography scans showed fibrous dysplastic bones in the right tibia and in maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
