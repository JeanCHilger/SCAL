Magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of mid- and long-term complication after liver transplantation. To assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mid- and long-term complication monitoring after liver transplantation.Twenty-one recipients receiving orthotropic liver transplantation between Feb 2003 and May 2005 were enrolled in this study. FLASH T(1)-weighted, T(2)-weighted fast spin echo, T(2)-weighted fat suppression, dynamic gadolinium-enhanced, MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and three-dimensional dynamic gadolinium-enhanced FISP MRA images were obtained.Of the 21 patients, bile duct complications were detected in all cases and liver arterial and venous complications in 8 cases. Liver cancer relapse occurred in 5 cases and allograft failure in 4.MR imaging allows effective monitoring of mid- and long-term complications of liver transplantation, which provides valuable clues for their clinical treatment.
