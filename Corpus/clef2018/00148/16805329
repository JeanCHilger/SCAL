Palliative percutaneous drainage in malignant biliary obstruction. Part 1: indications and preprocedure evaluation. A diagnosis of liver metastasis, periportal adenopathy, or hepatobiliary cancer often is accompanied by findings of biliary obstruction. Malignant biliary obstruction frequently is associated with pruritus, anorexia, cholangitis, or hyperbilirubinemia, which that precludes treatment with chemotherapeutic agents that are excreted or metabolized hepatically. In patients with low biliary obstruction, endoscopic stent placement may accomplish drainage of the entire biliary tree without the need for an external device. Patients with high bile duct obstruction, on the other hand, may need a percutaneous approach to drain the target ducts and avoid draining an atrophic segment or lobe. This first of a series of two articles concerning palliative percutaneous biliary intervention will review the indications for biliary drainage and the preprocedure evaluation of this complicated patient population.
