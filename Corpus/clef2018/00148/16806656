The incidence and characteristics of uterine bleeding during postoperative GnRH agonist treatment combined with tibolone add-back therapy in endometriosis patients of reproductive age. This study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence and the factors associated with uterine bleeding while taking GnRH agonist treatment combined with tibolone add-back therapy in endometriosis patients of reproductive age.The medical records of 188 endometriosis (stages III-IV) patients of reproductive age receiving postoperative GnRH agonist treatment combined with tibolone add-back therapy for 6 months were reviewed. Clinical features were analyzed and compared between the two groups: Group A, patients without an episode of uterine bleeding (n=137) and Group B, patients that had experienced uterine bleeding (n=51).Demographic profiles were not different in the two groups. The incidence of uterine bleeding was 27.1% and irregular spotting was the most frequent bleeding pattern. The proportion of patients who received ovarian surgery during pelviscopy was higher in Group B (p<0.05), but other clinical characteristics were not different between two groups.The incidence of uterine bleeding was 27.1%. And, the proportion of patients who received ovarian surgery was higher in patients with uterine bleeding.
