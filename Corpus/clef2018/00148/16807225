Early microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction is not accompanied by structural arterial injury in polycystic ovary syndrome. During the last decade cardiovascular risk factors and endothelial dysfunction have been shown to be present early in life in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The aim of the present study was a global assessment of abnormalities in the arterial bed of young women with PCOS by non-invasive, reproducible methods.27 women with PCOS and 27 control women of comparable age, body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were studied. Macrovascular function was assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) on the brachial artery. Nitrate-induced dilatation (NID) was performed to exclude a vascular smooth muscle cells injury. Microvascular function was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography studying forearm blood flow. Arterial structure was evaluated by ultrasonographic assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery.FMD values were lower in women with PCOS compared to controls (PCOS: 3.84+/-0.74% vs. controls: 9.83+/-0.97%, P<0.001), but no difference was observed in NID (PCOS: 16.59+/-1.84% vs. controls: 16.64+/-2.05%, P=0.98) values. The time required for reactive hyperemia to reach peak value, a plethysmography parameter, was longer in PCOS women (PCOS: 20.63+/-4.67 sec vs. controls: 10.38+/-5.11 sec, P=0.02). No difference was observed in the combined IMT among the studied groups (PCOS: 0.49+/-0.01 mm v.s. controls: 0.51+/-0.02 mm, P=0.19).Using non invasive methodologies endothelial dysfunction in the macrocirculation and early impairment in the microcirculation were demonstrated in young women with PCOS who had normal profile of glycemia, lipidemia and blood pressure, and no evidence of structural arterial impairment.
