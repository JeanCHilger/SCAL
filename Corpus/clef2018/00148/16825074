Diagnostic hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonography: prediction of intrauterine polyps and myomas. To compare the positive predictive value (PPV) of diagnostic hysteroscopy (DH) and saline infusion sonography (SIS) for the detection of myomas and polyps in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding.All consecutive women referred to our University Hospital diagnosed with an intrauterine polyp or myoma by office DH or SIS were included in the study. Patients referred to our clinic from 1993 through 2000 underwent DH. From 2001 through 2004 SIS was performed. After hysteroscopic removal in an inpatient setting, histopathologic results were used as a gold standard to calculate PPV of SIS and DH. (Canadian Task Force classification II-3)Tertiary referral center.Diagnostic hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonography.Women in whom an intrauterine polyp or myoma was diagnosed either by DH or SIS MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The PPVs of SIS and DH in the evaluation of intrauterine polyps and fibroids did not significantly differ. However, p = 0.3 is the significant difference for the PPV of SIS in premenopausal women comparing the PPV of SIS for fibroids (0.95) with the PPV of SIS for polyps (0.81).Diagnostic hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonography are equivalent diagnostic tools for the detection of intrauterine myomas and polyps.
