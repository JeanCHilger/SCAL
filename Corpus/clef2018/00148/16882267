Metabolic disorders in patients with recent gestational diabetes mellitus. To determine metabolic disorders in patients with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared with controls.Thirty-six patients with recent GDM and treated with a diabetic diet only, and 33 controls with normal pregnancies, were included in the study. An oral glucose tolerance test, with corresponding insulin and hormone levels, was performed the homeostatic model assessment scores were calculated to estimate insulin resistanceWaist : hip ratio and fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in women with recent GDM high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not differ between groups. Fasting, 1-h and 2-h plasma glucose levels were significantly higher in the GDM groupWe found a higher prevalence of polycystic ovarian morphology in women with GDM than in controls. Among women with recent GDM, higher waist : hip ratios and fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride levels may indicate metabolic syndrome. In women with recent GDM managed by diet only, insulin resistance may not be detected in the short term.
