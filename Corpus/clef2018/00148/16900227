Effects of exercise and nutritional counseling in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This pilot study assessed the effects of exercise and nutritional counseling on hormonal, menstrual, and reproductive function in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Twelve females with a clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic diagnosis of PCOS were randomly assigned to endurance and resistance exercise plus nutritional counseling (EN) or nutritional counseling only (N) for a period of 12 weeks. Anthropometry, resting metabolic rate (RMR), selected hormones, and ovarian follicle population were measured pre and post-intervention. Following the 12 week intervention, greater decreases in sum of 2 skinfolds (p = 0.002) and a greater increase in estimated VO2 max (p = 0.017) occurred in the exercise group. Significant decreases in waist girth (p = 0.001) and insulin levels (p = 0.03) occurred in both groups. Hormonal changes were not statistically significant however, a trend towards an improved hormonal profile, specifically sex-hormone binding globulin (EN, 39% increase
