Clinical aspect, diagnostics and treatment of follicular ovarian cysts. 48 young women aged 16 to 40 were observed for the menstrual cycle disorders and pain of various intensity in the lower abdominal region have been diagnosed for having at ovarian follicular cyst. The peculiarities of hormonal secretion in 30 patients have been studied. Existence of transitory hyperprolactinemia, excessive production of the lutheinizing hormone and deficit of progesterone production was determined. These factors hamper the folliculorexis and the follicular cyst does develop. Thus, in the occurrence of follicular cysts the major role belongs to the hypothalamic-pituitary disregulation. Therefore, the suppressive hormonal therapy is justified as highly effective. Dynamic ultrasound makes it possible to identify the conservative treatment terms and where necessary, timely transfer of the patient to the laparoscopic treatment.
