Capsule endoscopy in patients with chronic abdominal pain. Patients with chronic abdominal pain consult gastroenterologists frequently, requiring a large number of examinations.To assess the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy in patients with chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin and negative diagnostic work-up.From January 2002 to September 2004, 16 patients (10 female mean age 42.7 years) who complained of chronic abdominal pain were referred to our unit for capsule endoscopy.Chronic abdominal pain was defined as continuous or almost continuous, for at least 3 months and without criteria for other gastrointestinal disorders. All patients had a previous diagnostic work-up including abdominal ultrasonography, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel follow through, performed within 2 months.Capsule endoscopy was normal in 12 patients (75%). Small bowel abnormalities were found in three patients, but were considered irrelevant. In one patient (6.3%), capsule endoscopy revealed ileal erosions and inflammation and was retained in a stricture undetected by radiology. This patient underwent elective surgery which revealed an ileal carcinoid neoplasm.Capsule endoscopy identified a specific cause of chronic abdominal pain in only one patient. Capsule endoscopy is a safe procedure but does not seem to play an important role in the evaluation of patients with chronic abdominal pain of unknown origin.
