Late choledochal pathology after cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. After "simple" cholecystectomy for lithiasis, biliary disorders can appear, with the onset more than 3 years postoperative, like cholangitis or transitory jaundice. Meantime, a whole range of congenital abnormalities initially ignored can become manifest: biliary tract congenital dilatations, duodenal para-Vater diverticulum, Oddi stenosis.to establish the pathological circumstances that determine late choledochal syndrome, including an analysis concerning the therapeutical approach in these cases. Patients with cholecystectomy complains of late biliary disorders (least 3 years symptom-free) between 1997-2005, were retrospectively studied. Exclusion criteria were intraoperative incidents or accidents, recognised incomplete surgical procedure, early difficult postoperative course. Therapeutical approach was endoscopical, surgical or conservative. 46 patients entered the study group 38 underwent open cholecystectomy. Mean interval between operation and disturbances onset was 10 years. Following etiopathologic causes of late choledochal pathology were recorded: incomplete cholecystectomy, retained or primary common bile duct (CBD) stones, choledochal cyst or stenosis, Oddi stenosis, duodenal para-Vater diverticulum, anomaly biliary tree. Thirty patients undergone successful endoscopic treatment
