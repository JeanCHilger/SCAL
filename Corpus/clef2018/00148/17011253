Laparoscopic neo-os creation in an adolescent with uterus didelphys and obstructed hemivagina. Uterus didelphys is a rare congenital anomaly with a well-documented association with obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis. Treatment of this anomaly includes drainage of hematocolopos and excision of the vaginal septum, which has traditionally used a scalpel or scissors, often with hymenotomy. Recently, a less invasive approach using hysteroscopic resection has been reported, allowing improved visualization with preservation of the hymenal ring. In this article, we present an alternative minimally invasive approach using a combination of laparoscopy and vaginoscopy in the case of a 10-year-old girl. This approach allows for treatment in cases wherein vaginoscopy provides inadequate visualization with the advantage of enabling full evaluation for associated complications affecting future fertility including endometriosis, pelvic infection, and pelvic adhesions.
