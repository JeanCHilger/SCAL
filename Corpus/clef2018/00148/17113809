Diagnosis of endometrial pathologies in West Africa: contribution of saline infusion sonography. Experience of Yopougon's teaching hospital (Abidjan, Ivory Coast). The aim of this survey was to value the contribution of saline infusion sonography (SIS) to endometrial pathologies diagnosis in a context of work where hysterography is the reference exam rather than hysteroscopy.A prospective comparative cohort survey led at Yopougon's teaching hospital, from July 1st to April 30th 2003. This study concerned 65 patients. The sensitivity, the specificity, and the Kappa test have been calculated from the morbid results.The SIS has been successfully carried out among 63 patients (96,8%). The polyps (23,8%), and the mucous myomas (14%) dominate the endometrial pathologies. The analysis of the results indicated sensitivity and a global specificity respectively of 100% and 76,5%. The dissonant diagnoses have been decided in 82% of the cases in favour of SIS. Besides, SIS permits to save 31.67 Euros/patient.SIS could therefore constitute a tool of choice for the exploration of the uterine cavity in the developing countries.
