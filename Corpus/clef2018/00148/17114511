Pouchography, CT, and MRI features of ileal J pouch-anal anastomosis. Our objective is to describe pouchography, CT, and MRI features of the J-shaped pouch, both normal and with pouch-related complications.Pouchography is performed before closure of the loop ileostomy to assess the integrity of the ileal pouch and anastomosis. CT and MRI can be performed when postoperative complications, such as small-bowel obstruction, pouchitis, leakage, abscess, intramural hematoma, desmoid tumor, or recurrent Crohn's disease, are suspected.
