Prevalence and risk factors of gallbladder polyp in adults living in Daegu and Gyeongbuk provinces. Although there are various reports on the prevalence of gallbladder (GB) polyp according to the race or area, there is no report on Daegu and Gyeongbuk provinces. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and related risk factors of GB polyp in health screening population of Daegu and Gyeongbuk provinces.Of 28,911 adult health screening examinees from January 1997 to May 2003, age and gender-matched 8,008 (3,896 men, 4,112 women) were randomly selected to evaluate the prevalence. Independent risk factors were analyzed by comparing various variables between the GB polyp positive and negative groups.The prevalence of GB polyp was 2.2% (175/8,008). Those were 2.7% (104/3,896) among men and 1.7% (71/4,112) among women. Independent risk factors related with GB polyp were male gender (OR 1.434, p<0.001), obesity (OR 1.237, p=0.024), and hepatitis B carrier (OR 1.888, p<0.001)Prevalence of GB polyp in Daegu and Gyeongbuk provinces is 2.2%.
