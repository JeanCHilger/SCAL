Prediction of ovarian response and IVF/ICSI outcome by three-dimensional ultrasonography and power Doppler angiography. The objective was to evaluate whether three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D-US) and power Doppler angiography (PDA) measurements can predict ovarian response and/or are associated with IVF/ICSI outcome.A prospective clinical study in 65 women undergoing IVF cycles. Ovarian volume (OV), number of antral follicles > or =2mm (NAF) and PDA indices: vascularisation index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularisation flow index (VFI) were evaluated by 3D-US and PDA on the day of pituitary suppression control. These measurements, age and BMI were correlated with the number of follicles>10mm on the hCG day and the number of oocytes retrieved.Ovarian volume, NAF, VI, FI and FVI correlate significantly (P<0.01) with the number of follicles and oocytes recovered. Ovarian volume and the number of antral follicles predicted significantly the number of follicles (R=0.67 adjusted R(2)=0.43) and oocytes retrieved (R=0.63Three-dimensional ultrasound and PDA make it easier to evaluate all the sonographic parameters implied in ovarian response. Ovarian volume and the number of antral follicles are the only independent predictors of the number of follicles developed and oocytes retrieved.
