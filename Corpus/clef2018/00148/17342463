Spontaneous hemoperitoneum: a bloody mess. Spontaneous hemoperitoneum may be a life-threatening occurrence. It most frequently presents with acute abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used modality in the initial work up of these patients, but sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a role in the diagnosis. The etiology is varied, yet may be broadly classified into gynecologic, hepatic, splenic, vascular, and coagulopathic causes. This review will describe the common imaging findings of spontaneous hemoperitoneum, as it presents through the emergency room, and will detail the underlying causes and significance of spontaneous hemoperitoneum.
