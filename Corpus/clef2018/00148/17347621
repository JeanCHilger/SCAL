Intrabiliary metastasis in colorectal cancer. Endobiliary metastasis of colorectal cancers are rare. We report a 36 years-old patient, operated on 5 years ago for a left colon cancer with a left colectomy. He consulted for pain in the upper right quadrant without fever nor jaundice. Ultra-sound, CTscan, RMI and PET led to the diagnosis of endobiliary metastasis and the patient underwent a right hepatectomy. A review of the literature of the endobiliary metastasis follows this case-report. These tumours can mimic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in clinical presentation, imaging or even histological examinations. The main goal of the imaging explorations is to establish the resecability of such tumours. Patients with endobiliary metastasis seem to have better survival than patients with intrahepatic metastasis.
