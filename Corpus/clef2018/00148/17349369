Treatment options for primary infected aorta. A 71-year-old man, with a history of anterior-perineal bowel resection for previous malignancy, presented with a septic picture and back pain. Investigations revealed a primary infected aorta. At laparotomy an ileocolic tumor was also discovered and resected. Blood cultures prior to the operation were positive for Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium was cultured from the actual aorta.
