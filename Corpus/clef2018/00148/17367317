Transvaginal ultrasound and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme activity profile in uterine aspirate for diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Postmenopausal patients with vaginal bleeding (n = 72) were evaluated with the combination of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) and analysis of the lactate dehydrogenase (LD) isoenzyme activity profile in uterine fluid aspirates. TVS evaluation of the endometrium was classified as <5 mm, > or =5 mm, or poorly defined. The LD isoenzyme activity profile was characterized as abnormal or normal. Pathologic findings were further evaluated with diagnostic curettage. TVS found the endometrium to be > or =5 mm or poorly defined in 44 patients (61%). Endometrial carcinoma was found in 6 of 72 patients (8%). They appeared in the TVS groups endometrium >5 mm (n = 2) and endometrium poorly defined (n = 4) but not in the endometrium <5 mm. The LD isoenzyme activity profile was abnormal in the six malignant cases and in ten benign cases. Thus, the need for further evaluation with hysteroscopy and curettage was reduced to 16 cases. Since TVS had 100% sensitivity but only 42% specificity, it is suitable for first-level examination in patients with postmenopausal bleeding. The second-level method should have similarly high sensitivity but much higher specificity. The LD isoenzyme activity profile in uterine fluid aspirates had 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Another important feature is that the method is not sensitive to endometrial thickness, amount of sample, sampling device, or dilution. Thus, it is more reliable than aspiration histology. For every hysteroscopy or curettage that can be replaced by LD analysis, the cost is reduced by approximately EUR 720 or 540, respectively.
