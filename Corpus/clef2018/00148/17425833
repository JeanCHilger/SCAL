Use of three-dimensional ultrasound in evaluating the intrauterine position of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. This paper reports the first case of three-dimensional (3-D) transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) imaging of malpositioned levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). In patients carrying LNG-IUS, the application of 3-D TVS with the adjunctive volume contrast imaging in the coronal plane (VCI-C) and inversion rendering modes clearly display the correct spatial position of the LNG-IUS in relation to the uterine cavity much better than two-dimensional ultrasound.
