Sonographic findings of groin masses. The groin contents consist of the spermatic cord and its fascial coverings and vascular, nervous, and muscular structures. Abnormalities in the groin region are variable. The purpose of this image presentation is to describe the sonographic findings of the various kinds of groin lesions.We retrospectively reviewed the sonographic findings of various kinds of groin lesions. All sonographic examinations were performed with high-frequency (5- to 15-MHz) linear array transducers.The most common abnormality in the groin was a hernia, which contains bowel loops, omental fat, and peritoneal fluid. The most common benign tumor of the inguinal region was a lipoma. Other benign tumors of the groin included leiomyomas, dermoid cysts, epidermoid cysts, and lymphangiomas. The most common primary malignant tumors in the inguinal region were sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma. Secondary malignant tumors of the inguinal regions were metastatic lymphomas and metastatic carcinomas of the lung, breast, ovary, and gastrointestinal tract. Hematomas and inflammation may occur in the inguinal region.Although there was substantial overlap of sonographic findings in the various inguinal masses, clinical history and certain sonographic details can assist in making the correct diagnosis.
