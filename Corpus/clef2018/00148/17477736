Real-time reflectance confocal microscopy: comparison of two-dimensional images and three-dimensional image stacks for detection of cervical precancer. Confocal microscopy can provide real-time, 2-D and 3-D images of the cellular morphology and tissue architecture features that pathologists use to detect precancerous lesions without the need for tissue removal, sectioning, and staining. The utility of 3-D confocal image stacks of epithelial tissue for detecting dysplasia has not yet been explored. We aim to extract morphometry and tissue architecture information from 2-D confocal reflectance images and 3-D image stacks from fresh, unstained cervical biopsies and compare their potential for detecting dysplasia. Nine biopsies are obtained from eight patients confocal images are acquired pre- and postacetic acid at multiple epithelial depths in 1.5 mum-intervals. Postacetic acid images are processed to segment cell nuclei
