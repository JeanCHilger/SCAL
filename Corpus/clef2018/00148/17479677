Bizarre big belly ball: intraabdominal abscess mimicking stauffer syndrome secondary to uterine leiomyosarcoma. Stauffer syndrome, a very rare paraneoplastic syndrome, refers to reversible intrahepatic cholestasis in the setting of an abdominal malignancy.A 60-year-old female with a past medical history of uterine leiomyosarcoma status post radical hysterectomy, presented three months later with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Laboratory evaluation revealed intrabdominal cholestasis and ultrasound of the abdomen showed an echogenic solid mass consistent with a metastatic leiomyosarcoma, and it was felt that her hyperbilirubinemia was due to Stauffer syndrome. However, three days later, blood culture grew gram negative bacilli, and CT scan of the abdomen revealed multiple mesenteric masses with air bubbles consistent with an abdominal abscess. The abscess was drained under CT-scan guidance and her cholestasis gradually came back to nearly normal.The case highlights the importance of considering infectious etiologies and Stauffer syndrome in the differential diagnosis of liver dysfunction in patients with intraabdominal malignancies.
