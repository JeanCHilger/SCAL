The risk of malignancy in post-menopausal women presenting with adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion is usually diagnosed in pre-menopausal women and is less common in post-menopausal patients. The risk of malignancy in cases of torsion in menopausal patients is not known. We set out to describe our experience with adnexal torsion in post-menopausal women and to discuss issues related to management in this situation.A retrospective chart review was conducted of all post-menopausal patients diagnosed with torsion of the adnexa from January 1990 through December 2005. Patient charts were reviewed for information regarding pre-operative signs and symptoms, pathology, demographics, surgical findings, procedure and outcome. As a control group, we chose a consecutive cohort of 29 pre-menopausal patients diagnosed with adnexal torsion during 2002.Twenty-seven patients were found to be menopausal at the time of diagnosis of adnexal torsion. Median age at presentation was 63 years (range 43-93). A median delay of 40 h was found between the time of hospital admittance to surgery for post-menopausal patients in comparison to the pre-menopausal ones. The cause of torsion was benign in pre-menopausal patients whereas 22% of post-menopausal patients were diagnosed with malignant disease. More adnexas were found to be necrotic in menopausal patients and this resulted in under-diagnosis of malignancy on frozen section analysis.The diagnosis of adnexal torsion is less evident in post-menopausal patients leading to delayed treatment. The high risk of malignancy is of major importance and should be taken into account when counseling patients and when using frozen section during surgery.
