Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma combined with infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma in an infant. Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is a rare benign tumor in children, and infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma is also a rare liver neoplasm. We report a female newborn with an abdominal mass noted by the regular maternal ultrasound at 32 weeks of gestation. After birth, a liver mass was detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Frequent postprandial vomiting and progressive abdominal distension occurred 4 months later. Three tumor masses were detected this time, and the serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 6700 ng/mL. Segmental resection was performed initially and complete resection of these tumors and left lobectomy were performed 21 days later. Pathologic examination of these liver masses revealed mesenchymal hamartoma combined with infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma. After half a year of regular follow-up, the AFP level decreased gradually to 79.5 ng/mL, without evidence of tumor recurrence.
