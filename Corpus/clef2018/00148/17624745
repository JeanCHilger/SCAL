An atlas of the pelvic lymph node regions to aid radiotherapy target volume definition. The implementation of advanced three-dimensional radiotherapy planning techniques requires accurate target volume localisation. We have previously developed guidelines to aid definition of the pelvic lymph node regions, and the aim of this study was to produce a CT atlas.The guidelines were applied to a CT scan of a patient to receive adjuvant radiotherapy.Reference CT images of the pelvis were generated, illustrating the nodal regions and a typical target volume for adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer.These images can be used as an aid for target volume definition of the pelvic nodal regions.
