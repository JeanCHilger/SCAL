Latent gallbladder carcinoma in a young adult patient with acute cholecystitis: report of a case. Acute cholecystitis associated with gallbladder carcinoma is very rare in young patients (younger than 30 years of age). Moreover, a definitive preoperative diagnosis is difficult. A 26-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 5-day history of right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography and ultrasonography demonstrated an enlarged gallbladder with a diffuse thick wall and a 2-cm gallstone obstructing the cystic duct. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed no evidence of an anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction. The patient showed an elevation in the white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, and alkaline phosphate however, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were all within the normal ranges. The preoperative diagnosis of gallstone-induced acute cholecystitis was made and an open cholecystectomy was thus performed 2 days after admission. The macroscopic findings showed a necrotic enlarged gallbladder with a thick wall and a gallstone, but no intraluminal nodular lesion. Histologic examinations revealed well-differentiated focal adenocarcinoma in the gallbladder mucosa, but no venous, lymphatic, or perineural invasion. The postoperative course has been uneventful with no recurrence 18 months postoperatively.
