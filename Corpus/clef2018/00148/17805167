Müllerian adenosarcoma of the ovary: case report and review of the literature. Müllerian adenosarcoma is a rare neoplasm that can arise in both uterine and extrauterine locations. This report describes the ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging findings of one case of ovarian adenosarcoma and reviews the literature as to the previously described imaging findings. Adenosarcoma should be considered in patients with a predominantly solid pelvic mass on imaging, particularly in those with a history of endometriosis or findings compatible with endometriosis on ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. A very low resistive index on ultrasound may also be suggestive of this diagnosis.
