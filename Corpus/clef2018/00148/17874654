The undescended testis. Cryptorchidism represents a common condition affecting male infants that has significant clinical implications, including infertility and testicular malignancy. The precise developmental mechanisms leading to cryptorchidism are poorly understood however, abnormalities in both functional anatomic and hormonal factors during embryogenesis and testicular descent are implicated. Although surgical intervention is ultimately required, there is a defined role for diagnostic imaging in patient evaluation-particularly in the setting of a nonpalpable undescended testis. Consultation among urologists, pediatric surgeons, and radiologists is paramount to optimize patient care.
