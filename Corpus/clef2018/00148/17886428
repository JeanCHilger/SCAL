Prevalence and risk factors for gall bladder polyps. Polyps of gallbladder are tumour-like lesions of this organ. Little has been known about factors associated with the occurrence of gallbladder polyps. We aimed to examine prevalence and factors associated with gallbladder polyps in our region.Prospective clinical study.Kocaeli University Teaching Hospital.Four hundred and thirty two patients were enrolled to the study.Subjects were screened for the presence of any pathological condition for gallbladder by upper abdominal ultrasonography completed a questionnaire, and underwent a physical examination and blood chemistry tests.Family history of gastrointestinal disease, gallbladder disease and any neoplastic disease and abnormality in HDL-cholesterol levels had most consistent association at univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that family history of any gastrointestinal disease and abnormalities of HDL-cholesterol levels were significant.Our findings suggest the formation of gallbladder polyps is associated with fat metabolism. Other unknown factors may also influence the formation of this lesion. Relationship between gallbladder polyps and family history of some diseases suggests us to perform some genetic studies.
