Linear polyp measurement at CT colonography: 3D endoluminal measurement with optimized surface-rendering threshold value and automated measurement. To determine the optimal surface-rendering threshold value for three-dimensional (3D) endoluminal computed tomographic (CT) colonographic images for accurate manual polyp measurement, with direct measurement of simulated polyps as the reference standard, and to assess the agreement between manual 3D measurements and automated measurements.Institutional review board approval was not required for the experimental study with pig colons obtained at an abattoir but was obtained for the use of patient data, with waiver of informed consent. Eighty-six simulated polyps (reference size, 3-15 mm) and 14 human polyps (approximate size, 5-20 mm) were included. Automated polyp measurements and manual measurements with endoluminal views that were surface rendered at threshold values of -800, -700, -600, and -500 HU were performed by one observer. Agreement between CT colonographic measurements and reference sizes and between manual and automated measurements were assessed by using the Bland-Altman method.For simulated polyps, mean measurement difference between the observed size and reference size was 0.86 mm (95% limits of agreement: -0.52 mm, 2.24 mm), 0.55 mm (95% limits of agreement: -0.75 mm, 1.85 mm), 0.20 mm (95% limits of agreement: -1.11 mm, 1.50 mm), and -0.08 mm (95% limits of agreement: -1.43 mm, 1.27 mm) for -800, -700, -600, and -500 HU, respectively. Mean measurement difference was 0.09 mm (95% limits of agreement: -1.49 mm, 1.67 mm) for automated measurement. Manual polyp size at -500 HU (P = .277) and automated polyp size (P = .288) were not significantly different from reference size. For human polyps, 10 polyps, excluding four lesions that were large, lobulated, or located adjacent to an edge of the haustral fold, showed accurate automated demarcation of lesion boundaries. Automated measurements of the 10 polyps showed the closest agreement with manual measurements at -500 HU.The optimal surface-rendering threshold value for accurate polyp measurement is approximately -500 HU. Automated measurements agree closely with manual measurements at the optimal threshold value for well-circumscribed smooth rounded polyps.
