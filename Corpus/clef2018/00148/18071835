A case of peribiliary cyst presenting with obstructive jaundice. A 77-year-old woman with a complaint of itching was shown to have an elevated serum bilirubin level. She had no history of liver disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a 17-mm-diameter cystic lesion obstructing the main hepatic duct at the hepatic hilum. Drip infusion cholangiographic computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed that the cyst did not communicate with the biliary tree thus, a peribiliary cyst was diagnosed. Cystectomy was performed, and the jaundice resolved. Peribiliary cysts are generally asymptomatic and rarely cause obstructive jaundice. They are usually multiple and caused by an underlying liver disorder with a poor prognosis. Our case suggests that peribiliary cysts can arise in healthy liver and cause symptoms. Cystectomy is the treatment of choice if the cyst is solitary.
