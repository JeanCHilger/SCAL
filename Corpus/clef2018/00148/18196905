Oxidative stress in nonobese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: correlations with endocrine and screening parameters. We investigated serum total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) and whether oxidative stress is associated with endocrine and sonographic parameters in nonobese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Sixty-three nonobese normoinsulinemic PCOS women and 58 normoandrogenic ovulatory controls were enrolled in the study. Standard clinical examinations and ultrasonographic and endocrine screening including follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, progesterone, total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) were performed. The insulin resistance was calculated by the measurement of fasting serum glucose and insulin levels, serum insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance test and homeostasis model assessment. TAS and TOS were assessed by automated colorimetric methods.The women with PCOS had significantly higher TAS, TOS, LH, free androgen index and DHEAS levels. TAS, but not TOS, was positively correlated with LH, free androgen index and ovarian volume. However, there was no correlation between TAS and DHEAS. By multiple regression analysis, LH, TOS and ovarian volume were the independent variables that were associated with TAS.TAS was found to be increased in nonobese patients with PCOS, and this may account for some of the physiological changes.
