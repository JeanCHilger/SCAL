Changes in ultrasound morphology of the uterus and ovaries during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause: a 4-year longitudinal study. To describe changes in uterine and ovarian size and morphology as determined by ultrasonography from 2 years before to 2 years after menopause.Twenty 50-year-old women with fairly regular vaginal bleeding at the start of the study underwent transvaginal ultrasound examination every 3 months until 12 months postmenopause, then every 6 months until 24 months postmenopause. The results are presented from 2 years before to 2 years after the menopause.In the 2 years preceding menopause all the women were in menopausal transition. From 2 years before to 2 years after menopause uterine anteroposterior diameter decreased by 22% (mean) and left and right ovarian volumes by 45 and 20% (median), respectively. At 2 years before the menopause the total number of intraovarian follicle-like cystic structures varied from 0 to 5, at the menopause from 0 to 7, and at 1 and 2 years after the menopause from 0 to 4 and from 0 to 2, respectively. Premenopause, the most common finding was that of ovaries containing either no follicles or a few follicles with at least one measuring >/= 11 mm and simultaneously a hyperechogenic endometrium of varying thickness and not manifesting any midline echo or triple-layer appearance. Images compatible with the late follicular phase were found in 6% (9/150) of examinations ('cycle day' 8-196) and images compatible with the luteal phase in 7% (10/150) ('cycle day' 11-56). Intraovarian cystic structures (3-25 mm) were seen in 14 women after the menopause.We have described sonographic changes in the uterus and ovaries occurring during the transition from premenopause to postmenopause.
