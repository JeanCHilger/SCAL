3-T MRI in the preoperative evaluation of depth of myometrial infiltration in endometrial cancer. The objective of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3-T MRI in determining the depth of myometrial infiltration in patients with endometrial cancer.Fifty-two patients (43 postmenopausal) with histopathologically proven endometrial carcinoma underwent preoperative 3-T MRI. The following sequences were performed: axial T1 fast spin-echo (FSE) axial, parasagittal, and paracoronal T2 FSE. MRI performed on a 3-T unit was in agreement with histopathology in assessing the depth of invasion in 86.4% (44/52) of the patients with a mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 83.5%, 93.9%, 77.8%, 92.2%, and 89.7%, respectively. Performance values were also assessed for single stages of myometrial infiltration. For the detection of an intramucosal lesion (MRI, 12/52 histopathology, 6/52), sensitivity was 100%In evaluating the depth of myometrial infiltration in patients with endometrial cancer, 3-T MRI showed high diagnostic accuracy-equivalent to that of 1.5-T MRI reported in the literature. Artifacts did not significantly affect image quality.
