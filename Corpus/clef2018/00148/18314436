Spinal cord compression in patients with advanced metastatic cancer: "all I care about is walking and living my life". As 1 of the 12,700 US cancer patients who, each year, develops metastatic spinal cord compression, Ms H wishes to walk and live her life. Sadly, this wish may be difficult to fulfill. Before diagnosis, 83% to 95% of patients experience back pain, which often is referred, obscuring the site(s) of the compression(s). Prediction of ambulation depends on a patient's ambulatory status before therapy and time between developing motor defects and starting therapy. Ambulatory patients with no visceral metastases and more than 15 days between developing motor symptoms and receiving therapy have the best rate of survival. To preserve ambulation and optimize survival, magnetic resonance imaging should be performed for cancer patients with new back pain despite normal neurological findings. At diagnosis, counseling, pain management, and corticosteroids are begun. Most patients are offered radiation therapy. Surgery followed by radiation is considered for selected patients with a single high-grade epidural lesion caused by a radioresistant tumor who also have an estimated survival of more than 3 months. Team discussions with the patient and support network help determine therapy options and include patient goals assessment of risks, benefits, and burdens of each treatment
