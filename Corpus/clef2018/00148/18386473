Recurrence of granulosa cell tumor 25 years after initial diagnosis. Report of a case and review of the literature. Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are rare functional sex cord-stromal ovarian tumors constituting approximately 2-3% of all ovarian malignancies. They are characterized by low malignant potential, local spread, late recurrence and high survival rates. We report a case of recurrent ovarian GCT in a 60-year-old woman 25 years after the initial diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical resection of the pelvic masses and refused to receive any adjuvant treatment, considering the late recurrence and high survival rates of this tumor. This case illustrates an example of a very late recurrence and emphasizes the importance of the extended follow-up required for these patients.
