Sonography of postpartum uterine inversion from acute to chronic stage. We report the sonographic appearance of postpartum uterine inversion progressing from acute partial to chronic stage after an 8-week interval. The delay in diagnosis was partly due to the patient's stable clinical condition except for minor vaginal discharge and bleeding. The diagnosis of chronic inversion on the follow-up sonographic examination prompted clinicians to undertake surgical repair. Our case shows that the prompt use of sonography during labor and in the peripartum should be sufficient to establish the diagnosis of this serious postpartum complication, which can result in shock or even death. Sonography findings can be considered characteristic and fairly accurate in this condition.
