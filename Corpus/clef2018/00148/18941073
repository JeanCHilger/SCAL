MR hysterosalpingography with an angiographic time-resolved 3D pulse sequence: assessment of tubal patency. The purpose of our study was to determine if tubal patency can be assessed by MR hysterosalpingography (HSG) using a clinically available MR angiographic sequence (3D time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics [TRICKS]). This capability would enhance the value of MRI in women with infertility.MR HSG effectively shows tubal patency and can be considered when both conventional HSG and standard MRI are necessary for the evaluation of women with infertility, such as in women with suspected uterine anomalies or extrauterine disease.
