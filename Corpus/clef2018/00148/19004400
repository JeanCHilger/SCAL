Use of ultrasonographic cut point for diagnosing endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women with multiple risk factors for endometrial cancer. To determine if the established endometrial thickness cut point (5 mm) for abnormal endometrial pathology shifts to higher thickness in the presence of selected risk factors/comorbidities.A sample of 112 postmenopausal women was identified. The outcome was abnormal endometrial pathology, be it endometrial cancer or hyperplasia with atypia. Logistic regression was used to calculate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) of abnormal results for women with thick or thin endometria and 0 or > or = 1 of the following comorbidities/cofactors: obesity, diabetes, hypertension and use of hormone replacement therapy.Approximately half the sample was hypertensive 56.3% were obese. A large proportion (84.8%) of the patients had > or = 1 of the comorbidities/cofactors of interest. Women with endometria > or = 12 mm and > or = 1 comorbidities appeared to have 5 times the odds of having an abnormal result compared to women with thin endometria (<12 mm) who had 0 comorbiditiesClinicians should continue to use the 5-mm cut point when deciding whether patients should have endometrial sampling.
