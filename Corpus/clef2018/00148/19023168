Transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization followed by microwave ablation for hemobilia from hepatocellular carcinoma. Bile duct invasion is rare in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We show the usefulness of selective transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization (TAE) followed by microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) in a case of HCC with portal and biliary tumor thrombi that ruptured into the biliary system. A 70-year-old man with HCC was admitted because of melena and postprandial abdominal pain. Four years earlier, he had undergone posterior segmentectomy of the liver for HCC. Portal venous thrombus was detected on computed tomography (CT) 3 months earlier. On admission laboratory tests revealed the following values: serum alkaline phosphatase, 760 IU/L total serum bilirubin, 11.9 mg/dL
