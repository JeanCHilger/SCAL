The influence of a tibolone therapy on endometrium in postmenopausal women. Assessment of the frequency of vaginal bleeding and morphologic changes of endometrium in postmenopausal women treated with tibolone.26 patients, aged from 50 to 70 (mean 59.7+/-6.7) years, without contraindications to hormonal replacement therapy.The therapy with a tibolone in a daily dose of 2.5 mg during the course of 1 year. The assessment of endometrium was obtained by means of transvaginal ultrasound examination (USG TV) and curratage and/or biopsy with Pipelle probe.during the therapy with tibolone, vaginal bleeding was noted in case of 3 (11.5%) postmenopausal women. The thickness of endometrium measured by USG TV was mean 4.6+/-2.3mm and did not change enough to be considered statistically significant during the therapy. Endometrial morphology assessed by curratage and/or biopsy showed atrophic endometrium in 20 patients, polyposis endometrium in 1 case or no samples.Tibolone therapy leads to low rates of vaginal bleeding and atrophic changes of the endometrium. Tibolone is a safe and effective alternative to hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women.
