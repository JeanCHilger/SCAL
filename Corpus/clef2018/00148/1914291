Echinococcal infestation of the spine in North America. Taenia echinococcal infestation, a parasitic disease rarely seen in the United States, occurred in a 62-year-old man. Bone is involved in about 1% of all cases, and of these cases, the spine is involved in about 50%. Preoperative identification is difficult because of lack of characteristic radiographic features. Successful management is also problematic because of the difficulty of preoperative diagnosis, the invasive nature of the bony involvement, and the variable anaphylactic reaction to the cyst fluid antigen. The diagnosis must be entertained in the differential diagnosis of benign spinal neoplasms especially when dealing with patients from endemic areas.
