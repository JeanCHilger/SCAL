Prostate cancer and left ectopic ureter opening to seminal vesicle with left renal agenesis: a case report. We report a case of prostate cancer and left ectopic ureter opening to seminal vesicle with left renal agenesis. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for treatment of prostate cancer with cyst formation. On the rectal examination, a cystic tumor was palpable on the left side of prostate. The left kidney was not detected by intravenous pyelography and ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a retrovesical cystic lesion in the left side. Total prostatectomy and left ureterectomy were performed under the diagnosis of clinical T1cN0M0 prostate cancer and left ectopic ureter opening to seminal vesicle with left renal agenesis. The pathological findings showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3 + 3, and left ectopic ureter entering into the seminal vesicle and left renal agenesis. The patient was well 39 months after the total prostatectomy and left ureterectomy without evidence of recurrence. There have been no cases of the association of this urogenital anomaly, such as ectopic ureter opening to seminal vesicle with renal agenesis and prostate cancer and the combined management of both. Our case seems to be first case in the Japanese literature.
