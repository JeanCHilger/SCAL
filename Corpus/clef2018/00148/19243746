Cervical mucus status can be accurately estimated by transvaginal ultrasound during fertility evaluation. Examinations of the cervical mucus for determining its quantity and physical characteristics are used to provide a clinical marker for the timing of ovulation. We propose that transvaginal ultrasound, which is routinely used as a tool for monitoring follicular growth in patients undergoing ovulation induction, might also be used simultaneously for estimating cervical mucus measurements. With no additional effort or expense, these data may help to optimize individual patient management.
