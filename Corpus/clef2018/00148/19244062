Three-dimensional power Doppler vascular sonographic sampling for predicting ovarian cancer in cystic-solid and solid vascularized masses. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of 3-dimensional (3D) power Doppler (PD) sonography to discriminate between benign and malignant cystic-solid and solid vascularized adnexal masses and to define cutoff values for 3D PD indices to be used in a clinical setting.A total of 143 consecutive women (mean age, 50.4 years range, 17-82 years) with diagnoses of cystic-solid or solid vascularized adnexal masses on B-mode and 2-dimensional PD sonography were evaluated by 3D PD sonography before surgery. Three-dimensional PD sonography was used to assess vascularization within papillary projections and solid areas with a virtual organ computer-aided analysis program. Three-dimensional PD vascular indices (vascularization index [VI], flow index [FI], and vascularization-flow index [VFI]) were automatically calculated. A definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained in each case.A total of 113 masses (74%) were malignant, and 39 (26%) were benign. Morphologic evaluation revealed 30 unilocular solid masses (19.7%), 43 multilocular solid masses (28.3%), and 79 mostly solid masses (52%). The mean VI (9.365% versus 3.3% P< .001), FI (34.318 versus 28.794Three-dimensional PD vascular indices could be helpful for reducing the false-positive rate in cystic-solid and solid vascularized adnexal masses.
