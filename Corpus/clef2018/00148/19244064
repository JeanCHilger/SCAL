Diagnostic accuracy of sonographic and clinical parameters in the prediction of retained products of conception. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of different parameters (clinical and sonographic) in the prediction and management of retained products of conception (RPOC) in the late postpartum period.This was a prospective cohort 3-year audit. Predefined data were collected and compared with histopathologic (HP) reports after uterine evacuation. The primary outcome measure was the diagnostic accuracy of different clinical and sonographic parameters, including color Doppler imaging in diagnosis of RPOC confirmed on HP reports. Secondary outcome measures were complication rates influencing maternal morbidity.In total, 93 patients (0.92% of all deliveries) were selected. The presence of gestational tissue was confirmed on HP reports in 58% of cases. The likelihood ratio of sonography alone was 1.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.84), whereas that of sonography combined with color Doppler imaging was 2.16 (1.3-3.59), providing statistically significant accuracy regarding the prediction of RPOC.Sonography alone or combined with color Doppler imaging has better diagnostic accuracy than the usual clinical parameters used for the prediction of RPOC.
