Pyogenic liver abscess complicating early bile duct carcinoma in the middle bile duct: a rare presentation. We describe an 83-year-old woman who developed a pyogenic liver abscess complicated with early bile duct carcinoma. After percutaneous abscess drainage, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a filling defect in the extrahepatic bile duct suggestive of a bile duct tumor. Resection of the extrahepatic bile duct with regional lymph node dissection was carried out. The resected specimen showed a polypoid tumor in the middle bile duct and histologic examination revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosal layer. These findings suggest that careful investigation of the biliary tract is necessary in patients with pyogenic liver abscess, because of the possible association of bile duct cancer.
