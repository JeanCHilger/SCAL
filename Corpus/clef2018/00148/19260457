Preoperative assessment for feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystectomy using magnetic resonance cholangiography. We present the results of classification of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) focusing upon visualization of cystic duct for preoperative laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), along with assessments of a possible correlation between MRC classification and feasibility of LC.The study included a total of 663 patients who were diagnosed as cholelithiasis. MRC were classified into four types: Type A entire biliary tract was visualized (+), Type BMRC were classified as follows: Type A (58.4%), Type B (15.2%), Type C (19.3%) and Type D (7.1%). A total of 124 patients (18.7%) had chronic cholecystitis, and a strong correlation with MRC type was noted (p<0.0001). In 46 patients (7.5%), the surgical procedure was changed from LC to OC. The percentages of cases in which LC was changed to OC was significantly higher for Type C and Type D (p<0.0001), so these two groups demonstrated prolonged operating time.Our MRC classification based on the visualization of cystic duct can reflect the feasibility of LC, and LC may be less feasible tin Type C, and in particular Type D patients.
