Ovarian crescent sign and sonomorphological indices in preoperative determination of malignancy in adnexal masses. To compare the value of ovarian crescent sign (OCS) and various sonomorphologic scoring systems in consolidating pre-operative suspicion of ovarian malignancy in adnexal masses.A prospective study was carried out in 60 consenting women with an undiagnosed adnexal mass requiring operative intervention. OCS was considered to be present if normal ovarian tissue was seen adjacent to the tumor area on ultrasound. Various other sonological parameters were noted to calculate five morphological scoring systems. Doppler velocimetry study values were available in 27 cases. The results were compared for correctness of suspicion with histopathologic examination report of the tumor obtained at surgery.Eleven of 60 specimens showed histopathologic diagnosis of malignancy. OCS was identified in 97% of the benign masses. The sign was not seen in 10 of the 11 cases with malignancy. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of crescent sign was better than values obtained for the compared sonomorphological indices and Doppler velocimetry studies.Ovarian crescent sign is a reliable and simple sonographic indicator comparable to sonomorphological indices and Doppler flow velocimetric studies for the preoperative detection of malignancy in adnexal masses.
