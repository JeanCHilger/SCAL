Nipple-areolar complex: normal anatomy and benign and malignant processes. The nipple-areolar complex may be affected by many normal variations in embryologic development and breast maturation as well as by abnormal processes of a benign or malignant nature. Benign processes that may affect the nipple-areolar complex include eczema, duct ectasia, periductal mastitis, adenomas, papillomas, leiomyomas, and abscesses malignant processes include Paget disease, lymphoma, and invasive and noninvasive breast cancers. Radiologists should be aware of the best methods for evaluating each of these entities: Many disorders of the nipple-areolar complex are unique or differ in important ways from those that occur elsewhere in the breast, and they require a diagnostically specific imaging evaluation. Patients may present with benign developmental variations
