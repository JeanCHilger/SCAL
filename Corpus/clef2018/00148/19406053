Gallbladder cancer staging with 18F-FDG PET-CT. Gallbladder cancer is the most common biliary tract neoplasm. It generally affects the elderly, who are usually clinically asymptomatic. When symptoms appear, they suggest the presence of complications locally or due to tumour progression. Late diagnosis of the disease indicates a poor prognosis for these patients. Surgery is the only treatment with curative intent, but it is only possible in the early stages. Diagnostic imaging of this type of tumour is usually performed with ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance cholangiography. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with dedicated scanners or hybrid PET-CT scans are new diagnostic tools which could help in the pre-surgical diagnosis of these tumours. We present three cases to illustrate the usefulness of PET-FDG in the pre-surgical staging of gallbladder cancer.
