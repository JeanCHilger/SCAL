Vaginal tridimensionel ultrasound interest for the assessment of correct Essure sterilization micro-insert placement. To determine the interest and simplicity of 3D ultrasound for the 3-month check in place of the recommended routine radiologic in a general gynecology practice.Twenty-five patients had routine radiologic and transvaginal 3D ultrasound (Voluson 730 Expert) 3 months after placement of Essure micro-insert.Twenty-one 3D acquisitions were realized. In all cases, the micro-insert are easily visualized. Ideally, the echogenic micro-insert appears in the cornuale portion of the fallopian tube. The relationship between the micro insert and the uterine cavity is well documented.Easy-to-use, good reproducibility, absence of radiation, make the 3D ultrasound an interesting alternative for the 3-month check. The coronal view gives a directly exploitable document for the surgeon.
