Endoscopic biliary plastic stenting and successful intentional stent retrieval in a benign biliary stricture with mural spherical calcification and porcelain gallbladder. We report a very rare case of benign biliary stricture with calcification and porcelain gallbladder, causing difficulty in differential diagnosis. A 64-year-old man was referred for further examination of jaundice. Computed tomography showed calcifications in the gallbladder wall and the common bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed narrowing and a filling defect in the distal common bile duct. Peroral cholangioscopy showed a protruded lesion and stricture, and pathological examinations revealed no evidence of malignancy. The stricture was resolved after temporary insertion of progressively larger of plastic stents. Patients with benign biliary stricture and/or porcelain gallbladder should be followed carefully, because malignancy can occur as a complication, although infrequent.
