Bazedoxifene effects on the reproductive tract in postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to examine the endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety of bazedoxifene, a novel selective estrogen-receptor modulator, in postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis.Healthy postmenopausal women (N = 1,583 mean age, 57.6 y) with lumbar spine or femoral neck bone mineral density T scores between -1 and -2.5 and/or other clinical risk factors for osteoporosis were enrolled in a 24-month, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial. They received daily treatment with bazedoxifene 10, 20, or 40 mgBazedoxifene was not associated with a significant change from baseline in mean endometrial thickness at month 24. The percentage of participants with a change from baseline in endometrial thickness or endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm at month 24 was similar among groups. There was no consensus diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy in the bazedoxifene or raloxifene groups the rates of other histologic findings, including endometrial polyps, were low (<5%) and similar among groups. No significant between-group differences were found in the change from baseline in ovarian volume, number or size of ovarian cysts, or incidence of ovarian cancer. Reports of breast pain (<4%) and breast cancer (<1%) were low and evenly distributed among groups.A favorable endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety profile was found after 2 years of treatment with bazedoxifene in healthy, recently postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis.
