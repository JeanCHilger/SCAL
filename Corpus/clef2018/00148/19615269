Surgical treatment and prognosis of primary duodenal carcinoma. To investigate the clinicopathological features, surgical treatment and prognosis of primary carcinoma of the duodenum.The clinicopathological data of 86 patients with primary duodenal carcinoma from January 1996 to June 2007 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed by SPSS 13.0.The clinical manifestation includes upper abdominal pain, jaundice, anemia, gastrointestinal obstruction, melena and weight loss. Four patients had a tumor located in the first portion of the duodenum, 66 in the second portion, 12 in the third portion and 4 in the fourth portion. The preoperative correct diagnostic rate by BUS was 41.7%, by CT 69.4%, by MRI 75.0%, by duodenal endoscopy 84.0%, and by air barium double radiography 80.9%. Complete resection of the tumors was achieved in 38 patients, palliative resection in 45 cases, and exploration alone in 3 cases. The median survival time of the group with complete resection was 42 months versus 13 months in the group with palliative resection, with a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05).Primary carcinoma of the duodenum has no specific symptoms. Early diagnosis and complete resection are effective to improve prognosis.
