Population screening and early detection of ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women. The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre position statement: 'Population screening and early detection of ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women', was developed and agreed following a Forum in February 2009 attended by key Australian stakeholders. The final position statement and supporting background information have been endorsed by key Australian colleges and agencies. Position statement on population screening and early detection of ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women: 1) There is currently no evidence that any test, including pelvic examination, CA125 or other biomarkers, ultrasound (including transvaginal ultrasound), or combination of tests, results in reduced mortality from ovarian cancer. 2) There is no evidence to support the use of any test, including pelvic examination, CA125 or other biomarkers, ultrasound (including transvaginal ultrasound), or combination of tests, for routine population-based screening for ovarian cancer. 3) Further validation in large clinical trials is required before current or new biomarkers could be recommended for routine use in a population screening setting.
