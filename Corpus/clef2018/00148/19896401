Ovarian mucinous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy in a premenarchal girl. Ovarian mucinous cystadenomas are benign epithelial neoplasms that occur most often in the third to sixth decade of life. Ovarian mucinous cystadenoma can be classified into 3 categories (benign, borderline malignancy, malignancy) based on histopathologic evaluation. Premenarchal cases of ovarian mucinous cystadenoma of borderline malignancy are exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, there have been only 4 reported cases of borderline ovarian mucinous cystadenoma prior to 2009. Here we report a 13-year-old premenarchal girl with a giant mass occupying almost the whole of the abdomino-pelvic cavity.
