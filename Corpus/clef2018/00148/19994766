Ultrasound study of the myoendometrial border. Abnormal thickening of the Endometrial Subendometrial Myometrium Unit (ESEMy Unit, including basal endometrium and inner myometrium) has been detected on imaging and referred to as "diffuse adenomyosis" in infertile patients with proven endometriosis. However, no robust relationship exists between enlargement of the ESEMy Unit and adenomyosis proven on hysterectomy specimen examination moreover, if any correlation exists, it lacks histological validation in women wishing to preserve fertility. While adenomyosis effects on fertility, if any, remain elusive, thickening of the ESEMy Unit have been consistently linked to fertility impairment in both experimental and clinical models. The hypothesis tested herein is that a novel condition exists, called "ESEMy Unit disruption disease"
