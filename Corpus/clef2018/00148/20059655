PCOS and urethrovaginal space: 3-D volumetric and vascular analysis. The vaginal orgasm seems to be evocated by the stimulation of the G-spot: a highly sensitive area on the anterior wall of the human vagina. However, the existence of such a spot is controversial.To evaluate, by the use of three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasonography, the anatomic structures of the urethrovaginal space both in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients and eumenorrheic non-hirsute controls.Twenty-three (Group I) PCOS patients and 25 eumenorrheic young women (Group II) were submitted to two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D ultrasonography and color Doppler analysis of the urethrovaginal space and of the clitoris.2-D ultrasonographic evaluation of the ovaries and of the urethrovaginal space color Doppler evaluation of the ovarian stromal arteries, urethrovaginal main feeding artery, and dorsal clitoral arteriesThe vaginal orgasm was present in 13/23 (56%) patients in PCOS Group and in 13/25 (52%) in the controls. The 3-D reconstruction of the urethrovaginal space demonstrated a gland-like aspect with small feeding vessels: "female prostate." The 3-D mean volume of the "female prostate" was significantly higher in Group I (0.48 ± 0.21 mL) than in Group II (0.39 ± 0.19 mL P = 0.044). The Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLys (VOCAL) built mean volume of the "female prostate" was positively correlated with the time since intercourse (r = 0.486The presence of the G-spot and its role in vaginal orgasm remains controversial. In Italians, and normal weight PCOS patients the hyperandrogenism seems to result in ovarian stromal and "female prostate" hyperplasia.
