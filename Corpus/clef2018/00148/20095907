Uterine leiomyomata associated with self-reported stress urinary incontinence. To investigate the association between the presence and characteristics of uterine leiomyomata (UL) and self-reported stress urinary incontinence (SUI).The study included 836 premenopausal participants (474 African American and 362 Caucasian) in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Uterine Fibroid Study. UL were characterized at baseline with ultrasound screening, and SUI was assessed at follow-up (after 4 years, on average). Linear risk models were used to estimate adjusted prevalence differences (aPD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), controlling for age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and number of deliveries.Compared with women without UL, SUI prevalence was higher among women with any UL (aPD = 7.4%, 95% CI 0.4-14.3) and women with UL 2-4 cm (aPD = 9.6%, 95% CI 1.3-17.9). Marginally significant results were found for the presence of UL > or =4 cm and anterior UL > or =2 cm.The observed 7% increase in prevalence of this common condition for women with UL is of clinical importance. Further research is needed before concluding that treatment for larger UL might enhance SUI treatment in some women.
