Reliability of automated volumetric measurement of multiple growing follicles in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. To evaluate the reliability of a computer-assisted approach for automatically measuring ovarian follicles during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).Prospective, comparative study.Hospital Béclère, Clamart, France.Twenty-seven infertile IVF-ET candidates undergoing COH.Just before the oocyte retrieval, growing follicles (n=72) had their mean diameters measured and their volumes determined semimanually by virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) and automatically by SonoAVC. Follicles were sorted in small (12-16 mm n=35) and large (>16 mmConcordance of results using intraclass correlation coefficient and limits of agreement methods, respectively.Overall, VOCAL (median: 3.42 mL range: 0.98-9.68 mL) and SonoAVC (3.25 mLAutomated measurement of multiple follicular volumes using SonoAVC is a simple technique, which reliability is superior to usual diameter measurements and comparable to VOCAL. This technologic refinement invites us to switch toward volumetric monitoring of follicle growth during COH.
