Clinical research of 120 cases of primary small intestine malignant tumor. To study the clinical and pathological features, diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of primary small intestine malignant tumor.A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data from the 120 cases of primary small intestine malignant tumor.Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, abdominal mass and jaundice were the main clinical features. The pathology was confirmed by abdominal X-ray, gastrointestinal barium, CT, MRI, endoscopy and surgical exploration. Most tumors originated in the duodenum (54.1%), and adenocarcinoma (55.8%) was the main pathological type. The median survival time of the patients was 19.2 months and the 1-year survival rate was 55.4%. Chemotherapy did not seem to significantly improve the 1-year survival rate of the patients (P=0.842).Primary small intestine malignant tumors lack specific clinical manifestations and surgical resection should be performed as early as possible.
