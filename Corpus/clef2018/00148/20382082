Intramyometrial ectopic pregnancy in an ICSI patient following uterine artery embolization. Myometrial pregnancy represents a rare subtype of ectopic pregnancy. A history of uterine artery embolization (UAE) because of symptomatic uterine fibroids, and assisted reproductive treatment may predispose to this unusual implantation site. A 40-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids underwent a transfer of two embryos after intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. The combined findings on transvaginal ultrasound scan, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scan, suction curettage, diagnostic hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were compatible with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy within the myometrium, at the site of a necrotized intramyometrial fibroid following UAE. Treatment with systemic methotrexate resulted in successful resolution of this ectopic pregnancy. In conclusion, this study reports a pregnancy within a previously necrotized fibroid. Findings suggest that in patients with a history of UAE for the treatment of uterine fibroids and who subsequently undergo assisted reproductive treatment, the risk of an ectopic pregnancy within the myometrium has to be considered.
