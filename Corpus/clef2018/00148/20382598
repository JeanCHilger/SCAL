Hilar inflammatory pseudotumor mimicking hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the biliary tract is a benign disease, and is extremely rare. Its diagnosis often depends on pathological examination after operation. The histopathological examination shows inflammatory lesions with a polymorphous infiltration and variable amounts of fibrous tissue. This study was undertaken to elucidate that an inflammatory pseudotumor in the right hepatic duct is especially difficult to distinguish from hilar cholangiocarcinoma.The clinical data of one patient with inflammatory pseudotumor of the right hepatic duct were analyzed.An occupying lesion of the right hepatic duct was revealed by abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The right hepatic duct inflammatory pseudotumor was not identified during the operation but was confirmed by postoperative histopathological analysis. The patient recovered well without any serious complication.The preoperative evaluation for optimizing surgical management is important to the diagnosis of hepatobiliary occupying lesions. The evaluation involves clinical manifestations, imaging appearance and tumor markers. Malignant tumors and possible benign lesions should be considered to avoid aggressive surgical treatment.
