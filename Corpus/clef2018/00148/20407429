Pancreatic resection guided by preoperative intraductal ultrasonography for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Successful treatment requires reliable preoperative assessment of the highly variable extension of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). We aimed to determine the role of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) in predicting the extension of IPMN, and in selecting the method of pancreatic resection and the long-term outcome after surgery.Randomized prospective study. Forty consecutive patients who underwent IPMN resection were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to an IDUS group or control group, in which IDUS was not performed.Preoperative assessment by IDUS had an 85% (17 of 20) diagnostic accuracy for tumor extension of IPMN compared with 50% (10 of 20) in cases assessed by other imaging methods without IDUS (P=0.018). In 9 of 15 patients with invasive carcinoma, the tumor was located in the pancreatic head, and 11 had a main duct-type tumor. Recurrent disease was identified in 5 of 15 (33%) patients with invasive IPMN at a mean follow-up of 50 months of them, 1 underwent preoperative IDUS and 4 were assessed by other imaging methods. None of the 25 patients with noninvasive IPMN had recurrent disease at follow-up. The overall cumulative 3-year survival rate was 79%.Preoperative IDUS was useful in determining the type of surgery and the extent of resection, especially in main-duct IPMN.
