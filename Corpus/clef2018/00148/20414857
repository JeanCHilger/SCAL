Gallbladder polyps: prevalence and risk factors. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of gallbladder polyps and possible risk factors in a random population sample of an urban population.A total of 2099 subjects (1072 women, 1027 men aged 19 - 65 years, mean age 42.1 (SD ± 12.8 years) were prospectively examined using ultrasound, a standardized questionnaire and laboratory studies.Gallbladder polyps were identified in 6.1 % (128 / 2099) of all subjects (women: 6.1 % [63 / 1027]) men: 6.1 % [65 / 1072]). Solitary polyps were found in 52.4 % (65 / 124), two polyps in 16.1 % (20 / 124), three polyps in 6.5 % (8 / 124), several polyps in 22.6 % (28 / 124) and multiple polyps in 2.4 % (3 / 124) of subjects. The mean polyp diameter was 4.7 mm (SD ± 2.2The prevalence of gallbladder polyps reported in the present study (6.1 %) is higher than figures previously published for populations in Germany or Europe. The majority of polyps were pedunculate and solitary. A typical risk factor profile for gallbladder polyps could not be identified in the present population sample.
