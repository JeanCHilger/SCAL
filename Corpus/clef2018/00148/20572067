Sonographic measurement of uterus and ovaries in premenarcheal healthy girls between 6 and 13 years old: correlation with age and pubertal status. To provide normal references of sonographic uterine and ovarian size in premenarcheal healthy girls aged 6-13 years in different stages of puberty.Two hundred forty girls were enrolled into the study (mean age ± SD, 9.5 ± 1.7 years [range, 6-13.5 years]). Pubertal status was classified according to Tanner staging. All subjects underwent pelvic sonographic examination for the measurement of uterine volume, body and cervical length, anteroposterior diameter of fundus, body, and cervix, ovarian volume, and both right and left prominent follicular diameter.A gradual increase with age was observed in all uterine and ovarian measurements. Both uterine and ovarian parameters were significantly correlated to age, height and weight, and stages of puberty. Uterine volume was <3.5 cm(3) in 98% of prepubertal girls, and in stage 2 it was significantly more than in stage 1 (3 ± 3.2 versus 1.7 ± 1.7, respectively) (p < 0.001). Uterine body length was also significantly greater in stage 2 than stage 1 (17.5 ± 4.5 versus 14.6 ± 3.3, respectively) (p < 0.001).The reference values for uterus and ovaries were determined in healthy girls. There is a progressive increase in size of internal female genitalia in relation to age, height, weight, and puberty. Uterine volume and body length presented the best correlation with age and stage of puberty.
