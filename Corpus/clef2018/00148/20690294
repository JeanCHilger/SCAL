Spontaneous uterine rupture during pregnancy: case report and review of literature. Rupture of a gravid uterus is a surgical emergency. Predisposing factors include a scarred uterus. Spontaneous rupture of an unscarred uterus during pregnancy is a rare occurrence. We hereby present the case of a spontaneous complete uterine rupture at a gestational age of 34 weeks in a 35 year old patient. The case was managed at the University Teaching Hospital of Yaounde (Cameroon). She had past history of two uterine curettages. She presented with abdominal pain of sudden onset. After ultrasound scan, uterine rupture was diagnosed and an emergency laparotomy done. The entire amniotic sac was found in the peritoneal cavity with a rupture of the uterine fundus. Spontaneous uterine rupture occurs when there is an upper segment uterine scar. This case report shows that past history of curettage is a risk factor for the presence of uterine scar.
