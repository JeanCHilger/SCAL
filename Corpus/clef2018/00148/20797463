Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: MR correlation with surgical and histological findings. To evaluate magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) with high-resolution dynamic gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in determining the imaging features of hilar cholangiocarcinoma that relate to tumour extent and influence resectability.Twenty-six patients that underwent resection were reviewed. Tumour location and extent, lobar atrophy, the degree of portal vein and hepatic artery involvement were recorded. The findings were correlated with surgical and histopathological findings.Biliary assessment was concordant in 14 and discordant in eight of 14 stented and four of 12 non-stented patients. In 63/82 veins and 43/74 arteries results were fully concordant. The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) in predicting involvement of the main portal vein (MPV) at surgery were 83.3, 100, 100, and 92.5% of the left main branch of the portal vein (LPV) were 100, 91.6, 93.3, and 100%MRC with high-resolution dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI is effective in determining tumour extent and vascular involvement, but prior stenting may lead to overestimation.
