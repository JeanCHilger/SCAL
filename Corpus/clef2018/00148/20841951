A case of solitary splenic metastasis from an ovarian cancer 12 years after primary resection. A 57-year-old woman underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for bilateral ovarian tumors (T1b, N0, M0 Stage I b, serous cystoadenocarcinoma) in May 1994. She received 4 courses of CAP (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2+epirubicin 50 mg/m2+cisplatin 60 mg/m2) therapy as adjuvant chemotherapy. An increase of the serum CA125 was detected in December 2006, and abdominal CT revealed a mass in the spleen. Since whole-body FDG-PET-CT showed no evidence of local recurrence of the ovarian cancer or multiple organ metastases, a solitary splenic metastasis from ovarian cancer, even though very rare, was strongly suspected. Splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy was undertaken in December 2007. Histopathological examination revealed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma, suggesting the final diagnosis of solitary splenic metastasis from ovarian cancer. Periodic CA125 measurements are considered very important even over 10 years after surgery for ovarian cancer. Once solitary splenic metastasis is diagnosed, surgical resection would be the treatment of choice.
