Post-cholecystectomy Mirizzi's syndrome: magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstration. A long cystic duct remnant may be found after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Stone may form in the remnant cystic duct and can cause postcholecystectomy syndrome. Remnant cystic duct calculus may rarely result in postcholecystectomy Mirizzi's syndrome. Traditionally, Mirizzi's syndrome has been diagnosed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and treated with open surgery. We report a case of postcholecystectomy Mirizzi's syndrome that developed 3 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A non-invasive diagnosis of Mirizzi's syndrome was made comprehensively by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic stone removal was achieved successfully with ERCP without any complication.
