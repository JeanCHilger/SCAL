Complicated hepatic hydatid cyst and acute pancreatitis. Value of ERCP and treatment with endoscopic sphincterotomy. We present the case of a 29 year-old cholecystectomized woman with hepatic hydatid cysts who was admitted for acute pancreatitis. Echography and abdominal CAT revealed three thydatid cysts-the one in the right liver lobe being complicated-as well as pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) confirmed the suspected diagnosis of intrabiliary hydatid cyst rupture. An endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed, posterior evolution being asymptomatic, thus permitting the postponing of surgery.
