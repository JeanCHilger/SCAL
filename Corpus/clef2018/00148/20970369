Chromosome organization and dynamics in plants. The past few years have brought renewed interest in understanding the dynamics of chromosomes in interphase cells as well as during cell division, particularly meiosis. This research has been fueled by new imaging methods, particularly three-dimensional, high-resolution, and live microscopy. Major contributors are also new genetic tools that allow elucidation of mechanisms controlling chromosome behavior. Recent studies in plants have explored chromatin arrangement in interphase nuclei, chromosome interactions and movement during meiotic prophase I, and mechanisms that ensure correct segregation of chromosomes during anaphase. These studies shed light on chromosome dynamics in a small-genome plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as in plants with large and complex genomes of polyploid origin, such as wheat and maize.
