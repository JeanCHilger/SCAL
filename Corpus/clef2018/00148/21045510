Supratentorial enterogenous cyst: a report of two cases and review of literature. Enterogenous cyst is extremely rare in the supratentorial compartment. Two adult patients with histologically variefied supratentorial entrogenous cyst are described. Light microscopy and immunohistochemistry examination revealed the endodermal origin of the cyst. Enterogenous cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of non-enhancing cyst in the supratentorial compartment. Total excision of the cyst wall should be done wherever feasible. Preventing spillage of the cyst contents during surgery is mandatory to avoid postoperative intractable seizures and craniospinal dissemination.
