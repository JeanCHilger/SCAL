Application of ultrasonic monitoring in induced abortion during the first trimester. To evaluate the value of ultrasonic monitoring in induced abortion during the first trimester.Totally 110 healthy women with a singleton pregnancy between 9 and 11 gestational weeks were enrolled. All the procedures of induced abortion were performed routinely. Ultrasonography was performed when the procedure of induced abortion was completed. Patients with normal ultrasonographic results were assigned in the control group, while patients with abnormal ultrasonographic findings were enrolled in the study group,in which these patients underwent further operations until the ultrasonography showed clear endomembrane line. All the recurretaged tissue in the study group were sent for pathological examinations.Of these 110 patients, 28 (25.5%) entered study group and 82 (74.5%) entered control group. In the study group, trophoblastic cell or chorion was found in the recurretaged tissue in 11 patients (39.3%), in which 3 had trophoblastic cell embedded in smooth muscular tissue, 6 had pathologic deciduas, and 11 had pathologic secretory endometria. In this control group,1 patient (0.9%) had retained products of conception. The operation duration [(20.6∓2.1) min vs.(11.5∓3.5) min, P0.05].Ultrasonic monitoring in induced abortion during the first trimester can decrease the incidence of retained products of conception and will not induce endometrial damage. It is especially useful for women whose fetuses were at older gestational ages.
