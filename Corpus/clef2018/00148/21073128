McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS): early and extensive bone fibrous dysplasia involvement and "mistaken identity" oophorectomy. McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a triad of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP), caf√©-au-lait spots (CALS) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone. The extent of the abnormalities is variable.We report a 3 year old girl with CALS since infancy, FD diagnosed at age of 2.5 years, and at the age of 3 years vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound revealed a cystic mass of the ovary, surgical pathology found ovarian cyst. LHRH stimulation demonstrated GIPP (LH 9.8 mIU/ml and FSH 8.9 mIU/ml normal LH 1.8-10, FSH 9-26 mIU/ml). Radiographs and bone scans demonstrated FD in multiple bones. Peripheral leucocytes and the ovary were negative for GNAS gene mutations. Treatment with Letrasole interrupted the pubertal development.We conclude that the clinical signs of MAS are telling and that timely MAS diagnosis prevents unnecessary oophorectomy. A close follow up is recommended regarding development of endocrine disorders and spreading of FD.
