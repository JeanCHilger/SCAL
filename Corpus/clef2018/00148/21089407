Radiology of acute abdominal pain in adult patients. The radiological evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain has changed in the past decade. In most conditions, plain abdominal radiographs is an insensitive technique which have been replaced with US and CT. US is the initial imaging technique of choice for patients with suspected acute cholecystitis or acute gynecological abnormalities. It is also the primary method for evaluating pregnant women and pediatric patients. CT permits a rapid examination with high diagnostic accuracy and is now the imaging test of choice for most adult patients with acute abdominal pain. The increase in CT use result in a marked increase in radiation exposure in the population. Close cooperation with the referring physician remains essential to avoid CT scans who are not totally justified by medical need and unnecessary radiation exposure.
