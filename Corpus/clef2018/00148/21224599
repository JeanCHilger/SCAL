A case of advanced gastric cancer resistant to S-1 successfully treated with weekly administration of paclitaxel. A 62-year-old female was diagnosed with type 2 advanced gastric cancer in May 2003. Pathological examination showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) revealed paraaortic lymph node metastasis, duodenal metastasis and ascites due to peritoneal dissemination. Chemotherapy with CDDP+S-1 was started and continued. After the chemotherapy, there were progressive diseases. Therefore, paclitaxel (PTX) was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m2/day for 3 weeks followed by a week rest. Clinical symptoms were relieved, and CT scan revealed metastatic lymph nodes were reduced after 4 cycles. After 13 cycles, MRI revealed a solitary brain mass was detected. She was resected for a right temporal-occipital brain metastatic tumor, and local cerebral irradiation was performed. After this operation, she was diagnosed with brain metastasis from advanced gastric cancer. The procedure was interrupted for about 6 months. After rehabilitation, PTX treatment was restarted as 14th cycle. She has survived without recurrence more than 30 cycles after the resection. A weekly administration of PTX may be a promising regimen as second-line chemotherapy for S-1 resistant recurrent gastric cancer.
