Increased arterial stiffness in mildly-hypertensive women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Although risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia, are commonly observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), impairment of vascular function is still controversial. We evaluated the vascular function in young women with PCOS.We evaluated arterial stiffness in 54 women with PCOS and 24 healthy control women using a volume-plethysmographic apparatus equipped with a multi-element applanation tonometry sensor for the left common carotid artery and studied the correlations of various factors.There was no significant difference in age or body mass index between the controls and the women with PCOS. These women with PCOS had a significantly higher serum testosterone and C-reactive protein levels and showed insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. The mean blood pressure in women with PCOS was within the normal range, but still significantly higher than those in the controls. Women with PCOS had a significantly higher brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) than that for the controls (P < 0.02), whereas there was no significant difference in the carotid augmentation index between the two groups. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that blood pressure influences the baPWV in women with PCOS. Arterial stiffness evaluated using the baPWV in mildly-hypertensive women (systolic blood pressure ≥120 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) with PCOS was significantly higher than that in the controls or normotensive women with PCOS.Early changes in vascular function were detected in mildly-hypertensive women with PCOS. Lifestyle interventions to prevent hypertension, such as diet and exercise, should be the first-line of treatment in women with PCOS.
