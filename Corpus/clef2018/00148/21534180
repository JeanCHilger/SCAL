Value of ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of detected pathological gastrointestinal (GI) tract lesions but negative or incomplete endoscopy. The study aim was to investigate the diagnostic value of US-guided percutaneous needle biopsy in the case of suspicious tumor lesion of the GI tract revealed by abdominal US but without detection with endoscopy or with incomplete or no possible endoscopy.Over a defined time period, all consecutive patients with no appropriate endoscopic diagnostic specimen or finding were registered. The patient, diagnostic, and periinterventional characteristics were documented.In total, 16 patients (7 males mean age, 63.2 [range, 43 - 90] years) were enrolled in this study representing a rare but possible constellation from endoscopic practice characterized by no detectable intraluminal tumor growth and a suspicious tumor lesion revealed with abdominal US as found in each case (n = 16) from 01 / 01 / 2003 - 12 / 31 / 2006. The main indications for needle biopsy were pathological colonic cockades (n = 7) and tumor lesions of the stomach and small intestine (n = 9). The first needle biopsy attempt was successful in all subjects (technical success rate: 100 %) using the color-coded US mode in each case (100 %). There were no postinterventional complications (rate: 0 %).Percutaneous US-guided needle biopsy can be considered a safe diagnostic tool for clarifying the differential diagnosis of suspicious tumor lesions of the GI tract (revealed originally only by abdominal US) as the next favorable diagnostic step in the rare situation that endoscopy cannot provide appropriate information, in order to shorten the diagnostic course, to achieve a therapeutic decision and to decrease effort and costs.
