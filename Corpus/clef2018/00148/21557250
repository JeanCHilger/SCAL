Complete resolution of diffuse placenta increta in a primigravida with twin pregnancy: sonographic monitoring. We report a case of timely diagnosis of placenta increta by sonography during the third stage of labor, which avoided any attempt at manual removal of a retained placenta and thus prevented additional postpartum bleeding. The use of intra-cervical injection of vasopressin and methotrexate and application of transcatheter arterial embolization of bilateral uterine arteries and right internal iliac arteries resulted in a good outcome.
