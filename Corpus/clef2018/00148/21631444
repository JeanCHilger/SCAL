Clinical manifestations in women with isolated fallopian tubal torsion a rare but important entity. The diagnosis of adnexal torsion can be difficult to make, especially in isolated fallopian tube torsion (FTT). Only small series and several case reports on isolated FTT have been published in the literature.To demonstrate symptom presentations, objective findings and surgical outcomes in women with isolated FTT over a 12-year period at a tertiary hospital.Using the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, and Clinical Modification, we reviewed the clinical records of women with isolated FTT during 1996 and 2008 at our institute.Seventeen women, age 13-50 (mean 32) with surgically proven isolated FTT, were included. Five women (29.4%) had tubal ligation history. None of these cases were diagnosed before operation. Pain characteristics were variable the onset was sudden in 10 (58.8%) and 17 (100%) complained of lower abdominal pain, but only six (35.3%) had peritoneal signs. Other clinical manifestations were as follows: nausea or vomiting in seven women (41.2%), lower urinary tract symptoms in four (23.5%) and fever in three (17.6%). All the women had a cystic adnexal mass on ultrasound. An enlarged tubal mass (5-14 cm) was found in all the cases at surgery. Eleven women (64.7%) underwent laparoscopy, and six (35.3%) laparotomy for salpingectomy.The diagnosis of isolated FTT is often not made before surgical intervention because clinical features are non-specific. However, it needs to be considered in women with acute lower abdominal pain with a unilateral cystic adnexal mass.
