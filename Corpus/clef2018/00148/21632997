Influence of different rotation angles in assessment of lung volumes by 3-dimensional sonography in comparison to magnetic resonance imaging in healthy fetuses. Three-dimensional (3D) sonographic volumetry is established in gynecology and obstetrics. Assessment of the fetal lung volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in congenital diaphragmatic hernias has become a routine examination. In vitro studies have shown a good correlation between 3D sonographic measurements and MRI. The aim of this study was to compare the lung volumes of healthy fetuses assessed by 3D sonography to MRI measurements and to investigate the impact of different rotation angles.A total of 126 fetuses between 20 and 40 weeks' gestation were measured by 3D sonography, and 27 of them were also assessed by MRI. The sonographic volumes were calculated by the rotational technique (virtual organ computer-aided analysis) with rotation angles of 6° and 30°. To evaluate the accuracy of 3D sonographic volumetry, percentage error and absolute percentage error values were calculated using MRI volumes as reference points. Formulas to calculate total, right, and left fetal lung volumes according to gestational age and biometric parameters were derived by stepwise regression analysis.Three-dimensional sonographic volumetry showed a high correlation compared to MRI (6° angle, R(2) = 0.971 30° angle, R(2) = 0.917) with no systematic error for the 6° angle. Moreover, using the 6° rotation angle, the median absolute percentage error was significantly lower compared to the 30° angle (P < .001). The new formulas to calculate total lung volume in healthy fetuses only included gestational age and no biometric parameters (R(2) = 0.853).Three-dimensional sonographic volumetry of lung volumes in healthy fetuses showed a good correlation with MRI. We recommend using an angle of 6° because it assessed the lung volume more accurately. The specifically designed equations help estimate lung volumes in healthy fetuses.
