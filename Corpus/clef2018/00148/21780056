Gadofosveset enhanced MR phlebography for detecting pelvic and deep vein leg thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis is mainly diagnosed by ultrasound today. In some instances diagnosis is challenging and magnetic resonance angiography could be an attractive alternative. Gadofosveset is a blood pool contrast agent with some favourable properties for this purpose.We investigated eight patients with proven deep venous thrombosis by Gadofosveset enhanced MR phlebography. We performed a 3D gradient-echo sequence with an overall measurement time of 9 minutes and 6 seconds. One minute after injection of Gadofosveset in a concentration of 0.12 ml/kg body weight images were acquired. Thrombi were visualised by their lack of luminal contrast filling.Thrombi were visualised in all patients. In one patient with extended thrombosis a previously undiagnosed ovarian adenocarcinoma was detected additionally.Deep venous thromboses in lower extremities can be visualised reliably by performing MR phlebography with blood pool contrast agent Gadofosveset. Visualisation of the complete venous system is feasible. This investigation method may be performed in patients difficult to investigate with ultrasound or may be used for planning interventional procedures.
