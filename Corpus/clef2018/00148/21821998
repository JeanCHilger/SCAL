Fertility preservation in heterotopic cervical pregnancy: what is the best procedure? We describe a patient who underwent assisted reproduction techniques and was diagnosed with heterotopic cervical pregnancy, and then discuss the management of this entity, which is rare and has no standard protocols. Treatment consisted of intra-arterial methotrexate (50 mg/m(2) body surface area) and simultaneous selective embolization of uterine arteries. The literature is also reviewed to identify other approaches and outcomes.
