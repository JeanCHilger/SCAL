Cystic polyposis of the stomach. An X-ray contrast medium examination revealed extensive polyposis in the gastric fundus of a 66-year-old patient with intermittent heartburn. Physical examination and laboratory tests including carcinoembryonal antigen yielded no abnormal findings. Gastroduodenoscopy showed more than 100 polyps of about 5 mm diameter in the fundus and corpus of the stomach. Gastric mucosa was histologically intact. Numerous cysts lined by non-pathological epithelia were seen in the body and neck of the gastric glands. No polyps were found in the small bowel or colon. Since cystic polyposis does not tend to become malignant, no surgery was performed. Annual endoscopic controls, however, are recommended.
