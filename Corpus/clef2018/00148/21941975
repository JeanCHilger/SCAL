Parovarian tumors of borderline malignancy. The incidence of a parovarian tumor is 10-20% of all uterine adnexal masses, however, it is benign in most cases, and a borderline or malignant tumor is extremely rare. The classification of disease stage and treatment is still controversial owing to its scarcity. We have managed one mucinous and two serous cystadenomas of borderline malignancy originating from paraovarian cysts in our institute over ten year. We report and discuss the cases herein.
