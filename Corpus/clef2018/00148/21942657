Levonorgestrel releasing-intrauterine system for the treatment of menorrhagia and/or frequent irregular uterine bleeding associated with uterine leiomyoma. To evaluate the effectiveness of the levonorgestrel releasing-intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in the treatment of menorrhagia and/or frequent irregular uterine bleeding in women with uterine myomas.Prospective study whereby 102 women with intramural myomas (in a few cases associated with submucous or subserous myomas), suffering from menorrhagia and/or frequent irregular uterine bleeding, were evaluated by means of the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC Higham score) and ultrasound, three, six and 12 months after insertion of a LNG-IUS.The PBAC score dropped (from a mean value of 231.7 to 17.6 at 12 months). The duration of menstrual bleeding diminished significantly (p<0.001). Uterine volume decreased from a mean of 145 cm3 to 129 cm3 at 12 months (p=0.01). Changes in the volume of the myomas were not statistically significant (p=0.23). Satisfaction rate was good in 91 cases (89%), fair in four cases (4%), and poor in seven cases (7%). During the one-year period of follow-up, 11 cases of expulsion or removal of the LNG-IUS were recorded.The LNG-IUS is effective in controlling heavy menorrhagia and/or frequent irregular uterine bleeding related to the presence of myomas, but has no significant effect on the size of the tumours.
