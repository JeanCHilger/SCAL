Polyplex-microbubble hybrids for ultrasound-guided plasmid DNA delivery to solid tumors. Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents are being developed as image-guided gene carriers for targeted delivery in vivo. In this study, novel polyplex-microbubbles were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for systemic circulation and tumor transfection. Branched polyethylenimine (PEI 25 kDa) was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG
