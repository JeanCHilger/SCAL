Preoperative assessment of endometrial carcinoma by three-dimensional power Doppler angiography. Preoperative evaluation of the depth of myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma is challenging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) in this setting.Sonographic and histological data on 100 consecutive cases of endometrial carcinoma were analyzed. The endometrial and myometrial vascular indices VI (vascularization index), FI (flow index) and VFI (vascularization flow index) were calculated by 3D-PDA. The results were compared with a complete surgical staging.The mean ( ± SD) age of patients was 67.1 ± 8.8 (range, 33-87) years. Forty-six patients had deep (≥ 50%) myometrial invasion. Eight patients had metastases, seven of them with deep invasion. Three patients were found to have carcinomas of non-uterine origin on histology, and these were excluded from further statistical analysis. The median endometrial and myometrial vascular indices were higher in the group with deep invasion than in the group without. Following multivariable analysis of the indices only the endometrial FI was independently associated with deep invasion (OR, 1.061 95% CI, 1.023-1.099Our study suggests that endometrial and, to a lesser degree, myometrial vascular indices and endometrial volume correlate with the depth of myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma.
