Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: an important differential diagnosis in psychosis. We present four cases of confirmed anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis three presented initially with serious psychiatric symptoms and the other developed significant psychiatric symptoms during the initial phase of illness. Brain biopsy findings of one patient are also described. Psychiatrists should consider anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in patients presenting with psychosis and additional features of dyskinesias, seizures and catatonia, particularly where there is no previous history of psychiatric disorder.
