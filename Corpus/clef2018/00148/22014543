Risk factors, symptoms, and treatment of ovarian torsion in children: the twelve-year experience of one center. To assess risk factors, clinical findings and mode of diagnosis and treatment in premenarchal children with surgically verified ovarian torsion (OT).A retrospective case review (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).Teaching and research hospital, a tertiary center.Premenarchal children with surgically verified OT.Patients underwent either laparoscopy or laparotomy.Twenty-two cases of OT in 20 premenarchal girls (median age 12 years) were identified. Three cases involved recurrent torsion after detorsion without cystectomy. The main presenting symptoms were sudden pain and vomiting. Six patients underwent Doppler examinations, and all demonstrated an abnormal flow. Seventeen interventions were by laparoscopy. Conservative management, mainly detorsion with additional cyst drainage or cystectomy, was performed in 19 cases (86.4%). Oophoropexy was performed in 3 cases (13.6%). Pathologic examination demonstrated 5 simple cysts and 1 dermoid cyst.Ovarian torsion in premenarchal girls usually presents with intermittent abdominal pain and abdominal tenderness. Other signs and symptoms are nonspecific. When performed, Doppler imaging may assist in diagnosing ovarian torsion in children. Detorsion followed by cystectomy may prevent recurrence.
