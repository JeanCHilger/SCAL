Ultrasound diagnosis of complete uterine inversion in a nulliparous woman. Non-puerperal uterine inversion is an extremely rare event, and the diagnosis is made during vaginal examination or exploratory laparotomy. We report a case of complete uterine inversion which was diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound examination in a 50-year-old nulliparous virgin who was admitted to the hospital because of profuse vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain and anuria. The confirmatory diagnosis of complete uterine inversion secondary to a fundal fibroid was made at exploratory laparotomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy was performed, and the pathological examination confirmed its benign nature. Ultrasound evaluation is useful in the diagnosis of non-puerperal uterine inversion.
