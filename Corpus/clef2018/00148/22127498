Diagnostic yield of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and of EUS-guided fine needle aspiration sampling in gallbladder carcinomas. Obtaining histological evidence of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is difficult due to its extraductal nature, and pathological confirmation remains challenging. We compared the diagnostic value and safety of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in patients with suspected GBC.Eighty-three patients with GBC were evaluated. Prior to definitive management, pathological evidence of GBC was obtained through either ERC cytopathologic sampling (n = 33), EUS-FNA (n = 24) or both (n = 26).Among the 83 patients, 59 (71.0%) with biliary obstruction were sampled using ERC with 47.4% (28/59) sensitivity. In 19 of the remaining 31 cases, EUS-FNA sampling had 100% diagnostic sensitivity. Likewise, 50 (60.2%) of the 83 patients with suspected GBC underwent EUS-FNA of regional lymph nodes or the gallbladder (GB) mass itself with 94.8% sensitivity. The overall diagnostic sensitivity rates of ERC and EUS-FNA were 47.4 and 96%, respectively (P < 0.001). Post-procedural complications were seen in 6.7% of the ERC group (4/59, all were mild pancreatitis), and in none of the EUS-FNA group (P = 0.10).Gallbladder carcinoma sampling using ERC and EUS-FNA should be incorporated into the diagnostic workup of GB lesions as complementary tools, and EUS-FNA should be applied in the setting of failed or not indicated ERC.
