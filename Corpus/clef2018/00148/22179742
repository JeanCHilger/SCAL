Malignant versus benign hepatic masses in patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis: MR differential diagnosis. To assess MR findings and diagnostic performance for differentiating malignant from benign hepatic masses in recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC).During a recent 6-year period, we performed MRI in 352 patients with RPC. Among them, 58 had confirmed hepatic masses cholangiocarcinoma (n = 15), abscess (n = 37), inflammatory pseudotumor (n = 3), biloma (n = 3). Two radiologists assessed MR findings including enhancement patterns, intratumoral appearance, peritumoral changes, mass location, and multiplicity. They also graded the malignancy using common MR findings. The receiver operating characteristic analysis and Chi-square test were used. The Îº statistics was used to determine interobserver agreement.The common findings for cholangiocarcinoma were thin and lobulated enhancement at the periphery (n = 8, 53%, P < 0.05) ill-defined enhancement (n = 7, 47%, P < 0.05)MR imaging is very useful for differential diagnosis of malignant vs. benign hepatic masses in patients with RPC.
