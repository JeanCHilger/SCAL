Ultrasound and epidemiological features of ectopic pregnancy in a suburb of Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire). The aim of our study was to describe current ultrasound and epidemiological features of ectopic pregnancy in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.This prospective study was carried out over a 24-month period (February 2006 to January 2008) at Nanglé Medical Clinic, i.e., a private clinic located in Abidjan's Yopougon suburb.A total of 32 cases of ectopic pregnancy were discovered by suprapubic and/or endovaginal ultrasound scan. The estimated frequency of ectopic pregnancy was 1.7%. Mean patient age was 26.2 years. The main risk factors were prior history of abortion (32%) and adnexal infection (20%). Most patients (52.5%) were nulliparous. The most frequent indication for ultrasound scan was metrorrhagia. Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was made at the ruptured stage in 65.6% of cases and nonruptured stage in 34.4%. The presenting lesions was hematosalpinx in 40.6% of cases and embryonate ectopic gestational sac in 31.3%. Salpingectomy and salpingorrhaphy were successful in 65.6% and 34.4% of cases respectivlely.In Abidjan, ectopic pregnancy involves young nulliparous women with a prior history of abortion and adnexal infection. Ultrasound allowed early diagnosis and, consequently, tube preservation in 34.4% of cases.
