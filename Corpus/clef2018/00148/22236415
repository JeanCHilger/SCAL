Endoscopic ultrasonography is a relatively new technology that combines the use of flexible fiberoptic endoscopes with high-resolution ultrasound technology. It proved to be highly accurate and useful in the staging of gastrointestinal malignancies, as well as in characterizing the nature of subepithelial lesions and disorders of the pancreaticobiliary system.
