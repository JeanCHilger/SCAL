Clinics in diagnostic imaging (137). A 45-year-old woman presented with generalised body itch, dark-coloured urine and pale stools for six day. Ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography revealed dilated intrahepatic ducts with stricture at the proximal common bile duct. The gallbladder was replaced by a large heterogeneous mass invading the liver and common bile duct. She underwent gallbladder resection, right hemihepatectomy, Whipple procedure, portal vein resection and reconstruction. Histopathology revealed diffusely infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder. The patient made satisfactory postoperative recovery. The imaging features of gallbladder carcinoma are discussed.
