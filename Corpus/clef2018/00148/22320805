Automated teniae coli detection and identification on computed tomographic colonography. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is a minimally invasive technique for colonic polyps and cancer screening. Teniae coli are three bands of longitudinal smooth muscle on the colon surface. Teniae coli are important anatomically meaningful landmarks on human colon. In this paper, the authors propose an automatic teniae coli detection method for CT colonography.The original CTC slices are first segmented and reconstructed to a 3D colon surface. Then, the 3D colon surface is unfolded using a reversible projection technique. After that the unfolded colon is projected to a 2D height map. The teniae coli are detected using the height map and then reversely projected back to the 3D colon. Since teniae are located at the junctions where the haustral folds meet, the authors apply 2D Gabor filter banks to extract features of haustral folds. The maximum response of the filter banks is then selected as the feature image. The fold centers are then identified based on local maxima and thresholding on the feature image. Connecting the fold centers yields a path of the folds. Teniae coli are extracted as lines running between the fold paths. The authors used the spatial relationship between ileocecal valve (ICV) and teniae mesocolica (TM) to identify the TM, then the teniae omentalis (TO) and the teniae libera (TL) can be identified subsequently.The authors tested the proposed method on 47 cases of 37 patients, 10 of the patients with both supine and prone CT scans. The proposed method yielded performance with an average normalized root mean square error (RMSE) ( ± standard deviation [95% confidence interval]) of 4.87% ( ± 2.93%, [4.05% 5.69%]).The proposed fully-automated teniae coli detection and identification method is accurate and promising for future clinical applications.
