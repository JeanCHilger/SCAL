Three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound for the study of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. To evaluate the blood flow characteristics of the cervix in normal women and in women with cervical precancerous lesions or cervical cancer.We studied 165 women with three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound (3D-PDU), of whom 71 had cervical cancer, 61 had precancerous lesions and 33 were healthy controls. The cervix was manually traced in the stored volumes using 15Â° rotation steps and the following 3D-PDU indices were calculated: vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). These indices were compared among the study groups and were also correlated with features of the precancerous lesions group and cancer group.The three indices were all statistically significantly higher in the cervical cancer group and precancerous lesions group than in controls (P < 0.001). In addition, significantly higher values of all indices were found in the cervical cancer group than in the precancerous lesions group (P < 0.001). Further analysis according to patient characteristics in the cancer group showed that VI, FI and VFI were not significantly different in relation to grade, histology, presence of positive lymph nodes or lymphovascular space involvement (P > 0.05). However, VI was significantly higher in patients with Stages IIIB-IV cancer than in patients with less advanced disease (P = 0.045). In the cervical cancer group there was a significant positive correlation between 3D-PDU indices and cervical volume.3D-PDU assessment of the cervix reveals significant differences in all indices studied between women with cervical precancerous lesions or cancer and healthy women. In women with cervical cancer, an advanced stage is associated with higher VI, but 3D-PDU indices are not related to other pathological characteristics.
