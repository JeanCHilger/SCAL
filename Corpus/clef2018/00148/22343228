Ovarian cancer screening. Annual screening of asymptomatic postmenopausal women using a combination of transvaginal sonography and serum Ca-125 has been evaluated in 4 major clinical trials as a means to facilitate earlier detection of ovarian cancer. In several trials, screening has caused a decrease in stage at detection. These ovarian cancer screening trials are reviewed. The effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality varies in different trials and is the subject of further investigation.
