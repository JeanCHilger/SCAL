Comprehensive review of the diagnosis and treatment of biliary tract cancer 2012. Part II: multidisciplinary management. Biliary tract cancers (gallbladder cancer, intra- and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma and selected periampullary cancers) accounted for 12,760 new cases of cancer in the USA in 2010. These tumors have a dismal prognosis with most patients presenting with advanced disease. Early, accurate diagnosis is essential, both for potential cure where possible and for optimal palliative therapy in all others. This review examines the currently available and emerging technologies for diagnosis and treatment of this group of diseases.
