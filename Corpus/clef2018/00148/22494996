Giant cell tumor of uterus resembling osseous giant cell tumor: case report and review of literature. Osteoclast-like giant cells (OLGCs) are multinucleated cells of histiocytic lineage and have been identified in a wide array of neoplasms. In the uterus, they have most frequently been reported in association with leiomyosarcomas. This article describes a case of an osteoclast-like giant cell-rich uterine tumor that was essentially indistinguishable at the morphologic and immunophenotypic levels, from typical giant cell tumor of bone. This is the first example of such a case that has been reported in the uterus to the authors' knowledge.
