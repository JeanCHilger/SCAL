Ultrasound diagnosis of gallbladder polyps. The most frequent benign gallbladder polyps are cholesterol polyps. Next in frequency were adenomas, which may have malignant potential. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of cholesterol polyps compared to adenomas. Patients were examined during the period from October 2006. to December 2008. In Department of Ultrasound, Clinic for Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Belgrade. The group of 54 patients analyzed consisted of 30 women (56%) and 24 men (44%). Most (59%) had solitary polyps. In 92.6% of patients the size of polyps was below 10 mm. 74% of respondents were over 50 years. Ultrasonography is the method of choice and gold standard in diagnosis of gallbladder polyps. Based on echoic properties cholesterol polyps can not be distinguished from adenomas. Malignant alteration of polyps also could not be detected. Appropriate ultrasonographic characteristics such as size of polyps, appearance of a broad base that sits on the wall, concomitant lithiasis findings and patient age may be indicative for malignancy.
