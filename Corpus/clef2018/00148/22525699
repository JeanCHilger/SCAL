Emergency ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: case report. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an exaggerated response to ovulation induction therapy. It is a known complication of ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing treatment for infertility. As assisted reproductive technology and the use of ovulation induction agents expands, it is likely that there will be more cases of OHSS presenting to the Emergency Department (ED).OHSS has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from mild abdominal pain to severe cases where there is increased vascular permeability leading to significant fluid accumulation in body cavities and interstitial space. Severe cases may present to the ED with ascites, pericardial effusions, pleural effusions, and lower extremity edema. Through a case report, we review OHSS with an emphasis on early diagnosis by Emergency Physician (EP)-performed bedside ultrasonography.We present a case of a patient undergoing treatment for infertility who presented to the ED with shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of severe OHSS was made, largely based on EP-performed bedside ultrasonography showing peritoneal free fluid and bilateral pleural effusions, as well as multiple ovarian follicles.This report reviews the pathophysiology of OHSS, its clinical features, and pertinent diagnostic and management issues. This report emphasizes the importance of early EP-performed bedside ultrasonography.
