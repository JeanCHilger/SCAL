Intralobar pulmonary sequestration: an uncommon case with triple arterial supply and systemic venous drainage. Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital pulmonary malformation. We report a case of a 10-month-old infant with intralobar pulmonary sequestration diagnosed in utero. The lesion had an uncommon blood supply consisting of three large arteries deriving from the thoracic aorta and venous drainage into the inferior vena cava.
