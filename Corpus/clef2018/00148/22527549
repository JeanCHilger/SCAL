Periurethral angioleiomyoma in a female patient. A 51-year-old white woman, gravida 4, para 3-0-1-3 referred to our urogynecology clinic for evaluation of questionable symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse was found to have a periurethral mass with associated urinary urgency. She underwent transvaginal excision of this mass, and pathology revealed angioleiomyoma. Her urinary urgency has resolved after surgery. No prior periurethral angioleiomyoma has been reported in female patients.
