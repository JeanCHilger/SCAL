Polyps of the gallbladder. Gallbladder polyps are a common incidental finding in ultrasound. They may be clinically significant, because adenomas have a malignant potential, in contrast to the benign cholesterol polyps occuring more frequently. As non-neoplastic polyps and neoplastic polyps cannot be morphologically discriminated in ultrasound, maximal diameter of a polyp has proven to be the best predictor for malignancy. Cholecystectomy is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for patients with polyps >1 cm. Patients with polyps <1 cm should have a follow-up check for a longer period of time (with the exception of very small polyps).
