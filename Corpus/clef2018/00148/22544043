Pelvic tuberculosis mimicking advanced ovarian malignancy. We sought to identify the characteristic features of pelvic tuberculosis (TB) in women with symptoms and sonogaphic findings which were otherwise consistent with an ovarian malignancy. This study is a retrospective analysis of 138 women who underwent an operation and had a preoperative diagnosis of ovarian malignancy at the Government Medical College Hospital, Chandigarh, from January 2004 to January 2008. Among these 138 women, seven cases (5.7%) of pelvic TB were identified. Abdominal pain and distension were the most common presenting symptoms. All patients had a pelvic mass, six had ascites (85%) and five had a fever (71%). The mean cancer antigen (CA) 125 level was 295 IU (13-529). Pelvic TB can present with symptoms and signs which mimic ovarian malignancy. Therefore, a high-index of clinical suspicion should be maintained when treating patients in countries with a high prevalence of TB.
