Unique duodenal hamartomatous polyp--case report. Duodenal tumors are very rare tumors, with the lower incidence among the tumors of the small bowel, whose frequence is less than 5 % of all digestive tumors. In most of the cases these tumors remain asymptomatic, sometimes the entire life. When they become symptomatic, their first manifestation is the loss of digested blood (melena), secondary anemia and obstructive symptomatology. Early diagnosis of these tumors is difficult because of the unsystematic symptomatology and becomes easy when the complications appear. In most of the cases the diagnosis is establish by the superior digestive endoscopy, followed by barium contrast studies, CT and ultrasound. We present a case of duodenal hamartomatous polip, unique, at the level of D3, in a female patient 66 years old, addressing to our service for superior digestive hemorrhage exteriorizated by melena, secondary anemia and physical asthenia we operated the patient procedeeing a polypectomy by a duodenotomy.
