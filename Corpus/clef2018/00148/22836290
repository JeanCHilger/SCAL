Uterine rupture in the second trimester of pregnancy as an iatrogenic complication of laparoscopic myomectomy. Uterine rupture is one of the most dangerous obstetric emergencies carrying a high risk for the mother and the fetus. Reports about uterine rupture in pregnancy following previous laparoscopic surgery have not been frequent however, an increasing rate of the occurrence of this complication has been observed and reviewed in contemporary literature. We report a case of a spontaneous uterine rupture at 22 weeks of gestation in a 25-year old primigravida, who had had a laparoscopic removal of a small, peduncular, asymptomatic myoma located in the right uterine horn 20 months earlier. Ultrasound examination and subsequent urgent laparotomy confirmed a spontaneous uterine rupture with a nonviable fetus in the peritoneal cavity. Women planning to become pregnant should be qualified for laparoscopic myomectomy with special carefulness. Special attention must be paid to the potential solutions that limit the risk of postoperative uterine rupture, if the absolute necessity for the enucleation of myomas during the reproductive age occurs and a decision about laparoscopic intervention is made.
