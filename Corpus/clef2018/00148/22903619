Time-efficient CT colonography interpretation using an advanced image-gallery-based, computer-aided "first-reader" workflow for the detection of colorectal adenomas. To assess the performance of an advanced "first-reader" workflow for computer-aided detection (CAD) of colorectal adenomas ≥ 6 mm at computed tomographic colonography (CTC) in a low-prevalence cohort.A total of 616 colonoscopy-validated CTC patient-datasets were retrospectively reviewed by a radiologist using a "first-reader" CAD workflow. CAD detections were presented as galleries of six automatically generated two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images together with interactive 3D target views and 2D multiplanar views of the complete dataset. Each patient-dataset was interpreted by initially using CAD image-galleries followed by a fast 2D review to address unprompted colonic areas. Per-patient, per-polyp, and per-adenoma sensitivities were calculated for lesions ≥ 6 mm. Statistical testing employed Fisher's exact and McNemar tests.In 91/616 patients, 131 polyps (92 adenomas, 39 non-adenomas) ≥ 6 mm and two cancers were identified by reference standard. Using the CAD gallery-based first-reader workflow, the radiologist detected all adenomas ≥ 10 mm (34/34) and cancers. Per-patient and polyp sensitivities for lesions ≥ 6 mm were 84.3 % (75/89), and 83.2 % (109/131), respectively, with 89.1 % (57/64) and 85.9 % (79/92) for adenomas. Overall specificity was 95.6 % (504/527). Mean interpretation time was 3.1 min per patient.A CAD algorithm, applied in an image-gallery-based first-reader workflow, can substantially decrease reading times while enabling accurate detection of colorectal adenomas in a low-prevalence population.Computer-aided detection (CAD) is increasingly used to help interpret CT colonography (CTC). An image-gallery first-reader CAD-workflow is feasible for detection of colorectal adenomas ≥ 6 mm. Image-gallery first-reader CAD yields per-patient sensitivity of 89.1 % and specificity of 95.6 %. The mean reading time for CTC was 3.1 min, making screening feasible. No large adenoma was missed by the radiologist who reviewed with CAD galleries.
