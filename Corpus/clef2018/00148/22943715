Ultrasound changes in the relationship between the urethra and bladder neck caused by prolapse repair: feasibility and reliability of measurements. The objective of this study was to assess whether intraoperative transperineal ultrasound can be used to assess changes in the relationship between the urethra and bladder caused by a prolapse repair operation. The reliability of the measurements was also assessed. A total of 25 women having an anterior colporrhaphy operation had pre- and post-repair imaging using a standard bladder volume. There was a statistically significant change (p ≤ 0.04) in the posterior urethrovesical angle (PUA) from 115° (SD 37) before surgery, to 135° (SD 30) after surgery. There was no significant change (p = 0.93) in the anterior urethrovesical angle before 73° (SD 14) after surgery 73° (SD 14). Interclass correlation coefficients showed good reproducibility for all measurements. Ultrasound can be used to measure changes in the relationship of the urethra and bladder produced by anterior colporrhaphy. Clinically, the effect of these changes is to reduce the angulation of the urethra in relation to the bladder.
