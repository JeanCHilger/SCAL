Semen apoptotic M540 body levels correlate with testis abnormalities: a study in a cohort of infertile subjects. What are the associations between semen apoptotic M540 bodies and other parameters of semen quality and sonographic alterations of the male genital tract in a cohort of infertile subjects?In infertile subjects, semen M450 bodies are highly correlated with ultrasound and clinical signs of testis abnormalities but not with alterations of other parts of the male genital tract, suggesting a testicular origin of M540 bodies.We have reported the presence in semen of round anucleate elements, named 'M540 bodies', resembling apoptotic bodies as they contain several apoptotic markers.A consecutive series of 130 males with couple infertility were evaluated, during the same day session, for clinical, scrotal and transrectal color-Doppler ultrasound characteristics, and hormonal and semen parameters, including interleukin 8 (sIL-8) and M540 body levels.Semen parameters were analyzed by WHO recommended procedures. CDU was performed using the ultrasonographic console Hitachi H21. sIL-8 and serum hormones were evaluated by ELISA methods.The average percentage value of M540 bodies was 24.6 Â± 18.3. After adjusting for possible confounders (age, waist, calculated free testosterone and smoking habit), M450 body levels negatively correlated with sperm number/ejaculate, progressive motility, normal morphology and sIL-8 levels (adj.r = -0.455, P < 0.0001 adj.r = -0.464, P < 0.0001The increased M540 body semen levels in men with a history of cryptorchidism should be confirmed in a larger number of patients.M540 bodies may be considered a semen marker of altered testis function and thus their evaluation may be helpful in the diagnosis of male infertility.This work was supported by grants from Ministry of University and Scientific Research (Prin project to E.B. and FIRB project to S.M.) and Regione Toscana (to G.F.).
