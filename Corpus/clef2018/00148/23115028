Principles of surgery for retroperitoneal sarcoma. The successful treatment of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas requires an experienced team consisting of not only surgeons but also pathologists and radiologists with a high case load in these tumours. The decisive step in the preoperative work-up of these, often late detected, tumours is their reliable grading as well as, if necessary, recognition of the sarcoma subtype as a basis for determining the direction of treatment. Imaging methods provide essential information with regard to the detection of infiltration of neighbouring structures and organs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable method for this purpose. Punch needle biopsy is to be preferred over fine-needle biopsy in all cases for histological confirmation. The surgical standard procedure for the majority of the patients comprises multivisceral resection as principle, with additional colon resection, nephrectomy, and resection of abdominal wall musculature or, respectively, the psoas muscle in order to achieve an R0 resection of the retroperitoneal compartment. If only small margins of clearance are to be expected, a preoperative (neoadjuvant) treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy even in combination with deep wave hyperthermia for high grade sarcomas should be strongly considered. Adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy often cannot be adequately applied due to the occupation of the former tumour bed by abdominal organs that were displaced by the mass effect, especially the radiation-sensitive small bowel. The optimal treatment strategy for these patients must be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board prior to any diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.
