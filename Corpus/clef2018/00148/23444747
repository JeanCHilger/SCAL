Three-dimensional ultrasound and three-dimensional power Doppler improve the preoperative evaluation of complex benign ovarian lesions. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and three-dimensional power-Doppler (3DPD-US) as adjuncts to conventional B-mode-US in evaluation of complex benign ovarian lesions.Transvaginal B-mode-US, 3D-US and 3DPD-US were performed in 29 patients with unilateral ovarian lesion. Patients were classified as low or high risk for malignancy according to a standardized scoring system composed of ten morphological and vascular parameters. Preoperative scores were matched to the histological results and the diagnostic performance of the scoring system was calculated.Seven out of the 16 cases of endometriomas (44%) were graded as low risk masses according to B-mode-US, while the addition of 3D-US and 3DPD-US increased the accuracy to 56% and 94%, respectively. All dermoid cysts were classified as high risk cases by B-mode-US, but 3D-US and 3DPD-US correctly classified 14% and 57% of cases, respectively. The use of B-mode-US, 3D-US and 3DPD-US correctly classified all four cystadenomas. Only the use of 3DPD-US correctly classified one out of two hemorrhagic corpus luteum cases, whereas the other imaging modalities characterized these lesions as high risk. The overall diagnostic accuracy increased from 38%, 48%, ana 83% with the application of B-mode-US alone, or combined with 3D-US and 3DPD-US, respectively.Conventional ultrasound supplemented with 3D-US and 3DPD-US and the evaluation of findings according to a specific scoring system can facilitate the preoperative classification of complex benign ovarian lesions.
