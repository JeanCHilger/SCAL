Dehiscent scar in the lower uterine segment after Caesarean section and IVF infertility treatment: a case report. Caesarean section is the most common obstetric operation associated with short and long term risks, one of which is uterine scar dehiscence. In this case report we describe four cases of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF+ET) treatment where the embryo was transferred into the uterus with known scar dehiscence in the lower uterine segment after a previous Caesarean section (SC).All transfers of embryos were ultrasound guided directly into the middle of uterine cavity. All resulting pregnancies continued without problems related to the dehiscent scar and babies were delivered in the third trimester by elective/emergency SC.Our cases suggest that IVF+ET can be offered as an infertility treatment option despite a dehiscent scar in the lower uterine segment after previous SC.
