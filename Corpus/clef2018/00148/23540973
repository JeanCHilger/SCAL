Endoscopic approach to the patient with congenital anomalies of the biliary tract. Congenital biliary tract anomalies typically present with neonatal cholestasis. In children and adults, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound are used to evaluate and treat choledochal cysts. Contrarily, endoscopy has traditionally played a minor role in the diagnosis of the cholestatic infant. Recent studies support the incorporation of ERCP into the diagnostic algorithm for biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis. But at present, most pediatric liver centers do not consider its use essential. This article reviews the congenital biliary tract anomalies in which endoscopy has been shown to contribute to the evaluation of the cholestatic infant.
