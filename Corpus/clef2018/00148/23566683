Interest of 3D ultrasound in the follow-up of tubal sterilizations: case report of a rare tubal perforation. The Essureâ„¢ system's effectiveness is based on the follow-up at three months. The challenge is to find a minimally invasive imaging technique to locate the devices. Therefore, many authors recommend three-dimensional ultrasound in first-line. We report here an exceptional case of tubal perforation for which ultrasound failed to diagnose. Until then, only three cases have been reported in the literature, noting the difficulty to diagnose this complication. Indeed, although ultrasound is described as reliable, reproducible and non-radiating, it is a dynamic examination, operator dependent, exposing to the risk of misinterpretation.
