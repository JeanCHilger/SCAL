Prognostic factors for successful varicocelectomy to treat varicocele-associated male infertility. The present study identified prognostic factors for successful varicocelectomy for the treatment of varicocele-induced male infertility. All varicoceles were diagnosed and graded by physical examination and ultrasound. Pre- and postoperative analysis of semen specimens measured sperm density, morphology and motility. 'Responder' and 'non-responder' status was determined by semen analyses at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Varicocele Grades 1, 2 and 3 were found in 16, 36 and 28 patients, respectively 49 patients (61.3%) were responders based on improved seminograms. Significant postoperative increases were noted in sperm density (from 18.20 ± 14.76 × 10(6) to 32.36 ± 24.81 × 10(6)mL(-1)
