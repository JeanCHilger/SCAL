Ultrasonographic evaluation of the uterine cervix length remaining after LOOP-excision. To assess whether there is a correlation between the length of a conization specimen and the length of the cervix measured by vaginal ultrasonography after the operationProspective observational study including patients less than 45 years with measurement of cervical length before and the day of the conization, and measuring the histological length of the specimen.Among the 40 patients enrolled, the average ultrasound measurements before conization was 26.9 mm (± 4.9 mm) against 18.1mm (± 4.4mm) after conization with a mean difference of 8.8mm (± 2.4mm) (difference statistically significant P<.0001). The extent of histological specimen was 9 mm (± 2.2mm) on average. A correlation between ultrasound and histological measurements with a correlation coefficient R=0.85 was found statistically significant (P<0.0001). Moreover, the rate of cervix length remove by loop-excision in our series is 33% (± 8.5%).A good correlation between the measurements of the specimen and the cervical ultrasound length before and after conization was found, as a significant reduction in cervical length after conization. The precise length of the specimen should be known in case of pregnancy and the prevention of prematurity due to conization rests on selected indications and efficient surgical technique.
