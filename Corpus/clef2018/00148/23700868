Placenta percreta leading to uterine rupture at 18 weeks of pregnancy with consecutive hysterectomy: a case report. A 26-year-old woman in the fourth pregnancy with a history of two Cesarean sections and one dilation and curettage was admitted to the hospital at 18 weeks of gestation with acute abdominal pain. Life-saving laparotomy revealed uterine rupture and placental invasion into the uterine wall. Supracervical hysterectomy was performed. This case shows that pathological placentation due to previous cesarean sections may be the cause of uterine rupture.
