How to predict spontaneous resolution of early pregnancies?. Assessment of early pregnancy is indicated in women with suspected abnormalities. It is based on biochemical assessment and on trans vaginal sonography .To identify clinical, biological and ultrasonographic parameters that are predictive of spontaneous pregnancy resolution. methods: A prospective observational study was performed interesting women with a positive pregnancy test without visualization of the pregnancy on the initial scan. All parameters measured during the initial visit were tested by univariate and multivariate analysis to identify parameters predicting spontaneous resolution of pregnancy.A total of 2675 women were included in the study. In 94 cases (4 %) the location of pregnancy was unknown. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that four parameters contributed significantly to the predictive power of the logistic model: Absence of pain (p =0,036), endometrial thickness < à 12 mm (p =0,021), initial serum βhCG level < 1000 UI/l (p =0,015) and progesterone level < 29 nmol/l (p <0,001).Women with a high probability of spontaneous resolution of their pregnancies can benefit from a spaced monitoring until the rate of ß-hCG will be negative.
