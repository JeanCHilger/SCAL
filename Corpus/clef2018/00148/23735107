Advanced techniques for endoscopic biliary imaging: cholangioscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, confocal, and beyond. Cholangioscopy, endosonography, and confocal microscopy represent important technologies that expand biliary imaging beyond a level previously realized by noninvasive modalities (ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic ultrasonography has shown efficacy for the evaluation of indeterminate biliary strictures however, this modality seems most reliable for distal bile duct abnormalities and in the setting of a moderate to high pretest probability for malignancy. Further refinement of these technologies, validation of their respective diagnostic criteria, and study within the context of comparative, randomized trials are needed and will contribute greatly to expedient patient care.
