Prevalence of maxillary sinus pathology in patients considered for sinus augmentation procedures for dental implants. To determine the prevalence of maxillary sinus pathology in patients presenting for implant rehabilitation involving sinus augmentation procedures.Three-dimensional images of 275 patients were evaluated. Age and gender were recorded to see if they had any relationship to the prevalence of pathology. Scans were classified into 1 of the 5 categories based on the type of sinus pathology detected: healthy, mucosal thickening > 5mm, polypoidal mucosal thickening, partial opacification and/or air fluid level, and complete opacification.Overall, 54.9% scans were classified as healthy, and 45.1% scans were classified as exhibiting sinus pathology. Men were more likely to exhibit pathology compared with females (P < 0.01). However, age did not seem to have any relation on the prevalence of sinus pathology. Of the patients who presented with evidence of sinus pathology, 56.5% had mucosal thickening (â‰¥ 5 mm), 28.2% with polypoidal thickening, 8.9% partial opacification and/or air/fluid level, and 6.5% complete opacification.It is proposed that, based on the findings of this study, 45.1% patients would require further consultation before proceeding with maxillary sinus augmentation surgery.
