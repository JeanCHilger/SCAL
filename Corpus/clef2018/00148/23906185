Clinical usefulness of classification by transabdominal ultrasonography for detection of small-bowel stricture. To assess the clinical usefulness of transabdominal ultrasonography (TUS) for detection of small-bowel stricture.Subjects were 796 patients undergoing double-balloon endoscopy (DBE), December 2003-October 2011. All underwent TUS prior to DBE. The TUS findings were classified by type as intestinal narrowing and distension at the oral side (Type A) extensive bowel wall thickening (Type B)Small-bowel stricture was detected by DBE in 11.3% (90/796) of patients. Strictures resulted from Crohn's disease (n = 36), intestinal tuberculosis (n = 24), malignant lymphoma (n = 9), ischemic enteritis (n = 6), NSAID ulcer (n = 5), radiation enteritis (n = 2), surgical anastomosis (n = 2) and other abnormalities (n = 6). Stricture was detected by TUS in 93.3% (84/90) of patients, and each such stricture fell into one of the three types of TUS abnormality. The remaining 6 strictures were detected only by DBE. DBE-identified strictures corresponded to TUS findings as follows: 100% (43/43) to Type A, 59.1% (29/49) to Type B, 14.8% (12/81) to Type C and 1% (6/623) to Type D. Correspondence between stricture and the Type A classification (vs. Types B, C and D) was significantly high, as was correspondence between stricture and Type B (vs. Types C and D).TUS was shown to be useful for detecting small-bowel stricture. We recommend performing TUS first when a small-bowel stricture is suspected.
