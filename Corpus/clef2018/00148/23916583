Effects of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system on urinary symptoms in patients with adenomyosis. We hypothesized that treatment of adenomyosis with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) can concurrently improve urinary incontinence along with irritative and obstructive symptoms and thus positively affect the patients' quality of life.Sixty-five patients suffering from heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) with dysmenorrhea diagnosed with uterine adenomyosis by ultrasound were enrolled in this study. LNG-IUS was inserted in the outpatient department for the treatment of the uterine adenomyosis. The patients filled out two validated questionnaires, the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), before and 6 months after the insertion of the LNG-IUS. The before and after scores were compared using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 44.5 ± 6.5 years. Both UDI and IIQ scores were significantly lower at 6 months after treatment with the LNG-IUS (P<0.0001). UDI scores revealed improvement rates of 14.3%, 35.7%, and 22.7% for urinary incontinence, irritative symptoms, and obstructive symptoms, respectively. Moreover, improvements in irritative and obstructive symptoms were significantly correlated with improvements in menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea (P<0.04). IIQ scores demonstrated improvement rates of 18.9%, 14.6%, 19.7%, and 18.5% for physical activity, travel, social relations, and emotional health, respectively.LNG-IUS used for treating menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea improved urinary incontinence along with irritative and obstructive symptoms in patients with adenomyosis.
