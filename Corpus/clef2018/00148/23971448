MRCP in patient care: a prospective survey of gastroenterologists. MRCP is increasingly used to evaluate pancreaticobiliary disease, yet its effect on patient care is unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of MRCP on referring physicians' initial diagnoses, the physicians' confidence in their diagnoses, and the influence of MRCP results on clinical management.We prospectively surveyed gastroenterologists who referred patients for nonurgent MRCP for pancreaticobiliary evaluation. Before MRCP, gastroenterologists reported the working diagnosis, confidence level (high, moderate, low), and next step in clinical management if MRCP was unavailable. MRCP was performed with standard protocols, including secretin enhancement. After reviewing MRCP findings and without referring to their previous assessment, gastroenterologists reported a revised diagnosis, confidence level, and next step in clinical management. They then compared pre- and post-MRCP management plans and rated the influence of MRCP on changing management from 1 (none) to 5 (major). Diagnostic confidence and frequency of common diagnoses and recommendation for an invasive next-step procedure (e.g., ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasound were compared between pre- and post-MRCP assessments.Survey data were analyzed on 171 patients (123 women, 48 men mean age, 50 [SD, 17] yearsUse of MRCP significantly changes gastroenterologists' treatment of patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary disease by increasing diagnostic confidence and reducing the frequency of invasive follow-up procedures.
