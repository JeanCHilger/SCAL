Laparoscopic resection of antenataly identified duodenal duplication cyst. We report the first case of complete laparoscopic resection of a duodenal duplication cyst (DDC) in an 8-mo-old patient. The cyst was diagnosed by routine antenatal ultrasound performed at 3 mo of gestational age. Although the baby was born asymptomatic without any congenital abnormalities, the cyst had continued to increase on serial sonographic examinations. Previous reports have described treatment of DDC by surgical resection (laparotomy) or endoscopic marsupialization we describe here, the first report of laparoscopic approach to resect DDC in a pediatric patient with a favorable outcome.
