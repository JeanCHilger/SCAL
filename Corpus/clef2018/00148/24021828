Value of high resolution ultrasonography in assessment of laryngeal lesions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of high resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) in diagnosis of various laryngeal lesions which already diagnosed with rigid endoscopy.Prospective study with control group.Sixty-six patients were suffering from throat symptoms and pre-examined by rigid endoscopy under local anesthesia and diagnosed to have a laryngeal lesion and 32 volunteers compose the control group. All 98 persons (patients and control groups) were examined by HRUS.HRUS was helpful in describing various laryngeal lesions, vocal fold polyps (17) 25.7%, glottic cancer (6) 9.1%, epiglottic enlargement (2) 3.1% and one patient had laryngocele (1.5%). HRUS was highly significant in diagnosis of subglottic lesions (10) 15.2%. Also vocal fold mobility can be demonstrated by HRUS. While interarytenoid lesions (17) 25.8% and small laryngeal lesions as vocal fold nodules (13) 19.6% were difficult to be described.Rigid endoscopy in laryngeal examination gives us large, bright image but it is difficult to diagnose patients with a sensitive gag reflex, patients with neck or jaw diseases or stridor and very difficult in infants and children. HRUS is an alternative method in diagnosis of some laryngeal lesions, and it is superior in the diagnosis of small subglottic lesions.
