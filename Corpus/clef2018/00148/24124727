Transgastric migration of gossypiboma remedied with endoscopic removal: a case report. Retained surgical instrument or sponge following an intra-abdominal surgery is a potentially dangerous medico-legal problem. The condition may manifest either as asymptomatic or severe gastrointestinal complications. Transmural migration of gossypiboma is a rare entity that may lead to bowel or visceral perforation, obstruction and/or fistula formation. Transmural migration of an intra-abdominal gossypiboma has been reported to occur in stomach, ileum, colon, bladder, vagina and diaphragm. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case reported in the medical literature. However, we report the first case of the largest gossypiboma to date: a surgical gas compress measuring 20 Ã— 20 cm which was successfully treated endoscopically.A 52-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice was referred to our clinic. She had a medical history of cholecystectomy and T-tube drainage for choledocholithiasis a year previously. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a mass located into the stomach which was compatible with gastric carcinoma. On the gastroscopy, a surgical gas compress that had totally migrated into the stomach was observed. The compress was successfully removed by gastroscopy through the esophagus. The recovery of the patient was uneventful.Transmural migration of gossypiboma into the stomach should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any postoperative patient with obstructive jaundice symptoms. Endoscopy may be feasible for both diagnosis and treatment even though the size of gossypiboma is large. However, surgery should be considered in case of fixed reaction or incomplete migration of gossypiboma located into the stomach.
