The special role of ultrasound for screening, staging and surveillance of malignant ovarian tumors: distinction from other methods of diagnostic imaging. Ovarian cancer is the most aggressive gynecologic malignancy, with a 5-year survival rate ranging around 40%. A crucial factor influencing the prognosis is early detection of a suspicious mass and referral to a gynecologic oncology center for further diagnosis, staging and debulking surgery. Here, we present the different imaging methods ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging, computer tomography (CT) and 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT that are used for the characterization, diagnosis, staging and surveillance of ovarian cancer. In this review, we focus on US and discuss in detail the advantages and the limitations, as well as the appropriate indications for each of the individual imaging techniques.
