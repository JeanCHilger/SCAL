Transvaginal sonographic features of perineal masses in the female lower urogenital tract: a retrospective study of 71 patients. To assess the transvaginal ultrasonographic features of perineal masses in the lower urogenital tract in a cohort of 71 women.Seventy-one women with perineal masses were referred consecutively for transvaginal ultrasonography. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound was used to scan the pelvic floor, including the urethra, vagina and rectum, and identify any possible areas of interest. A static three-dimensional (3D) sonographic reconstruction of the pelvic anatomy was created to further delineate the relation of the lesions with their neighboring structures. Ultrasound results were compared retrospectively with surgical pathology outcome when possible.Seventy-nine cystic, cystic-solid or solid masses were detected on transvaginal 2D ultrasonography in the 71 women: in 44 patients, 47 anechoic cystic masses were identified and diagnosed as vaginal wall cysts in 19 patients, 23 hyperechoic cystic masses were diagnosed as vaginal epidermoid cystsTransvaginal 2D and 3D ultrasonography is an accurate, non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic modality for the delineation of congenital, septic and neoplastic lower urogenital tract perineal masses in women.
