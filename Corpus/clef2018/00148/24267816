Intracardiac leiomyomatosis complicated by pulmonary embolism: a multimodality imaging case of a rare entity. We present a case of intravenous leiomyomatosis with intracaval and right ventricle extension that was misdiagnosed as venous thrombus. Part of the mass had split and embolized the pulmonary artery, requiring urgent surgery. Although the mass fragments were removed from the inferior vena cava, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery successfully, this case clearly shows the importance of prompt surgery.
