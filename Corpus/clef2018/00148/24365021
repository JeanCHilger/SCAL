A slowly reabsorbed, echogenic surgical thread provides a long-lasting ultrasound-detectable marker of grafted ovarian tissue. This communication reports a novel technical solution for the orthotopic transplant of cryostored-thawed ovarian tissue. The described technique was applied to three young women with iatrogenic ovarian failure. An echogenic thread that is reabsorbed after 6 months was used to fasten the thawed ovarian small fragments before grafting them onto the atrophic ovary. This technical solution made it possible to avoid the loss of small tissue pieces during laparoscopic grafting as well as to precisely localize the grafted tissue by transvaginal ultrasound during the following months. The precise localization of the grafted tissue was particularly helpful when its revascularization and functional recovery were followed up using, respectively, colour Doppler and transvaginal follicle growth examination. In conclusion, the use of a slowly reabsorbed, ultrasound-detectable surgical thread as an ultrasound-detectable marker able to improve the localization of the exact site at which ovarian tissue was grafted is proposed.
