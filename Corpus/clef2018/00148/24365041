Evaluation and management of small-bowel tumors in the era of deep enteroscopy. In summary, small-intestine tumors are a rare phenomenon, but they are being discovered more frequently with newer diagnostic techniques. Prior studies of the small bowel were limited, making the diagnosis difficult. With the advent of CE and deep enteroscopy, gastroenterologists are finding these tumors at an earlier stage, thereby offering better management options for these patients. Although the incidence of small-bowel tumors has increased, the survival rates have remained the same. This may be a lag-time bias but could be a future area of research in this emerging field.
