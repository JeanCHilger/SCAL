Full High-definition three-dimensional gynaecological laparoscopy--clinical assessment of a new robot-assisted device. To investigate the clinical assessment of a full high-definition (HD) three-dimensional robot-assisted laparoscopic device in gynaecological surgery.This study included 70 women who underwent gynaecological laparoscopic procedures. Demographic parameters, type and duration of surgery and perioperative complications were analyzed. Fifteen surgeons were postoperatively interviewed regarding their assessment of this new system with a standardized questionnaire.The clinical assessment revealed that three-dimensional full-HD visualisation is comfortable and improves spatial orientation and hand-to-eye coordination. The majority of the surgeons stated they would prefer a three-dimensional system to a conventional two-dimensional device and stated that the robotic camera arm led to more relaxed working conditions.Three-dimensional laparoscopy is feasible, comfortable and well-accepted in daily routine. The three-dimensional visualisation improves surgeons' hand-to-eye coordination, intracorporeal suturing and fine dissection. The combination of full-HD three-dimensional visualisation with the robotic camera arm results in very high image quality and stability.
