The role of endometrial thickness for detecting endometrial pathologies in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the significance of endometrial sampling in asymptomatic, bleeding-free postmenopausal women who have endometrial thickness greater or equal to 5 mm.A retrospective review was conducted of all women who underwent transvaginal ultrasonography between January 2000 and March 2009 in a menopause clinic, who were found to have an endometrial thickness of at least 5 mm and who were subjected to endometrial sampling.Five hundred and thirty asymptomatic postmenopausal women underwent ultrasonographic evaluation with subsequent endometrial sampling. The mean endometrial stripe thickness was 8.7 mm (range: 6-26). Five cases of adenocarcinoma (0.9%) and 65 (12.2%) cases of simple/complex atypical hyperplasia were diagnosed.In this study, 106 investigations were performed to detect one case of adenocarcinoma. Although this is a high number per case detection of endometrial adenocarcinoma, considering the rising incidence of endometrial cancer, large prospective trials with surrogate criteria for asymptomatic women are needed to investigate the importance of thickened endometrial stripe in postmenopausal women.
