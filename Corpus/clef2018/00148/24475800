Hilar cholangiocarcinoma: value of adding DW imaging to gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging with MR cholangiopancreatography for preoperative evaluation. To assess the benefit of adding diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging to gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR cholangiopancreatography in the preoperative evaluation of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. The study included 52 patients (36 men, 16 women mean age, 63.4 years) with surgically confirmed hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and DW imaging at 3.0 T between August 2010 and December 2011. Two observers independently reviewed two image sets--a gadoxetic acid set, including images from MR cholangiopancreatography, and a combined gadoxetic acid set and DW imaging set--to evaluate the tumor involvement of each biliary confluence and vascular and liver invasion by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.For each observer, area under the ROC curve (Az) values for tumor involvement of the biliary confluence were 0.965 and 0.957 for the gadoxetic acid set and 0.980 and 0.975 for the combined set, respectively (P > .05). For detecting 105 biliary confluences with tumor involvement, the sensitivities with the combined set (97.1% [102 of 105] and 98.1% [103 of 105]) were higher than those with the gadoxetic acid set (91.4% [96 of 105] for both observers) (P = .029 and P = .016), although the specificities were similar with both image sets (P > .05). For the detection of liver invasion, the combined set (75.0% [15 of 20] for both observers) yielded better sensitivity than the gadoxetic acid set (50.0% [10 of 20] and 45.0% [nine of 20]) (P = .016 and P = .031). For evaluation of vascular invasion, the two image sets showed similar diagnostic performance.In the preoperative evaluation of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the addition of DW imaging to gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging could improve sensitivity in the evaluation of tumor extent along the bile duct and liver invasion.
