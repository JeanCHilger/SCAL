Cornual pregnancy after surgical treatment of an incarcerated fallopian tube: a case report. Incarceration of the fallopian tube is a rare condition. Symptoms are often misleading, making proper diagnosis difficult because of nonspecific clinical presentations. We report a case of cornual pregnancy occurring 7 months after the treatment of an incarcerated fallopian tube. We believe that the abnormal cornual implantation of the gestational sac was due to myometrial reconstruction of the uterine wall.A primigravid woman treated for the incarceration of a fallopian tube was subsequently found to have a cornual pregnancy in a septate uterus. The cornual pregnancy was successfully aborted after laparoscopic myometrial reconstruction, and a metroplasty allowed a subsequent pregnancy.This hazardous type of ectopic pregnancy can be managed with systemic administration of methotrexate. If the cornual pregnancy is correctly identified at an early stage, this medical management can be attempted and offers the potential advantage of avoiding surgery and increasing the likelihood of preserving fertility.
