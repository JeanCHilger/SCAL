Laparoscopic partial cystectomy with mucosal stripping of extraluminal duodenal duplication cysts. Duodenal duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies. Duodenal duplication should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with abdominal symptoms with cystic structures neighboring the duodenum. Here, we present an 8-year-old girl with a duodenal duplication cyst treated with partial cystectomy with mucosal stripping performed laparoscopically. Laparoscopic surgery can be considered as a treatment option for duodenal duplication cysts, especially in extraluminal locations.
