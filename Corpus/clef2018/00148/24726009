A case of recurrent, bilateral ovarian mature teratoma in a young woman. Ovarian mature cystic teratomas are common, benign, pelvic tumors that are easily detected by pelvic ultrasonography. However, patients with recurrent teratomas are rarely noted, and cases of bilateral teratomas are even less common.A young woman with a recurrent, right ovarian teratoma had previously undergone surgical removal 2 times. After the second surgery, she underwent regular out-patient follow-up, and no residual tumor was observed. However, 3Â years after the second surgery, she developed recurrent, bilateral ovarian teratomas, in conjunction with elevated carbohydrate antigen-125 levels.Routine checking of the contralateral ovary during the surgical procedure along with frequent postoperative pelvic sonography for both ovaries in the patient at high recurrence rich is necessary. Additionally, the features of that kind tumor may mislead the surgeon into performing more extensive surgery that might compromise the fertility of young patients.
