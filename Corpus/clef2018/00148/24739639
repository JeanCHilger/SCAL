Significance of digital three-dimensional reconstruction techniques in the diagnosis of pelvic mass. To explore the significance of digital three-dimensional reconstruction techniques in the diagnosis of female pelvic mass.Original computed tomographic angiography (CTA) datasets of 72 patients with pelvic mass who were hospitalized in Southern Hospital of Southern Medical University from October 2009 to October 2012 were collected. All cases were undergone the B-mode ultrasound and CTA examination, the datasets were input into the Mimics Version 10.01 software respectively to construct digital three-dimensional models of pelvic, arterial blood network, pelvic mass and organs.On the basis of without knowing the diagnosis of the disease on CTA, two gynecologists gave the final diagnosis of the disease after observing and analyzing the supply blood vessels and the relationship between the adjacent organs of pelvic mass through rotate the three-dimensional model by single-blind method. Define the postoperative pathological diagnosis as the standard, and compare the coincidence rate between the postoperative pathological diagnosis with diagnosis results on different inspections (including B ultrasound results, CTA results or the diagnosis on the three-dimensional model of pelvic mass).We successfully reconstructed 72 patients' three-dimensional model which could clearly display anatomic structure of pelvic bone, abdomen and pelvic arterial branches at different levels and the anatomic relationship between the mass and main organs in the pelvis. In all cases, 56 of them preoperative B-mode ultrasound examination were consistency with the postoperative pathological diagnosis, the coincidence rate was 78%, the preoperative CTA inspection results of 58 patients were consistency with the postoperative pathological diagnosis, the coincidence rate was 81%. While the diagnosis rate of 66 patients on the basis of digital three-dimensional model were consistency with that of the postoperative pathological diagnosis, the coincidence rate was 92%. Compared the compliance rate between diagnosis of pelvic mass based on the digital three-dimensional model and preoperative B-mode ultrasound, there were significant difference(P = 0.021).While compared with the preoperative CTA examination, there was not significant difference (P = 0.054).The pelvic three-dimensional models in vivo constructed by the digital three-dimensional reconstruction technique could visually display the source of the blood supply and the relationship between the pelvic organs, and guide to diagnosis and assess preoperatively.
