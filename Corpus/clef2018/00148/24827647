Migration of intrauterine devices with radiological findings: report on two cases. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are one of the most reliable and cheapest contraception methods. Our aims are to evaluate misplaced IUDs with radiological findings and to emphasise the importance of radiological imaging. We report two cases with radiological findings, one of complete migration to the abdomen without colonic perforation and one of partial migration to the bladder lumen with pregnancy. Uterine perforation and migration of IUDs are rare and undesirable complications. Suspected intra-abdominal IUDs can be evaluated with CT for precise localisation and possible complications without pregnancy.
