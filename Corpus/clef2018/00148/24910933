Contrast ultrasonography for tubal patency. Evaluation of tubal patency is an essential part of a fertility workup. Laparoscopy with chromopertubation in conjunction with hysteroscopy is the gold standard in evaluation of tubal patency and the uterine cavity. In this review article we describe a newer method for evaluation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, that is, hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy). Accuracy of HyCoSy for tubal patency has been shown to be comparable to that with hysterosalpingography (HSG) when compared with laparoscopic chromopertubation. Sensitivity ranges from 75% to 96%, and specificity from 67% to 100%. HyCoSy is also accurate when compared with HSG in determining tubal occlusion after hysteroscopic sterilization, with 88% of patients stating they would prefer to undergo the tubal occlusion test in their gynecologist's office. Because HyCoSy also includes evaluation of the uterine cavity with saline solution-enhanced sonohysterography, accuracy in evaluating the uterine cavity is >90% when compared with hysteroscopy. HyCoSy enables the gynecologist to complete a fertility workup in the office in the most minimally invasive way. HyCoSy is well tolerated and has been suggested in the literature to replace HSG for evaluation of tubal disease in the subfertile population.
