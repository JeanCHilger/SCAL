Diagnosis and management of choledochal cyst: 20 years of single center experience. We report the first case series from Africa and the Middle East on choledochal cyst, a disease which shows significant geographical distribution with high incidence in the Asian population. In this study, the epidemiological data of the patients are presented and analyzed. Attention was paid to diagnostic imaging and its accuracy in the diagnosis and classification of choledochal cyst. Most cases of choledochal cyst disease have type I and IV-A cysts according to the Todani classification system, which support the etiological theories of choledochal cyst, especially Babbitt's theory of the anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, which are clearly stated. The difficulties and hazards of surgical management and methods used to avoid operative complications are clarified. Early and late postoperative complications are also included. This study should be followed by multicenter studies throughout Egypt to help assess the incidence of choledochal cysts in one of the largest populations in Africa and the Middle East.
