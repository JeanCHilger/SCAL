One-year dynamic MRI follow-up after vaginal mesh repair: evaluation of clinical, radiological, and quality-of-life results. Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common disorder in elderly women often surgically repaired with alloplastic meshes yet knowledge of the pelvic floor behavior and multi-compartment defects postoperatively is scarce.To evaluate the 1-year outcome after mesh repair in patients with POP using clinical examination (CE), dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), and the prolapse quality-of-life (P-QOL) questionnaire.A prospective observational study was conducted of 69 women undergoing pelvic mesh surgery. Clinical examination, dMRI, and the P-QOL questionnaire were applied before and after surgery to evaluate POP. Mean outcome measures were POP outcome as determined on clinical and dMRI examinations and its impact on quality of life. Statistical results were obtained with SPSS version 15.0. ANOVA was used to compare pre-/postsurgical quality of life data.Sixty-nine women (mean age, 64.75 years BMI, 26.75 kg/m(2)The 1-year follow-up after mesh repair showed statistical and clinical improvement for all tools employed. dMRI seems a reliable tool for simultaneous assessment of defects in all three compartments, but tends to overestimate POP compared to clinical examination.
