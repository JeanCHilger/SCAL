Endometrial thickness affects the outcome of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in normal responders after GnRH antagonist administration. The goal of this study was to assess the association between endometrial thickness on the chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) day and in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) outcome in normal responders after GnRH antagonist administration.A retrospective cohort study was performed in normal responders with GnRH antagonist administration from January 2011-December 2013. Patients were divided into four groups according to endometrial thickness, as follows: <7 mm (group 1), > = 7- < 8 mm (group 2), > = 8- < 14 mm (group 3), and > =14 mm (group 4).A total of 2106 embryo transfer cycles were analyzed. The pregnancy rate (PR) was 44.87%.The clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate and the implantation rate (17.28%, 13.79%, 10.17%, respectively) were significantly lower in group 1 compared to the other three groups (p < 0.05). The miscarriage rate was higher in patients with endometrial thickness less than 7 mm. The clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate and implantation rate were highest in patients with endometrial thickness higher than 14 mm, but showed no difference in patients with those of endometrial thickness between 8-14 mm.There is a correlation between endometrial thickness measured on hCG day and clinical outcome in normal responders with GnRH antagonist administration. The pregnancy rate was lower in patients with endometrial thickness less than 7 mm compared with patients with endometrial thickness more than 7 mm.
