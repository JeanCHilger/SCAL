Risks and benefits of hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling as a standard procedure for assessing serendipitous findings of endometrial thickening in postmenopausal women. A retrospective study was undertaken of 35 asymptomatic postmenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy, dilatation and curettage (H D&C) for an incidental finding of thickened endometrium to assess the rate of significant pathological findings, cost per finding and complication rate of any procedures performed. This study found one case of endometrial adenocarcinoma (1/35 3%) at an estimated cost per significant finding of $507,116 with an estimated 11.6 complication events per finding.
