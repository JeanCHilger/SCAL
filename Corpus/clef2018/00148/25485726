Circulating AMH reflects ovarian morphology by magnetic resonance imaging and 3D ultrasound in 121 healthy girls. In adult women, Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by small growing follicles, and circulating levels of AMH reflect the number of antral follicles as well as primordial follicles. Whether AMH reflects follicle numbers in healthy girls remains to be elucidated.This study aimed to evaluate whether serum levels of AMH reflects ovarian morphology in healthy girls.This was a population-based cohort study involving the general community.Included in the study were 121 healthy girls 9.8-14.7 years of age.Clinical examination, including pubertal breast stage (Tanner's classification B1-5), ovarian volume, as well as the number and size of antral follicles were assessed by two independent modalities: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Ellipsoid volume, follicles ≥2 mm and Transabdominal ultrasound, Ellipsoid and 3D volume, follicles ≥1 mm. Circulating levels of AMH, inhibin B, estradiol, FSH, and LH were assessed by immunoassaysAMH reflected the number of small (MRI 2-3 mm) and medium (4-6 mm) follicles (Pearson's Rho [r] = 0.531 and r = 0.512, P < .001) but not large follicles (≥7 mm) (r = 0.109, P = .323). In multiple regression analysis, small and medium follicles (MRI ≤ 6 mm) remained the main contributors to circulating AMH (β, 0.501 P < .001) whereas the correlation between AMH and estradiol was negative (β, -0.318Similarly to adult women, small and medium antral follicles (≤6 mm) were the main contributors to circulating levels of AMH in girls.
