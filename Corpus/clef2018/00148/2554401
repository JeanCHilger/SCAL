A comparison of the efficacy of sonography, computed tomography, ERCP and angiography in the diagnosis of primary bile duct carcinoma. Sonography, CT, ERCP and angiography were carried out in 22 patients with operatively and histologically confirmed primary carcinomas of the bile duct and the findings were compared with the appearances at operation. ERCP proved to have an accuracy of about 79% and is markedly superior to the other diagnostic methods. Sonography had an accuracy of about 39%, CT 42% and angiography 55%.
