Transvaginal ultrasonography and hysteroscopy as predictors of endometrial polyps in postmenopause. The study compared ultrasound and ambulatorial hysteroscopy as diagnostic methods detecting endometrial polyps in postmenopause women. 281 women aged 41-82 years who underwent ambulatorial hysteroscopy were analyzed for presence of uterine bleeding and/or altered transvaginal ultrasound (endometrial thickness ≥5 mm). Ultrasonography detected endometrial polyps in 22.8% of patients and endometrial thickening in the other 59.8%. Hysteroscopy diagnosed endometrial polyps in 80.8%. Ultrasonography showed sensitivity of 88.7%, specificity of 25.4%, positive predictive value of 81.7%, negative predictive value of 37.5% and accuracy of 75.4% in diagnosing endometrial polyps. Hysteroscopy showed 96.4% sensitivity, 74.6% specificity, 93.4% positive predictive value, 84.6% negative predictive value and 91.8% accuracy. Hysteroscopy demonstrated more accuracy than ultrasonography, which is not sufficient for accurate diagnosis.
