Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of spinal tumours. The use of gadolinium diethylenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) (Magnevist) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (0.15 T) in the assessment of spinal tumours is described. Thirty-five patients were entered into the study and a total of 39 examinations were performed. The information obtained from unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences was compared with the Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1 images. Thirty patients had intradural lesions and five had extradural lesions. A variable pattern of enhancement of intramedullary tumours was found, which in part reflected differences in the cystic component of the lesions. Extramedullary intra- and extradural lesions generally showed marked enhancement. The greatest contribution to management decisions was in the evaluation of intramedullary tumours where the use of contrast enhancement facilitated the precise localization of active tumour, differentiation of cystic and solid components of tumour, separation of tumour from peritumoral oedema and, in cases of suspected recurrence, aided distinction between tumour and both post-operative scarring and radiation damage.
