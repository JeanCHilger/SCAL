Diagnose and treatment of post-cesarean section scar diverticulum by hysteroscopy combined ultrasonography and laparoscopy. To investigate the application of hysteroscopy combined ultrasonography and laparoscopy in the diagnose and treatment of post-cesarean section scar diverticulum (PCSD).From March 2011 to February 2013, 27 patients with PCSD were diagnosed and treated in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital. All patients were diagnosed by hysteroscopy and ultrasonography. Treatment protocols were decided by the thickness of the diverticulum. The clinical data of all patients were analysed fully.(1) All patients were diagnosed by hysteroscopy combined ultrasound, of which only 17 cases were diagnosed by preoperative ultrasound, the coincidence rate was 63% (17/27). (2) The thickness of diverticulum was measured by hysteroscopy combined ultrasound. Thickness of less than 3 mm in 19 cases, were treated by hysteroscopy combined with laparoscopy diverticulectomy repair no less than 3 mm in 8 cases, were used hysteroscopy diverticulum incision. (3) The effective rate was 7/8 after hysteroscopy, and which was 16/19 after laparoscopy combined with hysteroscopy surgery. There was no difference in the treatment effect (P=0.663). The ineffective rate was 1/8 after hysteroscopy, and which was 3/19 after laparoscopy combined with hysteroscopy surgery. The size of the PCSD was smaller and the thickness of diverticulum was thicker than preoperation in the later one, which has no difference in the former one.(1) Hysteroscopy combined ultrasound is an accurate method for the diagnose of PCSD. (2) According to the thickness of the diverticulum operation method is choosed, which is beneficial to reduce the trauma, and relieve symptoms. (3) Diverticulum poor positioning and incomplete resection are the main causes of postoperative recurrence of the diverticulum.
