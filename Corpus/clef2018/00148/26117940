Selection of the sites for microsurgical vasoepididymostomy: A report of 56 cases of epididymal obstructive azoospermia. To explore the prediction of the site for microsurgical vasoepididymostomy (VE) in the treatment of epididymal obstructive azoospermia (OA).This study involved 56 infertile men with confirmed OA whose obstruction was suspected to be in the epididymis. Based on their medical history and results of preoperative physical examination and ultrasonography, we predicted the sites for VE. We performed surgical scrotal exploration for the status of epididymal obstruction, conducted palpation and microscopic observation for the epididymal tubules to be anastomosed, and finally decided on the sites for VE by making sure of the presence of motile sperm in the epididymal fluid of the patients. After surgery, we followed up the patients for the rate of pregnancy.All the patients received bilateral scrotal ultrasonography and surgical scrotal exploration, totaling 112 procedures, including 98 VE procedures. The accuracy rate of the predicted sites for VE was 80.5% (153/190) by medical history and physical examination, 80.3% (90/112) based on the results of ultrasonography, and 87.4% (90/103) according to the first selected epididymal tubules. Of the 28 patients followed up for more than 12 months, motile sperm were found in 19 (67.9% ) at 2 to 12 months and spontaneous pregnancies were achieved in 10 (35.7%), all with the anastomotic sites in the corpus or cauda.Medical history and physical examination contribute to the selection of anastomotic sites and non-invasive scrotal ultrasonography is effective and practical for positioning epididymal obstruction. The epididymal tubules with motile sperm for anastomosis could be easily obtained from the most dilated ones in indurated epididymides.
