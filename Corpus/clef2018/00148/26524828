Giant cervical myoma associated with urinary incontinence and hydroureteronephrosis. Cervical leiomyomas compromise fewer than 5% of all uterine leiomyomas. Cervical myomas exacerbates surgical difficulties, such as poor operative field, difficult suture repairs, and blood loss. When performing myomectomy for cervical myomas, care must be taken to avoid injuries to neighboring structures in the pelvic cavity.These structures include the bladder in front of the cervix, the rectum behind the cervix, and the uterine arteries and ureters on both sides. Myomectomy for cervical myoma is empirically difficult and frequently problematic. The authors report a case of giant cervical myoma presenting with urinary incontinence.
