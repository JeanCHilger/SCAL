Evaluating the Acute Abdomen in the Pregnant Patient. Acute abdominal pain in pregnancy presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Ultrasound remains the primary imaging investigation of the pregnant abdomen because of its availability, portability, and lack of ionizing radiation. MR imaging has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of gynecologic and obstetric problems and in the setting of acute abdomen during pregnancy. MR imaging is often used when ultrasound is inconclusive. Computed tomography is the investigation of choice when there is a life-threatening situation and in case of traumatic injuries, when a rapid diagnosis is required.
