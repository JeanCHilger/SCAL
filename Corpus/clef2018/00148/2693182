Ultrasonographic and x-ray computed tomographic aspects of Mirizzi's syndrome. The Mirizzi syndrome is due to common hepatic duct obstruction secondary to the impaction of a large gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder or the cystic duct. The sonographic and computed tomography features in 3 cases of Mirizzi syndrome are described and compared with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography findings. The Mirizzi syndrome was diagnosed preoperatively on sonography in 2 out of 3 cases and on plain computed tomography scans in all 3 cases. However pre or intraoperative visualization of the biliary tract is mandatory in suspected Mirizzi syndrome to detect the presence or absence of cholecystobiliary fistula, in order to adapt the operative strategy.
