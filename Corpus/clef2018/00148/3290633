Current management of liver hydatid cysts: results of a 10-year study. During the 10-year period July 1977 to June 1987, 23 patients were referred to one surgical department with hepatic hydatid cysts. Accurate diagnosis in all but one case was possible by hydatid serology (hydatid immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and ultrasonography or computed tomography which showed the presence of daughter cysts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated the presence of hepatic-duct hydatid cysts in one case. The probable source of the hydatid infection was identified in all 23 cases. The surgical management was standardized and included the use of a suction cone to prevent spillage the closure of biliary communications under vision
