Primary tumours of the small intestine--the diagnostic problem. The records of 43 patients with 32 malignant and 11 benign neoplasms of the small intestine were reviewed in order to improve early diagnosis. The malignant tumours comprised of 14 carcinoids, 10 carcinomas and 8 sarcomas. The benign tumours constituted 7 different histological types. An increasing frequency of malignant tumours through the bowel was found. Thirty-three per cent of all patients had a sudden onset of symptoms leading to acute explorative laparotomy, whereas the remaining 67 per cent were characterized by a long history. The predominant symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weight loss and a palpable abdominal mass. An exact preoperative diagnosis was made in 41 per cent of the cases. Upper gastrointestinal X-ray contrast examination with small bowel follow through and ultrasonography gave the greatest sensitivity. A diagnostic strategy was difficult to recommend considering the rarity of these tumours and the low sensitivity of the employed diagnostic modalities. Recently developed Japanese enteroscopes capable of exploring the entire small bowel seem to offer the most promising diagnostic method for the future.
