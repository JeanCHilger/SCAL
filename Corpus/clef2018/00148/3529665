Papillomatosis of the bile ducts. In patients with signs of obstructive jaundice also rare diseases such as biliary papillomatosis should be taken into consideration. These primarily benign epithelial tumours show a tendency of recurrence and malignant degeneration and, therefore, have to be regarded as precancerous. An early preferably preoperative diagnosis is essential, because extensive surgical treatment is required. Today this diagnosis can be made by ultrasound, ERCP or PTC. This study describes 2 cases of progressive biliary papillomatosis observed in 1978 and 1985. (One female 48 years, one male 53 years). The first case was only diagnosed after relaparotomy, and several palliative operations were carried out without satisfying results. In contrast, in 1985 the diagnosis was suspected by ultrasound, confirmed by ERCP and biopsy, and a liver transplant was performed successfully.
