Sonoendoscopic evaluation of extraesophageal and extragastric abnormalities: a review. A conventional fiberoptic gastroscope was modified to incorporate a 9-MHz transducer 7 cm from the tip. Conventional fiberoptic gastroscopy could be performed simultaneously with sonoendoscopic evaluation of the esophagus and gastric, extraesophageal, and extragastric areas. The instrument was utilized to evaluate intra- and extra-luminal abnormalities of the mediastinum and upper abdomen. This paper presents our data on extraluminal disease. Small hepatic and pancreatic tumors were identified, occasionally with more accuracy than conventional imaging studies. Additionally, mediastinal tumors, gastrointestinal tumors, and cardiac abnormalities were also clearly demonstrated.
