Acute pancreatitis in children. Twenty-nine children with acute pancreatitis were managed during the period 1971 to 1983. Aetiology included trauma (5), mumps (5), drug therapy (4), biliary disease (1), and cystic fibrosis (1) 13 cases were classified as idiopathic. Diagnosis could be difficult, and unnecessary laparotomies were performed in 7 instances for suspected appendicitis. One patient, however, had a well-justified laparotomy revealing coexisting severe appendicitis and pancreatitis. Morbidity included relapses (7), pseudocysts (3), obstructive duodenal hematoma (1), and miscellaneous problems (4). Improvements in management included endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) to exclude anatomical anomalies in relapsing cases, ultrasonography for the diagnosis of pseudocysts and for follow-up measurements in two such cases successfully managed conservatively, and increasing use of total parenteral nutrition in cases with protracted disease or serious complications.
