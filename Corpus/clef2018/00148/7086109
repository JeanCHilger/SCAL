Cystadenoma of the liver. We report a patient with cystadenoma of the liver who presented with jaundice and abdominal mass. Although cystadenoma of the liver is a rare neoplasm, the lesion was diagnosed preoperatively by gray scale ultrasonography, PTC and ERCP. Characteristically, cystadenoma shows a multiseptated cystic appearance. While the origin of a cystadenoma is unclear, theories of synchronous development from anomalous bile ducts, endodermal diverticula, and ectopic germ cell origins have been promoted. Approximately 85% of patients with hepatic cystadenoma are women, with an insidious onset of symptoms due to the slowly growing nature of this tumor. Common symptoms include right upper quadrant mass, abdominal distension, and dull abdominal pain. Jaundice is less common. Complications include biliary obstruction, infection, hemorrhage, and rupture. As hepatic cystadenoma tends to recur after inadequate excision, and has malignant transformation potential, hepatic lobectomy has been promoted as definitive treatment.
