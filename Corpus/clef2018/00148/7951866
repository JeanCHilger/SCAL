Adult mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver mimicking bile duct cystadenoma. We report a rare case of mesenchymal hamartoma in the cirrhotic liver of a 52-year-old Japanese male. The tumor, 3.5 cm in diameter, contained a cystic lesion and was located in the lateral segment. Bile duct cystadenoma was considered most likely preoperatively because of the patient's age and the normal levels of tumor markers. However, since malignancy of the lesion could not be ruled out by preoperative imaging diagnosis, lateral segmentectomy was performed. Histological examination led to a diagnosis of mesenchymal hamartoma, since the lesion consisted of a multilocular abnormal bile duct accompanied by abundant myxomatous or loose collagen.
