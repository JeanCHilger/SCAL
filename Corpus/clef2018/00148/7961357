Imaging of polypoid endoluminal growing bile duct tumors. We reviewed the radiological documents and protocols of 196 cases of bile duct tumors examined over a period of 12 years: 20 of them (10.2%) presented with a polypoid endoluminal growth. The aim of this study was to provide a better knowledge about the radiological features of this less frequent kind of tumor. In these 20 cases, the correct diagnosis of bile duct lesion was provided in 100% by E.R.C.P., P.T.C., U.S. as well as C.T., and in 42% by arteriography. The correct diagnosis of tumor was made by E.R.C.P. in 86%, by P.T.C. in 88%, by U.S. in 61%, by C.T. in 63%, and by arteriography in 25%. A correct diagnosis of tumor could be reached in all cases by combination of several examination techniques. The anatomopathological diagnosis was: bile duct adenocarcinoma (7 cases), adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (4), villous adenoma of Vater's ampulla (2), cystadenoma (1), cystadenocarcinoma (1), hepatocellular carcinoma (1), apudoma (1), and metastases (3).
