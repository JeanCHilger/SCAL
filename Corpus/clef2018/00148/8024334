Ectopic left ureter emptying into the ipsilateral seminal vesicle: diagnosis with nuclear magnetic resonance. We report on a 35-year-old male patient with ectopic left ureter entering the seminal vesicle associated with ipsilateral renal dysplasia who consulted for pain in the left renal fossa, painful ejaculation and recurrent episodes of left epididymitis. Patient evaluation included cystoscopy, urography, CT and MRI. However, only MRI showed precise images of the trajectory of the ectopic ureter, thereby obviating the need for other invasive diagnostic techniques and permitting surgical correction of the anomaly.
