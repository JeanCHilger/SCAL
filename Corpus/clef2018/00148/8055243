Using endoscopic ultrasound imaging, highly accurate gastrointestinal tumor characterization and staging is now possible without surgery. Precise endosonographic preoperative staging allows use of the TNM pathological staging system to stratify treatment for esophageal, gastric, rectal, and pancreatobiliary tumors. Endoscopic ultrasonography often establishes a diagnosis in malignant and, in certain patients, benign disease accurately evaluates anastomoses for recurrent tumor
