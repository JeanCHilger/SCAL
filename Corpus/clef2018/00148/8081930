Laparoscopic ultrasonography: limits and potential of present technologies. During recent years, laparoscopic contact sonography has been introduced into clinical practice to remedy the limitations of minimal invasive surgery. The technology of laparoscopic ultrasound probes is described in this paper as well as the technique of US contact scanning via the laparoscopic approach. This method is a tool which allows the examination of tissues and non-palpable parenchymal organs in endoscopic surgery, thus permitting correct assessment of both anatomy and the spreading of neoplasms, with consequent impact upon surgical decision making.
