Radiology in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A retrospective study. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is attempted in all our patients scheduled for cholecystectomy. The related standard radiologic procedures are preoperative ultrasonography (US) and preoperative cholangiography (PCA). In a retrospective study of 214 patients scheduled for LC over a 2-year period we have reviewed the radiologic and clinical records. Preoperative US revealed stones in the common bile duct (CBD) in 8 patients, all treated with endoscopic papillotomy before or after operation. PCA was successful in 176 patients (82%) and gave crucial information in 22 patients including 8 with stones in the CBD not preoperatively diagnosed, 6 with anomalous anatomy, and 8 with malpositioned surgical clip on the cystic duct. In 26 patients LC was converted into open surgery, but in only one case due to CBD stone revealed at PCA. Seventeen patients had minor postoperative complications, all managed conservatively. We consider preoperative US and PCA appropriate radiologic investigations in conjunction with LC.
