Bile duct cysts: presentation in adults. Bile duct or choledochal cysts are rare congenital anomalies and presentation in adult is infrequent. Seven cases of type I/IV bile duct cysts presenting in adult life have been treated by the authors during the past 2 years. The diagnosis was made using a combination of ultrasound and cholangiography (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography/percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography). All cases underwent total cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. There were no operative complications and all patients were asymptomatic in the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 to 23 months.
