Single-stage resection of at least 6 liver segments in cases of liver tumors. Seven partial liver resections of at least six hepatic segments (five extended left hepatectomies, also called left trisegmentectomies, and two subtotal hepatectomies) were performed for tumor (of malignant nature in 6 cases). Six of seven patients were admitted for liver transplantation and one for liver resection. These procedures were performed under total vascular exclusion of the liver in six cases (with a veno-venous bypass in two cases) and with the Pringle maneuver in one case. Postoperative liver function was satisfactory in six cases whereas one patient died of hepatic failure on the tenth postoperative day. There was one bile duct stricture at eight months, after extended left hepatectomy. Four patients survived more than one year, three with hepatic tumor recurrence and one with distant metastases. Two patients were still alive, one after fourteen months with tumor recurrence in the liver, the other after seventeen months. In selected cases, partial hepatic resection of more than six segments can be performed for very large tumors. In cases of malignant tumors, a short period of survival with good quality of life can be offered to these patients.
