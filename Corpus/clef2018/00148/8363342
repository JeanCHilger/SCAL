Multifocal mucus secreting papillary adenocarcinoma of the bile duct causing obstructive jaundice. We present a 64-year-old Malay lady who had undergone a choledochoduodenostomy (CDD) two years ago for obstructive jaundice. She was admitted with jaundice and underwent ultrasonography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) and computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the liver and biliary tree. All the investigations confirmed a type IVa choledochal cyst. At operation, the grossly dilated biliary system was packed with a thick mucoid material and the mucosa of the bile ducts was visibly abnormal with scattered nodules. This mucoid material had caused occlusion of the entire biliary tree resulting in obstructive jaundice. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first report of obstructive jaundice caused by thick mucus. The peculiar management problems of this case and the risk of malignant change in choledochal cysts are discussed.
