Diagnosis of cholelithiasis--endoscopic pancreatocholangiography. Endoscopic cholangiography is fundamentally evaluated as X-ray anatomy of the biliary system as well as the principal technique for endoscopic treatments that is endoscopic papillotomy and endoscopic drainage, while gallstone is routinely diagnosed by ultrasonography in medical practice. By endoscopic cholangiography, stones in the cystic duct and the common bile duct are confirmedly diagnosed in the same quality as gallbladder stones, and the anatomical information of the cystic duct, the gallbladder, and the duodenal papilla are clearly demonstrated, which are required in many therapeutic procedures for gallstones diseases including laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
