Surgical management and radiological characteristics of bronchogenic cysts. Forty-two patients with bronchogenic cysts were treated over a 30-year period (1962 to 1991). The location was mediastinal in 37 and intrapulmonary in 5. Cysts were symptomatic in 21 patients (50%) and complications occurred in 11 (26%). The complications included infection in 5 patients, hemorrhage into the cyst in 2 patients, dysphagia due to esophageal compression in 2, adenocarcinoma arising from a bronchogenic cyst in an 8 1/2-year-old girl, and an esophagobronchopleurocutaneous fistula as a result of previous incomplete resection in 1 patient. Magnetic resonance imaging has been found to provide specific diagnostic information about bronchogenic cysts. All but 2 patients were treated with complete excision. One patient was managed by observation and another had drainage of the cyst by mediastinoscopy. Complications of treatment occurred in only 2 patients. One had a minor wound infection and the other had Clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Only 4 patients were lost to follow-up. No late complication or recurrence developed in those patients having complete excision. We recommend complete excision in most instances to confirm the diagnosis, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications.
