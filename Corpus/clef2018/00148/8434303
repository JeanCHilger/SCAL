Anorexia and weight loss as the solitary symptoms of choledocholithiasis. Two patients are described who presented symptoms of anorexia and weight loss. Further investigation revealed choledocholithiasis in both cases, though neither patient had the classic symptoms of biliary colic, jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. The associated weight loss and anorexia resolved completely after successful bile duct surgery. These cases emphasize the need to exclude benign causes of common bile duct obstruction in patients with anorexia, weight loss, and abnormal results of liver function tests, mimicking a possible underlying malignancy.
