Wedge-shaped intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: MRI-pathologic correlation. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, wedge-shaped areas of signal abnormality noted in association with liver lesions have been attributed to secondary phenomena and are said to be substantially larger than the actual tumor. We describe the MRI and pathological appearance of a wedge-shaped cholangiocarcinoma. In cases where therapy might be affected, biopsy of wedge-shaped MRI abnormalities associated with hepatic malignancy should be considered for accurate tumor staging.
