Asymptomatic choledochal cyst. A 45-year-old woman sustained an ankle fracture in an accident. At examination she was found to have marked pallor of skin and mucosae. There was no hint for melaena or haematemesis.Biochemical tests showed marked iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin 7.5 g/dl) and raised serum bilirubin and C-reactive protein levels (1.94 mg/dl and 85.2 mg/l, respectively). Abdominal sonography revealed a cystic space-occupying mass (8 x 4.5 cm) projecting onto the gallbladder, interpreted as a choledochal cyst of unknown origins without bleeding. After treatment of the ankle fracture an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed. This showed a large cyst of the choledochal duct into which the cystic and choledochal ducts entered, without evidence of tumour or haematoma. There was also a 1 cm prepapillary common choledochal and Wirsung duct.With these findings, the diagnosis of a congenital choledochal cyst (type Ia of Todani) could be made. After healing of the ankle fracture the cyst was removed and a Roux Y-anastomosis created. The cystic tissue was benign. At follow-up 6 months later the patient was symptom-free and no longer anaemic.Congenital choledochal cysts are very rare in Europeans. The symptom-free course with anaemia and no manifestation until adulthood is also very unusual.
