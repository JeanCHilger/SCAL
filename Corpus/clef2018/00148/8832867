Radiologically identifiable intratumoral portal vein in intrahepatic cholangiomas: a diagnostic pitfall. Although intratumoral patent portal vein (ITPV) is one of the characteristic features of benign hepatic lesions, ITPVs can be demonstrated in malignant tumors. We present the spectrum of MR and CT findings of ITPV identified in intrahepatic cholangiomas with pathological correlations.The ultrasound, CT and/or MRI findings of pathologically-confirmed intrahepatic cholangiomas were reviewed and correlated with surgical specimen or autopsy findings.Intratumoral patent vessels were radiographically-demonstrated in 5 patients with intrahepatic cholangiomas. All intratumoral vessels were secondary or tertiary order portal vein branches. Some wall thickening was identified on pathological examinations.The radiological demonstration of intratumoral portal vein is not a specific sign of benignity. In the case of a hepatic tumor with a patent portal tract, cholangioma should be considered, as well as benign tumors or lymphoma.
