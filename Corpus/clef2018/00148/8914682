A case of traumatic neuroma of the gallbladder in the absence of previous surgery and cholelithiasis. We experienced a patient with traumatic neuroma of the gallbladder with no history of gallbladder surgery or cholelithiasis. A 74-year-old man was referred to our department after a gallbladder tumor was incidentally discovered during a preoperative screening examination for prostate hypertrophy. Ultrasonography, MRI, CT and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a protuberant lesion of the gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted but adhesion between the liver and duodenum forced us to convert to open laparotomy. Cholecystectomy and adjacent liver tissue resection was performed. Diagnosis was made by frozen histology during operation. It revealed no malignancy. Postoperative pathological examination revealed traumatic neuroma associated with inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of gallbladder neuroma without a history of gallstones or surgery in the English and Japanese literature since 1980. This traumatic neuroma should be considered in a differential diagnosis in treating gallbladder neoplasm, even in the absence of an operative history or cholelithiasis.
