Recurrent gallbladder carcinoma at laparoscopy port sites diagnosed by positron emission tomography: implications for primary and radical second operations. Inapparent gallbladder carcinoma discovered by histologic examination following 1 per cent of cholecystectomies generates a difficult clinical problem. There is evidence that radical resection can prolong survival, especially for locally advanced (> or = PT2, according to the Union International Centre Cancer pathologic T classification) lesions. Case reports of recurrence at port sites after laparoscopic cholecystectomy add another aspect to the management difficulty. A 64-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic. Histologic evaluation revealed an incidental adenocarcinoma, stage pT3. Radical resection with curative intent occurred 11 days later, including mesohepatectomy, skeletonization resection of the common bile duct with en bloc lymph node dissection, and bilateral Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomies. There was no tumor identified in the re-excision specimen (T3N0M0). At 7-month follow-up, the patient presented with nodules in the right subcostal area and in the periumbilical incision. Positron emission tomography demonstrated carcinoma at both sites. Biopsy confirmed metastatic gallbladder carcinoma. This case emphasizes the significance of tumor seeding at port sites during laparoscopy. An open technique is indicated if carcinoma is suspected. To avoid dissemination of unsuspected carcinoma during routine laparoscopic procedures, isolation techniques must be applied. The benefit of radical resection was clearly thwarted in this case, and resection of port sites at the time of reoperation is warranted. Finally, positron emission tomography scan is useful in delineating the recurrence of gallbladder carcinoma and its extent.
