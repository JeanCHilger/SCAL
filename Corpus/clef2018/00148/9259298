A review of open biopsy for mediastinal masses. To review the recent experience with biopsied mediastinal lesions in children and to assess the impact of recent advances in imaging and surgical techniques on diagnosis.The clinical and radiological features of 55 patients who had mediastinal biopsies at The Royal Alexandra Hospital For Children (RAHC) over 15 years were reviewed.Fifty-five patients presented to RAHC between 1978 and 1993 with lesions of the mediastinum requiring biopsy of that site. Thirty-one of the 55 (56%) lesions were malignant. Neurogenic tumours were the most common (40%). In order of frequency the following lesions were found: neuroblastoma (15), teratoma (eight), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL eight), enteric cyst/duplication (five), ganglioneuroma (five), bronchogenic cyst (three), ganglioneuroblastoma (two), lymphangioma (two), abscess (two), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HLThe clinical presentation of mediastinal masses is often non-specific or incidental. Despite recent advances in imaging technology and biopsy techniques, full histological examination is required to exclude malignancy.
