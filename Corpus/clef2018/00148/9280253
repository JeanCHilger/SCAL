Duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma: CT, MR imaging, and US findings. To determine the imaging features of duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma that can be used to differentiate this mass from other lesions.Imaging, histopathologic, and surgical findings in five patients with proved gangliocytic paraganglioma were reviewed. The most common symptom at presentation was abdominal pain (n = 3). All patients underwent computed tomography (CT), two underwent ultrasonography (US), and one underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Imaging findings were correlated with findings from surgical resection specimens in all cases.All lesions were located around the second portion of the duodenum and were 3-13 cm in diameter (mean, 6.5 cm). Two extended laterally to the duodenum, two extended medially, and one was intraluminal. All appeared solid and homogeneous on US, CT, and MR images and had homogeneous contrast material enhancement on CT and MR images. All were solid, with a prominent vascular network, but no cystic hemorrhage or necrosis was noted at pathologic examination.The imaging features of gangliocytic paraganglioma are suggestive enough for the prospective diagnosis and differentiation of this benign mass from other lesions.
