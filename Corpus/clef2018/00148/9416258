Ectopic gallbladder revisited, laparoscopically: a case report. A case of the rare congenital anomaly ectopic gallbladder is presented. A 16-year-old girl suffered attacks of epigastric pain unrelated to eating. On abdominal ultrasonography, the gallbladder could not be found in its usual position. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated the gallbladder on the left side of the common duct and the cystic duct arising from the right hepatic duct. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done without complication. This appears to be the first reported case of laparoscopic removal of an ectopic gallbladder. The importance of preoperative cholangiography is emphasized for accurate diagnosis and preoperative location of the gallbladder.
