Bile duct hamartomas. A report of two cases. Bile duct hamartomas (von Meyenburg's complexes) of the liver are usually detected at laparotomy or autopsy as an incidental finding, and usually they are multiple. We report two cases of proved bile duct hamartomas of the liver. The first was in a 65-year-old man whose initial sepsis and many hepatic lesions were interpreted as microabscess of the liver. The second patient was a 39-year-old man, a hepatitis B surface antigen carrier, in whom an incidental hepatic tumor was found. We suggest that liver biopsy be done in hepatic lesions with uncertain clinical features, because the histologic findings may change the treatment plan.
