Removal of enterogenous cyst of the cervical spine through anterior approach. Enterogenous cyst is a cause of spinal cord compression. The cyst has been treated surgically through a posterior approach in spite of the location ventral to the spinal cord. We saw two patients who had recurrence at 1 and 3 years after partial removal through this approach. We removed the cyst at the level of the cervical spine in four patients totally or subtotally through an anterior approach. All patients improved neurologically, and there were no signs or symptoms of recurrence at follow-up of from 2 to 13 years (average, 7 years 3 months). It is reasonable to approach the cyst located ventrally to the spinal cord through the anterior route, where the relationship between the cyst wall and the spinal cord can be viewed directly.
