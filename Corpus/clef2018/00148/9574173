Ultra-rapid magnetic resonance tomography: a quantum leap in preoperative hepatobiliary diagnosis?. The recent improvements in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using the new ultrafast echo-planar technique for diagnosis of hepatobiliary lesions are outstanding. Besides the detection and preoperative evaluation of benign and malignant hepatobiliary tumors, angiography and cholangiography can be simultaneously performed using the techniques of MR angiography or MR cholangiography. Looking ahead, further advantages such as three-dimensional image reconstruction, no X-ray exposure, and short examination time, this MR technique will become the preferred diagnostic procedure for evaluating hepatobiliary lesions.
