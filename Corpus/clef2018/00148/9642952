Diagnosis and treatment of liver echinococcosis complicated by cysto-biliary fistula. 890 patients with echinococcosis of the liver were operated during 1976-1992. Complicated forms of the disease were li detected in 222 (24.9%) patients, among them 141 (15.8%) patients with cysto-biliary fistulas. Ultrasonography examination and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were regarded as the most informative methods of preoperative diagnosis of cysto-biliary fistulas. Three-stage management was worked out. The usage of laser, plasmatic scalpel and ultrasound of low frequency substantially contributed to improvement of the results of treatment of these patients.
