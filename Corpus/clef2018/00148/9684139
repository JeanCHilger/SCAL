Mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma treated by extended left hepatic lobectomy with resection of the right hepatic vein and preservation of the inferior right hepatic vein after hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. We herein describe a patient with a giant mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (MHC) surrounding the inferior vena cava (IVC). The patient was treated by extended left hepatic lobectomy with resection of the main right, left and middle hepatic veins and preservation of the inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV) after hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy. The patient died of distant metastases 4 years after initial HAI chemotherapy. As there is no hope of cure with HAI alone in the patients with MHC, this operative procedure even after HAI is recommended for patients with reduced liver function, tumor involving the RHV and surrounding the IVC.
