Case report: successful obliteration of a bleeding duodenal varix using endoscopic ligation. The occurrence of duodenal varices is rare and experience in the control of haemorrhage from duodenal varices is limited. A 69-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is reported. Emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy indicated one varix 1.5 cm in diameter with white nipple sign at the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb. Endosonography confirmed the diagnosis of duodenal varix. The patient was treated with endoscopic ligation and follow-up endoscopy showed complete eradication of duodenal varix 3 weeks later.
