Ultrasonographically guided percutaneous biopsy of gastric, small bowel, and colonic abnormalities: efficacy and safety. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of sonographically guided percutaneous biopsy of gastric and bowel lesions and to document any associated complications. A retrospective review of all patients undergoing ultrasonographically guided biopsy of gastric, small bowel, or colonic lesions was performed. Cases were evaluated for size of lesion, location, efficacy in obtaining a diagnostic specimen, and any procedure-related complications. A total of 46 biopsies were performed in 44 patients over a 6 year period. Fifteen gastric, four duodenal, seven small bowel, 16 right colonic, and two left colonic lesions were identified. Histologic diagnosis included 20 adenocarcinomas, seven lymphomas, 10 mesenchymal tumors, and two cases of candidal enteritis. In 18 (41%) patients the initial fine-needle aspirate was negative, although 10 of these patients subsequently underwent ultrasonographically guided core biopsy with a diagnosis of neoplasm established in all 10. Two patients with an initial negative result on fine-needle aspiration underwent repeat aspiration, demonstrating malignancy. Two additional false-negative aspirates were obtained these patients did not undergo repeat biopsy but were subsequently found to have lymphoma. Two of the patients with aspirates that were negative for malignancy were believed to have inflammatory changes secondary to pancreatitis. One patient was lost to follow-up evaluation. No complications were recorded. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of gastric and bowel lesions is a simple and safe procedure and may be particularly useful with poor candidates for endoscopy or for lesions that are difficult or impossible to reach endoscopically. Diagnostic yield is high, particularly in documenting malignancy, although in suspected stromal tumors a core biopsy often is required.
