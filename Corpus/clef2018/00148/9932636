Giant hepatic biloma following transcatheter oily chemoembolization in a patient with hepatic metastases from malignant pheochromocytoma. A 48-year-old woman developed hepatic metastases from malignant pheochromocytoma resected 8 years previously. Angiography revealed multiple tumor stains in the liver. Transcatheter oily chemoembolization using styrenomaleic acid neocarzinostatin and iodized oil was performed. The patient complained of severe right upper quadrant pain immediately following the transcatheter oily chemoembolization. Necrotizing cholecystitis developed on the 4th day post-transcatheter oily chemoembolization, hepatic infarction on the 12th day, and a biloma on the 19th day. Despite the administration of antibiotics and percutaneous transhepatic drainage, neither the volume of drainage nor the size of the biloma decreased. Biliary reconstruction was performed using a metallic stent, which decreased the size of the biloma.
