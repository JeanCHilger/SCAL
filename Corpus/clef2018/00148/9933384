3D MR gastrography: exoscopic and endoscopic analysis of the stomach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of MR gastrography, based on 3D MRI following the oral administration of Gd-DOTA-enriched blueberry juice, in order to depict alterations of the gastric wall. The stomachs of three volunteers and three patients were examined on a 1.5-T MR system. Following ingestion of 400 ml of blueberry juice spiked with 2 ml of Gd-DOTA, each subject underwent 3D MR imaging in three positions: 45 degrees left lateral decubitus, supine, and 45 degrees right lateral decubitus. In each position, a coronal 3D SPGR acquisition consisting of 60 continuous 2-mm slices was acquired over a 35-s breathhold (TR/TE = 4.0/1.8 ms, 40 degrees flip angle, 0.5 excitations, voxel size of 1.25 x 1.66 x 2.00 mm). Multiplanar reformats (MPR), maximum intensity projections (MIP), surface shaded displays (SSD), and virtual intraluminal endoscopic views (VIE) were calculated. Magnetic resonance gastroscopy was tolerated well by all subjects without adverse effects. Based on the 3D MRI data sets acquired in various patient positions, all regions of the stomach and the proximal duodenum were visualized to good advantage. Whereas MPR and MIP provided a morphologic overview, SSD and VIE images permitted analysis of the gastric mucosa. Normal mucosa could be differentiated from the course and irregular pattern characterizing carcinomatous infiltration. The 3D SPGR data sets acquired following ingestion of oral Gd-DOTA-spiked blueberry juice permits exoscopic and virtual endoscopic viewing of the stomach.
