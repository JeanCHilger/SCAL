Humanitarian assistance in UN operations: laboratory and consultative support of a local hospital in Eritrea. The United Nations Mission to Eritrea and Ethiopia deployed to monitor a cease-fire in a mutually agreed upon Temporary Security Zone. Support for the United Nations (UN) troops included a Field Dressing Station supplied by the Dutch Navy, augmented by Canadian personnel. As with most missions of this type, the health of the deployed Canadian and Dutch soldiers is such that there is time to provide some medical support to local civilian institutions. This article describes this interaction in Eritrea through the illustration of the diagnosis and management of a specific illness through the cooperative use of high-technology laboratory equipment coupled with what we believe to be common sense. Although there was no specific United Nations Mission to Eritrea and Ethiopia humanitarian medical assistance mandate, the expanded use of CIMIC# projects was employed to allow this activity. The guiding principle of sustainability once UN facilities leave is also illustrated in the approach taken to provide this assistance.
