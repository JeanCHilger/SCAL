Extraluminal hyperechogenic echo detected by transvaginal ultrasonography as a prognostic factor in recurrent hydatidiform mole. Measuring beta hCG titers by either bioassay or radioimmunoassay has become the cornerstone in the management and treatment of hydatidiform mole. It is this very determination which will indicate either spontaneous remission or the need for chemotherapy treatment due to rising or plateauing titers. Herein, we report on the potential assistance of a unique ultrasonographic appearance of a hyperechogenic shadow located in the uterine wall, before and after an attempt for full evacuation of hydatidiform mole. The behavior of this echogenic area was more sensitive in predicting the course of the disease than did the beta hCG titers. Thus, using transvaginal sonography may serve as another predictor and indicator in evaluating the treatment of hydatidiform mole.
