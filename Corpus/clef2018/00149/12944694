Torsion of para-ovarian cyst: a cause of acute abdomen. Torsion of uterine adnexa is an important cause of acute abdominal pain. Torsion of ovarian masses is quite common and isolated torsion of fallopian tube has also been reported in literature. However, torsion of para ovarian cyst is a very rare. We report a rare case of twisted para ovarian cyst resulting in secondary torsion of the fallopian tube. Torsion of fallopian tube and para ovarian cyst are usually seen in the reproductive age group. Physicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for this uncommon and often difficult to diagnose cause of abdominal pain.
