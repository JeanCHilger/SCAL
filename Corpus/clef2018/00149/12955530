The office hysteroscopic evaluation of postmenopausal patients. The objective was to characterize postmenopausal women with endometrial polyps and to evaluate their significance.The study population included all consecutive postmenopausal patients with a diagnosis of endometrial polyps. Demographic, medical and gynecological data were assessed with regard to the endometrial histologic findings.Of the 181 eligible patients, 34 had endometrial hyperplasia (4 cases of them had endometrial carcinoma). The 144 patients using hormone replacement therapy had significantly higher rate of endometrial hyperplasia than non-hormone users (p<0.006). No differences were observed among the endometrial histological categories for any of the presenting symptoms and signs, ultrasonographic findings, or medical histories.Postmenopausal endometrial polyps is a common, mostly benign entity. However, the relatively high rate of concomitant endometrial hyperplasia, especially in patients receiving hormone replacement therapy, dictates a thorough histological evaluation in all cases.
