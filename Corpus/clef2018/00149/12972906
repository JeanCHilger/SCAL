A case of retention of urine and haematocolpometra. A 13-year-old local girl presented to the emergency department with a 12-h history of lower abdominal pain and inability to pass urine. Examination showed that she was in urinary retention and an imperforate hymen was found. Further investigation showed haematocolpos and haematometra. This is a rare cause of the retention of urine and the emergency physician should consider this condition in women between the ages of 12 and 18 years presenting with abdominal pain and obscure urinary complaints.
