Asymptomatic uterine rupture after two spontaneous vaginal deliveries following prior cesarean section. We present the case of an almost asymptomatic uterine rupture after two consecutive vaginal deliveries after a prior cesarean delivery (first child). Uterine rupture is rare even after a prior cesarean delivery, permitting a trial of labor after a cesarean delivery in spite of the increased risk of uterine rupture. Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery, however, demands a cautious approach. Appropriate recommendations have been published by the ACOG and the 'AG fOr fetomaternale Medizin' (a branch of the German Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology). In our case diagnosis was made by an vaginal ultrasound examination 7.5 weeks after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery. An additional MRI examination did not result in substantial extra information. For that reason it will be indicated only in exceptional cases. To answer the question whether a vaginal ultrasound examination should routinely be offered after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with a prior cesarean delivery in the history to preclude uterine rupture further studies are necessary.
