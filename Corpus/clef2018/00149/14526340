Bilateral hematosalpinx in a case of ectopic pregnancy: a clinical dilemma. A 31-year-old woman with a positive pregnancy test and a transvaginal ultrasound scan result that was suggestive of a right tubal ectopic pregnancy underwent a laparoscopy, which showed bilateral hematosalpinx. In the presence of active bleeding and deteriorating hemodynamic status of the patient, a minilaparotomy was performed that revealed a right-sided hematosalpinx and a left-sided ectopic gestation.
