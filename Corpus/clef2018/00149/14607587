Rapid reaccumulation of hydrometra after drainage at embryo transfer in patients with hydrosalpinx. To report the occurrence and management of hydrometra at the time of scheduled embryo transfer in two patients who underwent drainage of hydrosalpinges at oocyte retrieval.Case report. University IVF clinic.Two patients with hydrosalpinges visible on ultrasonography who deferred tubal surgery. Although no fluid was seen at the time of oocyte retrieval, hydrometra was noticed and drained before planned embryo transfer (ET).Reoccurrence of hydrometra after drainage.Rapid reaccumulation of hydrometra despite drainage was seen in both patients, one of whom had reoccurrence in 1 hour. Embryo transfer was deferred until after tubal surgery, and all embryos were cryopreserved.In patients with hydrosalpinges, ultrasonography before ET is useful to detect newly developed hydrometra. Aspiration of the uterine fluid is unlikely to help because of rapid reaccumulation of hydrometra. Cryopreservation of the embryos for future transfer after the hydrosalpinx is removed or ligated is recommended.
