Stromal testis tumors in infants. a report of two cases. Gonadal stroma tumors account for 8% of pediatric testicular tumors and are therefore exceedingly rare. They generally exhibit a benign behavior. We report two consecutive cases of gonadal stroma tumors in infants. A 5-month-old boy presented with a Sertoli cell tumor and a 2-month-old boy with a juvenile granulosa cell tumor without systemic disease. Both were diagnosed incidentally during routine examinations. Organ-sparing surgery and radical orchiectomy, respectively, was the therapy of choice. Although neonatal testicular tumors are rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a newborn with a scrotal mass.
