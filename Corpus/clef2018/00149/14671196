Elevated serum level of anti-mullerian hormone in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: relationship to the ovarian follicle excess and to the follicular arrest. The serum level of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), a product from granulosa cells involved in follicle growth, has been shown to correlate tightly with the small antral follicle number (FN) at ultrasonography (U/S) in women who do not have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Because PCOS is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in growing FN, we investigated whether an increased AMH serum level correlates to other hormonal and/or U/S features of PCOS. Serum AMH has been assayed in 104 women (59 symptomatic PCOS, 45 controls) between d 2 and 7 after the last either spontaneous or progestin-induced (in PCOS) menstrual period. Mean serum AMH level was markedly increased in the PCOS group (47.1 +/- 22.9 vs. 20.8 +/- 11.6 pmol/liter in controls P < 0.0001), an increase in the same order of magnitude as the one of the FN in the 2- to 5-mm range at U/S (12.8 +/- 8.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.9
