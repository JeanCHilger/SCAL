Current trends in chest wall malignant tumor. Surgery used to treat chest wall sarcomas requires preoperative evaluation in order to document their margins, and to reveal any nodules of recurrence. Because of its considerable sensitivity and specificity ultrasound was associated with routine imaging techniques. The results obtained are useful in defining superficial and lateral tumor margins, but particularly in determining micro-nodules of recurrence which would otherwise go unrecognized. Based on the data obtained using routine methods of diagnosis and ultrasound, we submitted patients to excision that each and every time proved to be wide on histological examination. A particular surgical method was used for reconstruction, involving a polypropylene mesh fixed to one or two mouldable plates. This method exploits the elasticity of polypropylene, which is indispensable for the correct respiratory dynamics of the rib cage, thus avoiding paradoxical or harmful movement. Oncological and functional results were satisfactory.
