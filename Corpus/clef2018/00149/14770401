Transvaginal ultrasound detection of multifollicular ovaries in non-hirsute ovulatory women. To characterize ovarian morphology in a group of ovulatory, non-hirsute women with infertility and normal circulating levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids.Thirty-three women with normal physical examinations, regular ovulatory menses, and absence of hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score < or = 7) were studied. No woman had thyroid disease, galactorrhea, polycystic ovary syndrome, 21-hydroxylase deficiency or diabetes. Two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal sonography (TVS) was used to measure follicle size and ovarian volume on menstrual cycle day 5. Three-dimensional (3D) TVS images were stored to determine the number of follicles (measuring 2-10 mm in diameter) in the largest sonographic plane. Fasting blood sampling and oral glucose tolerance testing were performed to assess serum gonadotropin and sex steroid levels as well as glucose tolerance.The median ovarian volume by 2D-TVS imaging was 7.2 (range, 2.3-15.8) cm(3) (n = 64 ovaries). No follicles were > 10 mm in diameter. The median number of follicles by 3D-TVS was 4 (range, 2-8) (n = 63 ovaries) in the largest sonographic plane. Fourteen of 63 ovaries (22%) had six or more small follicles in one plane distributed within normal stroma (multifollicular ovary, MFO). No ovary had 10 or more follicles in one plane located within abundant stroma (polycystic ovary). Of 33 women examined, 20 women (61%) had apparently normal ovaries bilaterally, while 13 (39%) had at least one MFO. There were no significant differences between women with and those without MFO in serum gonadotropin and steroid levels or glucose tolerance.MFO is a common morphological variant in non-hirsute ovulatory women with normal gonadotropin secretion and ovarian steroidogenesis.
