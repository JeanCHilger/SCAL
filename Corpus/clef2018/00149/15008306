Reduced liquor drainage at delivery: an unusual presentation of uterine rupture. A 27-year old unbooked G(5)P(3) + 1 woman with a history of previous caesarean section is reported. She had an apparent normal vaginal delivery at term with very scanty liquor drainage. She then developed severe persistent abdominal pain with stable vital signs. A laparotomy confirmed a ruptured uterus. We therefore conclude that any woman with a scarred uterus presenting with very scanty liquor drainage at delivery, if she develops persistent abdominal pain, should raise a suspicion of uterine rupture.
