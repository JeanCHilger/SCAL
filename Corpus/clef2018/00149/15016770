Endometrial and subendometrial blood flow measured during early luteal phase by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound in excessive ovarian responders. Impaired implantation in assisted reproduction cycles with high serum estradiol (E(2)) concentrations may be related to suboptimal endometrial perfusion. Endometrial and subendometrial blood flow were compared between excessive responders (serum E(2) on the day of HCG >20 000 pmol/l) and moderate responders (E(2) < or =20 000 pmol/l).Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound examination with power Doppler was performed 2, 4 and 7 days after HCG in 32 patients who did not have embryo transfer in order to measure endometrial thickness, pulsatility index (PI)/resistance index (RI) of uterine vessels, and endometrial volume, vascularization index (VI)/flow index (FI)/vascularization flow index (VFI) of endometrial and subendometrial regions.Excessive responders tended to have lower endometrial and subendometrial VI/VFI on HCG +2 and more absent endometrial/subendometrial blood flow. They had significantly higher endometrial FI and subendometrial VFI than moderate responders on HCG +7. Only in the excessive responder group, uterine PI/RI declined significantly from HCG +2 to HCG +7 and endometrial VI/VFI increased significantly from HCG +4 to HCG +7.Changes in uterine Doppler flow indices, and endometrial and subendometrial 3D power Doppler flow indices during the early luteal phase were significantly different between moderate and excessive responders.
