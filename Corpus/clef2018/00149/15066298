Interfractional variation in position of the uterus during radical radiotherapy for cervical cancer. This study was conducted to investigate the positional change of the uterus during radiotherapy which can degrade the accuracy of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Sixty-six patients received radical radiotherapy for cervical cancer in Samsung Medical Center. For each patient, two MRI scans were taken one was before beginning radiotherapy and the other was in the third or fourth week of radiotherapy. In T2-weighted MRI images, the positional change of the uterus was quantified by measuring six parametersMean value of change in Dcx+Dco of tumor size during treatment was 8.0 mm in small tumors and 17.9 mm in large tumors. Among 44 anteflexed uterus patients, 5 changed into a retroflexed position. 12 patients (18%) had a greater than 30 degrees variation in any angle. For patients under 60 years, the difference in Acx was statistically significant.Positional changes of the uterus during radiotherapy should be considered in the treatment planning of 3DCRT or IMRT, particularly in patients under 60 years or those with tumor size greater than 4 cm in diameter.
