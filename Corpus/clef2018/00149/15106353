Obstetrics and gynecology. Three-dimensional(3D) ultrasound is getting popular rapidly in obstetrics and gynecology, especially for fetal diagnosis. Three-dimensional ultrasound provide with not only various kinds of 3D images but also any arbitrary sections that cannot be obtained by conventional two-dimensional ultrasound. Fetal biometry can be performed easily and accurately on a 3-orthogonal-plane image by 3D ultrasound. Morphological abnormalities of the fetus and their severities, especially on the face, ears, extremities and skeleton, can be depicted clearly by 3D images. Realistic surface images of a normal fetus may work well on the parents-fetus bonding. Congenital uterine abnormalities are depicted easily and clearly on coronal sections of the uterus by transvaginal 3D ultrasound.
