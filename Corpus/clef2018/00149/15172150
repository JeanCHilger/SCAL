Computer tomography-assisted three-dimensional technique to assess rectal and bladder wall dose in intracavitary brachytherapy for uterine cervical cancer. We used a computer tomography (CT)-assisted three-dimensional (3D) technique to assess dose to the rectum and bladder in intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) for patients with cervical cancer, and compared this technique with the conventional method. The results revealed that the difference in dose to the rectal and bladder wall between these two methods were significant. The CT-assisted technique is a feasible method, and it gives different results than the conventional method.
