Management of nonpalpable testicular tumors. To report our series of nonpalpable testicular tumors with a review of published studies. Radical orchiectomy remains the reference standard in the treatment of a solid testicular mass. Testis-sparing surgery has recently been advocated for a select group of patients with nonpalpable tumors.Between 1998 and 2002, a nonpalpable testicular mass was discovered in 9 patients. Ultrasonography was performed for infertility evaluation (5 patients), testicular pain (3 patients), and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (1 patient).Radical orchiectomy was performed in 7 of 9 patients and testis-sparing surgery with microsurgical excision of tumor in 1 patient. One patient decided against surgery. A benign testicular tumor was found in 6 and a malignant tumor in 2 of the 8 patients.A high incidence of benign nonpalpable tumor and an advanced microsurgical technique justifies organ-sparing surgery as an alternative for radical orchiectomy in a select group of patients. Testicular preservation in patients with a malignant nonpalpable testicular tumor is a feasible, but still controversial, approach.
