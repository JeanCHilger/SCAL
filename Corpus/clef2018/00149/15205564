MR and ultrasound imaging of floating globules in mature ovarian cystic teratoma. A rarely reported case of cystic teratoma with floating globules or fat balls is presented. Comparative imaging investigations of the floating globules in an ovarian cystic teratoma were performed using magnetic resonance and two- and three-dimensional ultrasound. Ultrasound imaging easily detected the floating globules, especially the 3-dimensional features showed almost the same findings that were observed macroscopically after surgery. Magnetic resonance thus clearly revealed the character of floating globules.
