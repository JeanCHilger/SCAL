Clinical usefulness of endometrial screening by ultrasound in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of routine use of endometrial ultrasound in asymptomatic, bleeding-free postmenopausal women.We retrospectively reviewed the data of 850 postmenopausal women subjected to hysteroscopy, focusing our attention on those cases (148) with an ultrasound indication of endometrial thickening.In 850 postmenopausal women, we identified 27 (3.2%) endometrial adenocarcinomas. In these subjects, the indication for office hysteroscopy was abnormal uterine bleeding in 24 (24/27 88.9%) casesOur findings show that the use of tvUS as a screening tool for endometrial pathology in asymptomatic postmenopausal women generates 93.2% false positive results, so that most of these women undergo this second level invasive procedure uselessly. Our data suggest that, in asymptomatic postmenopausal women, endometrial ultrasound evaluation is not worthwhile as a screening tool, such as it is considered in common clinical practice. The present results call for a larger prospective trial to further elucidate this controversial issue.
