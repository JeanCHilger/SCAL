Urethral polyp verumontanum. Congenital posterior urethral polyps are rare benign lesions that can cause a variety of symptoms in young boys, the diagnosis is usually made by cystourethrogram and ultrasonography where the polyp appears as a soft tissue mass arising at the base of the urinary bladder. We present a case of verumontanum polyp in a 7-year-old boy who presented to us in October 2001 with terminal hematuria, dysuria, interrupted stream and suprapubic pain. The polyp was diagnosed by ultrasonography and cystourethrogram. Transurethral resection of the polyp was performed and pathological assessment revealed a fibroepithelial lesion which is consistent with congenital posterior urethral polyp. After 18 months follow up, the patient was free of symptoms. We reviewed the literature to identify the presentation, diagnosis, treatment options and prognosis of these polyps. In the past 20 years the posterior urethral polyp has become more common than before, and it should be considered in boys with lower urinary tract dysfunction and hematuria.
