Hystero-salpingo-contrast-sonography with 3-d-ultrasound -- a pilot study. Hystero-salpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) is a sensitive method of assessing tubal patency but cannot completely substitute diagnostic laparoscopy with blue dye and hysteroscopy. Three-dimensional sonography has new imaging facilities which could lead to a reduction of invasive diagnostic procedures.The aim of this pilot study was to analyse the feasibility of HyCoSy by 3D- and 3D-Doppler-sonography.In a prospective setting conventional (2D) HyCoSy was performed in 21 patients with an ultrasound device designed for 3D-ultrasound. After the completion of the 2D procedure, 3D-ultrasound was carried out. In five patients an additional 3D-Doppler-HyCoSy was performed. The generated 3D-volumina were then examined. Laparoscopy with blue dye was performed immediately after the ultrasound examination.A total of 42 Fallopian tubes was assessed. On 2D-ultrasound, visibility of the tubes was excellent in 28 and limited in seven tubes. Of the seven tubes not visible on 2D-ultrasound, four were not patent on laparoscopy. On 3D-ultrasound, visibility of the tubes was excellent in 15 and limited in twelve tubes. 15 tubes were not visible on 3D-ultrasound. 3D-Doppler-HyCoSy revealed excellent assessment in eight of ten tubes, even in one of those with limited visibility on 2D- and 3D-HyCoSy. In 19 patients the assessment of the uterine cavity was excellent by 2D- and 3D-HyCoSy, whereas it was limited in two patients.It is possible to visualise the full length of the tubes in a very detailed way from the uterine cavity to the fimbrial end in some patients, but the diagnostic power of HyCoSy is not improved by adding 3D-imaging. The accuracy of 3D-ultrasound seemed to be improved by 3D-Doppler-ultrasound.
