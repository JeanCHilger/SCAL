Differential diagnosis of Poland-syndrome versus unilateral accentuated thelarche. The syndrome was first described by Poland in 1841. It classically consists of unilateral muscular and osseous anomalies of the thorax and upper limb with defects of the ipsilateral breast and nipple. We report the value of panoramic-sonography in the diagnosis of this rare condition in three patients.The three girls, all born in 1990, were independently introduced to our unit of children and adolescent gynaecology because of unilateral "developmental defects" of the breasts at the beginning of puberty. To discriminate a Poland-Syndrome from unilateral accentuation of thelarche standardized clinical and sonographical examinations were performed.In 2 cases we found unilateral aplasia of the glandular tissue of the breast with different distinction of mamilla and pectoralis muscle. The 3 (rd) case showed a hypoplastic breast development with osseous defects of the chest wall, aplasia of the pectoralis muscle and brachydaktylia.The standardized panoramic sonography allowed an immediate and safe diagnosis without hazardous radiation exposure.
