Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) of the cervix presenting as a cervical polyp treated with fertility-sparing surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) of the female genital tract is rare in the cervix. It tends to occur in children and young women, and appears to have a better prognosis than sarcoma botryoides of the vagina and uterus.We report a case of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) presenting as a cervical polyp in a 19-year-old female. The tumor was composed of rhabdomyoblasts of varying differentiation dispersed within a loose, myxoid stroma, and formed a distinct 'cambium' layer beneath the epithelium. The patient was successfully treated with fertility-sparing surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.Awareness of this uncommon lesion in this site and its clinical implications is important to avoid misdiagnosis. Therapy has recently inclined towards conservative treatment.
