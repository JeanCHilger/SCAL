Luteal phase defect: myth or reality. Although the diagnosis of luteal phase defect (LPD) has been described convincingly in the research setting, it remains a controversial clinical entity. Apart from many uncertainties that surround the diagnosis of LPD, there is no convincing evidence that LPD is associated with infertility and recurrent abortion. Once diagnosed, the treatment options are empiric and include those that are recommended for unexplained infertility. The efforts to diagnose LPD in patients who have infertility or recurrent abortion are not justified.
