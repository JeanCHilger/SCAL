Surgical treatment of varicocele in day-surgery: our experience. Varicocele has been recognized as a treatable cause of male infertility. Recently, new techniques have been described for varicocele repair, including microsurgery, embolization and laparoscopy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of a group of patients who underwent subinguinal varicocelectomy using local anaesthesia in Day Surgery, after a careful ultrasonographic study to evaluate the degree and the quality of the reflux in the spermatic vein. The study shows that outpatient subinguinal varicocelectomy is a safe and reliable procedure. This approach is performed in local anaesthesia, has minimal morbidity and recurrences and, in our experience, has led an improvement in the quality of seminal fluid.
