CT virtual endoscopy of the stomach: comparison study with gastric fiberscopy. We evaluated the value of computed tomographic (CT) gastric virtual endoscopy (VE) by comparing it with real gastric fiberscopy (GF).Sixty-six VE findings in 63 patients were compared with lesions found with GF. After a GF examination, the examinees were given bubble-making granules for the stomach and placed in a supine position on the CT table. Abdominal CT slices of 1 mm thickness were obtained by multidetector row CT (Siemens Sensation 16) and reconstructed to VE images with volume and surface rendering on the same day.VE images were successful in showing subtle alterations in the gastric mucosal folds. Gastric cancer, polyps, ulcers, erosions, and gastritis were clearly visualized. Comparison studies between VE and GF (as the gold standard) showed a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 90.9%. Original CT images were also useful in detecting lesions in other abdominal organs such as the liver, adrenal gland, and kidney.Because VE is a good noninvasive screening method, except for minimal radiation exposure, it is expected to become a new technique for stomach examinations.
