An ultrasonographic morphological index for prediction of ovarian tumor malignancy. A newly created ultrasonographic scale called the Poznan index as well as scales already well known (introduced by Sassone, De Priest and Lerner) were compared in our group of patients.A morphological index was based on seven sonographic ovarian tumor features. Examinations on 686 patients were evaluated. Comparison of prognostic values of the Poznan index with other applied morphological indices in our group of patients was based on the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.The cut-off level of the new index is 8 points. The new morphological index has a specificity of 77.0%, and negative and positive predictive values of 90.7% and 69.1%, respectively. It has a sensitivity of 86.7% and accuracy of 80.6%. The Poznan index proved its usefulness and superiority (AU ROC = 0.89).Using this morphological index it is possible to make a precise prognosis of ovarian tumor malignancy. It also makes it possible to make the right decision concerning the manner of surgical treatment.
