Transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic hysteroscopy as a predictor of endometrial polyps: risk factors for premalignancy and malignancy. The aim of this study is to assess accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and diagnostic hysteroscopy in diagnosing endometrial polyps and to determine premalignancy and malignancy rates in asymptomatic women. The study was designed to retrospectively analyze 438 women who underwent operative hysteroscopy in a day-care unit when endometrial polyp was suspected after TVUS and diagnostic hysteroscopy. Multivariate logistic regression modeling showed effects of age, previous breast cancer with tamoxifen treatment, and menopause with or without bleeding on pathologic results. The results indicate that positive predictive value of TVUS with diagnostic hysteroscopy was 79.9%. Premalignancy or malignancy occurred in 3.2% and was significantly related to menopause with abnormal bleeding (P < 0.001), which carried a 20-fold higher risk of pathology than any other group. Age was also a risk factor. It was concluded that TVUS with diagnostic hysteroscopy reliably evaluates endometrial polyps. The low incidence of endometrial tumors in asymptomatic (especially premenopausal) women suggests that their operative evaluation may not be cost effective. Larger studies are needed to support this tentative conclusion.
