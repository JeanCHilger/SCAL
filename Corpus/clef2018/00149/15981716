Colon dissection: a new three-dimensional reconstruction tool for computed tomography colonography. To improve the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) colonography in the detection of polyps by comparing the 3D reconstruction tool "colon dissection" and endoluminal view (virtual colonoscopy) with axial 2D reconstructions.Forty-eight patients (22 M, 26 F, mean age 57 +/- 21) were studied after intra-anal air insufflation in the supine and prone positions using a 16-slice helical CT (16 x 0.625 mm, pitch 1.7 detector rotation time 0.5 sConventional colonoscopy revealed a total of 35 polyps in 15 patients 33 polyps were disclosed by CT methods. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting colon polyps were 94% and 94%, respectively, when using the "colon dissection", 89% and 94% when using "virtual endoscopy", and 62% and 100% when using axial 2D reconstruction. Sensitivity in relation to the diameter of colon polyps with "colon dissection", "virtual colonoscopy", and axial 2D-slices was: polyps with a diameter >5.0 mm, 100%, 100%, and 71%, respectively3D reconstruction software "colon dissection" improves sensitivity of CT colonography compared with the endoluminal view.
