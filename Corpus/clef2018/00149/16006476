Ultrasound-guided trial transfer may be beneficial in preparation for an IVF cycle. The objective of this study is to determine if ultrasound-guided trial transfer (UTT) in the office in preparation for an IVF cycle can be utilized as an alternative and/or adjunct to ultrasound-guided embryo transfer (UGET).Patients planning to undergo an IVF cycle at an academic centre were included. Each patient underwent an UTT in the office by the same practitioner. The difference in length (DL), if any, was measured from the perceived top of the uterine cavity (catheter tip) to the actual cavity apex as visualized by ultrasound.Of the 64 patients enrolled, 19 patients (29.7%) had a measurable DL, of which 14 (21.9%) had a DL exists 0.5 cm, and nine (14.1%) had a DL exists 1.0 cm. Significant differences were noted between patients when comparing DL to previous pregnancy status and the total cavity depth (sounding depth + DL) (P < 0.05).UTT in the office setting appears to be beneficial in preparation for an IVF cycle with embryo transfer.
