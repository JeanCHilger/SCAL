Advances in the early detection of ovarian carcinoma. Because early ovarian cancer is generally an asymptomatic process, the majority of cases are diagnosed at a late stage, when they are incurable. A precursor lesion, while thought by many to exist, has so far not been successfully identified. While CA-125 is a useful test for the follow-up of patients with established ovarian cancer, it has not led to earlier detection when used alone as a marker. Similarly, ultrasound, although a sensitive test, is not sufficiently specific to be utilized for screening. The combination of CA-125 and ultrasound is currently being studied and may ultimately prove to be an effective screening method for postmenopausal and high-risk women. Research is also under way to identify markers that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be utilized in the screening of asymptomatic women the hope is to ultimately develop a panel of markers for early detection.
