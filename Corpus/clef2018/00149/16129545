Transvaginal sonohysterographic evaluation of uterine malformations. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value and the usefulness of sonohysterography (SHG) in the detection of uterine anomalies, compared with other diagnostic methods.From January 2002 to December 2003, we collected 54 patients with a history of primary or secondary infertility or repeated spontaneous abortion and with a clinically or sonographically suspected abnormal uterus. All patients had previously undergone hysterosalpingography (ISG). All patients were examined by standard transvaginal ultrasound. Sonohysterography was then carried out by the intrauterine injection of an isotonic saline solution. Suspected uterine anomalies were also confirmed by hysteroscopy (HS) and/or laparoscopy.Sonohysterography was able to detect all the anomalies. The sensitivity and specificity of sonohysterography were the same as for hysteroscopy. However, there was no significant difference between the diagnostic capabilities of the methods analyzed.Transvaginal sonohysterography with saline solution is a low-cost, easy, and helpful examination method for uterine malformations. We propose that sonohysterography should be performed for the primary investigation of infertility and repeated miscarriages.
