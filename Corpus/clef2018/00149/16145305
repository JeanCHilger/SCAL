Bleeding patterns during continuous estradiol with different sequential progestogens therapy. : To evaluate the effects on monthly bleeding of four different progestogens administered in association with transdermal estradiol in a continuous sequential estrogen-progestin therapy (CS-EPT).: This prospective, open, randomized, clinical trial included 100 healthy postmenopausal women. Patients were randomized into four treatment groups, each consisting of 25 women. Treatment consisted of 50 mug/day transdermal 17beta-estradiol for all women combined to receive four different progestogens (group A: medroxyprogesterone acetate, 10 mg/day group B: nomegestrol acetate, 5 mg/day: A total of 937 cycles could be evaluated. In 690 cycles (73.6%), regular progestogen-related bleeding was reported. Among the other cycles, we observed 73 episodes of amenorrhea (7.8%, each one lasting one cycle), 78 episodes of irregular bleeding (8.3%), and 96 episodes of spotting (10.2%). Patients receiving nomegestrol acetate had a significantly higher incidence of regular progestogen-associated bleeding in comparison with those receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate or natural progesterone, and patients receiving dydrogesterone had a significantly higher incidence of regular progestogen-associated bleeding in comparison with those receiving natural progesterone.: Our data suggest that CS-EPT generally leads to regular withdrawal bleeding in women without uterine pathology. Micronized progesterone seems to induce more irregular bleeding episodes.
