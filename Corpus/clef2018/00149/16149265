Sclerosing stromal tumor of the ovary in a 30-year-old woman. A case report and review of the literature. Sclerosing stromal tumor of the ovary (SST) is an extremely rare neoplasm occurring predominantly in the second and third decades of life. It is a distinct benign neoplasm that differs from fibromas, thecomas, luteinized tumors and lipoid cell tumors. It presents most often with non-specific symptoms. We describe the case of a 30-year-old woman who developed menstrual irregularities and pelvic pain. She was diagnosed and treated operatively at our Department. During surgery, a benign tumor was found in the right ovary. Light microscopic and ultrastructural study confirmed the diagnosis of sclerosing stromal tumor of the ovary.
