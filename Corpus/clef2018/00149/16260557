Splenosis mimicking pelvic mass. Splenosis is a rare complication after splenectomy and generally does not cause clinical symptoms.A 34-year-old woman who had splenectomy in childhood after trauma presented with a pelvic mass. Ultrasound examination demonstrated a right adnexal mass and a myomatous uterus. Exploratory laparotomy revealed multiple splenic implants along the small and large bowel and in the ileocecal region, including the appendix. Total hysterectomy, right salphengectomy, and appendectomy were performed.After splenectomy, splenic implants may mimic benign or malignant tumors of the pelvis and may require surgical exploration.
