MR imaging of the pelvis in characterization of adnexal masses. MRI has proved beneficial in characterizing ovarian masses that are indeterminate by sonographic criteria. MRI can distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tumors with high sensitivity and specificity and is capable of characterizing many adnexal masses. MRI should be therefore included in the preoperative diagnostic of adnexal masses.
