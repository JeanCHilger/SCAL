Optimal block boundary pre/postfiltering for wavelet-based image and video compression. This paper presents a pre/postfiltering framework to reduce the reconstruction errors near block boundaries in wavelet-based image and video compression. Two algorithms are developed to obtain the optimal filter, based on boundary filter bank and polyphase structure, respectively. A low-complexity structure is employed to approximate the optimal solution. Performances of the proposed method in the removal of JPEG 2000 tiling artifact and the jittering artifact of three-dimensional wavelet video coding are reported. Comparisons with other methods demonstrate the advantages of our pre/postfiltering framework.
