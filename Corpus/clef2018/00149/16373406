Factors affecting endometrial and subendometrial blood flow measured by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound during IVF treatment. No information exists in the literature regarding the factors affecting the blood flow towards the endometrial and subendometrial regions during IVF treatment.We examined the effect of women's age, their smoking habits, their type of infertility (i.e. primary or secondary) and parity, causes of infertility and serum estradiol (E2) concentration on endometrial and subendometrial blood flows as measured by a three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasound during IVF treatment. All patients received a standard long protocol of ovarian stimulation and serum E2 concentration was determined on the day of hCG. 3D ultrasound examination with power Doppler was performed on the day of oocyte collection to determine vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) of endometrial and subendometrial regions.The age of women, their smoking habits, their types of infertility and parity and causes of infertility had no effect on the endometrial and subendometrial 3D power Doppler flow indices. There was a negative correlation between serum E(2) concentration and endometrial FI (r = -0.109 P = 0.006).Endometrial blood flow in IVF treatment was negatively affected by serum E2 concentration only.
