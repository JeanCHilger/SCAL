Parenchymal leiomyoma of the breast--clinical, sonographic, mammographic and histological features. Intraparenchymal leiomyomas of the breast are quite rare. Areolar lesions are distinguished from intraparenchymal leiomyomas, which are less frequent. Clinically, leiomyomas appear as nodules mammographically, they show up as round lesions. Reports on sonographic criteria are rare, and the criteria are nonspecific. Based on our case of an intraparenchymal leiomyoma, we describe additional sonographic features. The clinical, mammographic and sonographic characteristics of an intraparenchymal leiomyoma of the breast were evaluated. After surgery, the diagnosis was confirmed histologically.The clinical presentation of our patient with deep-seated leiomyoma of the breast included skin dimpling and a reduction in tissue mobility, differing from more commonly reported characteristics. Mammographically, the lesion was dense and only partly demarcated clearly, corresponding to other reports. On breast ultrasonography, the leiomyoma appeared as a hypodense, well demarcated, inhomogeneous lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing. A central tumour vessel was visible on Doppler imaging, and Cooper's ligaments were discontinuous. Acoustic shadowing, the hypodense character, hyperechoic border and the central tumour vessel are therefore additional ultrasonographic characteristics of an intraparenchymal leiomyoma of the breast. This type of lesion is usually described as isodense to hyperdense and homogeneous, possibly containing semicystic components. Previous reports have only described posterior acoustic enhancement, but not acoustic shadowing.On breast ultrasonography, an intraparenchymal leiomyoma of the breast can present with posterior acoustic shadowing, hypodense echogenicity, a hyperechoic border and a central tumour vessel. Neither imaging studies nor palpation allow distinction between benign and malignant lesions.
