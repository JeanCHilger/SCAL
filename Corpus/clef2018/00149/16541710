Three-dimensional sonoangiography in diagnostic of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. An assessment of vascularization indices and endometrial volume. Three-dimensional sono-angiography was executed in 123 women with uterine bleedings in perimenopausal period. With the use of software for automatic measurement of volume of blocks (VOCAL, Kretztechnik, Austria) vascular indices (VI, Fl, VFI) and endometrial volume (EV) were estimated. Based on histopathological estimation of endometrium the patients were divided into the following groups: atrophic, proliferative, secretive endometrium, hyperplasia and endometrial cancer (EC). Mean EV in women with EC amounted to 16.82 ml and was significantly higher (p < 0.005) than in women with hyperplasia or without pathological changes. Mean values of vascular indices VI, Fl and VFI in the group of women with EC amounted to respectively 5.464 25.995 and 1.898 and were also significantly higher in comparison to remaining groups of patients. The results of the investigation suggest, that three-dimensional measurement of endometrial volume with assessment of vascular indices (VI, Fl, VFI) can be valuable prognostic element improving a diagnostic precision of sonographic estimation of pathological changes of endometrium.
