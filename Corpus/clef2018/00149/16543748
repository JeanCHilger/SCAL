A rare case of rectovaginal endometriosis with lymph node involvement. A rare case of rectovaginal endometriosis with lymph node involvement is described in a 44-year-old patient. The presence of endometrial tissue in pelvic lymph nodes is rare and has been confirmed in the literature in subjects who underwent surgery for endometriosis. Involvement of pelvic lymph nodes by endometriosis seems unlikely to arise de novo and probably suggests lymphatic spread of the disease.
