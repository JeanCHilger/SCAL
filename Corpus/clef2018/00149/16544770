Giant aortic aneurysm and rhabdomyomas in infant with tuberous sclerosis (case report). We present the case of a giant aneurysm and dissection of the abdominal aorta in an eight month old infant. Imaging studies especially a helicoid computerized axial tomography with 3D reconstruction, showed a lesion which extended from the diaphragm to the iliac arteries. The clinical findings and the above mentioned studies revealed non-obstructive heart rhabdomyomas, tubers in the brain and the abdominal aortic aneurysm, all of which were consistent with the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
