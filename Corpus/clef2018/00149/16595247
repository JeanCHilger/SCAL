Endometrial, subendometrial, and ovarian stromal blood flow in patients treated with two different doses of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin. The effects of two different doses of recombinant hCG on blood flow to the uterus and ovary on the day of oocyte retrieval were studied by three-dimensional Doppler ultrasonography in 60 women during IVF treatment. There were no differences in all the indices of endometrial, subendometrial, and ovarian stromal blood flow in women who had received 250 microg or 500 microg of recombinant hCG for final oocyte maturation.
