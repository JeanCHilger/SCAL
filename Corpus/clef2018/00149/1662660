Ovarian fibrothecoma: sonographic and histologic findings. The sonographic and histologic findings observed in 11 cases of ovarian fibrothecoma were compared, and an attempt was made to find a correlation between each histologic type of the tumor (pure thecoma, predominantly fibrous fibrothecoma, mixed fibrothecoma) and its sonographic appearance. The presence of a homogeneous echogenic pattern, with marked posterior acoustic shadowing, in the absence of any calcification, was highly suggestive of a predominantly fibrous ovarian fibrothecoma the presence of a diffusely hypoechoic ovarian mass, with no posterior echo enhancement, was strikingly correlated with pure thecomas
