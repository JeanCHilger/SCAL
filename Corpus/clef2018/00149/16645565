Intravesical migration of intrauterine device resulting in stone formation. The migration into the bladder of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) by uterine perforation is a rare complication. We report two cases of IUCD which migrated into the bladder and subsequently became calcified. The two patients having had their IUCD respectively for 3 and 13 years. Revealing signs were related to bladder irritation for the first patient and hematuria for the second. The diagnosis was suggested on the plain abdominal X-ray and on ultrasound and was confirmed by cystoscopy. Ballistic lithotripsy of the bladder stone with endoscopic extraction of the IUCD was then performed. Performing a transvaginal sonographic examination of the pelvic organs, especially of the uterine anatomy is interesting before insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD), and repeat transvaginal sonographic examinations immediately after the insertion and 4-12 weeks later are advisable. This approach would permit early detection of any complications related to insertion of the IUCD.
