Teaching and evaluating ultrasound skill attainment: competency-based resident ultrasound training for AIUM accreditation. Modern obstetrics and gynecology practice requires the frequent use of ultrasound and ultrasound training as a required component of obstetrics and gynecology residencies. Although programs do offer training in obstetric ultrasound imaging, education in gynecologic imaging is either absent or limited. This article describes a comprehensive ultrasound curriculum for obstetrics and gynecology residents that has been developed and implemented at the University of New Mexico. The curriculum is competency based and qualifies the graduating resident to seek American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine laboratory accreditation.
