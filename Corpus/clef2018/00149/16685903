Panoramic views for virtual endoscopy. This paper describes a panoramic projection designed to increase the surface visibility during virtual endoscopies. The proposed projection renders five faces of a cubic viewing space into the plane in a continuous fashion. Using this real-time and interactive visualization technique as a screening method for colon cancer could lead to significantly shorter evaluation time. It avoids having to fly through the colon in both directions and prevents the occlusion of potential polyps behind haustral folds.
