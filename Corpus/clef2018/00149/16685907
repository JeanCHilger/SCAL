Development of a navigation-based CAD system for colon. We propose a navigation-based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the colon. When diagnosing the colon using virtual colonoscopy (VC), a physician makes a diagnosis by navigating (flying-through) the colon. However, the viewpoints and the viewing directions must be changed many times because the colon is a very long and winding organ with many folds. This is a time-consuming task for physicians. We propose a new navigation-based CAD system for the colon providing virtual unfolded (VU) views, which enables physicians to observe a large area of the colonic wall at a glance. This system generates VU, VC, and CT slice views that are perfectly synchronized. Polyp candidates, which are detected automatically, are overlaid on them. We applied the system to abdominal CT images. The experimental results showed that the system effectively generates VU views for observing colon regions.
