Segmentation and size measurement of polyps in CT colonography. Virtual colonoscopy is a relatively new method for the detection of colonic polyps. Their size, which is measured from reformatted CT images, mainly determines diagnosis. We present an automatic method for measuring the polyp size. The method is based on a robust segmentation method that grows a surface patch over the entire polyp surface starting from a seed. Projection of the patch points along the polyp axis yields a 2D point set to which we fit an ellipse. The long axis of the ellipse denotes the size of the polyp. We evaluate our method by comparing the automated size measurement with those of two radiologists using scans of a colon phantom. We give data for inter-observer and intra-observer variability of radiologists and our method as well as the accuracy and precision.
