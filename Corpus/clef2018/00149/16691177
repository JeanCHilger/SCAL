Imaging of a thickened-wall gallbladder. Thickening of the gallbladder wall may result from a large spectrum of pathological conditions, intrinsic as well as extrinsic to the biliary tract, and may have different appearances. Accurate diagnosis is usually established after a correlation of imaging findings, laboratory data and clinical history. US remains the initial imaging modality for the evaluation of acute right upper quadrant pain. CT and MRI are complementary to US and have an increasing role in assessing a thickened-wall gallbladder.
