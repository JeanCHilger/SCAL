Squamous cell carcinoma originating from the nasal septum: a case report. A 73-year-old male patient presented with a mass that developed in the left nasal cavity and projected out the nasal vestibule. Nasal endoscopy showed a polypoid, hyperemic mass that originated from the caudal end of the septum and almost filled the left nasal passage. Histopathologic diagnosis of the biopsy specimen taken from the lesion was squamous cell carcinoma. Ultrasonography of the neck showed no lymphadenopathy. The mass was excised via a lateral rhinotomy and the defect site was reconstructed with a nasolabial sulcus flap. No postoperative complications or recurrences were encountered during a follow-up of six months.
