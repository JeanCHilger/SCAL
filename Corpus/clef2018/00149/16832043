The human endometrium as a fertility-determining factor. Intensive research work has been performed to better understand the regulation of the endometrium and its clinical implications to improve implantation. Although many proteins and molecules may influence endometrial development, their co-ordinated contribution to the implantation process is still poorly understood and a translation into clinical use has not sufficiently been performed. Clinical evaluation of the endometrium by ultrasound and other techniques, like endometrial biopsy and analysis of uterine secretions, has been intensively studied and therapeutic options to improve endometrial function have been suggested and tested. Systemic treatment with heparin, aspirin or corticosteroids did not result in improved implantation rates. Gene therapy and cervical treatment, e.g. with seminal plasma, are still in the phase of clinical research. Therefore, this review focuses on different aspects of endometrial research, which all contribute to the diagnosis, evaluation and therapy of endometrial function and dysfunction. First, the endometrial development towards a receptive milieu is described. Second, the actual clinical evaluation of endometrial receptivity, possible therapeutic strategies and in particular, the evaluation of endometrial function in the non-natural situation of hormonal stimulation is critically evaluated. In conclusion, the endometrium shall be considered as an important fertility-determining factor and therapeutic options should be developed in near future.
