Ultrasound finding of an echogenic mass in women with secondary postpartum hemorrhage is associated with retained placental tissue. To describe sonographic findings associated with retained placental tissue in patients with secondary postpartum hemorrhage, and to compare these findings with those of women with a normal puerperium.This was a prospective observational study of 79 women with secondary postpartum hemorrhage. Ultrasound examinations were performed on the day the patients presented with clinical symptoms and were scheduled for postpartum days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56, continuing until uterine surgical evacuation was performed or until the bleeding stopped. The maximum anteroposterior (AP) diameters of the uterus and uterine cavity were measured and morphological findings in the cavity were recorded. The findings were compared with previously published results from a normal population.The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 18) underwent surgery and Group 2 (n = 61) was treated conservatively. Sonography revealed an echogenic mass in the uterine cavity in 17 patients from Group 1, and in 14 of these patients histology confirmed placental tissue. The AP diameter of the uterine cavity was above the 90(th) percentile in all but two of the 18 Group 1 patients. In 18 patients from Group 2 the cavity was empty and in 43 a mixed-echo pattern was found. The uterine cavity was wider compared with the controls, but the values largely overlapped.This report supports the opinion that the sonographic finding of an echogenic mass in the uterine cavity in women with secondary postpartum hemorrhage is associated with retained placental tissue.
