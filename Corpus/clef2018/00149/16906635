Tumor angiogenesis assessed by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound in early, advanced and metastatic ovarian cancer: A preliminary study. To evaluate tumor vascularity by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound (3D-PDU) in early and advanced stage primary ovarian cancers and in metastatic tumors to the ovary.This was a retrospective analysis of clinical and sonographic data from 49 women with primary ovarian cancers or metastatic tumors to the ovary. All women underwent 3D-PDU prior to surgery. Vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) from solid portions or papillary projections in the tumors were calculated using the Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis (VOCAL(trade mark)) program. Definitive histological diagnosis was obtained in each case.Among the 49 women, 10 had stage I primary cancers (five low-malignant potential tumors and five invasive tumors), 26 had advanced stage primary ovarian cancers and 13 had metastatic tumors to the ovary. Mean VI and VFI were significantly higher in advanced stage tumors and metastatic tumors as compared with early stage tumors. No differences in 3D-PDU indices were found between advanced stage and metastatic cancers.Vascular indices derived from 3D-PDU tend to be higher in advanced stage and metastatic ovarian cancers as compared with early stage ovarian tumors.
