Brenner tumors of the ovary: sonographic and computed tomographic imaging features. The purpose of this study was to describe the sonographic appearance of ovarian Brenner tumors with computed tomographic (CT) correlation.Twenty-two female patients (age range, 32-78 years mean, 58 years) with 25 ovarian Brenner tumors were identified from pathologic records from 1990 to 2005. Corresponding pathologic reports and images (17 sonographic and 14 CT) were reviewed independently.Tumors ranged in size from 0.3 to 12 cm (mean, 2.5 cm) all were benign. Sixteen (64%) of 25 were found incidentally. Eight (36%) of 22 patients had a total of 12 associated benign ovarian neoplasms (1 was contralateral)Brenner tumors are most often solid neoplasms found incidentally and frequently seen in association with other benign ovarian epithelial neoplasms.
