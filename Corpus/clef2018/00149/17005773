CT colonography with computer-aided polyp detection: volume and attenuation thresholds to reduce false-positive findings owing to the ileocecal valve. To retrospectively identify volume and average attenuation thresholds for differentiating between ileocecal valve (ICV) and polyp at computed tomographic (CT) colonography with computer-aided detection (CAD).Informed consent (with consent for future retrospective research) and institutional review board (IRB) approval were obtained for the original prospective study. This retrospective study had IRB approval, as well, and was HIPAA-compliant. A total of 496 patients were selected from a larger screening population. CT colonographic images from 394 patients (227 men, 167 women mean age, 58.0 yearsA total of 386 ICVs and 67 adenomatous polyps from the training set and 102 ICVs and 138 adenomatous polyps from the test set could be segmented with a three-dimensional segmentation algorithm. When supine and prone images were counted individually, 746 nonunique ICVs from the training set and 191 from the test set were segmentable. In the training set, a volume of 600 mm(3) and an attenuation of 36 HU provided 100% sensitivity (67 polyps 95% CI: 93%, 100%) and the optimal 83% specificity (618 of 746 ICVsVolume and average CT attenuation thresholds can help differentiate most ICVs from true polyps.
