A prospective evaluation of uterine abnormalities by saline infusion sonohysterography in 1,009 women with infertility or abnormal uterine bleeding. To evaluate the role of saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) in the investigation of uterine abnormalities and malformations in patients referred for infertility work-up compared with women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).Prospective cohort study.Academically oriented private practice.One thousand nine consecutive women examined by SIS for infertility work-up (n = 600, infertility group) or AUB investigation (n = 409, AUB group).SIS.Intracavitary abnormalities and uterine anomalies.Among the women in the infertility group, 16.2% (n = 97) were found to have intracavitary abnormalities, including polyps (13.0%), submucous fibroids (2.8%), and adhesions (0.3%). Significantly, more patients in the AUB group (39.6%, n = 162) revealed intracavitary abnormalities, including polyps (29.8%), submucous fibroids (9.0%), and adhesions (0.7%). In contrast, significantly more uterine anomalies were found in the infertility group (20%, n = 120) compared with the AUB group (9.5%, n = 39). Arcuate uterus was the most common finding (15% vs. 6.4% of patients, respectively).An SIS procedure for infertility work-up revealed a substantial percentage of infertile patients with intracavitary abnormalities and uterine anomalies. Because the technique is safe, well tolerated, and feasible in an outpatient setting, SIS should be considered routinely in the early stage of infertility and AUB investigation.
