Uterine torsion and fetal bradycardia associated with external cephalic version. Torsion of the gravid uterus is a rare obstetric complication in humans, but has been reported in association with malpresentation and with uterine leiomyomata.We report a case of uterine torsion diagnosed at emergency cesarean delivery after external cephalic version with prolonged fetal bradycardia.Physicians should be aware of the possibility of uterine torsion as a complication of external cephalic version. To minimize diagnostic delay, placental localization on ultrasonography should be noted before and after external cephalic version as an indicator of uterine orientation.
