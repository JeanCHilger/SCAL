Bone health in adolescents. Adolescence is a crucial period for the accrual of bone density and achievement of peak bone mass. Unique situations can arise during adolescence that place an adolescent at risk for bone loss or the failure to attain appropriate bone mass. Clinicians also are challenged by the limitations of currently available measurement tools to evaluate skeletal status in young patients. This article reviews medical approaches to prevent bone loss in patients with eating disorders and the skeletal effects of specific hormonal contraceptive agents. Adolescent medicine specialists and gynecologists caring for teenagers must recognize the potential implications of these clinical settings on bone health to provide appropriate patient guidance and direct management.
