Possibilities of using ultrasound in the diagnosis of descended posterior compartment of female pelvic floor. Find out the features of descending posterior vaginal wall using ultrasonography and set the objective diagnostic criteria.Prospective comparative study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Teaching Hospital Bulovka, First Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague.We included 39 attendants, 19 with clinicaly proven descent of posterior vaginal wall 20 as a negative control group. We observed the ultrasonographical features of descending posterior vaginal wall according to the horisontal line crossing the inferior margin of pubic bone (PM) and central anorectal angle (PARA) at rest and during Valsalva manoevre with and without intrarectal application of sonographic yelly. Student's t-Test was used for statistical evaluation.We proved the statisticaly significant increase in the distances PM and PM' in the group of females suffering from the descent compared to the group of healthy women. Values of PARA were also signifinatly hightened in the group of patients with the descent compared to healthy females.The ultrasonographical evaluation of descending posterior vaginal wall appears to be promising chance in diagnostics of female's pelvic floor pathology.
