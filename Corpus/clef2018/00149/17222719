The value of specific MRI features in the evaluation of suspected placental invasion. The objective of this study was to determine imaging features that may help predict the presence of placenta accreta, placenta increta or placenta percreta on prenatal MRI scanning.A retrospective review of the prenatal MR scans of 10 patients with a diagnosis of placenta accreta, placenta increta or placenta percreta made by pathologic and clinical reports and of 10 patients without placental invasion was performed. Two expert MRI readers were blinded to the patients' true diagnosis and were asked to score a total of 17 MRI features of the placenta and adjacent structures. The interrater reliability was assessed using kappa statistics. The features with a moderate kappa statistic or better (kappa > .40) were then compared with the true diagnosis for each observer.Seven of the scored features had an interobserver reliability of kappa > .40: placenta previa (kappa = .83) abnormal uterine bulging (kappa = .48)MRI can be a useful adjunct to ultrasound in diagnosing placenta accreta prenatally. Three features that are seen on MRI in patients with placental invasion appear to be useful for diagnosis: uterine bulging heterogeneous signal intensity within the placenta
