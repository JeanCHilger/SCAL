Laparoscopic management of the adnexal mass. In the past few years the contribution of operative laparoscopy in all fields of gynecological surgery has been revolutionary. Nowadays laparoscopic management of adnexal masses is the most frequently performed laparoscopic intervention. Laparoscopy in comparison to laparotomy has the advantages of lower morbidity, shorter length of hospital stay, decreased postoperative pain, lesser de novo adhesion formation, better cosmetic results, faster recovery, and reduced overall cost of care. However, careful preoperative evaluation is important for the appropriate and successful use of laparoscopy for removal of adnexal masses and the advantages of the laparoscopic approach should, in no way, compromise the clinical outcome in women with malignancy. Patient's age, history, findings of physical examination, and the results of serum markers in combination with the imaging assessment, such as Doppler sonography, CT, or MRI, should be considered to reach the diagnosis preoperatively. However, only pathology of the adnexal mass can provide the definitive diagnosis. The specific characteristics of the adnexal masses in childhood, adolescent, reproductive, and postmenopausal age represent the essential parameters that will determine the therapeutic strategy to be followed. Furthermore, the clinician has to determine whether an adnexal mass requires surgery or expectant management as well as to estimate the possibility of malignancy.
