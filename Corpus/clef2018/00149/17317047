Isolated torsion of fallopian tube in a post-menopausal patient: a case report. Isolated fallopian tube torsion after menopause is a rare condition. Here we report the second case of isolated fallopian tube torsion in a post-menopausal woman. A 55-year-old post-menopausal woman presented with right lower abdominal pain. Sonography depicted a simple cystic mass adjacent to the right uterine border. Laparatomy revealed torsion of the right fallopian tube together with a paraovarian cyst. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a simple paraovarian cyst with severe congestion, necrosis and hemorrhage. Tubal torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute lower abdominal pain, even in post-menopausal women.
