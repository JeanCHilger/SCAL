Pelvic and abdominal actinomycosis presenting as a parietal mass. Actinomycosis is a rare disease. It has a highly varied clinical picture and may simulate genital or gastrointestinal neoplasms.This 45-year-old woman was referred for suspected ovarian cancer, with secondary lesions of the liver and pelvic wall. Pelvic actinomycosis was first suggested by the presence of an intrauterine device (IUD), which had been in place for several years without any follow-up. The final diagnosis was based upon histological examination of a biopsy sample of the parietal mass.The association of apparent pelvic tumors with infection and inflammation together with the presence of an IUD must suggest genital actinomycosis and lead to the rejection of any immediate surgical resection. The diagnosis is usually histological, with samples obtained either surgically or by percutaneous stereotactic biopsy. The treatment is essentially medical and consists of long-term antibiotics (penicillin). The prognosis is usually good.
