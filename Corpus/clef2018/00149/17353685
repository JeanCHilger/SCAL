Three and four-dimensional ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology. Developments in ultrasound in general, but even more so in three-dimensional ultrasound, parallel the growth in computing power and speed of computer technology. It is not surprising, therefore, that three-dimensional ultrasound technology is constantly evolving at a fast pace. The purpose of this article is to provide enhanced diagnostic capabilities for the obstetrical and gynecologic provider.The most recent advances in three-dimensional ultrasound have to do with two main features. First, an increasingly fast acquisition speed, enabling quick sequences of fast moving organs such as the heart to be captured. Second, the increasing number of different display modalities, making understanding and analysis of normal anatomy and pathology easier for clinicians.This article highlights a selected number of clinical situations in which three-dimensional ultrasound meaningfully enhances the contribution of this fast evolving diagnostic imaging tool.
