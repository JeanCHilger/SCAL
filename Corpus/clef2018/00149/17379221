Essure sterilization associated with endometrial ablation. To evaluate the feasibility and the outcome of Essure sterilization associated with different techniques of endometrial ablation.Retrospective study conducted among 23 women with confirmed menometrorrhagia and with the desire for or the medical need for permanent tubal sterilization. Patients underwent combined hysteroscopic placement of Essure and hysteroscopic endometrial resection procedures: ThermaChoice (n=14), NovaSure (n=4), Hydrothermablator (n=2) and endometrial resection using monopolar energy (n=1), or bipolar energy (n=2).Fallopian tubes were successfully cannulated bilaterally in 87% of the cases (20/23). No adverse event was reported. Adequate bilateral occlusion was confirmed for all patients (20/20) by 3D ultrasound and pelvic X-ray at a 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, 85% of these patients were satisfied with the results of the procedure, all experiencing a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss (Higham blood loss score).Combining EA and hysteroscopic sterilization seems to be feasible and efficient in patients with menometrorrhagia.
