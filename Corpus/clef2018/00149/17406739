Pseudotumoral adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder diagnosed by ultrasound. Report of one case. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder wall is a frequent benign degenerative hyperplasia of unknown etiology. In some cases it looks like a malignant tumor. The diagnosis can be suspected during ultrasound examination. We report a 36 year-old male that presented with nonspecific dyspepsia. The ultrasound showed a gallbladder mass with small cyst and echogenic spot inside that suggested the presence of Rokitansky-Ashoff sinuses, seen in adenomyomatosis. The patient was operated and the tumor was excised. The pathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the presence of gallbladder adenomyomatosis.
