Ultrasonic Doppler flow studies of the uterine arteries in women with cervix cancer. The main characteristic of malignant tumors is their capacity for local destructive spread as well as infiltration into the adjacent tissue. The present study was carried out to evaluate the hemodynamic alterations in patients with advanced cervix cancer. Data of 34 patients with cervix cancer are compared to 30 healthy women with normal history. The mean pulsatility index (PI) was significantly lower in cancer patients (PI = 1.75 +/- 1.27) than in controls (PI = 3.18 +/- 0.99). Use of noninvasive Doppler ultrasound study physiology of uterine hemodynamics in patients with cervix cancer is of great clinical relevance and paves the way for further investigations in screening programs for cervix cancer.
