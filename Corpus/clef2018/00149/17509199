Selective visualization of the Fallopian tube with magnetic resonance imaging. At present, X-ray hysterosalpingography is used commonly as a screening method for testing Fallopian tube patency, but the results are often unreliable due to mucous plugs or muscular contractions. Selective catheterization of the tubes under X-ray control is feasible, but is rarely used due to exposure of young individuals aiming for pregnancy to a high ionizing dose. Here, a case is described of a patient whose Fallopian tubes were selectively catheterized and visualized three-dimensionally under contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance using a high-viscous gadoteric acid solution (Dotarem). In this patient, bilateral peritubal adhesions caused a blockage of the fimbrial part of the tube leading to transuterine spilling of tubal fluid. Laparoscopy followed by bilateral salpingectomy was then performed, which confirmed the three-dimensional MRI images, and the excised specimens were examined histologically. The advantages of this novel technique include the avoidance of ionizing damage to the gonads and the potential for development of more elaborate interventional methods, such as ballooning and stenting. It is intended to develop contrast MRI further, both for improved non-invasive visualization and for manipulative technology of the Fallopian tubes.
