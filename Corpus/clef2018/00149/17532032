Three-dimensional endometrial volume and 3-dimensional power Doppler analysis in predicting endometrial carcinoma and hyperplasia. To evaluate the accuracy of endometrial volume measurement and 3-dimensional power Doppler analysis (3D-PDA) in the diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma and endometrial hyperplasia in women with post- and peri-menopausal bleeding.56 women with post-menopausal and 89 with peri-menopausal bleeding were enrolled. All were scheduled for hysteroscopy, dilatation and curettage, endometrial sampling or hysterectomy, and the ultrasound was performed within 24 h before the procedure. Endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, vascularity index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularity flow index (VFI) were measured. These parameters were compared between the group of women with normal histology (including endometrial polyps) and the pathologic group (carcinoma and hyperplasia with or without atypia).Ninety women (62%) had normal histology, 26 (17.9%) had an endometrial polyp, 18 (12.5%) hyperplasia and 11 (7.6%) had endometrial carcinoma. Mean endometrial thickness was 11 mm and 15.5 mm in the normal and pathologic groups respectively (p<0.005). The mean endometrial volume was 6.87 cc and 15.5 cc in the two groups respectively (p<0.001). The VI was 2.27% and 2.95% in the two groups respectively (p=0.022). The FI was 18.6 and 23.6 in the two groups respectively (p=0.014). The VFI was 0.68 and 0.89 in the two groups respectively (p=0.018). Using ROC the area under the curve was 0.698, 0.728, 0.621, 0.631, and 0.625 for endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, VI, FI and VFI respectively. The best predictor of endometrial carcinoma was an endometrial volume of 3.56 cc or more (sensitivity 93.1%, specificity 36.2%).Endometrial volume and 3D-PDA are good diagnostic tools in predicting endometrial carcinoma and hyperplasia in women with post- and peri-menopausal bleeding.
