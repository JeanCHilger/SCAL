Polyorchidism in child (a case report and review of literature). Polyorchidism is an urogenital curiosity defined by the presence of more than two testes confirmed by histology. This anomaly is extremely rare and only a hundred world cases were described in the literature. Although it can remain asymptomatic, polyorchidism is often associated to processus vaginalis anomalies in childhood (hernia, hydrocele) and undescended testis. The review of the literature finds cases of polyorchidism revealed by testis torsion and an increased risk of malignancy and infertility. We report the case of polyorchidism in a 14 year old child, at whom a painful testis mass indicate surgical exploration and documented the histological diagnosis of polyorchidism. Through this observation and review of the literature, authors describe pathological and managment findings of polyorchidism.
