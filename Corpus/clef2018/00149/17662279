Ultrasonographic characteristics of the endometrium among patients with fibroids undergoing ART. A retrospective cohort study examining all completed nondonor first ART cycles was performed to evaluate the ultrasonographic appearance of the endometrial pattern and thickness at time of hCG administration among precycle screened patients with uterine fibroids compared with patients without fibroids. There was no difference in the endometrial thickness (10.3 +/- 2.0 mm vs. 10.0 +/- 2.6 mm) between those with fibroids and controls however, the rate of nonproliferative endometrial pattern (3.1% vs. 1.0%) and live birth rates (34.4% vs. 43.0%) were significantly different, most notably among those patients with intramural fibroids.
