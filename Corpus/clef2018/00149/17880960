Inheritance of pericentric inversion in chromosome 7 through the three progenies and a newborn with congenital hydronephrosis diagnosed prenatally by fetal urine sampling. To report the inheritance of a pericentric inversion in chromosome 7 through the three progenies, congenital hydronephrosis, and recurrent miscarriages in an extended family.Case report.Medical Faculty of Cukurova University in Turkey.Referred by obstetrics and gynecology clinic.Fetal urine and lymphocytic karyotype.Chromosomal analysis from fetal urine and peripheral blood lymphocytes were performed according to standard cytogenetic methods.We assessed an extended family in which a large pericentric inversion in chromosome 7 is segregating one of the three progenies with the karyotype 46,XY,inv(7)(p22This case describes the further molecular characterization of these breakpoints on the short or long arm of chromosome 7(p22-q22). The inv(7) is also associated with fetal wastage and may be playing a role in the etiology of the family's miscarriages. These findings can be used in clinical genetics and may be an effective tool for reproductive guidance and genetic counseling.
