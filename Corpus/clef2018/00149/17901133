Adnexal torsion: new clinical and imaging observations by sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings associated with adnexal torsion.A review of surgically proven cases of torsion between 1990 and 2006 included clinical, surgical, and pathologic data and preoperative sonographic, computed tomographic (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Imaging reports were assessed to determine whether a correct preoperative diagnosis was made. Factors related to failure to make a correct diagnosis were evaluated.Fifty-eight cases of torsion were evaluated (patient ages, 12-85 years 14 postmenopausal). There was a slight right-sided predominance (55%)Although CT shows features suggestive of torsion, in our study, the diagnostic value of initial CT was less than that of initial sonography. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made less often with an underlying adnexal mass and in postmenopausal women. Previous surgery and adhesions may be predisposing factors for adnexal torsion.
