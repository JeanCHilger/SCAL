Diagnostics, treatment and expert evaluation of air crew members with polypoid growth in the gallbladder. The article discusses results of diagnosing and treatment of various forms of gallbladder polypoid growth (GBPG) in air crew members in the past 10 yr. period. Growth of polyps was detected in 12.1% of pilots with gallbladder pathologies. Timely and correct diagnostics with the use of radiologic visualization may prevent unwarranted surgery of the hepatobilizry system and thus extend the flying longevity. Ultrasound Doppler investigation is particularly effective in diagnosing early GBPG. High quality of visual differentiation attainable with these techniques made it possible to diagnose the nonneoplastic nature of GBPG in 75% of cases that did not require operational treatment. In most cases the authors' diagnostic and treatment algorithm reduced the amount of surgical activity and prolonged ace careers.
