The association of intramuscular myxoma and fibrous dysplasia is a rare disease known as Mazabraud's syndrome. We present a case of Mazabraud's syndrome coexisting with a uterine tumor and resembling an ovarian sex cord tumor (UTROSCT). This uterine tumor showed a high mitotic index and cytological atypia.
