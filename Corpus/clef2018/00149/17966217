The role of three-dimensional (3D) sonography and 3D power Doppler in the preoperative assessment of borderline ovarian tumors. To determine the value of three-dimensional (3D) sonography and 3D power Doppler in distinguishing borderline ovarian tumors from benign cysts and malignant tumors.One hundred and seventy-two women with a mean age of 37 years (range 28-45) and diagnosis of a confirmed pelvic mass were referred for preoperative evaluation with 3D sonography and 3D power Doppler. Sonographic criteria used for the diagnosis of borderline tumors were based on a system that included morphological characteristics, histological evaluation and power Doppler imaging.Ten lesions were histopathologically diagnosed as borderline ovarian tumors, 42 as malignant and 120 as benign. Three-dimensional sonography revealed 120 ovarian tumors which scored below 7 (benign), according to Kurjak's scale, 12 tumors which scored between 7-8 and 40 tumors between 9-13 (malignant).Preoperative assessment of borderline tumors by 3D imaging may promote improved patient care and introduce laparoscopic management as an alternative surgical approach.
