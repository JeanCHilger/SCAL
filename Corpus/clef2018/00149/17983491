Influence of embryo transfer depth on in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer outcomes. To investigate the influence of transfer distance from the fundus on clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate in in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.A total of 98 patients (108 cycles) undergoing ultrasound-guided embryo transfer were divided into two groups according to the distance between the tip of catheter and the uterine fundus: group A: > or = 5 - < 10 mm, group B: > or = 10 - < or = 15 mm.Clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate were significantly higher in group B compared with group A [44 % (23/52) vs 25% (14/56), 24% (28/115) vs 14% (17/121), P < 0.05]. The multiple pregnancy rate, ectopic rate and miscarriage rate were similar in the two groups (P > 0.05).The depth of the embryo replacement into the uterine cavity may influence pregnancy rate and implantation rate.
