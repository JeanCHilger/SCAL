Diagnostic value of ovarian morphology by ultrasonography in pubertal polycystic ovary syndrome. To explore the ovarian morphological characteristics by ultrasonography as diagnostic criteria for pubertal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Sixty-six adolescent PCOS patients and 27 controls were involved in this study. They underwent transrectal ultrasound during the early follicular phase or amenorrheal period (dominant follicle excluded by ultrasonography). t test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were mainly used for statistical analysis.The mean ovarian volume (MOV), maximal ovarian volume (MaxOV) and mean follicle number (MFN) in PCOS group were all significantly greater than control group (P = 0.000). ROC curve analysis showed a satisfactory diagnostic potency for both ovarian volume and follicle number. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.914, 0.884 and 0.838 for MOV, MaxOV and MFN respectively with no statistical difference among them (P > 0.05). Setting the threshold of MOV at 6.4 cm(3) offered the best compromise between sensitivity (84.8%) and specificity (87.5%), and setting the threshold of MaxOV at 8.6 cm(3) offered the best compromise between sensitivity (75.8%) and specificity (95.2%) and setting the threshold of MFN at 8 offered the best compromise between sensitivity (86.7%) and specificity (78.3%).Ovarian morphology by ultrasonography yields satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for adolescent PCOS. Taking MOV >or= 6.4 cm(3) or MaxOV >or= 8.6 cm(3) or MFN >or= 8 as an ultraphonic criterion for pubertal PCOS offer the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.
