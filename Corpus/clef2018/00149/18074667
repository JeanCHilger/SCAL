Noninvasive assessment of benign lesions of vocal folds by means of ultrasonography. Although ultrasonography (US) has been widely used in various parts of the body, its application in laryngeal examination has been limited. Our objective was to evaluate the significance of US examination in benign lesions of the vocal folds.Ultrasonographic examination of the vocal folds was performed in 14 patients in whom benign lesions of the vocal folds had been diagnosed by videolaryngoscopy and microlaryngoscopy. Microlaryngoscopic surgery was performed after US examination. Each lesion was analyzed for the following US features: shape, size, and echotexture (echogenicity and homogeneity).In total, 16 lesions were diagnosed in 14 patients by means of videolaryngoscopy and microlaryngoscopy. Ultrasonographic examination was capable of diagnosing 14 of the 16 lesions (87.25%). Ultrasonography mainly helped in the diagnosis of sessile polyps, nodules, and leukoplakia that were larger than 2 mm. The lesions were linear hyperechoic, heterogeneous hyperechoic, hypoechoic, and isoechoic if they were leukoplakia, nodules, hemorrhagic polyps, and other polypoid lesions, respectively. The results are better if the diagnosis follows the corresponding US echotexture pattern rather than videolaryngoscopy and microlaryngoscopy.Laryngeal US examination appears to be a useful diagnostic tool for supplementing microlaryngoscopy in the assessment of benign lesions of vocal folds. In contrast to these currently used imaging techniques, anesthesia is not necessary in laryngeal US examination. In addition, US is noninvasive, painless, and much less expensive than the other techniques.
