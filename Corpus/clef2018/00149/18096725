Preoperative sonographic and clinical characteristics as predictors of ovarian torsion. The purpose of this study was to determine the most closely associated sonographic and clinical characteristics of ovarian torsion.The medical records and sonographic studies of 39 patients with pathologically proven ovarian torsion diagnosed at our institution from July 1, 2000, through December 31, 2005, were retrospectively reviewed. The volumes of the affected ovaries and ovary/mass complexes were compared with an age-appropriate standard. Statistical significance of the data was assessed by a likelihood ratio chi(2) analysis.All patients (100%) had a chief symptom of abdominal pain. Thirty-three (85%) reported vomiting 22 (56%) had leukocytosisAbdominal pain, vomiting, ovarian enlargement, and absence of ovarian venous Doppler flow are the most frequently shown clinical and sonographic indicators of ovarian torsion. However, ovarian enlargement, even in the presence of arterial and venous Doppler flow, is the most commonly associated sonographic finding. Suspicion of ovarian torsion should be high in the setting of clinical symptoms and ovarian enlargement regardless of the presence or absence of an ovarian Doppler signal.
