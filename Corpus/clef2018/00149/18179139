TV sonographic assessment in postmenopausal asymptomatic women. The aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the usefulness of transvaginal sonography for the detection of endometrial disease in postmenopausal women without symptoms. The study involved 750 postmenopausal women aged 52-65 (mean 58.5). None of them were on hormone replacement therapy and all had had amenorrhea for more than two years. Transvaginal sonography was performed in 750 women. An endometrium of < 5 mm and non-measurable (627 women) was not investigated further. The 627 cases of this group were reassessed one year later. In the remaining 123 postmenopausal women with suspicious endometrium > 5 mm, 19 endometrial polyps (7.13%), one cervical polyp with extension in the cavity (0.8%), 90 endometrial atrophies (73.17%), ten atrophic endometritis (8.13%), two simple hyperplasias (1.62%), and one hyperplasia with atypia (0.8%) were found. Transvaginal sonography is an efficient and acceptable noninvasive method for the early detection of endometrial pathology in postmenopausal asymptomatic women.
