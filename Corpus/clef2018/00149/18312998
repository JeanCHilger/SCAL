Successful total laparoscopic cystic adenomyomectomy after unsuccessful open surgery using transtrocar ultrasonographic guiding. A 27-year-old woman with a cystic adenomyoma located within the myometrium underwent laparotomy unsuccessfully, with persistent postoperative heavy dysmenorrhea. Total laparoscopic resection of the cystic adenomyoma was then attempted. Intraoperative transtrocar ultrasonography was used to detect the location and boundaries of the cystic adenomyoma. The cyst was removed laparoscopically, and dysmenorrhea completely disappeared postoperatively. This is the first report of total laparoscopic resection of cystic adenomyoma after unsuccessful laparotomy, a minimally invasive approach that successfully eliminated the patient's severe signs and symptoms.
