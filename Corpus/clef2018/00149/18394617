Sonohysterography as a first-line evaluation for uterine abnormalities in women with recurrent failed in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. We evaluated the uterine cavity by sonohysterography (SHG) in patients with recurrent failed IVF-embryo transfer despite transfer of good quality embryos, compared with other diagnostic methods. We found that SHG is highly valuable and should be applied routinely as a first-line, office-based diagnostic tool in such cases.
