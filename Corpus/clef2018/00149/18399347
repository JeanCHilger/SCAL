Meigs' syndrome presenting as haemorrhagic pleural effusion. The association of a benign ovarian tumor with ascites and hydrothorax that resolve after tumor resection, known as Meigs syndrome is a rare clinical entity. Rarer still is the haemorrhagic form of the syndromeTo describe a case of benign ovarian tumour associated with ascites and bloody pleural effusion.A thirty-seven year old woman was referred for the further management of a pleural effusion. A detailed clinical evaluation was carried out, including pleural fluid cytology, chest CT scan and laparatomy. Treatment included antituberculous therapy and finally ovariectomy.The physical examination and a pelvic ultrasonographic scan revealed ascites in addition to a right sided ovarian mass. A chest CT-scan did not show any intrathoracic mass. Repeated pleural fluid cytology showed mesothelial cells but was negative for malignancy. An ovariectomy was performed and histological examination revealed a thecoma fibroma. The pleural effusion and ascites resolved spontaneously thus confirming the diagnosis of Meigs' syndrome.Meigs' syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis in female patients with hemorrhagic pleural effusion.
