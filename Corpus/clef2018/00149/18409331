Do calcification of placenta reveal only maternal cigarette smoking?. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with not only obstetrical and pediatrician complications with fetus, newborn and child but also with placenta. The aim of the work was the estimation of placental calcification between maternal cigarette smoking and non-smoking pregnant women. All women have taken vitamin supplements during time of experiment. The study group consisted of 200 pregnant women (100 smokers and 100 non-smokers). All patients were admitted and delivered singleton births in the Gynecological and Obstetric Clinical Hospital in Poznan, between 2004-2007. A questionnaire was used as a study tool. s. The study groups were similar under age, education, obstetrical interview and cigarette smoking (5-10 cigarettes/day). Ultrasound investigations showed placental calcification in 36% vs 45% pregnancy at 30 +/- 2 weeks of gestation and in 52% vs 57% at 40 +/- 2 weeks of pregnancy as well as in 55% vs 58% placentas in macroscopic examination, between smoking and non-smoking women. Cigarette smoking should not be considered as exclusive factor leading to formation deposits of calcium in placenta. The consumption of vitamin supplements probably also involve calcification of placenta tissue.
