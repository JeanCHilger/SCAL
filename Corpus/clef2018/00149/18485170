The use of inferior vena caval filters prior to major surgery in women with gynaecological cancer. To evaluate the use of inferior vena caval filters (IVCF) prior to surgery in women with gynaecological cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE).Retrospective review of medical notes and electronic records.Gynaecological oncology cancer centre.Women with gynaecological cancer and VTE requiring major surgery.A retrospective analysis was performed on women treated for gynaecological malignancies who had had VTE, and an IVCF placed before major abdominal surgery were reviewed during the period 1996-2006.Safety of IVCF placement and retrieval, peri-operative morbidity and incidence of further VTE.The median age was 66 years (range 30-84 years). Of the 39 women, 35 (90%) women had a primary cancer diagnosis and 4 (10%) had recurrent disease. Twenty-two women had ovarian cancer, 2 had borderline ovarian tumours, 9 had uterine cancer, 5 had cervical cancer and 1 woman had concurrent ovarian and endometrial cancers. The recurrent cancers were two cervical, one ovarian and one uterine. The IVCF used were either of the permanent or retrievable type, the latter being more commonly used in younger women. All filters were placed without morbidity, and none of these women who then underwent major abdominal surgery had VTE complications. In 43.6% of women (n = 17), surgery was performed within 6 weeks of the diagnosis of VTE. All women received perioperative anticoagulation in the form of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Three retrievable filters were uneventfully removed postoperatively. No filter-related problems occurred.Surgery in women with gynaecological cancer and life-threatening VTE is feasible with preoperative IVCF placement. The use of IVCF was safe with no worsening of the VTE, and without surgical or filter-related problems. A short interval between the diagnosis of VTE and surgery was not associated with increased perioperative morbidity.
