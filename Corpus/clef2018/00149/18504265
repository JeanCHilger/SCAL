Association between abnormal uterine artery Doppler flow velocimetry, risk of preeclampsia, and indices of arterial structure and function: a pilot study. Preeclampsia increases the risk of future cardiovascular disease. The association between abnormal uterine artery Doppler flow velocimetry, risk of preeclampsia, and indices of arterial structure and function is investigated in this study. The carotid intima-media thickness of 34 pregnant women with normal uteroplacental flow was compared with 30 women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler analysis during the transvaginal assessment of the uterine arteries at the routine anomaly scan (20-23 weeks of gestation). Women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler results had a greater mean internal (but not common) carotid intima-media thickness (0.58 +/- 0.06 vs 0.53 +/- 0.08, respectively, P = .005) and risk of developing preeclampsia (6 of 30 vs 0 of 34 or 20% vs 0%, respectively, P = .0079) compared with those with normal uteroplacental flow. Women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler results may be at increased risk not only for developing subsequent preeclampsia but also for future cardiovascular disease.
