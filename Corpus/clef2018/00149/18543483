Treatment of refractory polycystic ovary syndrome by bushen huoxue method combined with ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration. To observe the clinical effect of traditional Chinese medicine Bushen Houxue (BSHX) method combined with ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration (MFA) in treating refractory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Forty-four patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to two groups by randomizing digital table, 20 in the observation group and 24 in the control group. MFA was performed on both groups, and the decoction of BSHX, which consisted of dodder seed 20 g, prepared rehmannia root 10 g, mulberry mistletoe 20 g, epimedium 15 g, psoralea fruit 10 g, solomonseal rhizome 10 g, honeylocust thorn 15 g, peach kernel 10 g, pleione bulbocodioides 10 g, red sage root 20 g, and licorice root 6 g, was given to the observation group one dose every day for 14 days every menstrual cycle. Changes of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone (T) were determined before and after MFA. The impacts on quantity of HMG used, number of sinus follicle, mature follicle, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulating syndrome (OHSS), luteinized unrupture follicular syndrome (LUFS) and pregnance rate were also observed.MFA had been performed for 42 cycles in the observation group and 56 cycles in the control group. Levels of T, LH and LH/FSH ratio markedly reduced after aspiration, showing significant difference as compared with those of before treatment in both groups (P < 0.01), and difference of LH/FSH between groups was of statistical significance (P <0.01). In the observation group, 18 patients (90.0%) had their sinus follicle decreased to < 10 after MFA, while in the control group, it reached to <10 in 22 patients (91.70%), all were different to those before treatment (P <0.01). In the observation group, the quantity of HMG used for promoting ovulation was (585.0 +/- 195.0) IU, number of mature follicle at the day of HCG injection was 1.1 +/- 0.3, while in the control group, the corresponding data were (1470.0 +/- 532.5) IU and 3.1 +/- 1.4, all with significant difference between groups (P <0.01). None of OHSS and 1 case of LUFS occurred in the former group, while 1 mild OHSS and 2 LUFS in the latter. After ovulation promoting therapy and in the 3-month secutive follow-up period, pregnancy was found in 8 out of the 18 patients in the observation group (one twins and 7 single), with the pregnancy rate of 44.4% while in the control group, 7 in 22 (2 twins and 5 single) was found, the pregnancy rate being 31.8%.BSHX method combined with MFA is a safe and effective treatment for refractory PCOS, with few trauma. The combined usage of Chinese herbal medicine could significantly reduce dosage of HMG used for promoting follicle and the production of multiple mature follicles, thus to avoid the risk of OHSS.
