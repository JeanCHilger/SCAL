Misoprostol use as a method of medical abortion. The aim of our study was to verify with the use of ultrasound (US) scanning the effectiveness of misoprostol in medical abortion.The study population included women with a medical miscarriage attending the 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Athens in Aretaieion Hospital, Athens, Greece. All women < 49 days since their last menstruation received 800 microg vaginal misoprostol. The diagnosis of complete abortion was possible by the US measurements as endometrial thickness of 15 mm by transvaginal US was used as a cutoff level for successful abortion.The mean age of the study population was 27 years (ranging from 19 up to 37 years). Complete evacuation with misoprostol was performed in 149 women. The success rate was 85.2% (127/149). Twenty-two women experienced intrauterine echogenic structures with a diameter > 15 mm and all of them underwent surgical evacuation (14.8%). Vaginal bleeding was present in 17 patients after the procedure (11.4%). Less usual reported side-effects included nausea, vomiting, pain, or diarrhea.Misoprostol use is an effective, safe and acceptable method of medical abortion for women.
