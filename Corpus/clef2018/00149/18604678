Is transvaginal ultrasound a worthwhile investigation for women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy? Vaginal hysterectomy (VH) is the definitive surgical management for uterine prolapse. It is also the preferred route for other pelvic pathology where a hysterectomy is warranted, as it is associated with lower complication rate and faster recovery time. The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS) as an investigation prior to vaginal hysterectomy. A total of 103 patients were reviewed over 1 year. Associated gynaecological pathology was found in 46.6% of patients on TVS and this led to a change in planned management in 2.9% of cases. Consequently, preoperative TVS would appear to be a worthwhile investigation.
