Evaluation of endometrial thickness in hormone receptor positive early stage breast cancer postmenopausal women switching from adjuvant tamoxifen treatment to anastrozole. Evaluation of endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) in postmenopausal estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients treated with anastrozole after tamoxifen therapy. This study included 70 postmenopausal estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients who switched to anastrozole after tamoxifen patients had endometrial thickness >4mm and no endometrial malignancy. Endometrial thickness was measured after anastrozole treatment. Endometrial thickness during anastrozole therapy was lower than after tamoxifen therapy (p<0.001)
