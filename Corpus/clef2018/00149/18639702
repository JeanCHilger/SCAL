Oophoropexy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound after asynchronous bilateral ovarian torsion. A girl with asynchronous, bilateral ovarian torsion with previous oophorectomy presented with her second torsion. A laparoscopic untwisting of the torsed ovary was performed, treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy was given, and the outcome was followed with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. After 1 month, a laparoscopic oophoropexy was performed. The detorsed ovary regained its circulation and decreased in size. It looked normal at the time for oophopexy and at follow-up. This case supports the evidence of an ovarian-sparing approach to ovarian torsion in children and supports oophoropexy after torsion of a detorsed, otherwise normal ovary in the premenarcheal girl.
