A wandering spleen: unusual cause of a pelvic mass. Wandering spleen is a rare entity characterized by the incomplete fixation of the gastrosplenic ligaments. Several imaging modalities have been used to diagnose this condition, including Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography, nuclear scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging.We report a case of an asymptomatic woman presenting to a family planning center. An adnexal mass palpated on pelvic examination was diagnosed subsequently as a wandering spleen.This case illustrates that ultrasonography and nuclear medicine are useful to make a definitive diagnosis of wandering spleen.
