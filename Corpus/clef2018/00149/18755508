Cancer risk in male factor-infertility. Severe forms of male-factor infertility are associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer and scrotal ultrasonography is widely used for diagnosis. In this study, 2172 male members of infertile couples referred to our Reproductive Medicine Unit were submitted to scrotal ultrasonography and 835 selected patients had been followed during a 2-year period. Eight out of nine neoplastic nodules found at the initial examination were unpalpable and discovered by ultrasonography. Ten tumoral lesions were found in 370 testicular biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes or to extract spermatozoa and eight additional neoplastic lesions were discovered during the 2-year follow-up of 835 patients. The cumulative rate of neoplastic disease was 3.2%. Thirteen cases (1.5%) were malignant (12 germ cell tumours and one non-Hodgkin lymphoma of testicular origin)
