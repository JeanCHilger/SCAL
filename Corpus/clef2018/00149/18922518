Tolerability, side effects, and complications of hysterosalpingocontrast sonography (HyCoSy). To evaluate the tolerability, side effects and complications of hysterosalpingocontrast sonography (HyCoSy).Prospective study.University hospital.669 infertile women.All patients were examined with HyCoSy and monitored for 30 minutes after the procedure. A telephone interview was subsequently carried out to record possible late side effects and postprocedural complications.Tolerability to the procedure was evaluated by means of an 11-point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale of the pain experienced. Postprocedural fever, pelvic infections, peritonitis, hemorrhage were recorded.Of 660 patients who completed the examination, 483 (73.2%) completed the telephone follow-up after a period of 14.7 +/- 9.9 months from the procedure. The mean patient age was 34.5 +/- 4.3 years, and mean infertility duration was 28.1 +/- 23.2 months. The mean numeric rating scale was 2.7 +/- 2.5, and 10 patients (2.0%) required postprocedural drug treatment for pain relief. Mild vasovagal reactions were experienced in 20 cases (4.1%), and four patients (0.8%) had a severe vasovagal reaction. No late complications were reported. No patients required hospital admission after the procedure.In our series, HyCoSy was a well-tolerated examination with a very low rate of side effects and no late complications that required no atropine or anti-inflammatory drugs. These data support the safety of HyCoSy when performed as described, but further work is needed to estimate the rate of late complications and side effects in other settings.
