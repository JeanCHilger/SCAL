Comparison of low-dose human menopausal gonadotropin and micronized 17beta-estradiol supplementation in in vitro maturation cycles with thin endometrial lining. A challenge of in vitro maturation (IVM) treatment in some women is insufficient development of the endometrium prior to embryo transfer.Retrospective study.McGill Reproductive Center, Montreal, Canada.Women with endometrial thickness <6 mm on days 6-10 ultrasound (US) scan of IVM treatment.In the human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) group, 150 IU/day of hMG was started and in the estradiol group, 6 to 12 mg/day of micronized 17beta-estradiol was initiated. Additional US scans were performed 2 to 3 days apart, until endometrial thickness reached > or =8 mm or a dominant follicle (>10 mm) was identified.Endometrial lining before oocyte retrival.In both groups endometrial lining significantly thickened following treatment. However, hMG treatment resulted in a higher number of follicles > or =7 mm compared to estradiol (7.4 +/- 4.8 vs. 3.4 +/- 2.5, respectively) and a significantly higher percentage of mature oocytes that were identified on the day of oocyte retrieval (in vivo matured oocytes) (15.1% vs. 10.5%).In IVM designated cycles with a thin endometrium both low-dose hMG and micronized 17beta-estradiol supplementation significantly improve endometrial thickness. However, low-dose hMG results in larger follicles and a greater number of in vivo matured oocytes.
