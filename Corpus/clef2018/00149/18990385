Laparoscopy for differential diagnosis of a pelvic mass in a patient with Mayer-Rokitanski-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. To report a rare case of a myoma simulating a pelvic tumor in a patient with Mayer-Rokitanski-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. The rudimentary uterus may develop fibroids, and this event can lead to problems in differential diagnosis, especially if no vaginal reconstruction has been carried out.Case-report.University hospital.A 39-year-old patient with MRKH syndrome presented with a solid pelvic mass 9 cm in diameter on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging that could not be differentiated between fibroid and ovarian tumor.The patient was laparoscopically operated, and a fibroid of the right uterine residual was detected and removed.Histology confirmed a benign leiomyoma.In patients with MRKH syndrome, laparoscopy allows analysis of the origin of a solid pelvic tumor and its removal. Especially in patients without vaginal reconstruction, laparoscopy may be superior to imaging techniques.
