Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels and carotid intima-media thickness in obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and their relationship to metabolic parameters. To evaluate the plasma asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) levels and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Prospective study.University medical center.Thirty-five patients with PCOS and 31 healthy controls.Peripheral venous puncture, ultrasonography, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).Plasma ADMA, serum FSH, LH, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), free T and total T, insulin, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, homocysteine, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and carotid IMT.The PCOS group had higher levels of androgens, triglycerides, homocysteine, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance when compared with controls. There were no significant differences in ADMA levels and IMT between the two groups. The fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels were not different among the groups. Intima-media thickness was significantly correlated with DHEAS, but there was no association between IMT and ADMA.Results of our study revealed that ADMA levels and carotid IMT in patients with PCOS are not different from healthy controls.
