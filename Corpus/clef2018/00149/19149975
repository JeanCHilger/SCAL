Ovarian reserve and BMI between fertile and subfertile women. To compare the ovarian reserve and BMI in fertile and subfertile women aged 20-39 years by ultrasonography.A comparative study.The Ultrasound Clinic, PECHS, Karachi, from March to December 2006.Eighty women, 40 fertile and 40 subfertile, were subdivided into age groups of 20-29 and 30-39 years. Total ovarian volume (OV) was determined transabdominally (OV-TA) and transvaginally (OV-TV), antral follicle count (AFC) was performed transvaginally and BMI was calculated. Unpaired t-test and Pearson correlation tests were used for analysis.In the total and subfertile females, aged 20-39 years, OV-TA obtained was 10.47 +3.81 ml vs. 7.0+2.67 (p=0.015), OV-TA was 12.55+4.53 ml vs. 8.36+2.36 ml (p=0.001) AFC was 7.35+3.02 vs. 5.7+3.57 (p=0.027) and BMI was 23.4+3.9 vs. 26.5+4.7 (p=0.006). In the older group of fertile and subfertile females, aged 30-39 years, OV-TA was 7.92+2.01 ml vs. 6.74+2.38 (p=0.097), OV-TA was 9.97+2.99 vs. 7.73+2.40 (p=0.012), AFC was 5.30+2.05 vs. 3.05+2.46 (p=0.003), and BMI was 24.4+3.8 vs. 27.4+4.80 (p=0.034). A significant negative correlation was present between ovarian volume and BMI in the older fertile women only (p=0.001 r=0.3) whereas no significant correlation was seen in the two parameters in any other group (r=0.1).The ovarian reserve decreased with increasing age. The lack of ovarian reserve may lead to subfertility or early ovarian ageing. Ovarian volume showed decrease with an increase in the BMI, indicating the possible decrease in fertility with an increase in a woman's weight.
