Pseudoaneurysm of the uterine artery after cesarean delivery: management with superselective arterial embolization. Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare but serious complication of pelvic surgery. Cesarean delivery is the most common cause.We report a case of postpartum pelvic hemorrhage after cesarean delivery. A false aneurysm of the uterine artery was found by color Doppler ultrasonography and multislice spiral computed tomography. Arteriography confirmed the diagnosis. Superselective coil embolization of the aneurysm sac was achieved using the packing technique. The main uterine artery was preserved and the postprocedural course was uneventful.Color Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography were useful for the early diagnosis of uterine artery pseudoaneurysm. Primary transcatheter arterial embolization controlled bleeding without compromising reproductive potential.
