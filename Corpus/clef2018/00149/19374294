The effect of tranexamic acid for treatment irregular uterine bleeding secondary to DMPA use. Evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid and placebo for controlling irregular uterine bleeding in depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) users.A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 100 DMPA users attending the Family Planning Clinic King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. All users had abnormal bleeding. They were randomly divided in two groups a group of 50 received tranexamic acid, 250 mg four times a day for 5 days and another group of 49 received placebo in the same manner. One subject dropped out from the study. Total day of bleeding/spotting and percentage of women in whom bleeding was stopped were analyzed at the end of weeks 1 and 4.The percentage of subjects in whom bleeding was stopped during the first week after initial treatment was significantly higher in the tranexamic acid group than the placebo group (88% vs. 8.2%, p < 0.001). During the follow-up period (4 weeks after initial treatment), a bleeding-free interval of > 20 days was found in 68% of subjects treated with tranexamic acid and 0% treated with placebo(p < 0.001). The mean number of bleeding/spotting days were also significantly different between the groups (5.7 +/- 2.5 vs. 17.5 +/- 7.2 days, p < 0.05).Tranexamic acid was more effective than placebo in short-term treatment of irregular uterine bleeding/spotting associated with DMPA use.
