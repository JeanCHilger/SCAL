What factors currently limit magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound of leiomyomas? A survey conducted at the first international symposium devoted to clinical magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. To see if clinicians' impressions were influenced by expert opinion on patient selection criteria that influence magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) leiomyoma treatment.Survey-based study.First international symposium devoted to MRgFUS, "MRgFUS 2008," October 6-7, 2008, Washington, DC.Questionnaires on fibroid treatment were distributed to attending practitioners before and after the symposium.Selection criteria, which could be considered to be limitations to focused ultrasound therapy, were assessed on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1, which indicated no impediment to therapy, to 10, which represented an absolute contraindication to therapy.A total of 12 paired pre- and post-symposium questionnaires were analyzed. Mild adenomyosis, heavy bleeding, and bulk complaint were viewed as least likely to be an impediment to therapy both before and after the symposium. The presence of severe adenomyosis and five or more fibroids showed significant increases in mean rankings as contraindications to therapy following the symposium. Significant adverse events not previously reported were elicited by the survey.Expert opinion on patient selection criteria for MRgFUS is a useful resource for practitioner education.
