Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy in a patient with multiple prior cesarean sections: a case report. Cesarean scar pregnancy, an abnormal gestation implanted in the hysterotomy site of a previous cesarean section, is a unique type of ectopic pregnancy. Once uncommon, these life-threatening gestations are increasing in frequency. Outcomes depend on a high index of suspicion and early diagnosis.A 39-year-old, gravida 9, para 5-0-3-5, with a history of 5 cesarean deliveries, presented with vaginal bleeding secondary to cesarean scar pregnancy at 8 weeks' gestation. The patient, who desired future fertillty, was successfully treated conservatively with methotrexate and uterine artery embolization.Reports of cesarean scar pregnancies are rising in the literature, and we describe a scar pregnancy in a woman with multiple prior cesareans. Although the relationship between cesarean scar pregnancy and the number of previous cesarean deliveries is unclear, rising cesarean section rates worldwide will further increase overall incidence. The optimal treatment modality remains uncertain, but conservative management is appropriate when desired by the patient and administered under close observation.
