Juvenile granulosa cell ovarian tumor: a case report and review of literature. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors (JGCT) are rare ovarian tumors that frequently present with precocious puberty. Presentation in infants less than a year of age is also rare.We describe a 10-month-old infant who presented with both premature thelarche and adrenarche due to JGCT. Laboratory evaluation revealed classic elevation of estradiol and inhibin B, and less classic elevation of total and free testosterone. Oophorectomy and staging resulted in a diagnosis of Stage IA JGCT.Survival rates are >95% among patients diagnosed under 10 years of age. Tumor recurrence is rare but can occur as late as 48 months. Therefore, tumor surveillance is warranted for patients with even a Stage IA JGCT and involves monitoring serial inhibin B levels along with intermittent imaging.
