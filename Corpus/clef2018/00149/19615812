Feasibility of endometrial assessment after thermal ablation. To evaluate the feasibility of endometrial assessment after endometrial thermal ablation.Prospective observational study. A total of 57 women (age 47-52 years), who had undergone endometrial thermal ablation as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) 3-10 years (mean 6 years) earlier, were examined with transvaginal ultrasound and saline sonohysterography. Endometrial samples were collected with a Pipelle device. Visualisation of endometrium, access to uterine cavity, change in cavity length, success in outpatient endometrial sampling and success in sonohysterography were evaluated.Endometrial thickness was 4.5mm in amenorrhoeic women (n=17), 5.6mm in eumenorrhoeic women (n=37) and 6.6mm in hypermenorrhoeic women (n=3). An endometrial sample was successfully taken in 44 (77%) women, and in 13 (23%) women endometrial sample taking failed. The length of the uterine cavity compared to the length measured before endometrial thermal ablation was 0.5-5 cm (mean 2 cm) shorter in 34 women, unchanged in four women and longer in five women. The uterine cavity distended regularly in only nine (16%) women. In 14 (25%) women the cavity distended irregularly or only partly, and in 24 (42%) women the uterine cavity did not distend at all, but appeared as a narrow tube. In 10 (18%) women the sonohysterography catheter did not enter the uterine cavity at all.Endometrial assessment is compromised after previous endometrial thermal ablation. Both endometrial sampling and sonohysterography fail quite often, causing problems in diagnosis of abnormal bleeding. Intrauterine adhesions may also decrease the reliability of the endometrial sampling.
