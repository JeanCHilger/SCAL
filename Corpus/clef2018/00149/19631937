Ovarian torsion in in vitro fertilization-induced twin pregnancy: combination of Doppler ultrasound and laparoscopy in diagnosis and treatment can quickly solve the case. To diagnose and treat adnexal torsion in pregnancy.Case report.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Perugia Hospital.A 38-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1 with bichorial twin pregnancy in the 10th week of gestation who was admitted for abdominal pain. She conceived after an IVF attempt. Even if symptoms compared 2 days before the admission, they aggravated just 2 hours before.An ovarian torsion was suspected, and Doppler ultrasound showed a complete absence of vascular flow. The dimension of the right ovary and the absence of ovarian blood flow were strong arguments in favor of the diagnosis of adnexal torsion, and laparoscopic ovarian adnexectomy was performed.The ovarian torsion was confirmed, and right adnexectomy was necessary.The patient had a quick convalescence and was discharged on the third postoperative day. She had no more pain. She underwent a cesarean section for placenta previa. She and her children have remained well.Considering the increased number of IVF pregnancies, an ovarian torsion should be less uncommon than in the past. Doppler ultrasound should be considered as a first-line exam. The complete absence of vascular flow in the ovary may be an indication for adnexectomy. An ovarian torsion in pregnancy should be treated laparoscopically.
