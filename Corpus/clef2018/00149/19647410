Extensive cardiac metastases secondary to uterine leiomyosarcoma. Uterine leiomyosarcoma metastatic to multiple cardiac chambers occurs infrequently. Over the past 4 decades, there have been only 11 reported cases of cardiac metastasis secondary to uterine leiomyosarcoma. Metastatic cardiac tumors are commonly diagnosed postmortem, although it may be possible to diagnose them during life. The authors report a rare case of a 48-year-old woman with uterine leiomyosarcoma who was diagnosed with extensive cardiac metastases (in the left atrium, right and left ventricles, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein). Although extensive cardiac metastases are suggestive of imminent death, aggressive treatment resulted in survival for >1 year for this patient, which underscores the importance of treatment in select patients.
