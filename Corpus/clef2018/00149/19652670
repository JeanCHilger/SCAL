The Role of 2D, 3D ultrasound and color doppler in the diagnosis of benign and malignant endometrial lesions. Forty eight female patients, 15 in the child-bearing period, 6 pre- and 27 postmenopausal, with ages ranging from 35 to 78 years, presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. They were subjected to 2D, 3D ultrasound and Doppler studies. The combined use of ultrasound and Doppler was highly suggestive in the diagnosis of 19 cases of submucous leiomyoma, 16 cases of endometrial hyperplasia, 9 cases of endometrial carcinoma and 4 cases of endometrial polyp, with overall sensitivity and specificity of 93.75 % and 81.25 % respectively. The diagnosis of 35 cases was established by D&C or hysteroscopy and biopsy. The remaining 8 cases were highly suggestive of submucous leiomyomata by ultrasound and color Doppler the patients refused invasive procedures and were followed after 6 months with no significant changes. Key Words : 2D, 3D ultrasound - Color doppler - Endometrial lesions.
