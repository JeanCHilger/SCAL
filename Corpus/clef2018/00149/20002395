Reproductive endocrinology of adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among reproductive-aged women, and it typically presents during adolescence. The objective of this review is to describe the clinical manifestations of PCOS in adolescent girls and the underlying basis for the altered reproductive physiology. Recognising adolescents at risk for PCOS and taking the appropriate steps to reduce circulating androgen levels is critical in reducing the clinical symptomatology of this disorder, and the development of adulthood infertility, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in patients with PCOS.
