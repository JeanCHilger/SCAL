Three-dimensional ultrasound in the diagnosis of MÃ¼llerian duct anomalies and concordance with magnetic resonance imaging. To demonstrate the value of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound in the diagnosis of uterine malformations and its concordance with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).This study included 286 women diagnosed with uterine malformation by 3D ultrasound, having been referred to our clinics on suspicion of uterine malformation following clinical and/or conventional two-dimensional ultrasound examination. With the exception of three with intact hymen, patients underwent both bimanual examination and speculoscopy before and/or after sonography. MRI was performed in 65 cases. We analyzed the diagnostic concordance between the techniques in the study of uterine malformations.Using 3D ultrasound we diagnosed: one case with uterine agenesis 10 with unicornuate uterus, four of which also underwent MRIThere is a high degree of concordance between 3D ultrasound and MRI in the diagnosis of uterine malformations, the relationship between cavity and fundus being visualized equally well with both techniques. 3D ultrasound should be complemented by careful gynecological exploration in order to identify any alterations in the cervix.
