Sacrococcygeal teratoma in foetus--case report. Sacrococcygeal teratoma develops from all three germinal layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm). Sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT) are the most common neoplasms in the fetus and newborns, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000. Female to male ratio is 3:1. Perinatal mortality rate among fetuses with prenatally diagnosed SCT is high, mainly due to cardiac failure. According to Polish Gynecology Society Recommendation, the main aim of intrauterine intervention or pharmacological treatment in case of prenatally diagnosed SCT is to prevent development of severe fetal cardiac failure. Fetal cardiac failure is one of the most important prognostic factors in surveillance of fetus and newborns with SCT. The following article describes a case report of a 34-year-old pregnant woman, 23 weeks of gestation, with a diagnosis of fetal sacrococcygeal teratoma. Each pregnant woman with suspicion of neoplasm in fetus should be referred to tertiary center of perinatal care to gain access to specific diagnostic methods and medical care of many specialists, such as obstetricians, neonatologists, general practitioners and infant surgeons. The role of psychological care during hospitalization is also invaluable and helps the patient to minimize the mental trauma, due to diagnosed fetal abnormalities.
