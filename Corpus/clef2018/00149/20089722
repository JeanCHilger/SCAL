Adnexal masses: US characterization and reporting. Pelvic ultrasonography (US) remains the imaging modality most frequently used to detect and characterize adnexal masses. Although evaluation is often aimed at distinguishing benign from malignant masses, the majority of adnexal masses are benign. About 90% of adnexal masses can be adequately characterized with US alone. In this article, the important US features that should allow one to make a reasonably confident diagnosis in most cases will be discussed. The role of follow-up US and alternative imaging modalities, along with the importance of careful reporting of adnexal masses, will also be reviewed.
