Prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome and related disorders in mexican women. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been found to affect 4-8% of women of reproductive age however, in Mexican-Americans a prevalence of 12.8% has been reported. This study determines the prevalence of PCOS in a sample of Mexican women.This prospective cross-sectional study included 150 female Mexican volunteers aged 20-45 years. Menstrual cycles were recorded and hirsutism was graded. Pelvic ultrasound was performed and androgen levels were measured. PCOS was diagnosed by hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia, and oligo-ovulation (NIH 1990 criteria), and also by 2 of 3 findings: oligo-ovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries (PCO) (Rotterdam 2003 criteria), excluding other disorders.Nine of the 150 women were diagnosed with PCOS, a prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 1.9-10.1%), according to NIH criteria. The ultrasound morphology added one patient to give ten PCOS patients, a prevalence of 6.6% (95% CI: 2.3-10.9%) according to Rotterdam criteria. All PCOS patients presented oligo-ovulation, 9 had hirsutism and 7 of them had acne. Eight of the 10 PCOS patients had morphologic characteristics of PCO.The prevalence of PCOS in Mexican women is approximately 6.0%, similar to other populations, but lower than 12.8% reported in Mexican-American women.
