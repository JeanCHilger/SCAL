Malignant struma ovarii: a case report. We present a case of a 40-yr-old woman diagnosed with a primary malignant struma ovarii. The patient was admitted with the complaint of pelvic pain and a large pelvic mass in the mid-portion of lower abdomen on gynecological examination. Pre-operative tumor markers and routine biochemistry were unremarkable. She was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy and right salpingo-oopherectomy. Post-operatively, she was diagnosed with a malignant struma ovarii through the usage of histopathological criteria similar to the guidelines for primary thyroid gland disease. The patient was subsequently performed left salpingo-oopherectomy and retroperitoneal pelvic lympadenectomy for re-staging. Although, left ovary and lymph nodes were histopathologically normal, she was offered thyroidectomy but she refused to accept the offer. Thyroglobulin level was monitored in the post-operative period. She is free of the disease for 18 months.
