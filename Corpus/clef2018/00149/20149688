Leiomyoma volume changes at follow-up after uterine artery embolization: correlation with the initial leiomyoma volume and location. To study the changes in uterine leiomyoma volume after uterine artery embolization (UAE) and to correlate these changes with the initial tumor volume and location within the uterus.The study was performed retrospectively on 28 consecutive patients (age, 37-57 years mean, 48 y +/- 4.81) with 84 uterine leiomyomas. UAE was performed between June 2006 and August 2007. All tumors in all patients were evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before UAE and 3 months and 1 year after UAE. The volume and location of each tumor were evaluated in consensus by two radiologists.The mean pre-UAE volume of the leiomyomas was 51.6 cm(3) (range, 0.72-371.1 cm(3) SD, 79.3). Seven tumors were submucous, 28 intramural, and 49 subserous. At 3-month follow-up, 83 tumors (98.8%) showed volume reduction (mean, 52.62% +/- 21.85%UAE results in leiomyoma volume reduction at 3-month and 1-year follow-up. The tumor location plays an important role in volume changes and the initial tumor volume plays a minor role. Further studies with larger numbers of submucous leiomyomas are needed.
