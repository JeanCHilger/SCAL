Three-dimensional computed tomography combined with hysterosalpingography is useful for both diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic diverticulum of the uterus. A woman presented with vaginal bleeding after myomectomy. Ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) combined with hysterosalpingography (HSG) revealed an iatrogenic diverticulum of the uterus. The three-dimensional CT combined with HSG images were very useful for subsequent surgery.
