Asymmetric obstructed uterus didelphys/incomplete Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome/diagnosed by transvaginal 3D ultrasound--a case report. Asymmetric obstructed uterus didelphys (Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome-HWWS) is a rare congenital MÃ¼llerian anomaly consisting of uterus didelphys, hemivaginal septum and ipsilateral renal agenesis. We present a case of an incomplete HWWS diagnosed by 3D transvaginal ultrasound in a 22 year old patient with absence of the hemivaginal septum. The most contributive diagnostic factors as well as the appropriate therapeutic management in such cases are discussed.
