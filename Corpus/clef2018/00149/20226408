Value of 3-dimensional sonohysterography for detection of intrauterine lesions in women with abnormal uterine bleeding. To compare 2-dimensional (2D) sonohysterography (SHG) and 3D-SHG with saline solution infusion vs diagnostic hysteroscopy for investigation of intrauterine lesions in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding.Comparative observational cross-sectional study (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).University hospital.Fifty perimenopausal and 20 postmenopausal women with abnormal intrauterine bleeding with clinically or ultrasonically suspected intrauterine lesions.Conventional 2D- and 3D ultrasonography and 2D- and 3D-SHG with saline solution infusion followed by diagnostic hysteroscopy, and endometrial curettage or subsequent operative treatment (e.g., hysterectomy, myomectomy, or polypectomy). Ultrasonographic and hysteroscopic findings were compared with histopathologic findings.For 2D-SHG, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, overall accuracy, likelihood ratio for a positive result, and likelihood ratio for a negative result were 79%, 72%, 89%, 54%, 76%, 2.82, and 0.29, respectively, and for 3D-SHG, were 92%, 89%, 96%, 80%, 91%, 8.36, and 0.09, respectively and for diagnostic hysteroscopy, were 94%, 89%, 96%, 84%, 93%, 8.55, and 0.07, respectively. Thus, 3D-SHG was superior to 2D SHG (p = .02) and comparable to diagnostic hysteroscopy (p = .75) for diagnosis of intrauterine lesions.3D-SHG can be used in the initial investigation of intrauterine lesions in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding before resorting to invasive procedures such as diagnostic hysteroscopy. Further studies of computer-reconstructed 3D-SHG virtual hysteroscopy are recommended.
