Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in ovarian cancer: Initial experience at 3 tesla in primary and metastatic disease. The aim of this study was to develop and demonstrate a methodology for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at 3 T in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and to report the results from pharmacokinetic modeling of the data. Nineteen patients with suspected advanced ovarian carcinoma (FIGO stage 3 or higher) were enrolled in this prospective study. Up to three marker lesions were identified: primary ovarian mass, omental ''cake'', and peritoneal deposits. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed using a three-dimensional T(1)-weighted gradient-echo acquisition with a temporal resolution of 1.6 sec, following intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol. Precontrast T(1) mapping, using an inversion-recovery fast gradient-echo sequence, was also performed. Imaging was completed in 18/19 patients, although two were subsequently excluded based on pathology results. Pharmacokinetic modeling of the data was performed according to the extended Kety model, using an arterial input function formed by concatenation of the Fritz-Hansen and Weinmann curves. No statistically significant differences were found between the results for the three marker lesions. In the future, this work will allow kinetic modeling results from ovarian dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to be correlated with response to treatment. The high temporal resolution allows good characterization of the rapid contrast agent uptake in these vascular tumors.
