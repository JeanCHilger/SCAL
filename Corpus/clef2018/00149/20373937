Evaluation of cervical involvement in endometrial cancer by transvaginal sonography, magnetic resonance imaging and frozen section. This study was undertaken to compare the diagnostic performance of transvaginal sonography (TVS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and frozen section for detection of cervical involvement in endometrial cancer. The study included 64 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer. The subjects were evaluated with TVS and MRI by two radiologists and the frozen sections by a pathologist. The diagnostic accuracies of TVS, MRI and frozen section were compared using the McNemar test. The accuracy rates of TVS, MRI and frozen section were 90.6%, 92.2% and 95.5%, respectively. There were no statistical significant differences in overall diagnostic performance for the preoperative and intraoperative assessment of cervical involvement, although frozen section seemed to be slightly superior to the imaging techniques. TVS and MRI have similar performance in determination of cervical involvement. However, although time consuming and expensive, MRI may be recommended in cases with poor quality TVS. Frozen section may be advocated where preop-tests are equivocal.
