Virtual hysterosalpingography: experience with over 1000 consecutive patients. With the advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), a whole new spectrum of diagnostic imaging techniques and procedures appears. Virtual hysterosalpingography (VHSG) is a novel non-invasive modality for assessing the uterus and female reproductive system that combines hysterosalpingography technique with MDCT technologies. Nowadays, 64-row VHSG offers an excellent diagnostic performance, in concordance with the development of new reproductive interventions and the need of accurate diagnostic procedures. In this article, we review the VHSG technique and describe normal and pathologic findings.
