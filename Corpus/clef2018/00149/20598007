Preoperative assessment of myometrial and cervical invasion in endometrial carcinoma: comparison of multi-section dynamic MR imaging using a three dimensional FLASH technique and T2-weighted MR imaging. We aimed to show the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging by comparing T2-weighted images and dynamic 3D MR images in the assessment of myometrial and cervical invasion by endometrial carcinoma.This prospective study included 53 women consecutively diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. The subjects were evaluated by TSE T2-weighted images and 3D FLASH-VIBE dynamic MR images by two radiologists with a special training in gynecology. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were calculated for each imaging modality with regard to assessment of myometrial and cervical invasion.The diagnostic accuracy of TSE T2-weighted and dynamic 3D FLASH-VIBE MR imaging for the identification of any myometrial invasion were estimated as 64% and 84%, respectively. In the differentiation of deep myometrial invasion from the superficial invasion, the diagnostic accuracy of TSE T2-weighted and dynamic 3D FLASH-VIBE MR images were 75.5%, and 88.7%, respectively. Additionally, in the determining of deep myometrial invasion the sensitivity, the specificity, PPV, and NPV were 76%, 75%, 50%, and 90.9% on T2-weighted images, respectively 100%, 85%, 68.4%, and 100% on dynamic 3D MR images, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of TSE T2-weighted and dynamic 3D FLASH-VIBE MR images for cervical invasion by endometrial carcinoma were 86%, and 92%, respectively.The multiplanar capabilities of MRI are invaluable to evaluate spreading and margins of an endometrial mass, and the 3D dynamic MR techniques offer the advantages of increased coverage and high spatial resolution. Three dimensional dynamic MR imaging may be recommended in the especially postmenopausal cases before performing potentially curative treatments.
