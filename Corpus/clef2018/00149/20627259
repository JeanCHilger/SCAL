Place of pelvic ultrasonography using transabdominal technique in the investigation of premature ovarian failure. The aim of the present study was to characterize women with premature ovarian failure (POF) by their ovarian ultrasonographic appearances using transabdominal technique to establish the relationship to clinical, hormonal status, and genetic analysis.We studied a cohort of 80 patients suffering from POF. The surface of the ovary was calculated and we identified the detection or not of follicles.The detection of the two ovaries by ultrasound was positive in 33 patients only one ovary was identified in seven patientsThe clinical and hormonal status and the genetic analysis can't predict the presence or not of follicles in the ovaries of patients with POF.
