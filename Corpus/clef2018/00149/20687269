The effect of endometrial thickness on in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcome. The value of measuring the endometrial thickness and studying the endometrial receptivity in the context of assisted conception remains a contentious issue. A prospective analysis was carried out to determine the effect of endometrial thickness on IVF - embryo transfer/ICSI outcome in dedicated Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) units in Abuja and Rivers State, Nigeria. Two hundred and fifty one patients who met the inclusion criteria were analysed. They were grouped on the basis of endometrial thickness into 3 groups <7 mm, 7 - 14 mm and >14 mm. The main outcome measure was clinical pregnancy. There were significantly more pregnancies in the 7 - 14 mm endometrial thickness group compared to the <7 mm and >14 mm groups, p=0.004 and p<0.0001 respectively. The findings suggest that following IVF/ICSI, significantly more pregnancies occurred when the endometrial thickness was between 7 and 14 mm.
