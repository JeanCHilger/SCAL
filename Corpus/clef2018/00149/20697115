Incidentally detected gallbladder polyps: is follow-up necessary?--Long-term clinical and US analysis of 346 patients. To determine the natural history of gallbladder (GB) polyps incidentally detected at ultrasonography (US) and to propose management guidelines for these lesions based on polyp size.The HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. A database search for "polyp" in all US examinations of the GB between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2001, at a single institution was performed. All subsequent US reports were reviewed to determine changes in GB polyp size. The electronic medical record was searched to obtain clinical and pathologic follow-up.Three hundred forty-six patients (mean age, 51.6 years range, 20-93 years) with GB polyps were included. There were 156 men (45%) and 190 women (55%). US follow-up (mean, 5.4 yearsThe risk of GB malignancy resulting from incidentally detected polyps is extremely low. Incidentally detected GB polyps measuring 6 mm or less may require no additional follow-up. Data are inconclusive regarding polyps 7 mm or greater, and further studies are warranted.
