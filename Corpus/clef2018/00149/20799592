Evaluation of effect of silymarin on granulosa cell apoptosis and follicular development in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. To investigate the effects of silymarin on follicular development, we enrolled 40 healthy women undergoingin vitro fertilization (IVF) due to male factor infertility in this trial. They underwent ovulation induction and on a random and blind basis, patients were assigned to receive silymarin (70 mg x 3/day) or placebo from the beginning of the induction cycle. The number and quality of oocytes retrieved were evaluated and apoptosis of > or = granolusa cells was studied. There was no significant difference between the groups for mean number of follicles 18 mm (P = 0.131), mean number of oocytes retrieved (P = 0.209) or endometrial thickness (P = 0.673). However, the proportion of total apoptosis in the study group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (P = 0.032). These data suggest that administration of silymarin in IVF patients concomitantly with gonadotropin results in reduction of granolusa cell apoptosis but does not have any effect in promotion of follicular development, oocyte retrieval or endometrial thickness.
