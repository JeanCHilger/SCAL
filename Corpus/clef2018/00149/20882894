Difficulties in the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma: case report of squamous cell ovarian carcinoma in a 26-year-old woman. A 26-year-old woman who was admitted to the Gynecology Department with abdominal pain was later diagnosed with a multi-chamber tumor in the left ovary. Neoplastic markers were within normal limits. It was proposed that the patient should be operated on in order to remove the tumor, and a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. During the intraoperative histopathological examination, the tumor was described as being benign. However, in the final histopathological examination, a malignant neoplasm, a squamous cell carcinoma (G-2) of the ovary (pT1a), was found. It was decided that a hysterectomy and a right salpingo-oophorectomy should be performed. No other neoplastic foci were found in the postoperational material. The patient is currently undergoing periodic control examinations.
