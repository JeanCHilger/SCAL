Leiomyoma of the urinary bladder: a series of nine cases and review of the literature. To present our experience with 9 cases of bladder leiomyomas and a review of the relevant published data.During a 13-year period, 9 patients were treated for bladder leiomyoma. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed, and data, including age, sex, symptoms, tumor size and location, cystoscopy results, radiologic examination findings, method of extirpation, pathology slides, and follow-up results, were analyzed.All 9 patients were women, with a mean age of 43.6 years (range 24-65). Of the 9 patients, 5 reported urinary symptoms, 1 presented with gross hematuria, and 3 were asymptomatic. The mean tumor size was 4.2 cm (range 2.4-7). The tumor size was larger in symptomatic patients than in the asymptomatic patients. All tumors were endovesical lesions 1 patient had a concomitant extravesical tumor. Transurethral resection was performed in 6 patients, partial cystectomy in 2, and enucleation in 1. Microscopically, the tumors were composed of bland, spindle-shaped cells. Recurrence developed in 2 patients. Both patients underwent repeat resection, and no additional recurrence developed.Leiomyoma of the bladder is rare and occurs predominantly in women. The size, rather than the location, of the tumor appeared to be more closely related to the occurrence of symptoms. Surgical excision is the standard approach to diagnosis and treatment.
