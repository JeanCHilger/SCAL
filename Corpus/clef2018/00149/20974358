Radiological staging of ovarian carcinoma. Ovarian cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, accounting for 4% of all female cancers. An estimated 1 in 71 women in the United States will develop ovarian cancer in their lifetime. Accurate staging of ovarian carcinoma is vital in the appropriate management and counseling of patients. The surgical staging proposed by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology is the most universally used, and International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology encourages the use of imaging techniques to assess prognostic factors, such as resectable disease and lymph node status. Identifying the volume and locations of tumor is valuable in planning percutaneous tissue biopsy, triaging patients to either primary cytoreductive surgery, or primary platinum-based chemotherapy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the modality of choice for the staging of ovarian carcinoma, with magnetic resonance imaging being used as a problem-solving tool. In this article we discuss and illustrate the staging of ovarian carcinoma, with emphasis on the current imaging modalities and optimal image acquisition.
