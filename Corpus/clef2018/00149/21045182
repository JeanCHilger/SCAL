Uterine tumors: comparison of 3D versus 2D T2-weighted turbo spin-echo MR imaging at 3.0 T--initial experience. To compare a three-dimensional (3D) T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) magnetic resonance (MR) sequence (VISTA Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a two-dimensional (2D) T2-weighted TSE sequence in terms of image quality, signal intensity (SI) difference ratios, conspicuity, and staging of uterine tumors.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Sixty-one women (mean age, 53.0 years Â± 13.7 [standard deviation] range, 30-87 years) with cervical carcinoma (n = 28), endometrial carcinoma (n = 21), or leiomyoma (n = 30) of the uterus were included. Patients underwent T2-weighted MR imaging at 3 T with both 1-mm-thick 3D and 5-mm-thick 2D T2-weighted TSE sequences. Three-dimensional T2-weighted TSE images were reconstructed at 5-mm thickness with the aid of a workstation. Quantitative analyses of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and SI difference ratios between tumors and other tissues and qualitative analyses of image quality and tissue conspicuity were performed. Two radiologists independently assessed local-regional staging for carcinomas. Quantitative values, qualitative scores, and tumor staging were analyzed by using the paired t test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and McNemar test, respectively.Mean myometrial SNR was higher on 3D than 2D images (14.3 vs 9.8 P < .0001). Mean SI difference ratios between cervical (0.45 vs 0.34The 3D T2-weighted TSE sequence showed certain advantages over the 2D T2-weighted TSE sequence, and it has the potential to improve the performance of MR imaging for the evaluation of uterine carcinoma.
