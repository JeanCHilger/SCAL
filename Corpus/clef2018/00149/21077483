Three-dimensional power Doppler color ultrasonographic features of a minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. A case of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the cervix in a 34-year-old female is presented. The ultrasonographic and three-dimensional power Doppler color studies revealed a nodular cervical lesion with vascularization more prominent in the center of the nodule but also present at the periphery. The imaging diagnosis was suggestive of a myoma but with more vascularization than a conventional one.
