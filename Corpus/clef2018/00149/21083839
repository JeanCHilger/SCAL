Role of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry indices and plasma adrenomedullin level in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. To evaluate uterine artery Doppler flow resistance and plasma adrenomedullin levels in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) compared to controls.Eighty-three women, who attend the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Benha University, Egypt, participated in this study (RPL group: n=40, and control group: n=43). Uterine artery Doppler and plasma adrenomedullin (AM) (pg/mL) levels were measured for all women in the mid-luteal phase of a non-pregnant cycle.Both uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) and AM levels were significantly higher in RPL group compared to controls (2.71 ± 0.259 vs 2.06 ± 0.194 for PI and 287.5 ± 80.4 pg/mL vs 156.1 ± 39.8 pg/mL for AM, P<0.01). Uterine artery PI had a significant positive correlation with plasma AM levels both in the RPL group (r=0.645, P<0.001) and in the control group (r=0.384, P=0.011). Number of previous miscarriages in RPL group was significantly correlated with both uterine artery PI (r=0.838, P=0.015) and plasma AM levels (r=0.509, P=0.001).Uterine artery PI may be useful in identifying women with unexplained RPL who have impaired uterine circulation. Plasma AM may serve as a biochemical marker for RPL caused by impaired uterine perfusion.
