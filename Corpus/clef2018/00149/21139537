Capsule endoscopy of the small bowel in the clinical practice: outpatient management is feasible and cheaper. Four Italian regions have cost coding for outpatient capsule-endoscopy. Elsewhere it is performed in ordinary hospital admission. To identify, in a cohort of patients of a Gastroenterology Unit, those feasible for outpatient versus inpatient treatment to analyze costs distribution in both management areas.We retrospectively analysed 100 clinical records of admissions to A.O. San-Carlo-Borromeo, Milan between 2005-2008. Hospitalization criteria (at least 3): 1) occult/obscure gastrointestinal bleeding 2) hemoglobin â‰¤ 8 gr/dLA total of 62 patients had urgent admission, 60 blood transfusions, 81 underwent EGD and colonoscopy, 8 enteroscopy and 5 surgery. Mean haemoglobin value was 8.67 g/dL. Capsule-endoscopy was positive in 70, uncertain in 8, negative in 22. Positive cases: 33 angiodyplasia, 18 ulcers/erosions, 13 polyps/masses, 5 overt bleeding, 1 celiac disease. 47/100 were appropriate as outpatient, saving 432 days of hospital stays. Admission coding was grouped into 7 DRGs (overall expense: 98,366 Euros). Considering EGD/colonoscopy outpatient costs and 1.100 euros as estimated value for capsule-endoscopy, the total expense could be 53.919.Outpatient capsule-endoscopy small bowel examination is feasible in half of the cases. It is cost saving, (about 45.000 Euros/100 patients), reducing inappropriate hospital stays.
