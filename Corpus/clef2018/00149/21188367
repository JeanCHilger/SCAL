Fetal demise secondary to massive rhabdomyoma in the early second trimester of pregnancy. Rhabdomyoma is the most common cardiac tumor in fetuses, often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex and usually diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy, with a benign course in the majority of cases. The hemodynamic impact of cardiac tumor depends on the location and size of the mass and the presence of dysrhythmia (4). Fetal cardiac rhabdomyoma accounts for less than 10% of fetal demise cases (1). This report presents a case of massive cardiac rhabdomyoma filling the entire right heart with pericardial extension, leading to hydrops and subsequent fetal death in the early second trimester of pregnancy.
