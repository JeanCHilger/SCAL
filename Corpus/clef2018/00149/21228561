Role of pelvic ultrasound in girls with precocious puberty. Pelvic ultrasound evaluation of girls presenting with secondary sex characteristics before the age of 8 years may help to differentiate precocious puberty from premature thelarche, functioning ovarian cyst, and obesity. However, although uterine and ovarian measurements are significantly higher in girls with true precocious puberty than controls, there is a significant overlap of normal prepubertal and early pubertal values. In girls with precocious puberty treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue, ultrasound is a valid tool for monitoring ovarian suppression.
