Torsion of a tumor within an accessory ovary. An accessory ovary is a rare congenital anomaly of the female reproductive tract. This report illustrates a case of a cyst arising from an accessory ovary complicated by torsion.A 39-year-old nulliparous woman presented with lower abdominal pain and was found on physical examination to have an 8-cm mass anterior to the uterus. Ultrasonography of the pelvis showed a 9.3Ã—6.7 cm cystic lesion with a solid component anterior to the uterus suggestive of a left ovarian cyst. Laparoscopy was performed for presumed ovarian torsion. Torsion of a tumor arising from an accessory ovary was found intraoperatively.Patients suspected to have ovarian torsion should have emergency surgery for diagnosis and attempted ovarian preservation. Physicians should consider complications of paraovarian anomalies in the differential diagnosis.
