Incidental diagnosis of appendiceal mucocele with vaginal ultrasonography and computed tomography. Appendiceal mucocele is an uncommon entity that may be encountered at the time of abdominal surgery performed for an unrelated indication. The diagnosis may be suggested by imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Whereas early resection is curative, failure to recognize the disorder may lead to rupture and the devastating consequences of pseudomyxoma peritonei.Following an annual gynecologic checkup in a healthy 63-year-old woman, vaginal ultrasonography along with a subsequent computed tomographic study raised the possibility that an incidental appendiceal mucocele was present. At laparoscopy, this diagnosis was confirmed and the lesion was resected using minimally invasive techniques.Early diagnosis and treatment of appendiceal mucocele facilitates the successful management of this rare disorder.
