Ultrasound diagnosis and comprehensive surgical treatment of complete non-puerperal uterine inversion. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of very rare case of complete non-puerperal uterine inversion secondary to a large sub-mucous fibroid.A 50-year-old woman was admitted with heavy vaginal bleeding. Detailed vaginal and abdominal ultrasound, using color Doppler flow, raised the suspicion of complete uterine inversion. The distal ends of the fallopian tubes and part of the ovaries were demonstrated adherent to the uterine fundus. Laparoscopy showed there was no uterus inside the abdomen because of complete uterine inversion. Only a dimple with a constriction ring was found at the site of the uterus. A sub-mucous 6 cm fibroid was attached to the fundus, and vaginal myomectomy was performed to reduce uterine size in order to restore the uterus to its abdominal position. However, the uterus was impacted and only cutting longitudinally the anterior and posterior fornices helped to restore the uterus and facilitate an abdominal hysterectomy. Histological examination of the uterus and fibroid following hysterectomy confirmed their benign nature.Ultrasonographic diagnosis of complete uterine inversion is feasible. However, high index of suspicion is necessary.
