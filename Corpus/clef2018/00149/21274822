Validation and psychometric properties of the State Impulsivity Scale (SIS). Impulsivity is a complex phenomenon that can be evaluated from a trait or state perspective. Impulsive trait is a predisposition relatively stable over time, but not always perceptible by behavior. However, the impulsivity state covers transient variations on impulsivity levels that are dependent on environmental or biologic conditions.This study has aimed to validate a scale to assess impulsivity as a state in a Spanish sample.State Impulsivity Scale (SIS) was designed based on three experimental models: Reward, Automatism and Attentional. All the items in the SIS explore the presence and frequency of impulsive behaviors. Statistical analyses of reliability and validity were done. Convergent validity was examined by means of correlations among SIS and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Sensitivity to the punishment and sensitivity to the reward questionnaire (SPSRQ) and Sensations Seeking Scale type V (SSS).We used a Spanish sample of 70 patients who had at least one diagnosis of Impulse Control Disorder (IP), 73 psychiatric patients without impulsive disorders (NIP) and 150 control subjects (CS). The values obtained reveal the high reliability of the SIS (Cronbach's alpha coefficients 0.884), factor analysis confirmed the theoretical three-dimensional structure and convergent validity was excellent. SIS also demonstrated its capacity for discrimination among IP group and NIP and CS groups.SIS is a new impulsive behavior assessment instrument validated in Spanish population. The results obtained indicate adequate psychometric properties for its use in the clinical and research fields. Key Words: State Impulsivity, Trait, Evaluation, Scale.
