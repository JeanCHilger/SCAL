High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of abnormal vaginal bleeding secondary to uterine myoma. We describe the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound for acute vaginal bleeding secondary to uterine myoma in 2 young female patients. Both patients had episodes of abnormal vaginal bleeding with severe dysmenorrhea that was not efficiently controlled by medical treatment. After high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, both vaginal bleeding control and symptom relief were achieved without postinterventional complications. The patients remained free of symptoms during 2 months of follow-up and regained normal menstruation after high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy. High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment is one of the least invasive options for dysfunctional vaginal bleeding and may be an effective and safe alternative to other procedures in women of reproductive age with abnormal vaginal bleeding secondary to uterine myoma.
