A proposal for a new scoring system to evaluate pelvic masses: Pelvic Masses Score (PMS). Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death among neoplastic diseases in women. In spite of constant improvement in surgical, chemotherapeutic and immunologic techniques, which can induce long remission periods, the five-year survival rate has not really changed over the past thirty years. We tried to create a sonographic scoring system, called PMS, that could be helpful in diagnosis of pelvic masses.The three most commonly used and validated indexes--Sassone score, Ovarian Tumor Index (OTI), and Risk of Malignancy Index 3 (RMI3)--were applied to a population of 102 women with adnexal masses. We developed a new scoring system, named Pelvic Masses Score (PMS), that takes into account the ultrasound morphological pattern, the Doppler flowmetry of the pelvic mass, the CA125 serum level and the menopausal status. We then applied this scoring system to a population of 160 women for validation of the score.Statistical analysis of the data obtained from the new scoring system reveals that sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) are higher than in the case of data separately derived from the Sassone score, OTI index or RMI index.Our preliminary data showed good results in term of sensitivity, specify and predictive values compared to other old scoring systems. A larger prospective study is required to confirm these preliminary data. The number of cases will be expanded to permit a better evaluation of PMS.
