Deliberate posterior low transverse incision at cesarean section of a gravid uterus in 180 degrees of torsion: a case report. Torsion of the term gravid uterus is a rare, potentially serious, unexpected obstetric pathology and is almost always diagnosed at cesarean section. We report a case of deliberate posterior low transverse segment hysterotomy in irreducible uterine torsion at 41 weeks' gestation,A 29-year-old nullipara with a 15-cm uterine fibroid was admitted at 41 weeks' gestation with regular uterine contractions. Cesarean delivery was carried out for obstructed labor. Intraoperatively, 1800 levotorsion of the uterus was diagnosed. Following unsuccessful attempts at detorsioning the uterus, a posterior low transverse hysterotomy was performed for delivery.Delivery by a posterior low transverse hysterotomy may be feasible in uterine torsion after unsuccessful attempts at detorsioning the uterus during cesarean section at term.
