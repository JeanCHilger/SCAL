Prognostic value of total testosterone for pregnancy during treatment in patients with clomiphene-citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome: a pilot study. Reduction of serum total testosterone (TT) is associated with pregnancy rate in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women receiving metformin, but most of the studies focus on the changes of basal levels of TT. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the TT level around the ovulation period is related to the outcome of pregnancy in women with PCOS.In total, 30 non-obese PCOS women with clomiphene citrate (CC) resistance from the Medical College's Reproductive Health Center were enrolled and randomly assigned to be treated with placebo (Group 1) or metformin (850 mg) (Group 2) twice daily for 3 months as the pre-treatment. Then, metformin alone was administered with CC, human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to induce ovulation for 3 months in Group 1. In Group 2, CC/HMG/HCG was used to induce ovulation for 3 months without metformin. Follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and TT levels before and after ovulation in pregnant cycles and non-pregnant cycles were evaluated over the course of treatment.A total of 26 subjects completed 65 cycles. The TT levels after ovulation in the pregnant cycles were significantly lower than in the non-pregnant cycles in both groups (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively).The level of TT after ovulation may be of prognostic value for pregnancy in non-obese women with PCOS and CC resistance during treatment.
