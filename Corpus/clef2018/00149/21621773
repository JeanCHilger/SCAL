Ultrasound ovarian assessments after endometrioma ablation using plasma energy. We performed a retrospective three-dimensional ultrasound evaluation of the ovarian features in ten women with no previous ovarian surgery who benefited from ablation by plasma energy for unilateral endometriomas greater than to 30 mm in diameter. Values of ovarian volume and antral follicle count in operated ovaries were decreased by an average 12% and 18%, respectively, suggesting that endometrioma ablation using plasma energy spares the underlying ovarian parenchyma.
