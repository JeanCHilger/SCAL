Imaging features of benign solid testicular and paratesticular lesions. The presence of an intratesticular solid lesion is usually highly suspicious for malignancy. Conversely, most extratesticular solid lesions including paratesticular lesions are benign. The characteristic imaging features of malignant solid testicular lesions are well known, but various unusual causes and imaging features of benign solid testicular lesions can be particularly misleading. Therefore, a careful assessment of solid testicular and paratesticular lesions is warranted. The purpose of this article is to present the clinical and imaging features of the spectrum of benign solid testicular and paratesticular lesions.We demonstrate a variety of benign solid testicular and paratesticular lesions and correlate them with pathologic results.Specific the clinical and imaging features of the spectrum of benign solid testicular and paratesticular lesions have been described.Familiarity with the clinical setting and imaging features of benign solid testicular and paratesticular lesions should facilitate prompt, accurate diagnosis and treatment.
