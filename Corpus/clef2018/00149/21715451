IVF and endometriosis-related symptom progression: insights from a prospective study. A possible and neglected concern in women with endometriosis undergoing IVF is the potential risk of progression of the disease. We set up a prospective study mainly aimed at evaluating the impact of IVF on endometriosis-related symptoms.Women with surgical or echographic diagnosis of endometriosis and selected for IVF were included. In the month preceding the IVF attempt and at a second evaluation 3-6 months after the cycle, women who did not get pregnant underwent clinical assessment and transvaginal ultrasonography. Each patient was requested to complete a questionnaire on the presence, severity and modifications of endometriosis-related symptoms before and after the IVF cycle.Overall, 64 patients completed the study protocol. The Biberoglu-Behrman Scores and the Verbal Rate Scales for dysmenorrhea, dispareunia and chronic pelvic pain did not worsen after the procedure. Other endometriosis-related symptoms also did not change. There was no modification in size and number of endometriomas and deep peritoneal nodules. The number (%) of women reporting general improvement and worsening were 14 (22%) and 7 (11%), respectively.IVF does not expose women to a consistent risk of endometriosis-related symptoms progression.
