Perineal endometriosis with anal external sphincter involvement: a case-report. The presence of perianal endometriosis involving the anal sphincter is a rare presentation of this disease, most cases are diagnosed late and few are reported in the literature despite the number of episiotomies performed today. We present a case in a female with perianal symptoms after an episiotomy 15 years ago and visualized by endoanal ultrasound. We also review the literature of this condition. The treatment of choice is wide excision of the lesion involving the anal sphincter so the sphincter defect should be repaired by sphincteroplasty. According to the literature, early diagnosis by clinical suspicion and confirmation by endoanal ultrasound, with wide excision of endometrioma gives satisfactory results regarding anal continence.
