Volumetric feedback ablation of uterine fibroids using magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound therapy. The purpose of this prospective multicenter study was to assess the safety and technical feasibility of volumetric Magnetic Resonance-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablation for treatment of patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids.Thirty-three patients with 36 fibroids were treated with volumetric MR-HIFU ablation. Treatment capability and technical feasibility were assessed by comparison of the Non-Perfused Volumes (NPVs) with MR thermal dose predicted treatment volumes. Safety was determined by evaluation of complications or adverse events and unintended lesions. Secondary endpoints were pain and discomfort scores, recovery time and length of hospital stay.The mean NPV calculated as a percentage of the total fibroid volume was 21.7%. Correlation between the predicted treatment volumes and NPVs was found to be very strong, with a correlation coefficient r of 0.87. All patients tolerated the treatment well and were treated on an outpatient basis. No serious adverse events were reported and recovery time to normal activities was 2.3 ± 1.8 days.This prospective multicenter study proved that volumetric MR-HIFU is safe and technically feasible for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.• Magnetic-resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound allows non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids. • Volumetric feedback ablation is a novel technology that allows larger treatment volumes • MR-guided ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids appears safe using volumetric feedback.
