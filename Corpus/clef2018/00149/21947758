In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer outcomes in relation to myometrial thickness. To evaluate the effects of myometrial thickening on the outcomes of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET).Four hundred thirteen patients, a total of 551 IVF-ET cycles, were divided into group A (<2.00 cm), group B (2.00-2.49 cm), and group C (â‰¥2.50 cm) based on myometrial thickness.The implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates were significantly lower in group C. The abortion rates were significantly higher in group C. Among patients in group B, cases with other sonographic findings suggestive of adenomyosis, such as myometrial striations, heterogeneous myometrium, myometrial cysts, and poor definition of the endometrial-myometrial junction showed lower implantation, clinical pregnancy, live birth rates, and higher abortion rates.Myometrial thickening of more than 2.50 cm on TVUS exerts overall adverse effects on IVF-ET outcomes. Even with mild thickening (2.00-2.49 cm), the presence of sonographic findings suggestive of adenomyosis is associated with adverse outcomes of IVF-ET.
