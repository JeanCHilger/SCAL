A virtual visualization system for colon polyp inspection. The virtual colonoscopy, virtual flattening and virtual splitting method are enhanced by the GPGPU model. The novel virtual eversion method is integrated for fast polyp detection. The experimental result showed that the system and various visualization methods can represent the colon inner-surface clearly and exactly, supporting real-time man-machine interaction. The proposed system is promising in human gastrointestinal cancer and polyp inspection.
