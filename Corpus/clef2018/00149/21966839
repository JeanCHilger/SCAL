Resistant ovary syndrome. Case report. Patients with primary amenorrhea, sexual infantilism and elevated pituitary gonadotropins are frequently diagnosed with hypogonadism hypergonadotropic and suspected ovarian failure, secondary to a chromosomal abnormality, intrinsic ovarian failure or altered receptors for gonadotropins, mainly FSH (ovarian resistance). We report the case of a 16-year-old, admitted to the endocrinology clinic for primary amenorrhea and lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics. A complete physical examination revealed: height of 1.58 m and 57 kg weight, with incipient breasts (Tanner I), sparse pubic and axillary hair (Tanner I). The ultrasound reported small uterus and ovaries. Laboratory studies reported high levels of FSH and LH, estradiol and testosterone levels before puberty, prolactin, TSH, T3 and T4 normal. Normal female karyotype. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which showed two ovarian slips biopsy was taken and reported both abundant primordial follicles and spindle cell stroma without evidence of primary and antral follicles, which integrates the diagnosis of resistant ovary syndrome.
