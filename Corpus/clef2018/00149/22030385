Unscheduled bleeding in continuous combined hormone therapy users. Continuous combined hormone therapy (HT) is effective for menopausal vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness but commonly leads to unscheduled vaginal bleeding and spotting. Unscheduled bleeding is disliked by women and may lead to invasive investigations to exclude underlying pelvic pathology. In most cases investigations do not reveal any underlying cause for the bleeding.
