Delayed treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from struma ovarii in a patient with history of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: a case report. We present a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from struma ovarii treated erroneously as ovarian adenocarcinoma for more than 3 years.We report clinical, surgical, laboratory, and imaging findings of the study patient and review the relevant literature.A 64-year-old woman was treated for ovarian adenocarcinoma for more than 3 years before it was determined that she likely had papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from struma ovarii. This is the first reported case of thyroid carcinoma arising from struma ovarii in a patient with a history of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Possible etiologies include residual ovarian tissue after oophorectomy, ectopic thyroid, or metastatic thyroid cancer.It is important to include struma ovarii and thyroid carcinoma arising from struma ovarii in the differential diagnosis, even with a history of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This case emphasizes the importance of effective communication among the pathologist, oncologist, and surgeon to ensure timely initiation of appropriate therapy and reduced patient morbidity.
