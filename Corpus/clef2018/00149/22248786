Testicular adrenal rest tumours in boys with congenital adrenal hyperplasia: case report and literature review. Nodular testicular lesions derived from adrenal tissue (testicular adrenal rest tumours - TART) in boys and men with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) lead to testicular structure damage, spermatogenesis disorders, and infertility. Hyperplasia of the ectopic adrenal tissue in testes is associated with high levels of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in blood serum. The development of non-invasive methods of diagnostic imaging allows detection of testicular lesions in adolescents and children. The basic method for TART detection is imaging with ultrasonography (USG) being the most widely available method. Since these mild testicular lesions can cause impaired fertility, periodic palpation and testicular ultrasonography should be performed in patients with CAH in order to prevent infertility.
