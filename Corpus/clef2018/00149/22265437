American Brachytherapy Society consensus guidelines for locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix. Part II: high-dose-rate brachytherapy. This report presents an update to the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy guidelines for locally advanced cervical cancer.Members of the ABS with expertise in cervical cancer formulated updated guidelines for HDR brachytherapy using tandem and ring, ovoids, cylinder, or interstitial applicators for locally advanced cervical cancer. These guidelines were written based on medical evidence in the literature and input of clinical experts in gynecologic brachytherapy.The ABS affirms the essential curative role of tandem-based brachytherapy in the management of locally advanced cervical cancer. Proper applicator selection, insertion, and imaging are fundamental aspects of the procedure. Three-dimensional imaging with magnetic resonance or computed tomography or radiographic imaging may be used for treatment planning. Dosimetry must be performed after each insertion before treatment delivery. Applicator placement, dose specification, and dose fractionation must be documented, quality assurance measures must be performed, and followup information must be obtained. A variety of dose/fractionation schedules and methods for integrating brachytherapy with external-beam radiation exist. The recommended tumor dose in 2-Gray (Gy) per fraction radiobiologic equivalence (normalized therapy dose) is 80-90Gy, depending on tumor size at the time of brachytherapy. Dose limits for normal tissues are discussed.These guidelines update those of 2000 and provide a comprehensive description of HDR cervical cancer brachytherapy in 2011.
