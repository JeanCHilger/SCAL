A case of a naturally conceived pregnancy associated with multiple ovarian cysts in a patient with severe untreated primary hypothyroidism. There are few reports of multiple ovarian cysts secondary to hypothyroidism, and multiple ovarian cysts associated with pregnancy most commonly occur in association with assisted reproductive technologies. Herein, we report a case of a naturally conceived pregnancy occurring 2 years after stopping treatment for primary hypothyroidism. The patient developed multiple ovarian cysts in the first trimester, and laboratory studies and ultrasonography were consistent with hypothyroidism. Herein, we present the case and discuss the importance of prenatal screening for hypothyroidism.
