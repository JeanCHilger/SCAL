Fibroma of the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath. Fibroma of tendon sheath is a rare benign tumor that usually occurs in upper extremities. It is mostly asymptomatic and grows slowly within the tendons or tendon sheaths. Histopathologic findings show well-demarcated nodules consisting of haphazardly arranged fibroblast-like spindle cells, which are embedded in a dense, collagenous matrix. We present a patient with fibroma of the tendon sheath on the flexor hallucis longus tendon, which was in an unusual location and has never been reported. The lesion was completely excised and showed no evidence of recurrence after 2 years of follow-up.
