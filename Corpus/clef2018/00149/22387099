Cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: characteristic histologic feature of adenomatous polyposis. A case report. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis and diagnosed with cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Neck ultrasound and computed tomography identified multiple nodules in the thyroid gland and neck lymph nodes. The cytological analysis was compatible with the diagnosis of papillary cancer of the thyroid. Total thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. The histological analysis established the diagnosis of cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Despite preoperative findings suggesting an aggressive form of thyroid cancer with lymph node involvement, the final diagnosis was a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma often associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and known to have a good prognosis.
