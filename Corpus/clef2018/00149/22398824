Utility of preoperative endometrial assessment in asymptomatic women undergoing hysterectomy for pelvic floor dysfunction. Uterine morcellation during laparoscopy for pelvic floor repair has prompted adoption of uterine screening tests by some surgeons. We report a case series of uterine malignancy incidentally diagnosed at the time of pelvic floor surgery.We reviewed records from patients undergoing hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and/or urinary incontinence (UI) from January 2004 to December 2009 and abstracted preoperative screening trends and final pathologic diagnoses.Of the 708 women in the study, 125 (18%) had preoperative endometrial biopsy (EB), 43 (6%) had pelvic ultrasound (US), and 21 (3%) had EB and US. Surgical route included vaginal (58%), abdominal (23%), and laparoscopic (18%). Most (97.1%) final pathologic diagnoses were benign. Five cancers (0.6%) were detected four of these women had normal preoperative screening, including EB (2), US (1), or both tests (1).Screening with EB + US was found to be ineffective in our cohort of patients due to the low prevalence of undetected uterine cancer in asymptomatic women planning POP/UI surgery.
