Endovascular treatment in postpartum haemorrhage. Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the main causes of maternal mortality and occurs in 5% of total deliveries. In this study we consider the indications for and technique and results of endovascular treatment for this serious event.Between January 2004 and December 2010, we conducted a nonrandomised prospective study on ten women with severe PPH who were treated endovascularly in an emergency setting. The procedure was considered to be clinically successful when the PPH resolved completely without the need for further surgical intervention. Laboratory values and the number of transfused blood packs were assessed for each patient.The endovascular procedure completely stopped the bleeding in 8/10 women. After embolisation, the remaining two patients underwent a second laparotomy, which completely arrested the bleeding. No patient died as a result of PPH, and no patient with PPH who avoided hysterectomy before endovascular treatment underwent it after the procedure.In keeping with the literature, our study indicates that endovascular therapy can significantly help reduce the rates of hysterectomy and mortality due to PPH. This treatment, when performed in the angiography room, is safe and effective and is probably relatively uncommon and underused.
