Comparison of risk of malignancy indices RMI 1-4 in borderline ovarian tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic values of the risk of malignancy index (RMI)/1-4 in patients with borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs).The study consisted of 50 patients with BOT diagnosed and treated between 2005-2010 and 50 patients with benign adnexal massses between 2009-2010 as a control comparison group in the retropsective study. Preoperative serum CA125, U score, tumor size (S), and menopausal status were recorded. The RMI 1-3 was calculated according to the formula UxMxCA125 and RMI4 formulation wasThe mean age, median value of CA125, ultrasound score, menopausal status, median values of RMI 1-4 of BOTs were statistically higher than benign adnexal masses. The sensitivity of RMI 1-4 was 26, 36, 62, and 60% at cutoff 200 level, respectively. The areas under curve of RMI 1-4 were found to be 0.676, 0.665, 0.668 and 0.734, respectively. DA of RMI 1-4 was found to be 56, 59, 50, and 71, respectively. When RMI 1-4 indices were compared with each other RMI 4 was the best RMI for BOTs.RMI 4 was the best predictive RMI for preoperative discrimination of BOT at a cutoff level of 200.
