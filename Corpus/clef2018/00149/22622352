Planned caesarean in the interventional radiology cath lab to enable immediate uterine artery embolization for the conservative treatment of placenta accreta. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of routine uterine artery embolization (UAE) immediately after planned caesareans performed in the cath lab for conservative treatment of placenta accreta.A retrospective study included all patients who had a planned caesarean in the cath lab for conservative treatment of placenta accreta at Angers University Hospital, which is a tertiary care centre, from April 2001 to September 2010. Twelve patients underwent UAE immediately after caesarean with the placenta left partially or totally in situ. The success rate of embolization, blood loss, and complications were reported.Diagnosis of abnormal placentation was confirmed by caesarean findings in 14 cases. Four patients had a percreta form with bladder invasion. In seven cases blood loss was insignificant and UAE was prophylactic no secondary haemorrhage was observed in this group. Postpartum haemorrhage occurred in five cases: control of immediate postpartum bleeding by embolization was successful in three and failed in two leading to hysterectomy. In one case uterine necrosis occurred 6 weeks after embolization, requiring a hysterectomy. Delayed complications resulted in hysterectomy and partial bladder resection 3 months after delivery for one of the patients with placenta percreta.UAE immediately after a caesarean performed in the cath lab is a feasible therapeutic option for conservative treatment of placenta accreta. Advantages include reducing stress and risks associated with transferring women with potentially unstable haemodynamics.
