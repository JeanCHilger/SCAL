Uterine pseudoaneurysm leakage may cause delayed postpartum haemorrhage: multidetector CT with angiography and transcatheter uterine arterial embolisation. The aim of this retrospective case study was to evaluate the role of transcatheter arterial embolisation in the management of delayed postpartum haemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm leakage, and present the angiographic findings with multidetector computed tomography (CT) along angiography as a diagnostic tool. Delayed postpartum haemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm leakage was diagnosed in eight patients at our institution between October 2006 and June 2010. The mean patient age was 31.0 years and the mean parity, 2.0. Bilateral uterine arterial embolisation was performed in all patients. No additional embolisation sessions or hysterectomies were performed. Multidetector computed tomography with angiography helped to demonstrate the location and originating vessels of the pseudoaneurysm via fast and clear 3D images. Transcatheter uterine arterial embolisation is an option in haemodynamically stable patients, and it appears to be the treatment of choice.
