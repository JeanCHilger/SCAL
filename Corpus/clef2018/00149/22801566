Gonadotroph pituitary macroadenoma inducing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: successful response to octreotide therapy. We report a young woman with spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), headaches, visual field defect and pituitary macroadenoma. She underwent transsphenoidal surgery with remission of OHSS. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for β-FSH and β-LH. Recurrence occurred after four years. The patient was treated with octreotide administration and conventional radiation therapy. Octreotide was effective in normalizing estradiol levels and resolving OHSS. This is a rare description of octreotide administration as an effective treatment modality of OHSS caused by gonadotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas.
