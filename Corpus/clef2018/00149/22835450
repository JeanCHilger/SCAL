Opposing effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and free testosterone on metabolic phenotype in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. To study the association of adrenal and ovarian androgen levels with metabolic parameters in a large cohort of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Cross-sectional study.Outpatient clinic of an academic hospital.Six hundred twenty-two women with PCOS.None.Analysis of the association of endocrine dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and free testosterone (FT) parameters with metabolic measurements.In multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) for insulin resistance was statistically significantly higher (4.42, range: 2.26-8.67) for women with PCOS who had elevated FT levels compared with the women with normal DHEAS and FT levels (reference group). We found no statistically significant differences when women with PCOS with elevated DHEAS or a combined elevation of DHEAS and FT levels were compared with the reference group. Women with PCOS and a high DHEAS/FT ratio had a more beneficial metabolic profile compared with the women with a low DHEAS/FT ratio. In multivariate adjusted binary logistic regression analyses, we found a statistically significantly lower risk for insulin resistance in the women with PCOS in the highest DHEAS/FT-ratio quartile compared with women with PCOS in the lowest quartile (OR 0.35, range: 0.14-0.89).Our results suggest that the distinction between adrenal and ovarian hyperandrogenism is important when evaluating metabolic risk in PCOS.
