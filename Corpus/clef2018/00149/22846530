Ovarian masses in adolescent girls. Ovarian masses are the most frequent gynecological pathology seen in adolescent girls. Functional or organic tumors of the ovary are usually benign and the incidence rises with age. Most cysts are functional and adnexal torsion is the main complication, but a malignant etiology must nevertheless always be eliminated. The clinical presentation is quite variable. Ultrasonography is the investigation of choice: the sonogram will reveal a strictly fluid, benign functional cyst, suggest an adnexal torsion, and provide evidence of a heterogeneous mass. Emergency surgery is indicated only in the case of suspected ovarian torsion, in order to perform detorsion. In all other cases, serum tumor marker measurements will orient the diagnosis and MRI is an essential complement to imaging of tumors with heterogeneous solid components. Surgery and histopathological examination then determine the stage and the benign or malignant nature of the mass. Ovarian tumors are classified by the World Health Organization based on the cell of origin into epithelial tumors, germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors. Surgery should always follow oncological standards and be as conservative as possible to preserve future fertility.
