Ultrasound-assisted endocavitary HDR-Ir(192) brachytherapy for unresectable locally advanced uterine cervix carcinoma: retrospective analysis focusing the efficacy and tolerability. To evaluate the impact of uterine cavity's ultrasound to final selected length of intracavitary tandem. The efficacy and tolerability of external beam radiation plus HDR-Ir(192) brachytherapy in our cohort of patients were also estimated.48 women with locally advanced unresectable uterine cervix carcinoma were treated by HDR-Ir(192) endocavitary brachytherapy between January 2007 and January 2009. The median age was 63 (range 38-74). The distribution according to Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was as follows: Stage IIB, 54.16 % IIIA, 10.4 %The complete remission rate after radiotherapy was 93.75 % (45/48). The 5-year actuarial major complication rates (Grade 3 or above) were 6.3 % overall (2.1 % proctitis, 2.1 % cystitis and 2.1 % enteritis). Estimation of the length of uterine cavity by ultrasound helped decisively in the proper placement of the intrauterine tandem inserted.Prior knowledge of the length of uterine cavity can facilitate the decisions regarding the proper insertion length of the tandem. Results of cervical cancer treatment with external beam radiation and HDR intracavitary brachytherapy in our hospital are encouraging.
