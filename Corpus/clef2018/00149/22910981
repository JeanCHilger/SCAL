Bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of uterine rupture following surgical abortion. Reports of uterine rupture following surgical abortion are rare but may result in hemorrhage, sepsis, and even death. In this unique case, we describe how a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound performed at the bedside by an emergency department physician identified uterine rupture with retained products of conception and led to an emergent laparotomy and hysterectomy. This case illustrates how bedside ultrasound may be used in patients presenting with abdominopelvic pain following surgical abortion to shorten the time to definitive treatment and ultimately lower the morbidity and mortality associated with a diagnosis of life-threatening uterine rupture.
