A feasibility study of unidirectional 240°-angle 3D CT colonography. In three-dimensional (3D) CT colonography (CTC), a wider viewing angle provides a larger field of view. The purpose of this study was to investigate the polyp detection rate and time efficiency of unidirectional 240°-angle 3D CTC compared with bidirectional 120°-angle CTC. CTC data sets of 40 patients were reviewed by two readers using the two methods. The unidirectional 240°-angle CTC showed a performance in polyp detection similar to the bidirectional 120°-angle CTC with improved time efficiency.
