The value of FDG-PET/CT in the post-treatment evaluation of endometrial carcinoma: a comparison of PET/CT findings with conventional imaging and CA 125 as a tumour marker. This retrospective study was designed to assess the value of positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging (PET/CT) in the post-treatment evaluation of the patients with endometrial carcinoma and to compare PET/CT scan with conventional imaging (CI) including computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CA 125 with both 20U/ml and 35U/ml cut-off values.A total of 31 patients who were treated for histopathologically proven endometrial adenocarcinoma, underwent PET/CT examination for restaging and suspected recurrence. Thirty five PET/CT studies were performed in 31 patients. Lesion status was determined on the basis of clinical follow-up including radiological imaging (follow-up CT scan) at least 6 months and response to therapy.Of the 35 PET/CT studies, 13 (37%) studies were positive, whereas 22 (63%) of them were negative. On study-based analysis the overall sensitivity, specificity, accuracy for PET/CT imaging were 100%, 96% and 97%, respectively. The corresponding information for CI were 46%, 87% and 74%, for CA 125 (cut off=20U/ml) measurement were 45%, 88% and 74%, and for CA 125 (cut off=35U/ml) measurement were 27%, 100% and 78%, respectively. On lesion-based analysis, PET/CT revealed only one false positive case. In none of 21 patients with negative 22 PET/CT studies, no subsequent clinical or radiological recurrences were observed with a follow-up of at least 6 months.FDG-PET/CT is found more useful modality than CI and CA 125 in the evaluation of post-treatment endometrial carcinoma patients, for suspected recurrence.
