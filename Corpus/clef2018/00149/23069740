Ovarian reserve parameters: a comparison between users and non-users of hormonal contraception. It remains controversial whether anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) concentration is influenced by hormonal contraception. This study quantified the effect of hormonal contraception on both endocrine and sonographic ovarian reserve markers in 228 users and 504 non-users of hormonal contraception. On day 2-5 of the menstrual cycle or during withdrawal bleeding, blood sampling and transvaginal sonography was performed. After adjusting for age, ovarian reserve parameters were lower among users than among non-users of hormonal contraception: serum AMH concentration by 29.8% (95% CI 19.9 to 38.5%), antral follicle count (AFC) by 30.4% (95% CI 23.6 to 36.7%) and ovarian volume by 42.2% (95% CI 37.8 to 46.3%). AFC in all follicle size categories (small, 2-4 mm intermediate, 5-7 mm
