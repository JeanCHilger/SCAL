Clinical characteristics and genetic analysis in women with premature ovarian insufficiency. Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as a primary ovarian defect characterized by absent menarche (primary amenorrhea) or premature depletion of ovarian follicles before the age of 40 (secondary amenorrhea) with hypergonadotropism and hypoestrogenism.We studied the clinical, biological, and genetic data related to 50 POI patients with a mean age of menopause of 29 years (94% with secondary amenorrhea, 6% with primary amenorrhea and 15% with a family history of POI). Seventeen patients were affected by endocrine autoimmune diseases, antral follicles were observed in 31 patients by ultrasonography.Karyotype analysis did not show any abnormality of the X chromosome. No mutation in FSH receptor and GDF-9 genes was reported, while in one patient a variant of BMP-15 gene (A180T) was found. Four patients had fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) premutation and one an intermediate sized CGG repeats of the same gene. Two patients with FMR1 premutation were sister and developed secondary amenorrhea at the age of 34 and 37 years. The other two patients presented with oligoamenorrhea at the age of 39 and 34 years. The patient harboured the intermediate sized CGG repeats developed secondary amenorrhea at the age of 33 years.The genetic analysis performed on a cohort of patients with POI revealed that 8% had FMR1 premutation and only one patient a previously known variant of BMP-15 gene. No alteration of the karyotype and FSH receptor and GDF-9 genes was evidenced.
