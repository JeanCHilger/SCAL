The clinical management in familial adenomatous polyposis deserves continuous monitoring for thyroid carcinoma. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is an extraintestinal manifestation of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, mainly occurring in young women. Recent publications highlight that familial adenomatous polyposis-associated papillary thyroid carcinoma represents a distinct type of follicular cell neoplasm histologically characterised by cribriform-morular aspects, the incidence of which has probably been underestimated so far. We report a case history of familial adenomatous polyposis-associated papillary thyroid carcinoma occurring in a 55-year-old man with Gardner syndrome, underscoring the importance of careful ultrasound screening examination of the thyroid gland in this condition.
