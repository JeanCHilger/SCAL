Primary ovarian pregnancy: case report and review of literature. A young woman in her 20s presented with sudden onset right-sided abdominal pain. On examination she was tender in the right adnexae. Her urine pregnancy test was positive and Î²HCG value was 1862. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound revealed evidence of a significant right-sided adnexal mass, a small amount of peritoneal-free fluid and an empty uterus. The decision was made to proceed with laparoscopy in view of mass size and the presence of fluid in the pelvis. Conservative resection of the gestational sac was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. Histology was consistent with ovarian ectopic pregnancy.
