Evaluation of symptomatic uterine fibroids in candidates for uterine artery embolization: comparison between ultrasonographic and MR imaging findings in 68 consecutive patients. Ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations of 68 women with uterine fibroids were reviewed to determine whether MR imaging may alter the therapeutic approach based on ultrasonography alone before uterine embolization. Therapeutic decisions based on ultrasonography alone were compared to those obtained after MR imaging. Discordant findings between both examinations involved 51 women (75%), and 19 (28%) had their therapeutic approaches based on ultrasonography alone altered by MR imaging. Ultrasonography and MR imaging showed concordant findings in 17 women (25%) for whom no changes in therapeutic option were made. MR imaging alters the therapeutic approach based on ultrasonography alone in 28% of candidates for uterine artery embolization.
