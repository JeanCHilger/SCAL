Small intestinal submucosa segments as matrix for tissue engineering: review. Tissue engineering (TE) is an emerging interdisciplinary field aiming at the restoration or improvement of impaired tissue function. A combination of cells, scaffold materials, engineering methods, and biochemical and physiological factors is employed to generate the desired tissue substitute. Scaffolds often play a pivotal role in the engineering process supporting a three-dimensional tissue formation. The ideal scaffold should mimic the native extracellular environment providing mechanical and biological properties to allow cell attachment, migration, and differentiation, as well as remodeling by the host organism. The scaffold should be nonimmunogenic and should ideally be resorbed by the host over time, leaving behind only the regenerated tissue. More than 40 years ago, a preparation of the small intestine was introduced for the replacement of vascular structures. Since then the small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has gained a lot of interest in TE and subsequent clinical applications, as this material exhibits key features of a highly supportive scaffold. This review will focus on the general properties of the SIS and its applications in therapeutical approaches as well as in generating tissue substitutes in vitro. Furthermore, the main problem of TE, which is the insufficient nourishment of cells within three-dimensional, artificial tissues exceeding certain dimensions is addressed. To solve this issue the implementation of another small intestine-derived preparation, the biological vascularized matrix (BioVaM), could be a feasible option. The BioVaM comprises in addition to SIS the arterial and venous mesenteric pedicles and exhibits thereby a perfusable vessel bed that is preserved after decellularization.
