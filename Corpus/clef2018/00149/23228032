Image assessment of cervical dimensions after LLETZ: a prospective observational study. To assess the impact of large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on cervical morphology as assessed by three-dimensional ultrasound.Prospective observational study.University Hospital in Dublin.Women with CIN who underwent an LLETZ procedure.All 106 participants had a three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound scan (3DTVS) performed immediately before and 6 months after LLETZ. The excised LLETZ specimen dimensions were also recorded. Blind analysis of the images was performed. The volume of the uterus and cervix was documented.The relationship between the extirpated LLETZ dimensions and subsequent cervical and uterine biometry, as assessed by 3DTVS.LLETZ induced a statistically significant reduction in both the length (mean, -0.46 cm P < 0.001) and the volume (-6.12 cm(3) The volume of tissue removed at LLETZ is related to the subsequent cervical volume, as well as the uterine length and volume, 6 months after the procedure.
