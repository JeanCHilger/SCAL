Ectopic cervical pregnancy, when conservative treatment fails. Case report and literature review. Cervical ectopic pregnancy is a rare and dangerous event that can be life and reproductive threatening. Years ago, the only treatment available were hysterectomy, resulting in a 50% of maternal mortality. In the present, ultrasound technologies let us make early diagnosis raising the possibilities of a conservative treatment in several ways. Cervical ectopic pregnancy represent a big challenge for the obstetrician, requiring great diagnostic and therapeutic skills in order to preserve the reproductive capacity, specially because this kind of ectopic pregnancy is more frequent in assisted reproductive techniques like intrauterine insemination, and in couples seeking fertility treatments, the reproductive capacity is an extremely important issue. By now, there's no plenty scientific evidence about this problem to write diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Today, personalized treatment is the only viable option for this patient. We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who arrived to our emergency room with a profuse vaginal bleeding, and with a history of conservative treatment for a cervical ectopic pregnancy.
