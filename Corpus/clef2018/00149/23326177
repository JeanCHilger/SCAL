Endoscopic resection of co-existing severe dysplasia and a small esophageal leiomyoma. Leiomyoma is the most common benign mesenchymal tumor of the esophagus. A small leiomyoma covered with endoscopically normal mucosa has a characteristic endoscopic ultrasonographic appearance, slow growth rate, and negligible risk of malignant transformation therefore the histology does not need to be proven. Synchronous tumors such as an epithelial tumor and small subepithelial tumor in the upper gastrointestinal tract are uncommon. We describe a case with a co-existing small leiomyoma and severe dysplasia in the esophagus which were completely resected by endoscopic mucosal resection.
