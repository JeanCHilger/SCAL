Preoperative staging of endometrial cancer using TVS, MRI, and hysteroscopy. To evaluate the accuracy of different preoperative modalities for staging of endometrial cancer to restrict extensive surgery to patients at high risk of metastatic disease.Aarhus University Hospital.156 women referred in 2006-2011 because of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (G0) or endometrial cancer.Patients were offered preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and hysteroscopic-directed biopsies from the uterine tumor and cervix. Final pathology of the removed uterus was the reference standard. Patients were divided into low risk (<50% myometrial invasion, and grades 0, 1, 2, and no cervical invasion) or high risk (all others).Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value.Patients were aged 32-88 years, with a mean body mass index of 29. At final pathology 81% had cancer and 19% G0 or no residual tumor 54% were high risk. Hysteroscopy-directed biopsies had a higher accuracy (92%) than endometrial biopsy (58%) for differentiating G0 from cancer (p < 0.001)Preoperative staging with MRI and hysteroscopy-directed biopsy can identify eight of 10 women with high risk of lymph node metastases and spare eight of 10 low-risk women extended surgery.
