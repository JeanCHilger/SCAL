Ciliary body leiomyoma: case report. A 41-year-old female complained of impaired vision on her left eye in the past year. Her visual acuity was 20/20 on the right eye and 20/50 on the left eye. In her left eye, there was an ill-defined, irregularly pigmented, orange lesion at 7 o'clock meridian behind the iris.
