Effects of low-dose metformin and rosiglitazone on biochemical, clinical, metabolic and biophysical outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of low-dose metformin and rosiglitazone on clinical, biochemical, ultrasound features and endothelial function in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). After randomisation, a group of 17Â women received metformin 500 mg b.d. (MG) and a group of 18 received rosiglitazone 4 mg o.d. (RG) for 3 months. Serum FSH, LH, testosterone, fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, CRP were measured at baseline and follow-up. Ovarian scan and microcirculation studies were also performed. It was found that there was a reduction in hyperandrogenaemia, insulin resistance, lipidaemia, CRP levels, ovarian volume and number of follicles in both groups. No improvement in endothelial- dependent function was noted but a significant improvement in endothelial-independent function in rosiglitazone group. It was concluded that low-dose therapeutic regimen with rosiglitazone and metformin, has comparable beneficial impacts on metabolic, hormonal and morphological features of PCOS but no obvious effect on vascular parameters in a population of predominantly mild PCOS.
