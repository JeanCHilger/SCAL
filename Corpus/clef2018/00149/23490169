Contribution of 3D imaging in brachytherapy: which kind of imaging for which localization?. The use of image-guided brachytherapy has led to a significant change in application techniques and improvements in treatment planning. Today, 3D imaging has replaced orthogonal radiographs for a large number of treatments, providing a possibility of an optimization adapted to the anatomy of each patient. When properly selected and implemented, this imaging provides accurate 3D information of volumes and brachytherapy device, allowing moving from a dose to points assessment to a dose/volume evaluation. This article describes the contribution of different imaging modalities for the different brachytherapy techniques: gynecological brachytherapy, interstitial brachytherapy (breast, penis, etc.) and prostate brachytherapy. It reminds recommendations for the establishment of protocols of images acquisition and 3D reconstruction of brachytherapy devices (applicators, plastic tubes, needles, etc.).
