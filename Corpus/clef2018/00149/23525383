Added value of 3-dimensional sonography for endometrial evaluation in early puerperium. The purpose of this study was to examine the uterine cavity within 48 hours of delivery using 2- and 3-dimensional sonography after normal vaginal deliveries, instrumental deliveries, exploration of the uterine cavity, and cesarean deliveries.A prospective study was performed in puerperal women with normal clinical examination findings. Measurements of the uterine length and width were taken in the midsagittal and coronal planes. Midsagittal measurements of the endometrium using 2- and 3-dimensional sonography and virtual organ computer-aided analysis were performed. Comparisons were made between normal and surgical vaginal deliveries, cesarean deliveries, and after exploration of the uterine cavity.A total of 123 patients were examined. Seventy-seven patients had normal vaginal deliveries 21 had assisted vaginal deliveriesSonography along with Doppler assessment has added value in the clinical evaluation of the puerperal women, being able to also show residua in asymptomatic women. Three-dimensional sonography did not show an advantage over 2-dimensional sonography in the estimation of the puerperal uterus or residua.
