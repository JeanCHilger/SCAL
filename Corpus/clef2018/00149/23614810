Cytokine patterns differ seasonally between women with and without uterine leiomyomata. Uterine leiomyomata are the most common reproductive tumor in women, and their cause is not known.Plasma samples from 155 women (74 with and 81 without ultrasound-confirmed leiomyoma) from a new study of leiomyoma risk factors in the Detroit, Michigan area, were examined for any cross-sectional associations between commonly examined cytokines and leiomyoma presence.Associations varied by season of sample collection defined a priori as winter (December-February) and non-winter seasons. In the winter months, interleukin (IL)13 and IL17 were positively and IP10 was inversely associated with having a leiomyoma. In the non-winter samples, VEGF, G-CSF, and IP10 were positively associated and Monocyte chemotactic protein-1, IL13, and IL17 were inversely associated with having a leiomyoma. Associations were not changed by adjustment for age or BMI.These data suggest that new insight into leiomyoma formation may be acquired through investigation of the immune system.
