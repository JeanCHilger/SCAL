Imaging findings of atypical leiomyoma of the urinary bladder simulating bladder cancer: a case report and literature review. Atypical bladder leiomyoma is a rare bladder tumor that is difficult to be correctly identified by imaging techniques or cystoscopy. We present the imaging characteristics of an atypical bladder leiomyoma and review the relative literature, with the aim of enhancing awareness of the differential diagnosis of bladder leiomyoma, to avoid and reduce misdiagnosis. The imaging characteristics of the atypical leiomyoma were the cauliflower shaped, abundant vascularity, and calcification foci on the surface of the tumor. The patient was misdiagnosed with bladder cancer after an imaging study. The histopathological study established the definitive diagnosis.
