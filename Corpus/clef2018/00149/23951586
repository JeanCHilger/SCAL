Sclerosing stromal tumour of the ovary: two case reports. Sclerosing stromal tumours are rare benign ovarian neoplasms of the sex cord stromal that occur predominantly in the second and third decades of life. Herein, we report two cases of sclerosing stromal tumour of the ovary. The two patients were 16 and 45 years old and both presented with pelvic pain. Ultrasonography demonstrated a heterogeneous solid mass of the left and right ovary, respectively, with some cystic foci in the second tumour. Laboratory tests including tumour markers and serum hormonal assays were normal in both cases. The two patients underwent left and right salpingo-oophrectomy, respectively. Microscopically, the tumours showed a pseudolobular pattern with cellular areas separated by oedematous and collagenous areas. The cellular areas were richly vascularized, with a hemangiopericytic pattern, and were composed of an admixture of theca-like and spindle-shaped cells. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumour cells were positive for smooth muscle actin, inhibin and vimentin, but negative for cytokeratin. The final pathological diagnosis was sclerosing stromal tumour. Postoperative course was uneventful for both patients.
