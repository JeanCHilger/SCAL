Thin endometrium in donor oocyte recipients: enigma or obstacle for implantation? To evaluate the combined effect of endometrial thickness and anatomic uterine factors on clinical outcome in oocyte donation recipients.Retrospective analysis of oocyte donation cycles conducted between 2005 and 2010.Two private IVF centers.A total of 737 donor oocyte cycles.None.Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.No statistically significant difference was found in clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates in cycles with endometrial thickness <6 mm compared with those with endometrial thickness >10 mm. However, a relatively high rate of live births was found within a medium range of endometrial thickness (8.2-10 mm). All intrauterine adhesion cases occurred in cycles with thinner endometrium.No statistically significant difference was found in clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates in cycles with endometrial thickness <6 mm compared with those with thickness >6 mm. A relatively high rate of live births was found within a medium range of endometrial thickness (9.1-10 mm).
