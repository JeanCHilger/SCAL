Pelvic ultrasound findings in prepubertal girls with precocious adrenarche born appropriate for gestational age. Precocious adrenarche (PA) refers to the clinical onset of excess androgen in girls before the age of 8. It is associated with an increased risk of functional ovarian hyperandrogenism after puberty. PA may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We compared pelvic ultrasound (US) findings of girls with PA born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) to healthy body mass index (BMI)-matched peers to determine whether US findings in AGA-born PA girls are associated with PCOS antecedents.We conducted a cross-sectional study on 56 AGA-born girls with PA (6·9 ± 0·6 years) and 33 BMI-matched prepubertal AGA-born peers (7·1 ± 1·0 years). Hormonal data, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitivity index (ISIcomp ) and pelvic US findings were compared. Associations of pelvic US findings with clinical and metabolic data were investigated.Precocious adrenarche girls had greater height and bone age-adjusted uterine length (UL P = 0·01) and UL standard deviation score (SDS) (P = 0·02) than BMI-matched peers. Mean ovarian volume (MOV), MOV SDS, uterine volume, uterine cross-sectional area and ovarian morphology were similar between the groups (P > 0·05). MOV and MOV SDS correlated with ISIcomp (r = -0·683, P < 0·001Appropriate for gestational age-born PA girls have greater UL measurements than AGA-born BMI-matched peers. In AGA-born girls with PA, decreasing insulin sensitivity is strongly and independently associated with an increase in MOV. Longitudinal follow-up of our cohort after menarche will allow us to establish how many AGA-born girls with PA will ultimately develop PCOS.
