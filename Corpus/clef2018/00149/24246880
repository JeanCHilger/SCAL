Diagnostic imaging modalities for Müllerian anomalies: the case for a new gold standard. Female reproductive tract anomalies are difficult to number in the general population but are often discovered in evaluations of menstrual complications or fertility disorders. Traditionally, assessment of the reproductive tract entailed hysterosalpingography to image the uterine cavity with the final diagnosis provided by combined hysteroscopy/laparoscopy. These approaches, while providing important information, were uncomfortable and invasive and for HSG, involved radiation exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MIR) allowed for the avoidance of these issues while offering accuracy, thus becoming the gold standard diagnostic imaging modality but entailing cost, patient discomfort, and inconvenience. Current advances in ultrasound technology, specifically 3-dimensional ultrasound, achieve the same benefits of MRI in being accurate and noninvasive but also offer the following advantages: they are available in the office, they are cost-effective, and they provide immediate results. As 3-dimensional technology continues to become more accessible and more providers become proficient in using it, ultrasound may replace MRI as the new gold imaging standard in diagnosing müllerian anomalies.
