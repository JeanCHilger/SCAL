The effect of vaginal sildenafil citrate on uterine blood flow and endometrium in the infertile women. Evaluation of endometrial receptivity remains a challenge in clinical practice. Ultrasound evaluation of endometrial thickness and texture and measurement of uterine artery blood flow has been used for endometrial assessment.To investigate the role of combination of sildenafil citrate and serophene on endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, endometrial FI and VFI on Angiohistogram, RI and PI to a. uterine on the day of hCG, in prediction of IUI outcome in infertile women.Forty two patients were selected randomly who had anovulatory infertility. In Sildenafil citrate plus Serophene group (Group I), patients got 25 mg sildenafil citrate (Silden) vaginally and Serophene 100-150 mg orally, and in Serophene group (Group II), 100-150 mg of Serophene was given orally.Mean endometrial thickness and endometrial volume was 11.8 +/- 2.6 v/s 10.2 +/- 2.8 and 5.2 +/- 1.4 v/s 3.6 +/- 1.8 respectively in group I and in group II (p < 0.05). There was significant decrease in PI and RI to a. uterina in group I.Combination of Sildenafil citrate and Serophene is an effective agent as a first-line of treatment for ovulation induction.
