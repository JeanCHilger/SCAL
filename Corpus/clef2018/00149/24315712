Complication rates associated with levonorgestrel intrauterine system use in adolescents with developmental disabilities. To assess the complication rates with the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUS) in adolescents with developmental disabilities.Retrospective chart review of all adolescents with developmental disabilities taken to the operating room for LNG IUS insertion between January 2000 and July 2009 at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Cases identified from the surgical database, and medical records reviewed.Complication rates with LNG IUS use in adolescents with development disabilities: non-insertion, uterine perforation, infection, and expulsion.Fifty-six adolescents with developmental disabilities had an attempted LNG IUS insertion. The average age at insertion was 15.6Â years (range 10.5-21.5 y). The LNG IUS was used as first line therapy in 14 cases (25%). Pre-insertion ultrasonography was ordered in 48% of cases, out of which 5 cases had uterine lengths <6 cm. Despite this, 4 of these cases had successful insertions. Two insertion attempts were abandoned intra-operatively (3.6%) one due to inadequate uterine length of 4 cm, and the other due to anatomic distortion. One spontaneous expulsion occurred at approximately 5 months (1.9%). Four IUDs were removed prematurely (7.4% withdrawal rate)Our experience in this population has been very positive and confirms that complication rates are comparable to that in adults.
