Dietary supplementation with polyphenol-rich chokeberry juice improves skin morphology in cellulite. The aim of our study was to investigate possible beneficial effects of organic chokeberry juice (OCJ) consumption in the treatment of cellulite. Twenty-nine women aged 25-48 with a cellulite grade 2 according to the Nurnberger-Muller scale were included. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. Skin structure was analyzed by ultrasonography. All subjects consumed 100 mL of OCJ per day, during 90 days. Measurements of investigated parameters were performed at 0, 45, and 90 days of the study. A marked reduction in the subcutaneous tissue thickness was observed in all subjects, with the average reduction of 1.9 mm. The length of subcutaneous tissue fascicles (ScTFL) was reduced in 97% (28 out of 29) of subjects, with the average value of 1.18 mm. After 45 days of chokeberry juice consumption, reduction of edema was observed in 55.2% of the subjects with edema at the baseline, while at the endpoint of the study, edemas were not observed in any of the subjects involved in the study. OCJ could have beneficial effects on the cellulite condition, including the length of ScTFL, subcutaneous tissue, and dermis thickness as well as on edema reduction.
