Three-dimensional endovaginal sonography of synthetic implanted materials in the female pelvic floor. The objective of this pictorial essay is to emphasize the ability of 3-dimensional endovaginal sonography to image synthetic implanted materials in the female pelvic floor. Implanted materials discussed in this pictorial essay include polypropylene vaginal mesh, polypropylene suburethral slings, and urethral bulking agents. Three-dimensional endovaginal sonography allows for more detailed imaging compared to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvic floor, in that each plane can be manipulated to show unique images of synthetic implanted materials.
