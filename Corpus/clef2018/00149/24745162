Endometrial receptivity-- can it be diagnosed and controlled? And why does it matter? Infertility remains a challenge to modern medicine. Despite extensive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, the achievement of pregnancy remains an elusive goal in some patients. The endometrium is one of the key factors in embryo implantation. Older methods of describing endometrial receptivity like histology or ultrasound, did not bring noticeable improvement in pregnancy rates. New technologies, including genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and secretomics promise to improve the detection of the implantation window in the endometrium and result in better counseling of patients with infertility.
