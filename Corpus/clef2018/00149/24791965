Comparison of 3-dimensional versus 2-dimensional laparoscopic vision system in total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a retrospective study. We compare the results of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) operations conducted using standard 2-D and 3-D high definition laparoscopic vision systems and discuss the findings with regard to the recent literature.Data from 147 patients who underwent TLH operations with 2-D or 3-D high definition laparoscopic vision systems in Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital, during 2 year period between December 2010 and December 2012, were reviewed retrospectively. TLH operations were divided into two groups as those performed using 2-D, and those performed using 3-D high definition laparoscopic vision systems.A statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in the operation times (p = 0.037 < 0.05). The mean operation time of the 2-D laparoscopy group (134.2 ± 61.8 min) was higher than the 3-D laparoscopy group (116.8 ± 38.5 min). No statistically significant difference was found between the 2-D and 3-D groups with respect to major, minor and total complication rates (p = 0.641 > 0.05). The operation time among obese patients was significantly shorter in those in the 3-D laparoscopy group than those in the 2-D group (p = 0.041 < 0.05).Recent literature indicates that 3-D laparoscopy vision system needs to be utilized more often and a higher number of ex vivo and in vivo studies have to be conducted. Furthermore, we believe that the prevalent problems encountered during laparoscopy can be overcome by the development of real-time vision devices and the appropriate training of the laparoscopists. 3-D high definition laparoscopic vision system will help to improve surgical performance and outcome of patients undergoing gynecological minimal invasive surgery.
