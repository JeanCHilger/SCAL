Complete hydatidiform mole coexisting with a live fetus. Hydatidiform mole co-existing with a normal fetus is very rare. We report a case of a 36 year old woman Para 4+0 who presented with amenorrhoea of twenty four weeks duration, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and pre-eclampsia. Ultrasound examination revealed a hydatidiform mole coexisting with a normal living fetus. The patient underwent a caesarean section at twenty eight weeks for maternal distress due to unbearable abdominal pain. The baby died after seven days. Post operatively she had an eclamptic fit and developed oliguria and persistent trophoblastic disease which were all successfully treated.
