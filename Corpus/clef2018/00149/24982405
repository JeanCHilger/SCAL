Ultrasound evaluation of cervical regeneration after LLETZ for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a prospective observational study. To assess cervical regeneration after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) by ultrasound (US) measurements of cervical length (CL) before conization as well as in the postoperative short- and long-term and to identify factors affecting regeneration.This was a prospective observational study including patients under 45 years of age treated by LLETZ for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) with repeated measurements of CL by transvaginal US before and just after LLETZ, at 1 and 6 months postoperatively.A total of 83 patients were enrolled, out of which 53 were included in the study. The mean CL was 28.6 mm (±5.7) preoperatively versus 18.3 mm (±4.2) after surgery 21.8 mm (±4.4) at 1 month and 25.5 mm (±4.9) at 6 months. The mean cone length estimated by US was 10.3 mm (±3.4). The differences in CL before/after conization and CL after conization/at 6 months were statistically significant (p<0.0001). Cervical regeneration at 6 months was 71% (±20), statistically greater than regeneration at 1 month (32%, ±16) (p<0.0001).Post-conization cervical tissue regeneration occurred with almost three quarters of the initial cervical length restored at 6 months. Further studies evaluating obstetric outcomes after LLETZ according to cervical regeneration might subsequently be used in clinical practice to identify high-risk pregnancies by pre- and postoperative US measurements of the cervical length. A rigorous assessment of CIN treatment risks and benefits remains essential when considering treating patients of childbearing age given a potential obstetric risk from conization.
