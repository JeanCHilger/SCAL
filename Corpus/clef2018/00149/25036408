Comparison of serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels in normal weight and overweight-obese adolescent patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. To evaluate serum concentration of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in adolescent patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with respect to body mass index (BMI), and to investigate the relationship with clinical, metabolic and hormonal parameters.Fifty-eight adolescent girls (29 normal weight and 29 overweight-obese) diagnosed with PCOS and 28 apparently healthy girls (controls) were enrolled in the study. BMI was calculated in all cases. Serum AMH, hormonal and metabolic parameters were compared between patients with PCOS (normal weight and overweight-obese) and controls.Serum AMH did not differ between patients with PCOS and controls (p=0.283), and no correlation was found between BMI and AMH. A significant positive correlation was found between 2-h plasma glucose on 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and AMH (R=0.364, p=0.005). HOMA-IR index and insulin were significantly higher in overweight-obese patients with PCOS than in controls, but no significant difference was found between controls and normal-weight patients with PCOS.AMH was not found to be a reliable predictor for the presence of PCOS, and serum AMH did not differ between obese and non-obese adolescent patients with PCOS.
