Comparison of pelvic masses score (PMS) and Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI 3) in the evaluation of pelvic masses. Ovarian cancer is the fourth cause of death from cancer in women worldwide and the majority of its diagnoses is made in an advanced stage of the disease. Several sonographic scoring systems have been created for a better preoperative discrimination between benign and malignant pelvic masses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of the Risk of the Malignancy Index 3 (RMI 3) and the Pelvic Masses Score (PMS).This retrospective study was performed in 55 women admitted to the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of University of Udine for surgical exploration of pelvic masses between 2009 and 2012. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for both the scores.PMS showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 93.8%, a PPV of 70%, and a NPV of 100%, while RMI 3 yielded a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 91%, a PPV of 60%, and a NPV of 97.8%.The authors found that, in discriminating between benign and malignant pelvic disease, the PMS method was more reliable than RMI3. PMS is a simple scoring system which can be used in clinical practice.
