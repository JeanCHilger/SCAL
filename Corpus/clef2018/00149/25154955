Fallopian tube torsion in the pediatric age group: radiologic evaluation. Fallopian tube torsion is a rare but important cause of acute pelvic pain in young adolescent girls. It is a surgical emergency treated with either detorsion or salpingectomy. The imaging findings can be nonspecific and challenging. However, an accurate early diagnosis is essential for prompt surgical treatment. Our objective was to review whether imaging findings can be specific enough to suggest the diagnosis of tubal torsion prospectively in the appropriate clinical setting. An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review of our imaging database from 2005 to 2012 revealed 10 surgically proven cases of fallopian tube torsion. All cases had sonography performed 5 cases had additional multidetector computed tomography. All 10 patients (9-17 years) presented with acute pelvic pain. Sonographic findings included dilated tubular structures in 6 of 10 cases: adjacent to a normal ipsilateral ovary in 5 of 6 and adjacent to a benign ovarian teratoma in 1. In 4 cases, no dilated tube was identified
