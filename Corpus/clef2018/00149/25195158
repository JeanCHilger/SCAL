The diagnostic accuracy of two- vs three-dimensional sonohysterography for evaluation of the uterine cavity in the reproductive age. To compare 2-dimensional sonohysterography (2D SHG) vs 3-dimensional sonohysterography (3D SHG) using saline solution infusion, with outpatient hysteroscopy as the gold standard, for evaluation of the uterine cavity in women of reproductive age.Comparative observational cross-sectional study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).University hospital.One hundred twenty women of reproductive age with abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, or recurrent pregnancy loss and with clinically and/or ultrasongraphically suspected intrauterine lesions.All patients underwent 2D SHG and 3D SHG using saline solution infusion followed by outpatient hysteroscopy. Sonographic findings were compared with hysteroscopic findings.For 2D SHG, sensitivity was 71.2% specificity, 94.1%3D SHG can be used in the initial evaluation of the uterine cavity in women of reproductive age, with accuracy comparable to that of hysteroscopy.
