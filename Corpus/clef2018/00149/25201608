Prevalence of adenomyosis in women undergoing surgery for endometriosis. To evaluate the prevalence of adenomyosis in patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis.Retrospective study including 1618 women with preoperative clinical and ultrasound diagnosis of endometriosis. As preoperative assessment, all patients underwent ultrasound to assess endometriosis and all features associated with adenomyosis (heterogeneous myometrial echotexture, globular-appearing uterus, asymmetrical thickness of anteroposterior wall of the myometrium, subendometrial myometrial cysts, subendometrial echogenic linear striations or poor definition of the endometrial-myometrial junction).Adenomyosis was present in 353/1618 (21.8%) women included in the study. Multivariate analysis showed that the prevalence of adenomyosis was significantly associated with deep infiltrating endometriosis, parity, dysmenorrhea intensity and women's age (P<0.0001).Adenomyosis is a common condition but its aetiology and natural history are still unknown. Our experience showed a 21.8% of prevalence of adenomyosis in patients affected by endometriosis and its association with parous women, increasing age, dysmenorrhea intensity and with the presence of deep infiltrating endometriosis.
