Color Doppler analysis of uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery blood flow before and after treatment with cabergoline in hyperprolactinemic patients. Prolactin (PRL) may have stimulatory effects on vascular resistance. We aimed to analyze uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery blood flow by Doppler ultrasonography in hyperprolactinemic patients prior to and after treatment with cabergoline. The study was conducted in Sisli Etfal Training and Research Hospital gynecology outpatient clinic between 1 March 2010 and 30 September 2011. Twenty-four women with symptomatic hyperprolactinemia in reproduction age were included in the study. All hyperprolactinemic patients were studied prior to and following the suppression of circulating PRL levels by cabergoline. Patients were examined by standard B-mod and color transvaginal ultrasonography. Pulsality index (PI), resistance index (RI), and systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) were recorded. The median PRL value was 86 (62-120) ng/ml before treatment and 4.0 (2.5-6.4) ng/ml after the treatment (p < 0.001). We found a significant association among PRL, uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery RI with linear regression analysis (p < 0.001 for all three arteries). Uterine, spiral, and intraovarian artery PI (p = 0.021, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively) and RI (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively) significantly decreased after cabergoline treatment. In conclusion, this is a pilot study which shows for the first time that PRL increases the uterine, endometrial, and intraovarian vascular resistance and cabergoline reverses this effect.
