Effects of combining low‑dose aspirin with a Chinese patent medicine on follicular blood flow and pregnancy outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical value of low‑dose aspirin in combination with Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by measuring follicular peripheral blood flow parameters and the clinical efficacy. The study involved 78 infertile females with PCOS who were randomly divided into experimental (n=38) and control (n=40) groups. The subjects in the experimental group were treated with letrozole in combination with aspirin and Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills, and the control group was treated with letrozole alone. Transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure the endometrial thickness, pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity (EDV) of the follicular peripheral artery on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration. The patients who failed to become pregnant in the control group were reintegrated into the experimental group in the subsequent cycle and the clinical effect was observed. In the experimental group, subject perifollicular blood flow was more plentiful, and the PI and RI of the perifollicular blood flow were significantly reduced, while the EDV of the perifollicular blood flow and the rate of clinical pregnancy were markedly elevated compared with the subjects in the control group. Low‑dose aspirin combined with Tiao Jing Cu Yun pills effectively improved perifollicular artery blood flow, and enhanced the oocyte quality and rate of clinical pregnancy.
