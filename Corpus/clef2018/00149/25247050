Mirror image artifact mimicking heterotopic pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound: case series. Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy is a common emergency department complaint. Point-of-care ultrasound is a useful tool to evaluate for intrauterine ectopic pregnancy.

We present two cases where mirror-image artifacts initially led to a concern for heterotopic pregnancies but were excluded on further imaging.
