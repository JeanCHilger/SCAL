Dynamics of the functional characteristics of the microcirculation system in the women of late reproductive age presenting with chronic endometritis under effect of contrast massage. The objective of the present work was to study the functional characteristics of the microcirculation system in the women of late reproductive age presenting with chronic endometritis before and after a course of contrast massage. Three types of functional changes in the microcirulation system were distinguished based on the results of laser-assisted Doppler flowmetry. All of them were characterized by high coefficients of correlation with the results of dopplerometry of uterine blood flow and underwent dynamic changes in the course of the treatment. The study has demonstrated the high therapeutic effectiveness of the contrast massage technique as a tool for inducing hemodynamic changes in the small pelvis basin in the women suffering from chronic endometritis.
