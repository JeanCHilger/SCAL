The relationship between serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels and the follicular arrest for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether higher levels of serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) are associated with the ovarian follicular arrest in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This prospective study compared AMH levels between serum and dominant follicular fluid (FF) in ovulatory polycystic ovary (PCO) women and anovulatory (menstrual cycle ≥60 days.) PCOS women. All 102 women provided a baseline hormone profile and underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). The anovulatory PCO women had a similar body mass index (BMI), antral follicle count (AFC), and baseline serum AMH levels as the ovulatory PCO women except that their median luteinizing hormone (LH 10.0 mIU/ml), testosterone (T) (0.61 ng/l), and androstenedione (A) (3.47 ng/l) levels were significantly higher than ovulatory PCO women (4.9 mIU/m
