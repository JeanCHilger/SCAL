Combination of 2- and 3-dimensional contrast-enhanced transvaginal sonography for diagnosis of small adnexal masses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) contrast-enhanced sonography in discriminating between benign and malignant small adnexal masses.Selected patients were evaluated with both 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced sonography after conventional sonography before undergoing any surgery. Time-intensity curves for 2D contrast-enhanced sonography were constructed by using contrast-enhanced sonographic software. A vascular perfusion characteristic analysis was achieved by 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced sonography. Results were finally verified by surgery.Forty-seven cases of benign and 10 cases of malignant small adnexal masses were discovered. Significant differences in perfusion patterns, time-intensity curve shapes for 2D contrast-enhanced sonography, grayscale contrast-enhanced sonography, and blood flow imaging on 3D contrast-enhanced sonography were observed between benign and malignant masses (P< .05). Two-dimensional contrast-enhanced sonography, 3D contrast-enhanced sonography, parallel combination of 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced sonography, and serial combination of 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced sonography all reached diagnostic sensitivity of 100% for discriminating benign from malignant masses, whereas specificity values were 61.7%, 63.8%, 68.1%, and 57.4%, respectively. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.809, 0.819, 0.840, and 0.787.Two-dimensional contrast-enhanced sonography is of high value in distinguishing malignant from benign small adnexal masses 3D contrast-enhanced sonography provides richer and more useful information for evaluation of these masses. Diagnostic sensitivity of 100% can be achieved when using a serial combination of 2D and 3D contrast-enhanced sonography, although specificity needs further improvement.
