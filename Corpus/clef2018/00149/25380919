Analysis of the selected biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function in children of mothers after liver transplantation. Children of mothers after liver transplantation (LT) are exposed during fetal life to the immunosuppressive agents. These drugs may have hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects.The aim of the work was to assess liver and kidney parameters of children born from mothers who had LT.The research included 51 children of mothers after LT and 51 children from a control group who were born in the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Warsaw between 2001 and 2013. The control group consisted of children born in the similar gestational age. Analysis concerned neonates, infants, and children older than 12 months. Two liver parameters (alanine transaminase [ALT] and aspartate transaminase [AST]) as well as two kidney parameters (urea and creatinine) were assessed. For statistical analysis we used Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney test.All children from the LT group had correct ALT levels. In the control group, 5 of 51 cases (9.8 %) had levels that were greater than the norm, and those cases concerned only children younger than 12 months. The average concentration of ALT in the LT group was 15.14 U/L and the average for the control group was 22.6 U/L (P = .012699, Mann-Whitney test). Three of 51 children in the LT group (5.9%) and 8 of 51 (15.7%) in the control group had AST levels that were increased (P = .2003 Fisher's exact test). Incorrect AST levels were reported in all age groups. Incorrect values of kidney parameters concerned only neonates. Increased creatinine levels were reported in 3 of 51 cases (5.9%) in the LT group and in 1 of 51 cases (1.96%) in the control group (P = .6175Exposure to immunosuppressive drugs during fetal life does not result in the occurrence of serious disturbances of liver function and kidneys function in children of mothers after LT.
