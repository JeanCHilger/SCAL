Ultrasonography evaluation of pelvic masses. Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality for evaluation of pelvic masses. Ultrasonography has the advantage of being inexpensive, widely available, and offering superior tissue characterization compared with computed tomography. The real-time imaging ability of ultrasonography and three-dimensional ultrasonography also has the advantage of being able to identify the organ of origin of the pelvic mass. Many pelvic masses have characteristic sonographic appearances that allow confident diagnosis and management. This article reviews the sonographic appearances and management of common pelvic masses encountered in nonpregnant women, and is organized based on anatomic location: uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.
