Uterine rupture at 26 weeks of pregnancy following laparoscopic salpingectomy with resection of the interstitial portion: a case report. Uterine rupture in pregnancy can occur in patients with a history of uterine surgery such as myomectomy and Cesarean section. Here, we report a case of spontaneous uterine rupture that occurred in the early third trimester in a pregnant woman who had previously undergone laparoscopic removal of the right fallopian tube and interstitial portion for treatment of interstitial pregnancy. The patient presented with sudden onset of abdominal pain at 26 weeks of gestation. Detailed ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging led to diagnosis of uterine rupture. In emergency laparotomy, the fetus was delivered by Cesarean section, the placenta and membranes were removed, and the uterus was preserved with closure of the rupture and wound. This case highlights the importance of close follow-up of a pregnant patient who has previously had a uterine incision. The case also raises the question of whether the prevalence of uterine rupture may increase as more patients are treated with laparoscopic surgery of the uterus.
