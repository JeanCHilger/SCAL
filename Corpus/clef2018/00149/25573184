Subendometrial blood flow changes by 3-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound after hysteroscopic lysis of severe intrauterine adhesions: preliminary study. To evaluate the changes in subendometrial blood flow and endometrial volume after hysteroscopic lysis of severe intrauterine adhesions (IUAs).A pilot observational study. Forty infertile women with severe IUAs served as their own controls and were included in this study only once, to avoid selection bias.Three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound was performed in all patients 1 day before hysteroscopic lysis of severe IUA, and repeated 1 month later, to assess subendometrial blood flow [as measured by vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI)] and endometrial volume. Main outcome measures were subendometrial blood flow (VI, FI, VFI) and endometrial volume.There were statistically significant postoperative increases in endometrial volume, VI, FI, and VFI. Subendometrial blood flow improved in 14 women (35%), and menstrual improvement occurred in 15 women (37.5%).Hysteroscopic lysis of severe IUAs improves subendometrial blood flow, with subsequent increases in endometrial volume.
