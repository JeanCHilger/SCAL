The conservative and interventional treatment of fibroids. Fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women. One-third of all women of reproductive age undergo treatment for symptomatic fibroids. In recent years, the spectrum of available treatments has been widened by the introduction of new drugs and interventional procedures.Selective literature review on the treatment of uterine fibroids, including consideration of several Cochrane Reviews.Fibroids can be treated with drugs, interventional procedures (uterine artery embolization [UAE] and focused ultrasound treatment [FUS]), and surgery. The evidence regarding the various available treatments is mixed. All methods improve symptoms, but only a few comparative studies have been performed. A meta-analysis revealed that recovery within 15 days is more common after laparoscopic enucleation than after open surgery (odds ratio [OR], 3.2). A minimally invasive hysterectomy, or one performed by the vaginal route, is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a more rapid recovery than open transabdominal hysterectomy. UAE is an alternative to hysterectomy for selected patients. The re-intervention rates after fibroid enucleation, hysterectomy, and UAE are 8.9-9%, 1.8-10.7%, and 7-34.6%, respectively. The main drugs used to treat fibroids are gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and selective progesterone receptor modulators.Multiple treatment options are available and enable individualized therapy for symptomatic fibroids. The most important considerations in the choice of treatment are the question of family planning and, in some cases, the technical limitations of the treatments themselves.
