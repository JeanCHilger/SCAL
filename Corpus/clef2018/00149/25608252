Adnexal masses in the premenopausal patient. Practitioners may frequently encounter adnexal masses in premenopausal women. Adnexal masses can represent a wide variety of etiologies, and therefore they can represent a diagnostic dilemma. When an adnexal mass is found the initial work up must focus on identifying acute pathology followed by determining the risk of a malignancy. Pelvic ultrasound remains the mainstay for evaluation of adnexal masses in premenopausal patients. If ultrasounds findings are indeterminate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the next imaging modality of choice. The evaluation for malignancy should include serum marker screening. Aspiration of adnexal masses is generally avoided, due to the lack of therapeutic benefit and risk of seeding a tumor. When ultrasound findings are suggestive of benign disease, conservative management, including repeat imaging, should be considered. If the clinical suspicion for malignancy is high referral to a gynecologic oncologist is warranted. In other patients whom the evaluation of their adnexal mass remains unclear surgical excision with care not to disrupt the integrity of the mass should be performed for pathologic diagnosis.
