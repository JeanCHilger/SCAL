Significance of ultrasonic detection of muscle layer thickness of cesarean section scar in late pregnancy. To explore the clinical value of high frequency ultrasound in monitoring muscle layer thickness of cesarean section scar in late pregnancy.A total of 131 patients re-conceived after cesarean section were selected randomly from our hospital.High frequency ultrasound was used for monitoring muscle layer thickness of cesarean section scar. And ultrasonic results and operative findings were compared.Based upon the ultrasonic results, they were divided into 2 groups: group 1 ( â‰¤ 2 mm, n = 61), there were confirmed (n = 19) and misdiagnosed (n = 11) uterine rupture group 2 ( > 2 mm, n = 70), confirmed (n = 5) and misdiagnosed (n = 5) uterine rupture.Monitoring muscle layer thickness of cesarean section scar is of great significance for preventing uterine rupture in late pregnancy.
