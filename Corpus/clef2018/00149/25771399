Intraoperative Transrectal Ultrasonography for Hysteroscopic Metroplasty: Feasibility and Safety. The primary objective of this prospective comparative nonrandomized study was to assess the feasibility and safety of intraoperative transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) during hysteroscopic metroplasty (HM). The secondary objective of the study was to assess whether TRUS facilitates complete removal of the uterine septum. Septate uterus was diagnosed by 3-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography (3D-TVS) and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. In the control group (HM group n = 18), patients underwent HM according to the traditional standard of operative hysteroscopy. In the study group (HM+TRUS group
