Large cardiac fibroma and teratoma in children- case reports. Primary cardiac tumours in paediatric population are an unusual occurrence. Although, majority of such tumours are benign (90%), the frequency and type of cardiac tumours in this age group is different from the adult population. There are several consecutive series published in the last decade on cardiac neoplasms. Therefore, this is not only an effort to contribute to the existing literature for better understanding and management of similar patients but also to highlight the importance of early detection either by prenatal imaging or careful evaluation of differential diagnosis of common symptoms. We herein, describe two infants with large cardiac tumours (fibroma and teratoma) both arising from the interventricular septum and underwent surgical excision. A possible role of cardiac remodeling in myocardial tissue healing after extensive tissue resection in such patients is hypothesised through available experimental or limited clinical information.
