Ovarian volume in normal and hyperandrogenic adolescent women. To study the threshold for increased ovarian size during different periods of adolescence.Cross sectional study with retrospective analysis.University center.A total of 146 hyperandrogenic adolescent women and 72 healthy adolescent controls.Intravaginal or transabdominal ovarian sonography.Determination of normal ovarian size during the different phases of adolescence calculated using the ellipsoid formula calculation of threshold for increased ovarian size during different adolescent gynecologic ages and prevalence of increased ovarian size for hyperandrogenic girls at different gynecologic ages.In adolescent women, the threshold for increased ovarian size was 11.5 cm(3) during first 2 years from menarche, 10.5 cm(3) during the third year from menarche, and 10 cm(3) during the fourth and fifth years from menarche. The prevalence of increased ovarian size in hyperandrogenic adolescents was around 50% from the third to fifth years from menarche and 35% during the first 2 years from menarche.After the first 2 years from menarche, the thresholds for increased ovarian size are similar to those used among adults. During first 2 years from menarche, ovarian size is larger, and differentiation between normal or increased ovarian sizes may be more difficult. In hyperandrogenic adolescent patients, the prevalence of increased ovarian size is relatively low (ranging from 35% to 50% during the different periods of adolescence). In these patients, increased ovarian size may have low sensitivity as a criterion for the diagnosis of possible polycystic ovary syndrome.
