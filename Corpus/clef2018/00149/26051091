Uterine volume and endometrial thickness in healthy girls evaluated by ultrasound (3-dimensional) and magnetic resonance imaging. To report normative data on uterine volume and endometrial thickness in girls, according to pubertal stages to evaluate factors that affect uterine volumeCross-sectional study of a nested cohort of girls participating in The Copenhagen Mother-Child Cohort.General community.One hundred twenty-one healthy girls, aged 9.8-14.7 years.None.Clinical examination, including pubertal breast stage (Tanner classification: B1-B5). Uterine volume: ellipsoid TAUS (n = 112) and 3-dimensional TAUS (n = 111) ellipsoid MRI (n = 61). Endometrial thickness: TAUS (n = 110) and MRI (n = 60).Uterine volume and endometrial thickness were positively correlated with pubertal stages e.g., ellipsoid TAUS: r = 0.753, and endometrium TAUS: 0.648. In multiple regression analyses, uterine volume was associated with the number of large follicles (TAUS >5 mm) (Beta 0.270)Uterine volume and endometrial thickness increased as puberty progressed. Circulating E2 from large follicles was the main contributor to uterine and endometrial growth. The TAUS and MRI assessments of uterus and endometrium were strongly correlated.
