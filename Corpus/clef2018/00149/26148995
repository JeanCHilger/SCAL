Evaluation of Tubal Patency with Transvaginal Three-dimensional Hysterosalpingo-contrast Sonography. To investigate diagnostic efficacy of transvaginal three-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (3D-HyCoSy) in assessing tubal patency with chromolaporoscopy.A total of 157 infertile women underwent 3D-HyCoSy to evaluate tubal patency. Among these patients, 39 patients were also examined by chromolaporoscopy. The concordance of the two clinical assessment methods was analyzed by the Kappa coefficient test.Among the 306 oviducts examined by 3D-HyCoSy, 99 (32.4%) were patent, 126 (41.2%) partially obstructed, and 81 (26.5%) completely obstructed. Diagnostic results with 3D-HyCoSy were not statistically different from those obtained in the 39 women (78 oviducts) who also underwent chromolaporoscopy, and the two methods showed a high concordance (k=0.747, P=0.000). The 3D-HyCoSy procedure had a sensitivity of 84.8% (28/33), a specificity of 96.2% (25/26), and positive and negative predictive values of 93.3% (28/30) and 86.2% (25/29) respectively.Transvaginal 3D-HyCoSy can accurately reveal the spatial path and morphology of the oviduct and is a safe and effective method to evaluate tubal patency.
