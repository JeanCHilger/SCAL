Sonohysterography versus hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of endouterine polyps. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of abdominal and vaginal sonohysterography (SHG considered both singly and in combination) for the diagnosis of uterine polyps. Fifty fertile women hospitalized for hysterectomy for benign gynecologic indications were enrolled. Main outcome measures were preoperative conventional vaginosonography, transabdominal and vaginal SHG, hysteroscopy and histologic evaluation of the surgical specimen. Conventional vaginosonography had a sensitivity of 33.3% and a specificity of 100%
