Relationship of endometrial thickness and echo patterns on pregnancy rates in patients with luteal phase defects. The objective of this prospective comparative study was to investigate the relationship of sonographic measurements of the endometrium at the time of peak follicular maturation to conception outcome in patients treated for luteal phase defects (as determined by out-of-phase endometrial biopsies). Treatments for luteal phase defects included progesterone supplementation with or without follicle-maturing drugs, depending on whether the patient attained a follicle of at least 18 mm and a serum estradiol of > 200 pg/ml. No differences in pregnancy rates were found by the thickness of endometrium (< 10 vs. > or = 10 mm) or echo pattern in any of the treatment modalities. Thus, contrary to findings in stimulated cycles for in vitro fertilization, endometrial thickness at the time of peak follicular maturation is not predictive of outcome in patients treated for luteal phase defects in natural cycles.
