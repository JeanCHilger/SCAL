Postoperative GnRH analog treatment for the prevention of recurrences of uterine myomas after myomectomy. A pilot study. Sixty-five patients with uterine myomas were studied after surgery to investigate the effect of periodic GnRH analog treatment on the prevention of recurrences. A group of patients was treated by leuprolide acetate depot 3 months a year for 3 years. At the end of treatment, these patients showed a significantly reduced uterine volume and myoma recurrence rate as compared to untreated patients. A role of GnRH analogs in the clinical prevention of myoma recurrence could be suggested.
