Transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluation of the endometrium related to the histological findings in pre- and perimenopausal women. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography in pre- and perimenopausal women suspected to have endometrial pathology.196 women, aged between 32 and 57 years, were referred to the outpatient clinic for a dilatation and curettage (D&C). In 81% the clinical indication was irregular vaginal bleedings. Before the D&C an examination with transvaginal ultrasonography was performed, and the endometrial thickness and texture were determined. The ultrasonographic results were later compared with the histological diagnosis obtained from the D&C specimen.Ultrasonographically both normal and pathological endometrial changes could be detected, and 82% of the women had an endometrium characterized as normal. The endometrial phase determination correlated with the histological findings in approximately 50% of the women. Histologically 83% of the women had a normal endometrium. Endometrial hyperplasia was found in 12% and endometrial polyps in 4%. There were no malignancies found in this study. The hormone users (33% of the women) had no higher incidence of hyperplasias than non-users.Our data indicate that transvaginal ultrasonography is as effective as the D&C for depicting the endometrium in pre- and perimenopausal women with irregular bleedings.
