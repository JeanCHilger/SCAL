Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluating of double uterus and associated urinary tract anomalies: a report of five cases. Uterine anomalies are associated with unilateral renal aplasia. We present the MR features of five cases with 'double' uteri. The anomalies consisted of four cases of uterus didelphys and one of a complete septate uterus. All the cases with uterus didelphys also had a longitudinal vaginal septum. The MR diagnoses were confirmed with hysterosalpingography and with laparoscopy. In one case of didelphic uterus, MR images predicted the (three-dimensional helical) computer tomography (CT)-pyelographic diagnosis of renal aplasia in which the single kidney was normal. The study shows that MR is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of not only uterine anomalies but also associated anomalies in other systems.
