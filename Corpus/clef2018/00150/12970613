Low-malignant-potential tumor of the ovary: sonographic features with clinicopathologic correlation in 41 patients. The biologic, behavioral, and pathologic features of low-malignant-potential (LMP) tumor of the ovary are distinct from their invasive counterpart. LMP tumors affect patients at a younger age and have a much better 5- and 20-year survival rate compared with invasive ovarian malignancy. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records and sonograms of 41 patients (51 masses) with LMP tumor of the ovary. They demonstrated a wide variety of morphologies on the presentation sonograms with six masses favored to be benign, four indeterminate, 18 likely malignant, and 23 clearly malignant. Eighteen of 51 masses (35.3%) had a unique appearance-a cyst within the ovary of small to medium size with vascular mural nodularity and preserved surrounding ovarian parenchyma. Low-level echoes within the cystic components of the mass, reminiscent of typical endometrioma, were present in 19 of 51 masses (37.2%). Peritoneal dissemination was present in six patients at presentation, all! whom were alive at follow-up between 45 and 120 months. The authors think that many LMP tumors may be recognized and treated while they are still small. Ovary-sparing surgery may preserve patient fertility. LMP tumors may present initially with a benign morphology, although temporal evolution tends to show more suspicious features. Because these tumors may also appear frankly malignant or show peritoneal dissemination, the possibility of LMP tumor must be considered in light of their much better prognosis compared with invasive ovarian malignancy.
