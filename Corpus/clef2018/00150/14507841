Impaired ovarian blood flow and reduced antral follicle count following laparoscopic salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy. Whether salpingectomy affects ovarian function is controversial. In this study, ovarian function was assessed by antral follicle count, ovarian volume and ovarian stromal blood flow measured by three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasonography. The objectives of the study were to compare the ovarian function of the operated side with the non-operated side after unilateral salpingectomy performed through laparoscopy or laparotomy for ectopic pregnancy.Thirty-two patients with unilateral salpingectomy performed for ectopic pregnancy were recruited: 18 through laparoscopy and 14 through laparotomy. Ultrasound scans were performed in the early follicular phase.Ovarian volume, antral follicle count and 3D power Doppler indices were comparable between the operated and the non-operated sides in the whole group and in the laparotomy group. The antral follicle count and 3D power Doppler indices were significantly reduced on the operated side in the laparoscopy group.Ovarian function seems to be impaired after laparoscopic unilateral salpingectomy at short-term assessment.
