Early endocrine, metabolic, and sonographic characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): comparison between nonobese and obese adolescents. Approximately half of all women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are overweight or obese, and studies have reported endocrine and metabolic differences between lean and obese women with PCOS. PCOS has not been as extensively investigated in the adolescent population. The objectives of our study were to further characterize early endocrine and metabolic alterations in adolescents with PCOS and to determine whether differences between nonobese and obese women with PCOS are present early in its course. We studied an ethnically heterogeneous group of 48 adolescents: 11 nonobese with PCOS [age, 16.1 +/- 1.9 yr body mass index (BMI), 22.5 +/- 1.5 kg/m(2)], 22 obese with PCOS (age, 15.5 +/- 1.4 yr
