An unusual abdominal lumpa--a case report. A 58 years old male presented with a self detected upper abdominal mass of 6 months duration along with recent history of weight loss and malaise. Ultrasonography (USG) of abdomen showed a hypoechoic mass with cystic areas, approximately 10 cm x 7 cm in measurement, occupying the upper abdomen and lying in front of the stomach. Endoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the anterior wall of the stomach without any detectable abnormality of the gastric and duodenal mucosa. CT scan of the abdomen showed a well defined heterogeneous mass with cystic areas, attached to the anterior stomach wall by a narrow stalk. Surgical resection of the mass along with a strip of stomach wall adjoining the stalk and the adherent omentum was performed. Few lymph nodes were sampled. Biopsy report suggested gastric leiomyoma and the lymph nodes did not reveal any tumour deposit. Patient is doing well more than a year after surgery.
