Reduced ovarian function in long-term survivors of radiation- and chemotherapy-treated childhood cancer. Seventy percent of children with cancer survive. Radiation and chemotherapy may, however, impair ovarian function. The aim of this population-based study was to achieve a comprehensive knowledge of the degree of ovarian damage. Ovarian function was evaluated in 100 childhood cancer survivors and 21 controls of similar age. Menstrual cycle pattern was recorded, and strictly timed ovarian sonography and hormonal assessment were performed. The median age of the survivors was 5.4 yr (range, 0.1-15.3) at the time of diagnosis and 25.7 yr (18.5-44.4) at study entry. Seventeen survivors with premature ovarian failure had follicle-depleted or nondetectable ovaries, elevated FSH and LH, and immeasurable inhibin B. Thirteen survivors used oral contraception. Survivors with spontaneous menstrual cycles (n = 70) had smaller ovarian volume per ovary than controls (median, 4.8 vs. 6.8 cm(3) P < 0.001) and a lower number of antral follicles per ovary (median, 7.5 vs. 11
