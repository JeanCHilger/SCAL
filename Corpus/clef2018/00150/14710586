Insulin resistance and lipid profile in women with polycystic appearing ovaries: implications with regard to polycystic ovary syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate carbohydrate and lipid profiles in women with polycystic appearing ovaries (PCO) on ultrasound examination who did not fulfill the criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We sonographically evaluated and biochemically diagnosed 35 patients with PCO, 31 women with PCOS and 23 healthy controls. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and calculated the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and the homeostatic model assessment (HOMAIR) scores. Serum fasting insulin levels, 1-h insulin response, HOMAIR and QUICKI scores were significantly higher in the PCO and PCOS groups than in the controls. However, serum fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin levels, HOMAIR and QUICKI scores were similar in women with PCO and PCOS. In women with PCO, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were higher, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride levels were lower compared with women with PCOS. Furthermore, insulin responses to OGTT, HOMAIR and QUICKI scores and lipid values correlated with serum androgen levels and body mass index (BMI) in PCO patients. In conclusion, women with PCO who do not fulfill the criteria for PCOS have abnormal insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance. The finding of similar insulin abnormalities in women with PCO to those in women with PCOS confirms that women with PCO have similar metabolic characteristics to those with PCOS.
