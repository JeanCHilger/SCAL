Diagnostic value of sonohysterography in the evaluation of submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps. To evaluate the diagnostic value of sonohysterography in the evaluation of submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps.Thirty-two women whose preliminary transvaginal ultrasound suggested endometrial abnormality underwent sonohysterography. The findings were then compared with histopathological results.The sonohysterographic diagnosis was fibroid in seven patients, endometrial polyp in 23 patients and simple hyperplasia in two patients. Histopathological findings confirmed our diagnosis in all except three patients with endometrial polyps, who had normal secretory endometrium. Sonohysterography was found to have a sensitivity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 90% and diagnostic accuracy of 90.6%.Sonohysterography is a useful, minimally invasive and accurate technique to evaluate the pathologies involving endometrium and uterine cavity.
