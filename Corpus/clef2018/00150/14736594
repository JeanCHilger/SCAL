Polycystic ovary syndrome in pubertal period: clinical, biological, metabolic and genetic polymorphism. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common cause of hyperandrogenism in adolescent girls. In its complete post menarchal expression, the syndrome is characterized by the association of typical clinical, biological, and ultrasonographic findings. Many factors have contributed to our knowledge of different clinical forms of PCOS in adolescent girls. They are helpful for clarifying misleading situations in a period of life when diagnosis of PCOS implies a treatment for many years and may interfere with gynecological outcome. During the last 3 years, we had the opportunity to manage in our unit 45 adolescent girls with ovarian hyperandrogenism: 32 of them had PCOS and the other 13 functional ovarian hyperandrogenism defined by clinical and biological hyperandrogenism without ultrasonographic abnormality. In this review, we report, from our personal experience as well as from recent literature data, the different clinical expressions of PCOS in the pubertal period: the classical post menarchal form, the exceptional pre menarchal form, the post precocious pubarche and the post precocious puberty forms, the familial expression as well as the dominant metabolic expression.
