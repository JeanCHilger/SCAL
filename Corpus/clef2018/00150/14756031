Sono-hysterosalpingography in the assessment of tubal infertility. The assessment of the fallopian tubes patency is an important moment in the investigation for infertility. Vaginal sonographic hydrotubation was assessed in the evaluation of uterine configuration and tubal patency. In addition, technique using "agitated" saline during transvaginal sonography was evaluated. Ultrasound was more effective in detecting abnormalities of both interstitial and distal parts of the tube compared with hysterosalpingography. Sonohysterosalpingography is cheaper, may be performed in the office and also the pelvic irradiation is avoided.
