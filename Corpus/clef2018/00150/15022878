Tubo-ovarian abscess occurring 16 years after supracervical hysterectomy. Supracervical hysterectomy is seldom performed and there are few reports of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) after supracervical hysterectomy.The case of a 49-year-old woman with a right TOA is reported. This patient had received a supracervical hysterectomy 16 years earlier due to rupture of the uterus. At this admission, she presented with complaints of, lower abdominal pain and fever. Bimanual and transvaginal ultrasound examinations demonstrated a tender mass in the right adnexal region. Laparotomy, pathologic examination and microbiologic study confirmed the diagnosis of right TOA.After supracervical hysterectomy, patients may develop endocervicitis, parametritis and/or TOA. This series may be a subtype of ascending infections in the female genital tract.
