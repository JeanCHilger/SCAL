Laparoscopic cystectomy of an ovarian mucinous cystadenoma in a 12-year-old girl: a possible role of operative laparoscopy for a huge benign adnexal mass. The case of an obese 12-year-old girl with a huge and mobile pelvic cystic mass is presented. After ultrasonography and determination of tumor markers, a right huge benign adnexal mass was suspected. In order to avoid exploratory laparotomy because severe pain and a large operative scar were expected, an operative laparoscopy was performed. No intra-operative and post-operative complications were observed. With the uneventful recovery, only a one-day hospital stay was needed. Neither residual nor recurrent evidence was suspected after 2-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months follow-up. With proper case selection, good pre-operative counseling and the operation performed under familiarity and good training in laparoscopy, laparoscopic management of a huge suspected benign adnexal mass is technically feasible. The benefits are reducing hospital stay, lowering morbidity, especially less pain and cosmetic acceptance of the operative scar.
