An ultrasound-based approach to the assessment of infertility, including the evaluation of tubal patency. An optimal initial infertility investigation protocol would be a process that is diagnostically accurate, expeditious, cost-effective, reliable and as minimally invasive as possible. In addition, the investigation should provide the clinician with useful prognostic information regarding possible future treatment. At present, extensive use of invasive procedures such as diagnostic hysteroscopy and laparoscopy is the standard at many fertility centres. Recent advances in gynaecological ultrasonography have shown that ultrasound can replace routine invasive investigative procedures. An ultrasound-based approach would make the basic infertility investigation less time-consuming and less expensive, but at the same time more acceptable to the majority of patients. This chapter describes an ultrasound-based approach to the assessment of infertility. In addition, the role of ultrasonography for assessment of the pelvic organs as a basic part of the initial investigation of an infertile couple is discussed and compared to more traditional invasive methods.
