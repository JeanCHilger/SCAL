The management of early pregnancy complications. Early pregnancy complications include miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, pregnancies of unknown location, adnexal masses and hydatidiform mole. The management of women with these complications has changed with the introduction of dedicated Early Pregnancy Units, with a shift away from a surgical approach to one based on an expectant or 'watch and wait' policy. This chapter describes the role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in the management of these women and critically evaluates the different treatment modalities available for the management of these complications. The management of miscarriage has largely changed from a surgical to an expectant or medical approach. The treatment of ectopic pregnancy (EP) is also being managed in a similar way as the condition is increasingly detected earlier. We will argue that EP should not be diagnosed on the basis of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy but rather by the positive visualization of an adnexal mass using TVS. If a pregnancy cannot be seen either inside or outside the uterus this should be described as a pregnancy of unknown location and managed expectantly until the outcome is confirmed.
