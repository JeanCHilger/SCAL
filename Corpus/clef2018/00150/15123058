Menorrhagia and abnormal bleeding before the menopause. Abnormal uterine bleeding before the menopause accounts for 20% of visits to the gynaecology clinic and almost 25% of gynaecological operations. The patient who presents with such bleeding presents two distinct but important challenges for the clinician. The first is the exclusion of cancer or hyperplasia the second is dealing with the annoyance as well as the fear that the bleeding engenders in the patient. Any attempt at appropriate therapy--whether surgical, hormonal or expectant--begins with an accurate diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound with saline infusion sonohysterography for selective patients has emerged as a safe, non-invasive and, inexpensive method of triaging patients with abnormal uterine bleeding in order to determine which patients require no further evaluation, blind endometrial sampling for a global endometrial process or visually directed endometrial sampling when pathology is thought to be focal.
