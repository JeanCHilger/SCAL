Multidetector CT and virtual endoscopy in the evaluation of the esophagus. In this prospective study, we assessed the diagnostic capabilities of multidetector computed tomography (CT) in various esophageal pathologic conditions. Thirty-three patients underwent a multidetector CT study after esophageal distention by means of effervescent powder administered after induction of pharmacologic esophageal hypotonia. All acquired images were post-processed with two- and three-dimensional software tools. The CT data were compared with the results of conventional radiology (33), endoscopy (28), endoscopy ultrasonography (14), or surgery (14). Follow-up ranged between 4 and 15 months. Esophageal distention in the upper and middle thirds was classified as "good" in 32 of 33 cases (97%) in the lower third, esophageal distention was "good" in 21 of 33 cases (64%). Final diagnoses were leiomyoma (six cases), squamous cell carcinoma (six), adenocarcinoma (four), esophageal infiltration by thyroid cancer (two), benign polyposis (two), chronic esophagitis (five), post-sclerotherapy stenosis (one), no abnormalities (seven). When good distention was achieved, the thickness of unaffected esophageal wall was less than 3 mm (range, 1.5-2.4 mm
