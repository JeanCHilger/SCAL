Effects of genistein on hot flushes in early postmenopausal women: a randomized, double-blind EPT- and placebo-controlled study. We evaluated and compared the effects of the phytoestrogen genistein, estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT), and placebo on hot flushes and endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women.Ninety healthy, postmenopausal women, 47 to 57 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive for 1 year continuous EPT (n = 30 1 mg 17beta-estradiol combined with 0.5 mg norethisterone acetate), the phytoestrogen genistein (n = 30By comparison with placebo, daily flushes reduced significantly by a mean of 22% (95% CI: -38 to -6.2 P < 0.01) after 3 months, by a mean of 29% (95% CI: -45 to -13The present study confirms that genistein might have positive effects on hot flushes without a negative impact on endometrial thickness and suggests a future role of this phytoestrogen as a strategically therapeutic alternative in the management of postmenopausal symptoms.
