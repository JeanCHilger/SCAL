Correlation between transvaginal ultrasound measured endometrial thickness and histopathological findings in Afro-Caribbean Jamaican women with postmenopausal bleeding. Postmenopausal bleeding is traditionally investigated with invasive procedures. Recent studies in white populations have suggested that these procedures can be avoided, as ultrasonographic endometrial thickness of < 5 mm is not associated with malignancy. We performed a prospective study in 75 Jamaican Afro-Caribbean women with postmenopausal bleeding to determine whether an endometrial thickness of < 5 mm excluded endometrial cancer. We also examined the aetiology of postmenopausal bleeding and looked for possible risk factors. Double-layer transvaginal ultrasonographic measurement of the endometrial thickness was followed by hysteroscopy, suction curettage and histopathological confirmation. Correlation between imaging and pathology was not reliable. Half the patients with endometrial cancer had an endometrial thickness of between 3 mm and 4 mm. Seventy per cent of the women with endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm had benign pathology. Additionally, the following characteristics were found to be more strongly associated with women with endometrial cancer: age over 65 years and 5 or more years since menopause. However parity < 2 appeared not to have a significant effect.
