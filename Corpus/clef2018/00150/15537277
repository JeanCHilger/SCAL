Curettage of uterine cavity in late puerperal bleeding. Sixty eight (68) female patients were subjected to curettage caused by late puerperal bleeding. The above group is considered as 0.8% of all the female patients who delivered children during the period of research. The most frequent causes of bleeding were: abnormal desquamation of decidua (48.5%), residua of secundines (32.4%), and endometritis (14.7%). Prior to curettage, every patient was subjected to ultrasonographic examination. The suspicion of residual secundines, found in ultrasonographic examination was later confirmed in 36.8% of patients. No significant interdependence between the results of ultrasonographic and histopathological examinations, were noted. The disturbances in natural process of decidua excretion were rarely diagnosed in ultrasonographic pictures (3%) when puerperal bleeding required curettage of uterine cavity.
