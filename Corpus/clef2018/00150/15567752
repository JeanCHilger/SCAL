Diagnosis and treatment of polypoid lesions of the gallbladder: report of 194 cases. With the wide use of B-ultrasonography in recent years, the polypoid lesion of the gallbladder (PLG) has been one of the most common diseases detected in biliary surgery. This study was to investigate the diagnostic method and operative indications of PLG.The clinical and pathological data of 194 patients with PLG who had received operation at our hospital from January 1994 to September 2002 were analyzed retrospectively. Categorized data were analyzed by the chi-square test.All the patients received preoperative B-ultrasonography. 185 of the 194 PLG patients were diagnosed as having cholecystic polyp, and 9 adenomas. Among the 42 patients who received CT, 6 showed early gallbladder cancer. Pathologically, cholesterol polyps were mostly multiple lesions (64.7%) with a mean diameter of 3.86+/-2.2 mm in 136 patients. Of 16 patients with adenomas, 10 had a tumor diameter of more than 10 mm (62.5%). In 11 patients with gallbladder carcinoma, 7 were accompanied with gallbladder stone (63.6%). In addition, inflammatory polyps and adenomyomas were found in 25 and 6 patients respectively.B-ultrasonography is the most effective diagnostic method for detecting PLG. When large or irregular lesions are found, CT should be performed in order to avoid missing of gallbladder carcinoma. Operative indications for PLG include: a maximal tumor diameter of more than 10 mm an over 50-year-old patient with a widebase and a single polyp lesion
