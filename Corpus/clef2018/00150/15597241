Jejunal intussusception of an inflammatory fibrinoid polyp. Intussusception of parts of the intestine in adulthood is a rare cause of ileus. In more than 90 % of all cases there is a malignant or benign tumour situated in the parts of the intestine affected. We describe a 55-year-old patient who was admitted to hospital as an emergency because of signs of a proximal intestinal obstruction. Abdominal sonography suggested the diagnosis of a typical jejunal intussusception, whereas gastroscopy yielded no pathological findings. Laparotomy was performed immediately and confirmed the diagnosis. After intraoperative de-invagination 9 cm of jejunum and an inflammatory fibrinoid polyp of 3 cm were resected.
