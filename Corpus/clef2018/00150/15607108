MRI of endocervical glandular disorders: three cases of a deep nabothian cyst and three cases of a minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma. The incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma is increasing. Nabothian cysts are a common gynecologic condition if multiple and/or large cysts are present, it is difficult to differentiate them from a minimal-deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), which is classified as a special type of cervical adenocarcinoma. We report three cases of deep nabothian cysts and three cases of MDAs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, signs, and symptoms of these cases are described. The absence of a watery discharge and an MR image displaying a round or oval cyst without enhancement after intravenous gadolinium are helpful in the diagnosis of a deep nabothian cyst.
