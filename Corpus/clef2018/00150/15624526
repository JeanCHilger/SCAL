Female paraurethral leiomyoma: ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Primary benign paraurethral tumors in females are observed only rarely. They may occasionally be detected at physical examination or present with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. A leiomyoma originating from the smooth muscle fibers of the urethra in a 43-year-old woman is reported. The benign nature of the lesion was suspected on the basis of transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical enucleation was performed and light microscopy showed a well-differentiated smooth muscle tumor.
