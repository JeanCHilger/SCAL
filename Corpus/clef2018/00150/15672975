Multiple dermoid cysts within the same ovary: our experience of a rare case with review of the literature. Ovarian dermoid cysts are relatively frequent ovarian lesions that can be easily diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography. However, the recognition of multiple dermoid cysts, separated by normal ovarian tissue, within a single ovary is rare.We present a case with bilateral dermoid cysts, four dermoid cysts within the right ovary and one in the contralateral ovary. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed hyperechogenic areas in the right ovary with a hypoechogenic area in front of them the hyperechogenic areas were separated by areas with the echogenicity of normal ovarian tissue and indentation, suggesting the presence of multiple dermoid cysts within the same ovary.Preoperative ultrasonographic suspicion of multiple dermoid cysts within the same ovary might contribute to a better decision about the surgical approach.
