Sonographic imaging of the paediatric female pelvis. Several conditions necessitate a pelvic ultrasound in their management. In this paper, we will first review the embryology of the female genital system and the normal morphology of the uterus and ovaries from birth to puberty. Thereafter, this paper aims to categorise pelvic pathologies based on their clinical presentations. We will consider successively ambiguous genitalia, precocious puberty, delayed puberty and amenorrhea, gynaecological masses and, finally, pelvic pain of gynaecological origin. Ultrasound is the key screening tool and often the only examination indicated. The appropriateness of other modalities, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, will be discussed. The aim of this article is to help radiologists form a sensible imaging plan when presented with a diagnostic dilemma involving the pelvis in female children.
