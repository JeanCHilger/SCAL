Low-dose CT colonography in children: initial experience, technical feasibility, and utility. CT colonography (CTC) is utilized as a diagnostic tool in the detection of colon polyps and early colorectal cancer in adults. Large studies in the literature, although focused on adult populations, have shown CTC to be a safe, accurate, non-invasive technique.We evaluated the technical feasibility of CTC in children using a low-dose technique.From November 2001 to April 2004 we evaluated eight patients (3-17 years) with non-contrast CTC. Seven of the patients had CTC, followed by standard colonoscopy (SC) the same day in one patient, CTC followed a failed SC. CTC results were compared to results of SC. The estimated effective dose from each CTC was calculated and compared to that of standard barium enema.CTC results were consistent with those of SC. Sensitivity for polyps 5-10 mm was 100%, and sensitivity for polyps 10 mm and larger was 66.7%. The estimated mean effective dose was 2.17 mSv for CTC, compared to the 5-6 mSv for a standard air-contrast barium enema in a small child.Our initial experience shows CTC in children is well-tolerated, safe, and useful. The procedure can be performed successfully with a low radiation dose, and preliminary results compare well with SC.
