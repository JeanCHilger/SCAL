Three-dimensional power Doppler vascular sampling: a new method for predicting ovarian cancer in vascularized complex adnexal masses. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of a new concept ("vascular sampling") as a third step to discriminate benign and malignant lesions in B-mode and color Doppler sonographically suggestive adnexal masses.Forty-five women (mean age, 52.3 years range, 17-82 years) with the diagnosis of complex adnexal masses on B-mode sonography were evaluated using 3-dimensional power Doppler sonography. Four women had bilateral masses. After a morphologic reevaluation was done, color pulsed Doppler sonography was used to obtain flow velocity waveforms, and velocimetric indices were calculated (resistive index, pulsatility index, and peak systolic velocity). Thereafter, 3-dimensional power Doppler sonography was used to assess vascularization of highly suggestive areas (gross papillary projections, solid areas, and thick septations), meaning a focused assessment ("sampling") of a suggestive area of the tumor. With a virtual organ computer-aided analysis program, vascular indices (vascularization index, flow index, and vascular flow index) were automatically calculated. A definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained in each case.Forty masses (82%) were malignant and 9 (18%) were benign. Morphologic evaluation revealed 10 (20%) unilocular solid masses, 20 (41%) multilocular solid masses, and 19 (39%) mostly solid masses. Blood flow was found in all cases. Median vascularization index (15.5% versus 8.2% P = .002), flow index (33.6 versus 20.8Three-dimensional power Doppler vascular sampling seems to be a promising tool for predicting ovarian cancer in vascularized complex adnexal masses. It could be better than conventional color pulsed Doppler imaging.
