Computerized fluorocolposcopy--the significance in evaluation and therapy of early cervical lesions. Understanding of cervical cancer biology has made it was possible to determine intraepithelial lesions in the early stage of carcinogenesis.The aim of the study was to design the computer model of colour analysis of fluorocolposcopic pictures, based on biology evaluation of early epithelial cervical lesions. From the other hand increasing non-radical treatment efficacy by the precise visualisation of the biopsy place and borderlines of therapeutic tissue destruction, using digital model of colours analysis. All colours typical of Berthalanffy technique were characterised by 3D mathematical, digital model in the range of primary colours (R-red G-green
