Accuracy of MR imaging combined with sonography for the diagnosis of persistent adnexal masses during pregnancy: about nine cases. To evaluate the accuracy of MR imaging combined with sonography for the diagnosis of persistent adnexal masses during pregnancy.From January 1999 to November 2003, nine patients with a persistent adnexal masse were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent both transvaginal and transabdominal sonography combined with MR imaging. Accuracy of imaging techniques was evaluated by comparison with histology.Adnexal masse was detected by systematic sonography in six women whereas three patients were symptomatic. Mean gestational age at the diagnosis was 17 weeks of amenorrhea (range 5-36). Mean tumor size was 96 mm (range 2-15). Two patients underwent a surgery during pregnancy one for acute abdominal pain related to an adnexal torsion and the second for suspicion of malignancy. One patient underwent a caesarean delivery for obstetrical reasons. In all patients, benign ovarian tumours were found. For eight patients the diagnosis suspected by imaging techniques was confirmed by histology.The combination of sonography and MR imaging allows diagnosing accurately adnexal masses during pregnancy.
