A three-dimensional definition of nodal spaces on the basis of CT images showing enlarged nodes for pelvic radiotherapy. To demonstrate that margins of each pelvic chain may be derived by verifying the bony and soft tissue structures around abnormal nodes on computed tomography (CT) slices.Twenty consecutive patients (16 males, 4 females mean age, 66 yearsThe more proximal structures to each enlarged node or group of nodes were thus recorded in a clockwise direction.According to their frequency and visibility, craniocaudal, anterior, lateral, posterior and medial margins of common iliac, external and internal iliac nodal chains, obturator and pudendal nodes, and deep and superficial inguinal nodes were derived from CT observations.
