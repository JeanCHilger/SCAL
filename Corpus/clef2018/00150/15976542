Hysteroscopy and menopause: past and future. The main aim in investigating post-menopausal women is to exclude endometrial cancer. The purpose of this review is to define up-to-date clinical guidelines for the management of all post-menopausal women (asymptomatic as well as symptomatic).Thanks to improvements in both the technology and the technique, hysteroscopy has become a simple and painless procedure that can easily be performed in an office or outpatient setting without any particular discomfort for the patient. The new, easier procedure, well tolerated by patients, has excellent diagnostic and surgical accuracy. Assuming that office hysteroscopy could offer a better visualization of the uterine cavity without increasing patient discomfort if compared to ultrasound, various authors have recently proposed the use of hysteroscopy as a first-line procedure in the approach to the menopausal patient. This could be defined as a change in strategy that has yielded very interesting results in terms of a better understanding of the appearance of the uterine cavity and the clinical value of small intra-cavitary pathologies (and their related treatment), particularly in asymptomatic women.Hysteroscopy can be considered a routine outpatient method providing immediate results and causing minimal discomfort, especially when performed with the vaginoscopic approach. This technique has ushered in a new era of very-low-cost hysteroscopy, because only the hysteroscope is required in the outpatient procedure, with no need for additional instruments, medication, extra personnel or dedicated theatre. The time taken is comparable to that required for transvaginal sonography.
