The value of sonohysterography in detecting intracavitary benign abnormalities. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the diagnostic value and the usefulness of sonohysterography in the detection of uterine intracavitary benign abnormalities, compared with other diagnostic methods (transvaginal ultrasonography and diagnostic hysteroscopy). From January 2003 to December 2003, a total of 73 patients (47 premenopausal (middle age 38.9) and 26 postmenopausal women (middle age 60.5)) underwent transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) and sonohysterography (SHG), consisting of an intrauterine infusion of saline solution during transvaginal ultrasound. The women referred to our Ultrasonography Center because of intermenstrual (38) or postmenopausal bleeding (19), or an abnormal or a poorly defined endometrial interface (16) as seen as baseline ultrasonography. The findings at TVS and SHG were compared with hysteroscopy (HS). In one case, the SHG was technically impossible to perform. In premenopausal group the sensitivity of SHG had been 100% in detecting submucosal fibroids, endometrial polyps and hyperplasia and 75% in detecting normal uterus. The specificity had been always 100%. In postmenopausal group the sensitivity of SHG had been 75% in detecting submucosal fibroids, 93.8% in endometrial polyps and 100% in hyperplasia and normal uterus. The specificity had been 100% in submucosal fibroids and hyperplasia and had been 90.0 and 95.5% in endometrial polyps and normal uterus, respectively. SHG allows to obtain a precise diagnosis of benign uterine pathology and it is more accurate in the diagnosis of intracavitary abnormalities than that obtained by TVS. Preoperative use of SHG may assist in choosing the best surgical treatment for the patient.
