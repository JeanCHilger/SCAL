Adenosarcoma of the uterus: a case report. Adenosarcoma of the uterus has two components: a benign epithelial proliferation and a stromal sarcoma. The purpose of this work was to report the clinical aspects and therapeutic modalities of an exceptional case of uterine adenosarcoma in a 15-year-old girl revealed by pelvic pain. Physical examination disclosed a polypoid formation protruding through the hymenal orifice. Histology of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of adenosarcoma of the uterus. The patient underwent hysterectomy and was given chemotherapy. This rare tumor (8% of uterine sarcomas) generally requires hysterectomy. Prognosis is relatively favorable.
