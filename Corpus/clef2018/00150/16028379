Sclerosing stromal ovarial tumor--a case report and review. Sclerosing stromal tumor (SST) is a rare benign ovarian neoplasm of stromal origin with less than 100 cases reported in the literature. Unlike the other stromal tumors, the comas and fibromas, which tend to occur in the fifth and sixth decades, sclerosing stromal tumors predominantly affect females in the second and third decades. Several unique histologic features including pseudolobulation, sclerosis and prominent vascularity of the tumor are clearly reflected at ultrasonography. We present a case of SST of the ovary in a 26-year-old female, and describe the ultrasound findings with pathologic correlation.
