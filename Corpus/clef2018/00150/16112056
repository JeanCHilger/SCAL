Renal leiomyoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus in a pediatric transplant patient. Renal leiomyoma is a rare smooth muscle tumor of the kidney. An association between Epstein-Barr virus and smooth muscle tumors in immunocompromised patients recently has been recognized. We describe a pediatric renal transplant patient who developed an Epstein-Barr virus-associated renal leiomyoma in his transplant kidney 5 years posttransplantation. Possible factors involved in the tumor pathogenesis in our patient are discussed, including immunosuppression, growth hormone therapy, and Epstein-Barr virus induction.
