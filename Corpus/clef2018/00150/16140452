Are there differences in ultrasound parameters between Chinese women with polycystic ovaries only and with polycystic ovary syndrome? We aimed to compare antral follicle count (AFC), ovarian volume, ovarian stromal blood flow between Chinese women with polycystic ovary (PCO) only and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to evaluate the effect of age on these ultrasound parameters in these women.In the second to fourth day of the period, they underwent a transvaginal three-dimensional scanning with power Doppler to determine total AFC, total ovarian volume, total ovarian vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). Hormonal profile was also measured.A total of 71 Chinese women were recruited in the study: 39 women with PCO only and 32 women with PCOS. Women with PCO only had significantly lower AFC, ovarian volume, ovarian VI, serum LH, testosterone and DHEAS concentrations but higher serum SHBG concentration when compared with PCOS women. When women with PCO only and PCOS were considered together, the rate of decline of AFC over age was 0.905 follicle per year (95% CI=0.008-1.803, p=0.048) and there was no significant decline of ovarian volume and total ovarian VI, FI and VFI over age.PCO only represents a milder end of the PCOS spectrum.
