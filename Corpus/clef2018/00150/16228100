Clinics in diagnostic imaging (106). Viable left tubal twin ectopic pregnancy. Live twin ectopic gestations are extremely rare. There are more than 100 reported twin tubal pregnancies but less than ten have foetal cardiac motions demonstrated in both embryos. We describe an additional patient with live twin ectopic gestation. A 32-year-old woman presented with increasing left-sided abdominal pains. She had a high beta-hCG level and a significant history of subfertility with previous surgical intervention. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed viable left tubal twin ectopic pregnancy. The diagnosis was confirmed at surgery. Factors that contribute to the risk of ectopic pregnancy, diagnosis and the management of this condition are described.
