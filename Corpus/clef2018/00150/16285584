Sequential recurrences of ovarian granulosa cell tumour 10 and 11 years after initial diagnosis as haemoperitoneum and subhepatic mass: a case report and review of the literature. Adult granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) are rare ovarian neoplasms characterised by an indolent course and a propensity for late recurrence. Due to frequent endocrine manifestations most GCTs are diagnosed at an early stage. However, clinical behaviour can not be safely predicted on the basis of conventional clinicopathologic parameters. Surgery remains the cornerstone of therapeutic management. We report on a rare case of a Stage IA GCT twice recurring ten and 11 years after initial surgical treatment. The first recurrence presented as an acute abdomen due to haemoperitoneum after tumour rupture. The second recurrence presented as a subhepatic mass. This case emphasises the need for extended, lifelong follow-up even for patients with early stage, apparently completely removed GCTs. Prognostic parameters and therapeutic options especially for patients with recurrent disease are discussed.
