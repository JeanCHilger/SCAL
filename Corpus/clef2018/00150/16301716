Three- and 4-dimensional ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology: proceedings of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine Consensus Conference. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine convened a panel of physicians and scientists with interest and expertise in 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology to discuss the current diagnostic benefits and technical limitations in obstetrics and gynecology and consider the utility and role of this type of imaging in clinical practice now and in the future. This conference was held in Orlando, Florida, June 16 and 17, 2005. Discussions considered state-of-the-art applications of 3D ultrasound, specific clinical situations in which it has been found to be helpful, the role of 3D volume acquisition for improving diagnostic efficiency and patient throughput, and recommendations for future investigations related to the utility of volume sonography in obstetrics and gynecology.
