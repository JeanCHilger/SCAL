Follow-up of successful bilateral placement of Essure microinserts with ultrasound. To evaluate the reliability of pelvic X-ray and transvaginal ultrasound to localize Essure microinserts (Conceptus, San Carlos, California) after successful placement in both fallopian tubes 3 months after placement.Prospective, observational study.Gynecology departments at two teaching hospitals.One hundred eighty-two patients who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization by placement of Essure microinserts between August 2002 and August 2004.Transvaginal ultrasound, pelvic X-ray, and hysterosalpingography (HSG) 3 months after sterilization with Essure.Transvaginal ultrasound confirmation of correct localization of microinserts after a 3-month follow-up.In 150 of 182 patients, confirmation of successful bilateral placement of two microinserts (300 devices) was possible. In 9 patients it was not possible to identify both devices with ultrasound, or there was doubt about the extension of the device through the uterotubal junction. The other 291 devices were identified as being in a good position.Hysterosalpingography at the 3-month follow-up after successful placement of Essure microinserts can be replaced by transvaginal ultrasonography. A 3-month follow-up with HSG after the Essure procedure is only required after unsatisfactory placements. In those patients in whom transvaginal ultrasonography cannot confirm satisfactory localization, a complementary pelvic X-ray should be performed.
