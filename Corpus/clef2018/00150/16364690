Screening for ovarian cancer in the general population. Screening for ovarian cancer in the general population presents several unique challenges. Without a clearly identified premalignant state, efforts have focused on detection of early stage disease. Towards this end, investigators have focused on the use of serum markers and transvaginal ultrasound. CA125 determination is the most reliable serum marker in use, and utilization of serial measurements to calculate risk of cancer appears to have greater utility than evaluation of a single value. Multimodality screening focuses on combining serial CA125 measurement with transvaginal ultrasound follow-up for those with abnormal values. Large prospective trials, such as the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), are currently underway to assess the impact of various screening strategies on mortality, and to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and morbidity of screening. Future research efforts will undoubtedly focus on promising techniques to examine the serum proteosome for patterns to identify early ovarian cancer.
