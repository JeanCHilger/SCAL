Ultrasonography-guided transvaginal endometrial biopsy: a useful technique in patients with cervical stenosis. In patients with failed dilatation and curettage due to stenotic cervix, options for endometrial sampling are limited. We propose the ultrasonography-guided transvaginal endometrial biopsy.Two postmenopausal women presented with bleeding and failed dilatation and curettage due to a stenotic cervix. Under direct transvaginal ultrasound guidance, a 20-gauge needle was inserted through the vaginal vault and anterior uterine wall into the endometrium. The endometrium was aspirated, and specimen was submitted to cytology. One patient had endometrial adenocarcinoma and underwent a staging procedure. The other patient had a benign cytology and was followed up clinically.The ultrasonography-guided endometrial biopsy is a viable option for endometrial sampling in the presence of stenotic cervix.
