Ovarian stromal vascularity is not predictive of ovarian response and pregnancy. The role of ovarian stromal vascularity in the prediction of the ovarian response and pregnancy in infertile women was evaluated by comparing age of women, body mass index (BMI), basal FSH concentration, antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian stromal vascularity indices measured by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound. A total of 111 women in their first IVF cycle were analysed. They were aged <40 years with basal FSH concentration <10 IU/l on recruitment for IVF treatment. AFC, mean ovarian volume and mean ovarian 3D power Doppler flow indices were determined on day 2 of the treatment cycle prior to a standard regimen of ovarian stimulation. Ovarian response was represented by the number of oocytes, serum oestradiol, the duration and dosage of gonadotrophins. AFC achieved the best predictive value in relation to the number of oocytes obtained, followed by age of women and BMI. Basal FSH concentration was the only predictive factor for the duration and dosage of gonadotrophin used. Mean ovarian 3D power Doppler flow indices were not predictive of pregnancy in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Ovarian 3D power Doppler flow indices measured after pituitary down-regulation were not predictive of the ovarian response and pregnancy in the IVF treatment.
