Ultrasonically verified vesicouterine fistula. We report a case of a vesicouterine fistula occurring after a Caesarean section. There was a noticeable delay in recognizing the fistula, which was, however, clearly visible on a vaginal ultrasound scanning. When urinary incontinence is developed after gynaecologic or obstetric surgery, a fistula must be suspected.
