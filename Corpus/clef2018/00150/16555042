Meningothelial meningioma in a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. Mature teratomas belong to the group of germ cell tumors of the ovary. They account for 27-44% of all ovarian neoplasms and up to 58% of all benign tumors of the ovary. In mature as well as in immature teratomas, secondary tumors originating from the three embryonic tissue components may be found. These tumors can show benign or malignant behavior. We report the case of a meningothelial meningioma, found within a mature teratoma of a 32 year old female. The characteristic histomorphology and immunohistochemical expression for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and desmoplakin are diagnostic.
