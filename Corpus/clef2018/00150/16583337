Cardiac tamponade in a neonate with cardiac tumour. A case of a neonate with a life-threatening cardiac tamponade due to cardiac tumour is presented. Pericardiocentesis was performed and 300 ml of purulent fluid was evacuated. Pericardial drainage was undertaken. Six months later cardiac tamponade recurred and was again successfully treated with pericardial drainage. A subsequent 10-month follow-up was uneventful. Diagnosis and treatment of cardiac tumours associated with pericardial effusion are discussed.
