Multifollicular ovaries in female adolescents with cystic fibrosis. To assess hormonal status and morphology of ovaries in cystic fibrosis (CF) adolescents.Prospective study.University teaching hospital.Female adolescents: 18 with CF and 18 normal.Transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography and venipuncture.Hormone profile and ultrasound examination of ovaries and uterus.Levels of LH, LH/FSH, androstenedione, and PRL were significantly higher in the CF adolescents. Levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were significantly lower and had negative correlation with percentage of body fat. Percentage of body fat and body mass index were significantly lower in CF and had significant correlation. Levels of E2, FSH, T, and DHEAS were comparable in the two groups. Ultrasound revealed cysts in eight (44%) of the CF subjects six of these had LH/FSH >3, and three had been operated for ovarian torsion. Nine out of all of the CF subjects (50%) had DM. No obesity, hirsutism, or acne was observed. The Shwachman score was 87.44 +/- 4.83 and correlated significantly with the percentage of body fat.Multifollicular ovaries were frequent in CF adolescents. Hormone changes characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome were detected. The low T levels, despite low SHBG, and the absence of hirsutism or acne may be a result of a lower percentage of body fat, disturbances at the pilosebaceous-adipocyte endocrine unit, or mechanical or other causes.
