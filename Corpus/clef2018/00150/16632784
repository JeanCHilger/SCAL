The Z technique: an easy approach to the display of the mid-coronal plane of the uterus in volume sonography. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the ease of learning and clinical applicability of a technique (Z technique) for display of the mid-coronal plane of the uterus in volume sonography.Eight physicians were randomly assigned to 2 groups, A and B, after being instructed on the basic principles of post processing of sonographic volumes. Physicians in group A were asked to individually display the mid-coronal plane of the uterus in each of five 3-dimensional volumes of uteri. Physicians in group B were instructed on the Z technique and were then asked to individually display the mid-coronal plane of the uterus in the same volumes as group A. The time needed for display of the mid-coronal plane of the uterus and the quality of the mid-coronal plane image retrieved were recorded for each volume.The mean time required to display the mid-coronal plane of the uterus for all volumes was 47.7 seconds in group B compared with 110.7 seconds in group A (P=.002). Furthermore, a significant improvement in time performance was seen for physicians in group A after learning the Z technique (23.2 seconds after compared with 110.7 seconds before P=.0001). The quality of the image produced was notably better for all physicians after learning the Z technique.The Z technique is an easy technique to learn. Physicians who learn this technique are able to retrieve the mid-coronal plane of the uterus faster and improve its image quality in volume sonography.
