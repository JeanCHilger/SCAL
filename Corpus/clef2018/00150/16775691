Three-dimensional MDCT imaging and CT esophagography for evaluation of esophageal tumors: preliminary study. The aim of this study was to determine whether multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) imaging, including CT esophagography (CTE), can be used as a comprehensive imaging test for esophageal tumors. Twenty-three patients with esophageal neoplasms underwent MDCT with esophageal distension and endoscopy. Of them, 20 underwent barium study. Two radiologists independently reviewed MDCT images with 3D CT esophagography (CTE) including CT endoscopy and were asked to determine the presence of the esophageal lesions and characterize them using a five-point confidence scale. The radiologists' performance for the lesion detection and characterization was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. They were also requested to determine the local staging of esophageal cancer, and the overall accuracies of MDCT for local staging were calculated. The ability of MDCT with CTE was also evaluated compared with conventional studies. CTE images successfully revealed 14 of 16 esophageal cancers and all seven submucosal tumors. Two esophageal cancers, both confined to the mucosal layer, were undetected. The Az values of the MDCT images were 0.954-0.957 for determining the presence of a lesion and 0.954-0.995 for differentiating between cancer and submucosal tumors. The overall accuracies for T and N staging were 42.9% and 85.7%, respectively. In 80% and 74% of cases, CTE gave similar or superior information to barium study and endoscopy, respectively. MDCT esophagography has the potential to serve as a comprehensive imaging modality for evaluating esophageal tumors as it provides accurate information regarding the detection and characterization of esophageal tumors as well as the similar information to conventional studies.
