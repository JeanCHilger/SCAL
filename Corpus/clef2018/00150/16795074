Imaging, morphologic, and immunohistochemical correlation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) recently have been distinguished morphologically, immunohistochemically, and genetically from other gastrointestinal-tract spindle cell neoplasms. The objective of this study was to correlate clinical and imaging findings with morphology and immunohistochemistry to diagnose GISTs and to differentiate them from other spindle cell lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.The authors reviewed 9 patients who had tumors that were diagnosed as GIST by image-guided and endosonographic-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with or without core biopsy (7 stomach tumors and 2 intraabdominal tumors). The male:female ratio was 3:6, and the patients ranged in age from 38 years to 80 years. Onsite evaluation, preliminary cytologic evaluation, and immunohistochemistry were provided for 6 patients. Immunostains were performed, depending on sample size, on aspirates and/or core biopsies.On imaging studies, most tumors were smooth and homogenous, consistent with GIST. Tumors ranged in size from 1.8 cm to 22 cm. The largest neoplasm showed solid/cystic and necrotic components. Aspirates consisted of spindle cell, neoplastic proliferation arranged in fascicles that exhibited focal, nuclear palisading indistinct, cytoplasmic bordersIn the setting of consistent clinical and radiologic findings, the combined use of cytomorphology and immunohistochemistry on FNA and/or core biopsy in most instances provides a reliable pathologic diagnosis of GIST. The need of sufficient material for performing ancillary studies and the usual impossibility of excluding malignancy are limitations of FNA cytology of GIST.
