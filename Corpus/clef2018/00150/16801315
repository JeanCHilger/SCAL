Rupture of uterine scar 3 weeks after vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC). Uterine scar rupture in vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC) usually occurs during labor or after placental extraction. We report herein the case of a patient who had a cesarean section in her first pregnancy and a VBAC in her second. The present one also ended with a normal VBAC and a documented intact scar, which then ruptured three weeks later.
