Early clinical detection of ovarian cancer: a review of the evidence. Subjective and objective evidence suggest that a third to half of patients developing ovarian cancer report symptoms at 3 or more months prior to diagnosis. Early ovarian cancer-associated symptoms constitute a constellation of mostly nongynecological complaints, suggesting a visceral disturbance, which do not point immediately to a pelvic origin. Abdominal bloating and pain predominate with recent onset and multiple symptomatic episodes. Gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms and fatigue/malaise may be part of the symptom complex. Women aged 50 years and older with this constellation of symptoms should have medical evaluation and, if symptoms are unexplained or persist, should undergo pelvic imaging (e.g., transvaginal ultrasound) and serum CA125.
