Recurrence rate of endometriomas following a laparoscopic cystectomy. The objectives were to observe the clinical course of patients who underwent laparoscopic cystectomy (LC) using transvaginal ultrasonography.The definition of "recurrence" was to detect a diffuse, hypoechoic area whose long axis was at least 2 centimeters (cm) on the transvaginal ultrasonogram during the postoperative follow-up period. Using the Cox regression test, we analyzed each patient's background variables, namely, patient's age, the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine score (r-ASRM score), use of gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa), and pregnancy during the observation period. Next, cyst size and multi-lobularity of each of the 417 cysts were also analyzed as recurrence risk factors per cyst.The mean postoperative observation period was 21.4+/-16.8 months. During the observation period, 50 (15.9%) out of 315 patients experienced recurrence and 51 (16.2%) out of 315 patients became pregnant. The cumulative recurrence rate per patient was 31.7% over 60 months. Among prognostic factors per patient, age and showed negative and r-ASRM scores positive correlations with cyst recurrence. On the other hand, we did not identify any cyst factors associated with recurrence. The patients who underwent hemilateral LC showed a 5.2% cyst recurrence rate in the ovary that appeared to be normal at the time of the initial surgery.Young age and severe endometriosis appeared to be the factors associated with high recurrence risk. Recurring ovarian endometrimas probably include cysts occurring spontaneously and those recurring from the cyst residues in the lesions where cystectomy has been performed.
