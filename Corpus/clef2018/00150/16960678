Minimal access approach to the management of large ovarian cysts. Laparoscopy has become an accepted method of management for ovarian cysts. Large ovarian cysts, however, have traditionally been, and continue to be treated by laparotomy. This is mainly due to technical difficulties and the possibility of malignancy. We describe four patients in whom laparoscopy was used to remove large ovarian cysts. Laparoscopic guided aspiration was performed, followed by extra-abdominal excision of the cyst. This approach has the advantages of minimising the risk of spillage of cyst fluid, a smaller incision compared to laparotomy, as well as faster recovery. We advocate this method for large unilocular benign cysts.
