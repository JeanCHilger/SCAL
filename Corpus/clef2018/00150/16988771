Dynamic pelvic three-dimensional computed tomography for investigation of pelvic abnormalities in patients with rectocele and rectal prolapse. Dynamic three-dimensional computed tomography (D-3DCT: high-speed helical scanning during defecation) was used for morphological evaluation of intrapelvic structures in patients with rectal prolapse and rectocele.Twenty-five patients with rectal prolapse or rectocele diagnosed by conventional defecography (CD) or clinical findings were additionally investigated with D-3DCT. D-3DCT images were acquired using a multislice CT system with a 16-row detector during simulated defecation. Helical scanning was performed with a slice thickness of 1 mm, a helical pitch of 15 s/rotation, and a table movement speed of 35 mm/s. The contrast medium, 100 ml of iopamidol (370 mg/ml), was injected at a rate of 2.5 ml/s to enhance contrast with other structures, and scan start was triggered by using a function for automatically determining the optimal scan timing.Among the eight patients with rectocele, additional intrapelvic disorders were diagnosed in five (enterocele, 4 cystocele, 1D-3DCT can be a useful diagnostic tool for investigation of pelvic pathology in patients with rectocele and rectal prolapse.
