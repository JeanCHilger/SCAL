Laparoscopic excision of a giant ovarian cyst after ultrasound-guided drainage. The laparoscopic approach to giant ovarian cysts in pediatric population may be difficult regarding the risk of cyst rupture and limited working space. We herein report a 16-year-old adolescent girl that presented with a giant ovarian cyst. To reduce the limitations of the laparoscopy, we performed laparoscopy after draining the cyst under ultrasonographic guidance. Under local anesthesia, a nephrostomy catheter was placed into the cyst by the Seldinger technique. During laparoscopy, abdominal cavity was explored by the scope and then the nephrostomy catheter was removed. Laparoscopic procedure was completed easily. No pre- and postoperative complications were encountered and the patient was discharged on the second postoperative day. The pathologic examination of the cyst revealed as follicular cyst. Laparoscopic excision of giant ovarian cysts after ultrasound-guided drainage seems to be safe and applicable treatment modality in children.
