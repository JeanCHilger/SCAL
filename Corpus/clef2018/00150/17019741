Reproducibility of the measurement of submucous fibroid protrusion into the uterine cavity using three-dimensional saline contrast sonohysterography. To determine the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of measurement of the percentage of protrusion of submucous fibroids into the uterine cavity using three-dimensional saline contrast sonohysterography (3D-SCSH).Women diagnosed with submucous uterine fibroids on B-mode two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound scan were invited to join the study and 3D-SCSH was carried out. 3D volume datasets were stored digitally and were examined later using the technique of planar reformatted sections. The reproducibilities of the measurement of fibroid diameter and protrusion ratio into the uterine cavity (ratio of the size of the segment of the fibroid protruding into the cavity to the total diameter of the fibroid) were examined by two independent observers who were unaware of the initial 2D scan findings. Interobserver reproducibility was assessed by calculating the difference between measurements taken by the two operators (limits of agreement) and interclass correlation coefficient. Intraobserver repeatability was assessed by calculating the difference between two measurements for each variable (limits of agreement) and further expressed as an intraclass correlation coefficient.Thirty-three 3D ultrasound volumes were examined. There was a good agreement between the observers in classifying the fibroids as greater or less than 50% confined to the myometrium (Cohen's kappa 0.81). There was no bias in measurements for both variables either between observers or with repeated measurements by each observer. For fibroid diameter and protrusion ratio the inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients were high (0.984-0.995), with narrow limits of agreement.3D-SCSH is a reproducible method for the quantification of the percentage of a submucous fibroid protruding into the uterine cavity.
