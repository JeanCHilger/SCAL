Monitoring ovarian stimulation: are hormonal assessments necessary?. Standard monitoring of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) includes hormone assays (estradiol, LH, progesterone) and regular pelvic ultrasound examination. We report a randomized study on an attempt to simplify monitoring of COH. Ultrasound monitoring of the cycle alone did not affect pregnancy rates and did not increase the risks of OHSS. These results encourage the future simplification of stimulation protocols.
