Peculiarities of the functional state of hypothalamus-hypophysis structures and endocrine status in patients with normogonadotropic primary-ovarian deficiency. 47 (aged from 17 to 30) women have been selected after the assay with exogenous estradiol, which proved the intactness of the mechanism of the negative feedback between ovaries and hypophysis. At the absence of genetic determination, significantly high indexes of premorbid are identified (infectious and viral diseases, surgical interventions into the area of pelvis minor, autoimmune processes). Menarche and the formation period are within the age norm limits menstrual irregularities are characterized by the hypomenstrual syndrome. In none of the cases voluminal processes in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal area were identified. The hormonal profile was characterized by significant (p<0.001) decrease of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), PRL (prolactin) and E(2) (estradiol). The impulse secretion of gonadotropins (had been studied in ten women) evidenced a normal secretion rhythm of gonadotropin releasing hormone by hypothalamus, while the assay with exogenous luliberin showed normal reactivity of gonadotrophs of the hypophysis to hypothalamic stimulation.
