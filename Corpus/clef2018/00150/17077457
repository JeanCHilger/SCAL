Ultrasound pecularities of various forms of normogonadotropic ovarian deficiency. As a result of examination of 237 (aged 16-31) women with various forms of gynecological neuroendocrine syndrome 3 groups of patients have been identified with identical ultrasonic characteristics of ovaries. The main complaints by the patients have been misbalance of menstrual periods. In 27 patients "diffuse loss of structure" was identified with vanishing of the borderline between the cortical and medullary substance with impaired folliculogenesis, developed against the autoimmune processes mainly (of the thyroid gland and ovaries). In 73 patients "diminished detailing of the structure of the follicular apparatus" is observed with absence of the development of the dominant follicle at ultrasonic monitoring. In this group of women hyperprolactinemia (in 97.3%) with sub-clinical course of hypothyreosis (in 49.5%) was identified. In 137 women "hyperplasia of the stroma of the ovary and uniform hardening with indispensable enlargement of the ovaries with single isometric follicular cavities" and considerable fibrosis of the capsule was identified in the absolute majority against the insulin-resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia".
