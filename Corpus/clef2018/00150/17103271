Impact of diagnostic laparoscopy on the management of chronic pelvic pain. Diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful tool, especially when there is no definite anatomical abnormality visible on imaging modalities. We assess the role and clinical impact of diagnostic laparoscopy in the management of women with chronic pelvic pain.Clinical data of 3,068 cases of diagnostic laparoscopy performed for chronic pelvic pain from June 1994 to August 2005 were analyzed. We compared the diagnoses after diagnostic laparoscopy and those after pelvic examination and imaging modalities such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), and we then checked the final pathologic diagnoses after operation.Pelvic endometriosis was the most common (60.2%) laparoscopic finding in patients with chronic pelvic pain in this study, followed by normal pelvic findings (21.2%) and pelvic congestion (13.0%). Diagnostic laparoscopy had an influence on correcting previous plans based on imaging modalities in 42.7% of patients such as discarding unnecessary procedures or introducing new diagnostic or therapeutic plans. There were 3 cases of major complications requiring immediate correction.Diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool for of women with chronic pelvic pain and can be used as a guideline for individualized treatment.
