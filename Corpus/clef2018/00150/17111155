Combining mid-trimester maternal plasma homocysteine with uterine artery doppler velocimetry: is it useful? To investigate the possible association between mid-trimester maternal plasma homocysteine concentration, uterine artery Doppler measurements in a two-stage screening strategy, and outcome of pregnancy.This prospective observational study was conducted on healthy women undergoing screening for pre-eclampsia by uterine artery Doppler velocimetry at 20-22 and 24-26 weeks of gestation. Abnormal uterine artery blood flow was defined as an average resistance index (RI) > 0.58 and/or bilateral early diastolic notch. Homocysteine measurement was performed by two competitive immunoassay methods involving two steps at 20-22 and 24-26 weeks' gestation.Sixty women enrolled. Abnormal Doppler findings were found in 18 of 60 (30%) women at 20-22 weeks of gestation. This proportion was reduced to 10% (6/60) at 24-26 weeks of gestation, and two of these six women developed pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the maternal plasma homocysteine levels in women with abnormal Doppler findings when compared with controls at first and second visits (p > 0.05).Mid-trimester maternal homocysteine concentration is not elevated in women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler findings in a two-stage screening method.
