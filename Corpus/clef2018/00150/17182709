Sonographic evaluation of the endometrium in patients with a history or an appearance of polycystic ovarian syndrome. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and significance of a thick, cystic-appearing endometrium in association with a history or an ovarian appearance of polycystic ovarian syndrome.An Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective medical record review of sonographic studies from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2005, found 245 patients with clinical features, a characteristic sonographic appearance of the ovaries, hormonal abnormalities, or a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. The sonographic thickness and appearance of the endometrium (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and histologic findings on biopsy were obtained.Two hundred twenty-seven patients had a homogeneous endometrium in the range of 1 to 17 mm (mean +/- SD, 6.4 +/- 3.1 mm) 18 patients had a heterogeneous endometrium in the range of 4 to 23 mm (mean, 13.2 +/- 5.6 mm). Of the 18 patients with a heterogeneous endometrium, 9 also had a sonographic finding of tiny cystic foci within the endometrium. Of these, 5 had endometrial biopsy, resulting in 2 cases of a proliferative endometrium and 1 case each of simple hyperplasia, hyperplasia with atypia, and scant tissue. No cases of hyperplasia were present in the patients with a homogeneous endometrium.A heterogeneous cystic endometrium is associated with the prolonged proliferative phase from chronic anovulation as well as endometrial hyperplasia.
