Elucidating the biosynthesis of chitin filaments and their configuration with specific proteins and electron microscopy. To deepen the knowledge of chitin synthesis, a yeast mutant has been used as a model. Purified chitin synthase I-containing vesicles (chitosomes) with a diameter of 85 to 120 nm are identified by electron microscopy to eject tiny fibers upon addition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The filigree of extruded filaments fused gradually into a large three-dimensional network, which is degradable by a chitinase. The network is targeted and restructured by the Streptomyces chitin-binding protein CHB1, which has a very high affinity only for alpha-chitin. Within the chitosomes, filaments are found to be highly condensed within consecutive oval fibroids, which are specifically targeted by the alpha-chitin-binding protein. The presented data give new insights to the generation of chitin filaments with an antiparallel (alpha) configuration. [image: see text]
