Large calcifications in ovaries otherwise normal on ultrasound. To evaluate calcifications >or= 5 mm in length in ovaries that are otherwise normal on ultrasound, and to determine whether such large ovarian calcifications are an indicator of ovarian neoplasm.This was a retrospective study reviewing pelvic ultrasound results at our unit between October 1994 and April 2002 to identify patients with ovarian calcifications that were >or= 5 mm in maximum length in otherwise normal ovaries, and who also had follow-up imaging studies. Patient medical histories were reviewed, calcification characteristics, including number, size, shape and laterality of calcifications, were recorded and follow-up imaging studies were reviewed to assess change in size of the calcification and to see if a neoplasm had developed.The study group consisted of 28 patients. The mean length of imaging follow-up was 35.2 +/- 30.7 months. The mean size of the calcifications was 7.4 +/- 2.3 (range, 5-13) mm. The calcification remained stable in all 28 patients and no ovarian neoplasms developed in any of the patients. Histological confirmation was available in one patient and this revealed dystrophic calcification in a corpus albicans.Calcifications ranging from 5 to 13 mm in length in otherwise normal ovaries remain stable on follow-up imaging and are not an indicator of current or future ovarian neoplasm.
