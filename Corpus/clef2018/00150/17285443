Elevated carbohydrate antigen 125 levels in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with heart failure. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125), known as a tumor marker for ovarian cancer, has been reported to increase and relate to severity in heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has a wide clinical spectrum that often includes heart failure symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CA 125 in HCM patients, its relation to severity of symptoms, and degree of diastolic dysfunction. CA 125 blood levels were determined in 32 HCM patients (21 male age 51.3 +/- 18.4 years) and in 30 healthy volunteers (19 male
