Transabdominal ultrasonography in diagnostics of gastric leiomyoms. Ultrasonography by an original technique, consisting in stomach examination after fasting and upon contrasting, was performed in 10 cases in addition to conventional radiological and endoscopic techniques for diagnostics of gastric leiomyomas. An anechogenous mass originating from the muscular layer of the stomach was considered an evidence of leiomyoma. Advantages of ultrasonography over other methods used for the diagnostics of gastric leiomyomas include a possibility to evaluate the whole gastric wall, its layers, and the internal structure of the formation. This provides additional possibilities for differential diagnostics, including cases of malignization.
