Role of hydrosonography in prevention and screening of premalignant and malignant endometrial disease. The study emphasizes the significance of hydrosonography in prevention and early diagnostics of endometrial pathology.To express the significance of hydrosonography in relation to timely detection and treatment of premalignant and malignant endometrial disease.Our study included 104 patients referred to transvaginal sonography, after which hydrosonography was recommended in order to obtain precise visualization of the endometrium because of suspected endometrial pathology. After hydrosonography, dilatation and curettage with endometrial biopsy were performed in all patients. Biopsy specimens were histologically analyzed.The application of contrast sonography described in our research helped diagnose and timely treat as many as 30.8% of patients suffering from premalignant and malignant endometrial disease (23.2% of premalignant and 7.6% of malignant). Discomforts (bleeding and pelvic pain) occurred in 72.1% of patients, out of whom 43.3% had already undergone curettage once or more than once because of the same or similar symptoms, while 27.9% of cases presented for regular control, i.e. they were symptom free. The obtained results clearly emphasized the significance of application of contrast sonohysterography as a method for timely detection of endometrial pathology and its adequate treatment.The study shows that application of contrast sonohysterography before exploratory curettage significantly facilitates the use of invasive diagnostics and improves accuracy and validity of the obtained results, especially in cases of endometrial focal changes consequently, it is also possible to achieve positive cost-benefit effect.
