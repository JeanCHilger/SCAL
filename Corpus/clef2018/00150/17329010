2D and 3D hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography in the assessment of uterine cavity and tubal patency. To demonstrate the diagnostic efficacy of 2D B-mode, color and pulsed Doppler Hy-Co-Sy and 3D B-mode and power Doppler Hy-Co-Sy.One hundred and fifty-two women were recruited into the 2D B-mode, color and pulsed Doppler Hy-Co-Sy study and 116 other women were recruited into the 3D B-mode and power Doppler Hy-Co-Sy study. We assessed the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) of 2D and 3D Hy-Co-Sy, compared to hysteroscopy, and laparoscopy and dye test in the assessment of uterine abnormalities and tubal patency, respectively.The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 2D hysterosonography compared to hysteroscopy were 93.6, 97.3, 98.2 and 97.3%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 3D hysterosonography compared to hysteroscopy were 97.9, 100, 97.9 and 100%, respectively. Addition of color and pulsed Doppler to 2D Hy-Co-Sy and power Doppler to 3D Hy-Co-Sy contributed to diagnostic precision in detection of tubal patency. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 3D power Doppler Hy-Co-Sy in detection of tubal patency compared to laparoscopy and dye intubation were 100, 99.1, 99.2 and 100%, respectively.2D and 3D Hy-Co-Sy are accurate methods for evaluation of uterine abnormalities and tubal patency in infertile patients.
