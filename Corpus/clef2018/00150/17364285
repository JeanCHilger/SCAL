Postpartum ultrasound in women with postpartum endometritis, after cesarean section and after manual evacuation of the placenta. To measure anteroposterior (AP) diameters, and to describe qualitative findings of the uterus and the uterine cavity in women with postpartum endometritis, after caesarean section (CS) and after manual evacuation of the placenta, and to compare these women with those in a normal puerperium.A prospective, descriptive, observational study of 103 postpartum women was conducted. Fifty-five women had clinical symptoms of postpartum endometritis, 28 had undergone CS, and 20 had manual placental evacuation. Ultrasound examinations were scheduled for days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 postpartum. Women with endometritis underwent their first examination on the day they presented with clinical symptoms.The AP diameters of the uterus and uterine cavity in all three groups overlapped considerably with the reference values. On day 56 postpartum, the uterus had achieved the same dimensions as found in our reference population. Compared with the reference group, during early puerperium, an empty cavity was less common among women with the three study conditions, and gas was present more often after CS and after manual evacuation of the placenta. An anteverted position of the uterus was less common among women with endometritis on day 14 and 28 postpartum, and among women delivered by CS on days 7, 14 and 28 postpartum. The incision site in the lower uterine segment was visible after CS.The ultrasonic findings in women with postpartum endometritis, after CS and after manual evacuation of the placenta, do not differ substantially from those during an uncomplicated puerperium. A delayed uterine involution process might explain the slight morphological differences observed.
