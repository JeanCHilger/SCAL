Alcohol sclerotherapy for successful treatment of focal adenomyosis: a case report. Adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium. Treatment options range from use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal suppression for symptomatic relief, to endometrial ablation or even hysterectomy. We report a case of successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of focal adenomyosis with intracavitary alcohol instillation in a patient with a recurrent intramural uterine lesion. This is the first report of the treatment of sclerotherapy by alcohol instillation, which may be considered as a reasonable alternative modality in treating rare cases of symptomatic adenomyosis.
