The value of transvaginal ultrasonography in the follow-up of postmenopausal women's endometrium. Endometrial cancer remains, today, a serious problem, especially for postmenopausal women. The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of the transvaginal ultrasound examination in the management of the endometrial abnormalities in postmenopausal women. We included, in a prospective cohort, 49 successive postmenopausal women: 34 with metrorrhagia (group I) and 15 with no symptoms (group II) and we compared the results obtained by ultrasound examination, Pap smear and endometrial biopsy. Patients in group I had a higher frequency of risk factors and thick and abnormal endometrium. Unlike Pap smear, ultrasound examination and biopsy had comparable values. We could conclude that transvaginal sonography is a reliable technique for the endometrium evaluation in the postmenopausal women. Ultrasound exam could select the cases (without any symptoms) for endometrial biopsy and detect associated gynecological pathology.
