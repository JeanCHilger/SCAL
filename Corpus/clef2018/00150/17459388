Three-dimensional ultrasound and three-dimensional power Doppler in the assessment of ovarian tumors. To determine preoperative method that predicts nature of ovarian tumors.Fifty patients with complex pelvic masses assessed preoperatively with two-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS), two-dimensional power Doppler (2DPD), three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS), three-dimensional power Doppler (3DPD), color Doppler.All patients underwent exploration, 19 (38%) had benign tumors, 31 (62%) had ovarian cancer. 2DUS identified 29 cases suspicious for malignancy giving sensitivity, specificity, PPV and accuracy of 80%, 78%, 86%, and 80%. 2DUS with 2DPD identified 28 suspicious cases giving sensitivity, specificity, PPV and accuracy of 80%, 84%, 89%, and 82%. 3DUS identified 31 suspicious cases including 28 cancers giving sensitivity, specificity, PPV and accuracy of 90%, 84%, 90%, and 88%. 3DUS with 3DPD, identified 34 suspicious cases including all 31 cancers giving sensitivity, specificity, PPV and accuracy of 100%, 84%, 91%, and 94%. Color Doppler RI of 0.48 identified 28 cases of 31 cancers giving sensitivity of 90%.Evaluation by 3DUS with 3DPD improves diagnostic accuracy of ovarian tumors.
