Three dimensional (3D) ultrasound in gynecology: a breakthrough?. A variety of techniques can be used to assess the pelvic organs, mainly the uterus and ovaries and tubes. Traditionally, X-ray hysterosalpingography has also been used to observe pathology in the uterine cavity, and thereby to indirectly evaluate the adjacent endometrium and myometrium. With the advent of high-resolution vaginal probes transvaginal sonography (TVS) has assumed an important role in assessing the myometrium and the endometrial echo complex. The 3D ultrasound can depict lesions not easily diagnosed by conventional 2D ultrasound due to the fact that the coronal plain is easily accessible. The coronal views manifest the relationship between the endometrium and the myometrium at the uterine fundus, delineate the entire cervical canal and visualize the corneal angles. A major advantage of the 3D ultrasound is the ability to rapidly acquire and store ultrasonographic data. This volume data can then be retrospectively analyzed with no loss of information. One can also "scroll" in real-time through the acquired volume that can be rotated and magnified. In conclusion, 3D ultrasound may provide additional information compared with standard accepted techniques in the vast majority of women.
