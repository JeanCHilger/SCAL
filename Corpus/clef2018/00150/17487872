Urodynamic and ultrasound characteristics of incontinence after radical hysterectomy. To test whether symptoms of urinary incontinence after radical hysterectomy could be objectified with urodynamics and ultrasound.This case-control study comprised 100 women who underwent radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer without post-operative radiotherapy. Fifty women reporting urinary incontinence were matched with 50 women reporting continence. All women were assessed with ultrasound of the bladder neck movements and urodynamics.No differences were found in ultrasound or urodynamic findings regarding mobility of the bladder neck, maximal detrusor pressure, post-voiding residual urine, flow of urine, or bladder capacity. A significant reduction in urethral pressure at rest and at contraction among the incontinent women was, however, demonstrated. Among urge-incontinent women, urethral pressure at rest was significantly lower than among continent and stress-incontinent women, respectively. Stress-incontinent women had significantly lower urethral pressure at contraction than did urge-incontinent and continent women.No differences in urodynamic or ultrasound findings were observed between the two groups, except for an overall difference in the intraurethral pressure. A decrease in the urethral pressure could contribute to the characterization of incontinence after radical hysterectomy, indicating that the urethral sphincter mechanism plays a role in the pathophysiology. In this study design, the mobility of the bladder neck did not play any role.
