The FeTouch project: an application of haptic technologies to obstetrics and gynaecology. Ultrasound technologies have been widely used in gynecology and obstetrics. Modern ultrasound systems allow the reconstruction of a 3D model of the subject being scanned, but even though visual interfaces have reached very high standards, the problem of representing a 3D image on a 2D computer screen still exists. Moreover no physical interaction is possible with such a model. The FeTouch system, developed at Siena University in the last two years, partially solves such issues by using stereo visual feedback and haptic devices. While the system can be used with any 3D model obtained from ultrasound scans, its current prime use is to allow mothers to interact with a model of the fetus they are carrying. The system is freely available on the project web page.
