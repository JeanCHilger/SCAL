Utility of ultrasound in the combat theater: experiences of a gynecologist during Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of ultrasound in a combat theater.A retrospective review of gynecology visits was evaluated at Camp Doha, Kuwait, from August 2003 through April 2004. Of the 1,737 visits, 237 required pelvic ultrasound. Demographic information, as well as the indications, diagnosis, and disposition of the patients, was compiled.The average age of the patient requiring ultrasound was 28 +/- 8 years. The primary presenting complaint was pelvic pain. Forty percent with pelvic pain had no identifiable cause. The most common final diagnosis was pregnancy. Of the 237 visits, the use of ultrasound resulted in 136 return-to-duty dispositions. Of the 31% who were administratively redeployed, the majority were secondary to pregnancy.Gynecologic ultrasound was found to be a very useful tool in the combat theater. Ultrasound resulted in improved diagnostic ability and enhanced reassurance to both provider and patient.
