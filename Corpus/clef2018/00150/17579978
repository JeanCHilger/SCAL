Low-dose HCG is useful in preventing OHSS in high-risk women without adversely affecting the outcome of IVF cycles. Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a rare but potentially fatal condition associated with conventional IVF treatment. It is found predominantly in women with polycystic ovaries who have an exaggerated response to exogenous FSH, leading to a large number of follicles and an overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor with resultant excessive increases in vascular permeability. There is evidence to suggest that OHSS is also linked to the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) to induce ovulation. Therefore, while HCG is essential for corpus luteum function, high amounts of HCG can lead to OHSS in high responders. In a pilot study, infertile patients at high risk of developing OHSS were given half the current minimum dose of HCG (i.e. 2500 IU). No woman developed moderate or severe OHSS 13 women (61.9%) conceived and there were three twin pregnancies. In women at high risk of OHSS, a low dose of HCG appears to prevent the development of OHSS without compromising success rates.
