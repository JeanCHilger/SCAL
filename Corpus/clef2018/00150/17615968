Clinical significance and management of testicular microlithiasis. Testicular microlithiasis (TM) refers to the calcium deposits within the seminiferous tubules. Owing to the wide use of scrotal ultrasonography, more cases of TM have been diagnosed clinically. TM can be associated with many conditions, including cryptorchidism, infertility, varicocele, testicular torsion, Klinefelter's syndrome, intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCN) and testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), and its frequent association with IGCN, TGCT and infertility is the particular concern of urologists and andrologists. The etiology of TM is not yet certain. Its biological meaning and clinical significance have not been well defined. Currently, there are controversies on the correlation of TM with IGCN, TGCT and infertility. This article reviews the definition, prevalence, etiology, and histopathology of TM, and summarized its association with IGCN, TGCT, and male infertility as well as the management of the disease.
