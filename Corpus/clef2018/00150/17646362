Three-dimensional sonographic morphologic assessment of adnexal masses: a reproducibility study. The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility of 3-dimensional (3D) sonography for classifying adnexal masses.Eighty-two consecutive women with the diagnosis of an adnexal mass on 2-dimensional transvaginal sonography were reevaluated by 3D sonography, and 3D volume data from each mass were stored. Two different examiners (6 years and 1 year of experience in 3D sonography, respectively) reviewed 3D sonograms 1 month after the last patient was recruited and then 1 week later again. Masses had to be classified as benign or malignant. Criteria suggestive of malignancy were the presence of a thick wall, gross papillary projections, solid areas, and solid echogenicity. A definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained in every case. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was estimated by calculating the Cohen kappa index.Twenty-seven (33%) tumors were malignant, and 55 (67%) were benign. Intraobserver agreement for both examiners was good (kappa = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively). Interobserver agreement was also good (kappa = 0.70).Three-dimensional sonography is a reproducible technique for morphologic assessment of adnexal masses.
