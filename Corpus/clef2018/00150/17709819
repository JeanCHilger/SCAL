Will 3D virtual dissection display prove to be the display format for reviewing CT colonography examinations? In the study by Kim et al, primary two-dimensional (2D) search with a three-dimensional (3D) problem-solving technique was compared with a 3D virtual dissection technique, with use of two independent reviewers. The authors observed no significant difference (P>.05) in sensitivity or specificity between the two techniques for the detection of polyps 6 mm or larger, whereas the median review time with virtual dissection was significantly (P<.05) shorter. This may have implications for the application of computed tomographic (CT) colonography for screening the asymptomatic average-risk population.
