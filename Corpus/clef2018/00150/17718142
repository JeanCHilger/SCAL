Testicular juvenile granulosa cell tumor: a case report. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors of the testis are rare gonadal stromal tumors of the pediatric age. They represent the most common neoplasms of the testis in the first 6 months of life. A testicular cystic mass is detected, or it can appear as an abdominal or inguinal mass. Differential diagnosis for testicular tumors at this age includes teratoma, simple cyst, epidermoid cyst, lymphangioma and testicular torsion. Association with ambiguous genitalia and sex chromosome abnormalities has been reported. Orchiectomy alone is recommended, because no case of metastasis or recurrence has been reported.We report a case of a 3-month-old male infant with a testicular juvenile granulosa cell tumor mass initially evaluated by fine needle biopsy, which disclosed single or cohesive groups of vimentin, alpha-inhibin and S-100-positive spindle cells with regular nuclei and fine chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Orchiectomy was performed, and histology revealed a juvenile granulosa cell tumor.Even though juvenile granulosa cell tumor is the most common neoplasm of the testis in the first 6 months of life, we found no reports describing its cytologic features. In this setting, fine needle aspiration cytology is a useful tool for initial and therapeutic management.
