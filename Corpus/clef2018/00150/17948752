Pelvic inflammatory disease. Pelvic inflammatory disease and upper genital tract infection describe inflammatory changes in the upper female genital tract of any combination: endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and peritonitis in the small pelvis. In most cases the infection is ascending, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common with increasing incidence. The spectrum ranges from subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening illness. Antibiotic treatment should be initiated promptly and must cover a broad spectrum of germs. Surgical treatment is necessary in cases of failure of antibiotic treatment and in cases with persisting symptoms after antibiotic treatment. Pelvic inflammatory diseases are one of the main causes of tubal sterility, ectopic pregnancies and chronic abdominal pain.
