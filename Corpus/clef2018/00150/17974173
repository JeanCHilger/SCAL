Stromal ovary in 14 years old girl. Struma ovarii was first described in 1899 and is extremely rare, with only 150 reported cases in the medical literature. Struma ovarii is most common between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Women with struma ovarii usually present with a pelvic mass or, less frequently, with hyperthyroidism or ascites. As in follicular tumors of the thyroid gland, the thyroid epithelium in the teratoma may be organized in a solid, embryonal or pseudotubular pattern, rather than thyroid follicles. The authors present an extremely rare case of struma ovarii in 14-year-old girl.
