ED endovaginal pelvic ultrasound in nonpregnant women with right lower quadrant pain. We hypothesized that emergency physician-performed endovaginal ultrasound (EVUS) would change diagnostic decision making in nonpregnant women with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain.A prospective cohort of female patients was enrolled at an urban emergency department (ED). Inclusion criteria were RLQ pain, hemodynamic stability, and a strong suspicion for appendicitis or right adnexal pathology. Treating physicians were queried regarding pre- and post-ED EVUS probability of disease, differential diagnoses, consultation, and management. Positive findings included large cysts or multitissue densities, tubal dilation, uterine enlargement/mass, and extensive peritoneal fluid.With a positive ED EVUS, mean physician probability increased for gynecologic (24%) and decreased for both surgical (14%) and medical (20%) disease. With a negative ED EVUS, mean physician probability increased for surgical disease (5.3%) and decreased for gynecologic disease (18.6%).Emergency department EVUS changes physician diagnostic decision making in nonpregnant women with undifferentiated RLQ pain.
