Features of ultrasound diagnosis of non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Ultrasound examination using color Doppler imaging was used in 70 patients with non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma and 23 patients with subserous nodes of uterine myoma. Diagnosis was confirmed by histological assay of resected material. The procedure can be used for differentiated diagnosis between non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma and subserous nodes of uterine myoma, as well as for appraisal of individual features of tumor so that adequate treatment might be selected.
