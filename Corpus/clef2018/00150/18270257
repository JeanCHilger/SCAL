Hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinism in children of women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a controlled study. Hyperandrogenia and insulin resistance are heritable family traits, likely to cluster in children of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) mothers.We performed a case control study of PCOS children (n = 32) compared with children from control women (n = 38) for reproductive and metabolic abnormalities, stratifying results by three Tanner stage groupings. The children underwent history and physical examinations, a 3-h timed urine collection, a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, and abdominal ultrasound examination (females only). Serum was obtained in older children (age > 8 yr) who consented.Urine LH levels were significantly lower in the Tanner IV-V PCOS girls compared with controls (P = 0.04). Urine testosterone levels were significantly elevated in Tanner II-III PCOS boys compared with controls (P = 0.007). There were no significant differences in dehydroepiandrosterone levels. We validated the correlation between salivary and serum levels of insulin (insulin areas under the curve) in an adult population [n =30, Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = 0.67 P < 0.0001], which also replicated in the children (2-h insulin r = 0.57Hyperinsulinism may be a familial characteristic of PCOS children (or at least girls) but does not appear until the later stages of puberty. Other reproductive abnormalities that characterize PCOS may develop later.
