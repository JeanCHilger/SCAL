Ultrasound-guided culdotomy for vaginal ovarian cystectomy using a renal balloon dilator catheter. To evaluate the feasibility and utility of performing ultrasound-guided culdotomy using a renal balloon dilator catheter for transvaginal ovarian cystectomies.Culdotomy using transvaginal sonography and a Nephromax balloon dilator catheter was performed in 16 patients for the vaginal removal of benign ovarian cysts located in the cul-de-sac. Each ovarian cyst was punctured under transvaginal ultrasound guidance and the punctured site on the vaginal wall was enlarged with a dilator. The cyst was then enucleated through this vaginal wound. Preoperative characteristics of the patients, outcome, operating time, blood loss and complications of each culdotomy, and the histology of the cysts, were recorded and examined.We used this method on 14 patients with unilateral ovarian cysts and two with bilateral cysts. Culdotomy was performed successfully in 15 cases (94%). The mean +/- SD operating time for culdotomy was 22 +/- 11 min, and blood loss during the procedure was less than 10 mL in all cases. There were no complications including rectal injury or febrile morbidity.Culdotomy assisted by ultrasound imaging and a dilator is a safe, reliable and effective method for removal of benign ovarian cysts via a vaginal approach.
