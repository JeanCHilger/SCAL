Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the pelvis. Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are well recognized in the pleura, but their occurrence at other sites has only become appreciated in recent years, as a consequence of which extrapleural examples often go unrecognized and misdiagnosed. Because of their rarity, overall experience concerning this tumor has not been significant and reports detailing radiological findings are few. We herein report an unusual case of a large retroperitoneal pelvic SFT with features of high vascularity negating successful surgical resection.
