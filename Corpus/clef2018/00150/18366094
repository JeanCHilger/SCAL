Large retroperitoneal schwannoma mimicking a cystic ovarian mass in a patient with Hansen's disease. We present a rare case of retroperitoneal cystic schwannoma of the pelvis in a patient with Hansen's disease that mimicked an ovarian cyst. Due to economic constraints and because the lesion was assumed to be of ovarian origin, the patient did not undergo any cross-sectional imaging other than sonography. Sonographically guided fine needle aspiration of the cystic lesion was inconclusive. A cystic schwannoma was diagnosed at laparotomy.
