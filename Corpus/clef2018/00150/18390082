Laparoscopic management of adnexal masses in postmenopause. The study included 64 postmenopausal women with adnexal masses. The selection criteria included menopausal status, an ultrasound scan indicating a benign mass and serum levels of CA-125 below the cutoff (35 U/ml). The results of the study confirm that the removal of a cystic mass in postmenopausal patients with laparoscopic surgery is a more valid and acceptable alternative to traditional surgery.
