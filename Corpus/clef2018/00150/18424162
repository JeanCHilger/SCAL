Role of ultrasound in the evaluation of patients after laparoscopic sacropexy: preliminary study. To evaluate results of laparoscopic sacropexy with introital and vaginal ultrasonography, that is to observe dynamic behavior of the mesh, to measure precisely its position and to conclude on the feasibility of this exam.The surgery was a laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy and a suspension of the cervix with an anterior vesicovaginal mesh and a posterior rectovaginal mesh. These meshes are joined together and fixed on the sacrum. Ultrasound was performed in fifteen patients to see in the sagital plane the position of the mesh. The distance anterior mesh-bladder neck and the distance posterior mesh-anal sphincter were measured at rest, during straining and during retaining. The spreading out and the dynamic behavior of the mesh were studied.The distance anterior mesh-bladder neck is 12 mm at rest, 15 mm during straining and 13 mm during retaining. The distance posterior mesh-anal sphincter is 30 mm at rest, 26 mm during straining and 31 mm during retaining. The mesh is always seen as spread out, or folded, but never strained. Video recording shows that sacropexy does not block pelvic dynamics.Ultrasound imaging appears in this study as a simple and efficient exam to study and measure prosthesis. It could be a good help for clinical examination to explain failure or complication of surgery.
