Lipoleiomyoma of the uterus: imaging features. Lipoleiomyoma is an extremely rare, benign, uterine tumor that requires no treatment when asymptomatic. It is important to differentiate it from malignant conditions requiring surgery.A uterine lipoleiomyoma in a 68-year-old asymptomatic woman exhibited highly suggestive features by ultrasound, multislice spiral computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The ultrasound findings were non-specific. CT scan showed an 8 x 7 cm well-defined fatty mass of the uterine body. On T(2)-weighted MR images, fat content within the tumor was confirmed because of evident chemical shift artifact.To our knowledge, the findings provided by these three modalities used in combination have not been reported previously in the gynecologic literature.The data yielded by CT and MRI on the fatty nature of the lesion are valuable in diagnosing this entity.The final pathological examination results confirmed the diagnosis of lipoleiomyoma.
