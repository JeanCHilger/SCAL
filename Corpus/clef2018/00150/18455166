Antral follicle count (AFC) can be used in the prediction of ovarian response but cannot predict the oocyte/embryo quality or the in vitro fertilization outcome in an egg donation program. To verify whether the antral follicle count (AFC) could predict ovarian response, oocyte/embryo quality, and IVF outcome.Prospective study.Instituto Universitario-Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad, Valencia, Spain.One thousand seventy-four donors and 975 oocyte recipient cycles.Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), endometrial preparation, IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ET.COH and oocyte/embryo quality parameters and IVF outcome.We observed lower E(2) levels and fewer mature retrieved oocyte numbers among donors who showed an AFC that was <10. These donors also showed significantly higher cancellation and no-donation rates poor and/or insufficient response was the principal cause (82%). However, there were no differences among the groups regarding embryo development parameters and IVF outcome.AFC is a noninvasive and simple tool that can improve the oocyte donor's selection of an egg donation program. This study suggests that AFC is a good predictor of ovarian response but cannot be used to predict oocyte/embryo quality or IVF outcome.
