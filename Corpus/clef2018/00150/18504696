Ultrasound assessment of the ovary in the infertile woman. Few would argue that the introduction of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) revolutionized the practice of assisted reproduction. For example, full-bladder follicular scanning and laparoscopic oocyte retrievals were converted to TVUS-guided procedures. The application of higher-frequency scanning probes provided greater resolution and improved the clinician's ability to evaluate the ovary for pathologic conditions, for determination of ovarian reserve, and for therapeutic decisions during ovarian stimulation cycles. All these uses of TVUS of the ovary will be discussed in this article.
