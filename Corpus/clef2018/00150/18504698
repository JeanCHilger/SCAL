Ultrasound assessment of the uterus and fallopian tube in infertile women. In addition to the history and physical exam, the traditional evaluation of an infertile couple has included assessment of tubal patency, semen analysis, and assessment of ovulation. This article will assess the role of transvaginal ultrasound imaging of the uterus and fallopian tubes in infertile women either as an additional diagnostic test or as an aid to infertility treatment cycles. Transvaginal ultrasonography has become very sensitive, allowing for the detection of uterine lesions that otherwise might be missed. Understanding and interpreting the significance of the lesions is a major clinical challenge in the infertile patient.
