Sonography in the management of symptomatic pregnancies of unknown location. To evaluate the management of pregnancy of unknown location in our conditions and to assess possibilities to improve on the performance of it.This was a retrospective study of a population of women classified as having PUL. Out- and inpatients were recruited. Their medical history, gynaecological examinations, transvaginal sonography and serum beta-hCG were carried out. Final outcome of each PUL was established.Diagnostic models for variant courses of PUL were established. EPs after PUL were evaluated. The following sonagraphic findings were associated with EP after PUL: blob sign in 4 of 16 cases (25%), bagel sign in 1 case (6.25%), EP established by sonography in 2/16 cases (12.5%) and no valid sonographic structures in 9/16 cases (56.25%).Conditions for improvement the management of PUL are: implementation of PUL in the clinical practice, creation of EPU, improvent in the evaluation of serum beta-hCG levels and resolution of sonographic examination (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 18).
