64-Row multidetector CT virtual hysterosalpingography. To illustrate the large variety of pathologies found on 64-row computed tomographic (CT) virtual hysterosalpingography (CT-VHSG) in the evaluation of the female reproductive tract in infertile patients.We prospectively evaluated CT datasets from 209 patients with diagnosis of infertility. CT-VHSG was performed with a 64-row CT scanner using 64 x 0.625 mm(2) collimation and 0.9 mm slice thickness. A total volume of 20 mL of an iodine contrast dilution was injected into the uterine cavity. The duration of the CT scan and the grade of patient discomfort of the procedure were documented. Images were analyzed on a workstation. The CT-VHSG exams were divided in studies with normal or pathological findings pathologies were classified according to their locations (cervical, uterine, and fallopian tube pathology).No complications occurred during the procedure. The mean scan time was 3.4 +/- 0.4 s the mean patient effective dose was 2.58 +/- 0.75 mSv. In relation to the patient's discomfort evaluation, 55.5% of the patients referred no discomfort during the procedure. Cervical pathology was found in 100/209 patients, uterine pathology in 93/209 patients, and fallopian tubes pathology in 37/209 patients.A 64-row CT-VHSG provides a reliable, non-invasive alternative diagnostic technique in the infertility workup algorithm.
