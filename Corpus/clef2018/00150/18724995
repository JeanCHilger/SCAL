Anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody conjugated polymer fluorescent nanoparticles probe for ovarian cancer imaging. Fluorescent nanoparticles (FNPs) with unique optical properties may be useful as biosensors in living cancer cell imaging and cancer targeting. A novel kind of polymer fluorescent nanoparticles (PFNPs) was synthesized and its application for ovarian cancer imaging with fluorescence microscopy imaging technology was presented in this study. The PFNPs were synthesized with precipitation polymerization by using methacrylic acid (MAA) as monomer, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (Trim) as cross-linker, azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as radical initiator and butyl rhodamine B (BTRB) as fluorescent dye. And the fluorescent dye was embedded into the three-dimensional network of the polymer when the polymer was produced. With this method the PFNPs can be prepared easily. And then the PFNPs were successfully modified with anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody. The fluorescence probe based on anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody conjugated PFNPs has been used to detect ovarian cancer cells with fluorescence microscopy imaging technology. The experimental results demonstrate that the anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody conjugated PFNPs can effectively recognize ovarian cancer cells and exhibit good sensitivity and exceptional photostability, which would provide a novel way for the diagnosis and curative effect observation of ovarian cancer cells.
