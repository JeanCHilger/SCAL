Endometrial growth in early pregnancy after IVF/ET. To detect the endometrial volume change in conception cycles. Additionally we measured endometrium in three planes, to see if the hypothesized endometrial volume differences will be detectable by this surrogate technique.Following the embryo transfer, a three-dimensional ultrasound exam was performed on average days 22 and 28 of the cycle.Seventy-eight subjects signed the informed consent form, and 63 completed the study. A significant difference was observed between Visit 1 and Visit 2, for endometrial volume, thickness, length and width in the pregnant group, and for endometrial volume, thickness and width in the non-pregnant group.In this study we have shown that in normal intrauterine pregnancy after IVF/ET, prominent endometrial volume growth can be detected by a three-dimensional ultrasound over the course of several days. Moreover, in patients who did not conceive in a particular cycle, a decrease in endometrial volume can be seen.
