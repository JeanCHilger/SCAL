Musculoskeletal pain in ultrasound operators. Ultrasound-based techniques are frequently used in cardiology, gynecology and radiology. Work-related symptoms are reported for ultrasound operators, but controlled studies have not been published. We wanted to map symptoms and clinical diagnoses in ultrasound operators, compare them to matched controls and evaluate a possible relation between symptoms and exposure.All ultrasound operators working at Rikshospitalet and Ullevaal University hospitals and matched controls who had other work at the hospitals were invited to participate. They answered questions about pain, well-being at the workplace, physical activity, smoking and validated function scores for the back (Oswestry Disability Index-ODI), shoulder and arm (Quick-DASH), and health- related quality of life (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS, as well as exposure time for ultrasound examinations. All participants underwent a blinded, systematic clinical examination.81 persons participated (43 women, 38 men) 44 operators and 37 controls. The ultrasound operators reported significantly more work-related pain from the wrist, elbow and shoulder and scored significantly worse on Quick-DASH (difference 6.1 [95 % CI 2.0 to 10.2, p < 0.001) and health-related function (EQ-5D). There was no difference in health-related quality of life (EQ-VAS) or back function (ODI). The number of persons with one or more clinical diagnosis was significantly higher for ultrasound operators (26/44 [59 %]) than controls (7/37 [19 %]), odds ratio 5.2Ultrasound operators reported significantly more shoulder and arm complaints and clinical diagnosis than controls.
