Endometrial osseous metaplasia mimicking retained intrauterine device: a case report. Osseous metaplasia of the endometrium is a rare disorder and can be associated with infertility. Although successful diagnosis and treatment have been widely reported, correct diagnosis in many cases still represents a challenge.A 40-year-old woman complaining of infertility presented with a diagnosis of retained intrauterine device (IUD) on ultrasound. Hysteroscopy revealed a normal endometrial cavity, but no IUD was visualized. Curettage pathology specimens showed chronic endometritis and calcification. Repeat hysteroscopy was performed because of persistent echogenic foci in the endometrium on follow-up ultrasound. Several irregular and calcified plaques were successfully removed.Osseous metaplasia can be misdiagnosed because of its rare incidence. Physicians should be aware of osseous metaplasia in the differential diagnosis of patients with uncertain history who present with a sonographic image resembling an IUD.
