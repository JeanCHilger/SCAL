The relationship between superior attachment points for anterior wall mesh operations and the upper vagina using a 3-dimensional magnetic resonance model in women with normal support. We examined structural relationships between anterior mesh kit suspension points and the upper vagina in women with normal support.Eleven women with normal support underwent supine, multiplanar magnetic resonance pelvic imaging at rest and maximal Valsalva. Using 3-dimensional models generated from these images, anterior wall mesh kit anchoring points were identified along the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis. We then measured the percentage of anterior vagina above and posterior to superior suspension points.The anterior vagina extended above superior attachment points in 100% of women at rest and in 73% during Valsalva. It extended posterior to them in 82% and 100% (rest and Valsalva, respectively). The mean percentage of anterior vaginal length above superior anchoring sites was 40 +/- 14% at rest and 29 +/- 12% during Valsalva.The upper vagina lies above and posterior to superior suspension points in the majority of women with normal support.
