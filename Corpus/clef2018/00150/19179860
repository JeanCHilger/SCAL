Imaging of Müllerian duct anomalies. Müllerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are relatively common disorders that are particularly relevant in patients with infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, or a history of preterm labor. Accurate characterization of MDAs is crucial to the implementation of appropriate treatment. Various imaging modalities have been used in the evaluation of MDAs, including hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although hysterosalpingography and ultrasound may suggest a Müllerian duct anomaly, further evaluation by MRI is often required. MRI is the best imaging method available because of its superior ability to reliably visualize complex uterovaginal anatomy.
