Pelvic endometriosis and hydroureteronephrosis. To assess whether routine renal ultrasonography may be recommended in all patients with pelvic endometriosis, in order to avoid silent ureteral involvement of the disease.Retrospective descriptive study.Tertiary center for the treatment of endometriosis at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the State University of Milan, Milan, Italy.Seven-hundred-fifty patients with a primary diagnosis of endometriosis, between January 2005 and July 2007.Routine urinary ultrasound recording of patient history, signs, and symptomsSymptoms and signs of ureterohydronephrosis diagnosis of ureterohydronephrosis.Twenty-three patients (3%) of all 750 patients with endometriosis had associated ureterohydronephrosis diagnosed at renal ultrasound. Symptoms secondary to ureteral and renal involvement were present in 10 patients (43.5%) 6 reported lumbar pain (26.1%) and 4 patients (17.4%) had renal colic.In our study, the high number (56.5%) of asymptomatic ureteral involvement in patients with known pelvic endometriosis seems to warrant the need for further investigations regarding the possibility to avoid the high percentage of silent renal losses. Unfortunately there appears to be no specific risk factor to allow for early suspicion nor a validated preventive diagnostic and therapeutic program. It remains to be evaluated whether urinary ultrasound ensures a beneficial cost-benefit ratio if employed on a routine basis.
