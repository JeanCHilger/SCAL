Successful management of uterine arteriovenous malformation by ligation of feeding artery after unsuccessful uterine artery embolization. Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. The present report describes a postmenopausal patient with uterine AVM manifesting recurrent, massive genital bleeding. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) was scheduled before hysterectomy, but UAE was unsuccessful due to the dilated, tortuous internal iliac arteries, and extremely rapid arterial blood flow. Hysterectomy appeared to carry a potential risk of massive blood loss due to multiple dilated vessels around the uterine corpus and cervix. Therefore, six arteries feeding the uterus were surgically ligated. At 10 months after the operation there have been no episodes of atypical genital bleeding.
