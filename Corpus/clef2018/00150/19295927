Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary associated with in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure: case report and clinical overview. Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix were previously shown to be tumors occurring in female offspring exposed prenatally to diethylstilbestrol. This report describes the first clinical case of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary linked to early diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero.A 45-year-old woman presented with a self-discovered lump in the lower abdominal quadrant. She underwent surgery and staging that revealed clear cell adenocarcinoma confined to the left ovary. Foci of high-grade squamous neoplastic proliferation, inflammation, and a paratubal cyst were also present on the pathology specimen. Medical records established unequivocally that the patient's mother received diethylstilbestrol therapy throughout the pregnancy.Our case is consistent with clear cell adenocarcinoma, probably related to diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero. It reinforces the need for continued vigilance in individuals prenatally exposed to this drug.
