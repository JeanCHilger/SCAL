Increased plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels in young obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome. To evaluate carotid intima-media thickness and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age-matched healthy controls, and to investigate their relationship with each other and with clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters.Clinical study.University hospital.Fifty young women with PCOS (overweight or obese [n = 24] and nonobese [n = 26]) and 25 age-matched healthy controls.History and physical examination, peripheral venous blood sampling, carotid ultrasonography.Plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, serum FSH, LH, DHEAS, total T, E(2), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin resistance defined by the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index, and carotid intima-media thickness.Plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels in the overweight or obese PCOS group were significantly higher than those in the nonobese PCOS and control groups. Carotid intima-media thickness did not significantly differ between the groups. Obesity and insulin resistance were associated positively with plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels, but there was no association between carotid intima-media thickness and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.Young overweight or obese women with PCOS have increased plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels. Impaired fibrinolysis may be responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in women with PCOS.
