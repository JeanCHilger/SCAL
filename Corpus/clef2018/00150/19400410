Septoplasty allows successful delivery in a primary aborter with six previous first trimester miscarriages. To demonstrate that septoplasty can correct a problem of recurrent miscarriage.The patient was a primary aborter with a history of six consecutive miscarriages. Septoplasty by hysteroscopy/laparoscopy was performed. The septum was diagnosed by 3D sonohysterography.She delivered a healthy live baby at 36 weeks.This case clearly demonstrates that sometimes the uterine septum plays an important role in recurrent miscarriage and that septoplasty can improve the chances of successful delivery. The case also shows that a definitive diagnosis of a bicornuate uterus by HSG and/or MRI can not be made.
