Bilateral megaureters may masquerade as hydrosalpinges on ultrasound. Gynaecologists are familiar with occluded Fallopian tubes presenting as pelvic masses on ultrasound. However, it is important to also consider anomalies of the urinary collecting system when presented with a pelvic mass, some of which do not necessitate surgical therapy. This report describes the case of a woman with unknown and asymptomatic bilateral megaureters who presented for evaluation of infertility. Initially, it was presumed that she had tubal disease and the possibility of a laparoscopy to remove her hydrosalpinges was entertained.
