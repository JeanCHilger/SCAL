The role of three-dimensional imaging in the investigation of IUD malposition. The aim of this study was to present a systematic review of the use of three-dimensional ultrasound for the detection and evaluation of intrauterine device malposition in a patient of our department.Transvaginal sonography failed to detect IUD misplacement in about 9% of cases. Whereas the three-dimensional ultrasound (3D), a new emerging technology, that could provide precise evaluation of IUD malposition.The data were extracted from the literature using computerised Medline system. The use-effectiveness and acceptance of three-dimensional imaging in the detection of IUD malposition was examined as an alternative method to two-dimensional ultrasound.Three-dimensional ultrasound was more accurate than two-dimensional for the identifying IUD device. Three-dimensional technique enables assessment of IUD length in the longitudinal section synchronically with imaging arms of the device. Examination with 2D ultrasound is limited to transverse views of the shaft. The arms or other smaller parts cannot be investigated completely because of the frontal view of an IUD is rarely presented.Three-dimensional ultrasound is a new and promising imaging tool which provides much better view of the endometrial cavity. This is especially useful in uterus examination and in the detection of IUDs because structures that are not located in one single plane can be imaged simultaneously. Three-dimensional ultrasound is considered to be more secure and safer diagnostic technique to determine the location of IUDs than hysteroscopic evaluation (Fig. 2, Ref. 17).
