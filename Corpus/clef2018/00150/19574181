Metastatic bilateral malignant ovarian tumors associated with pregnancy. Krukenberg tumors in pregnancy are extremely rare. Only three cases have been reported, two of which were diagnosed postpartum.A 20-year-old, primigravida with bilateral malignant ovarian tumors, who received no prior antenatal care, was presented with intestinal obstruction at 5 months' gestation. Pregnancy was preserved, and bilateral oophorectomy, omentectomy with resection of sigmoid colon growth, and colostomy were performed. The patient aborted spontaneously and postoperatively, and was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.Because platinum-based chemotherapy can be safely given during pregnancy, hysterectomy can be avoided in cases of bilateral malignant ovarian tumors if the uterus is not grossly involved, so allowing preservation of an existing pregnancy.
