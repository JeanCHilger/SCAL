Adnexal mass vascularity assessed by 3-dimensional power Doppler: does it add to the risk of malignancy index in prediction of ovarian malignancy?: four hundred-case study. The Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) is used for the prediction of ovarian malignancy. It includes menopausal status, carbohydrate antigen 125 serum levels, and ultrasound criteria. Three-dimensional power Doppler (3-DPD) is a reproducible investigation for assessment of tumor vascularity, classifying vascularity to avascular, parallel, and chaotic patterns. In this study 3-DPD was added to RMI for prediction of malignancy in 400 cases of ovarian masses. Sensitivity of RMI for prediction of malignancy was 88%, with a cutoff value of 202.5 at 95% confidence interval. Sensitivity of 3-DPD for prediction of malignancy was 75%, adding 3-DPD to RMI increased its sensitivity to 99%. Considering the pilot nature of the study, further studies are needed to corroborate such findings.
