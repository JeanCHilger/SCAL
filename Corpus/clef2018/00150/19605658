M端llerian duct anomalies and mimics in children and adolescents: correlative intraoperative assessment with clinical imaging. M端llerian duct anomalies (MDAs) are congenital entities that result from nondevelopment, defective vertical or lateral fusion, or resorption failure of the m端llerian (paramesonephric) ducts. MDAs are common, although the majority are asymptomatic, and have been classified by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine according to clinical manifestations, prognosis, and treatment. Accurate diagnosis of an MDA is essential, since the management approach varies depending on the type of malformation. In females, when a m端llerian duct becomes obstructed, the patient may present with an abdominal mass and dysmenorrhea. If the patient is not treated in a timely fashion, the consequences can be severe, extending even to infertility. When an MDA is suspected, ultrasonography (US) should be performed initially to delineate any abnormalities in the genital tract. However, US cannot help identify the type of MDA. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable technique for noninvasive evaluation of the female pelvic anatomy and accurate MDA classification. If obstruction is present, surgical correction of the MDA may be required, and further counseling of the patient with regard to reproductive possibilities becomes important.
