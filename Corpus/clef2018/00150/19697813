Usefulness of ultrasound endometrium thickness measurement in diagnosis of endometrium pathology in women with abnormal peri- and postmenopausal bleeding. Aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of ultrasound endometrial thickness measurement in the diagnosis of endometrial pathology in women with abnormal peri- and postmenopausal bleeding.Material included 182 patients whose endometrium sample was obtained for analysis. Patients were divided into six groups according to histological findings.Correlation between thickness of endometrium and histological diagnostic was sought. Wide and partially covered range of endometrium thickness were found in the observed groups. In carcinoma group the highest were maximal and average values. The difference in average thickness of endometrium in carcinoma and hyperplasia groups when compared to the remaining groups proved to be statistically significant A value of cut down ultrasound measured endometrial thickness to exclude endometrial cancer was 9 mm.Ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness is not sufficient to increase effectiveness of endometrial pathology diagnosis in women with abnormal peri- and postmenopausal bleeding.
