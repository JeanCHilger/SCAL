What is the fate of the missing intrauterine contraceptive device? An intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) is one of the most common forms of contraception in use worldwide today. It is associated with a myriad of problems and complications, one of which is the missing IUCD. It is a known fact that IUCDs can perforate the uterus resulting in its subsequent relocation in other organs within the pelvis and the abdomen. This study showed that more than 50% of clinically diagnosed cases of a missing IUCD are still located within the endometrial cavity. It is therefore being proposed that a clinical diagnosis of 'missing string' be made until adequate radiological investigations, such as ultrasonography, plain X-rays and computerized tomography, have been carried out.
