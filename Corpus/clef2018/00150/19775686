Comparison of the effect of tamoxifen on endometrial thickness in women with thin endometrium (<7mm) undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate. Infertile women undergoing ovulation induction (OI) with clomiphene citrate (CC) who have adequate follicular recruitment and an endometrial thickness of <7 mm as determined by transvaginal sonography in the late follicular phase were switched to tamoxifen for OI in a subsequent cycle. A comparison between the endometrial thickness on CC and tamoxifen was made with by paired analysis. For women undergoing OI with CC who have adequate follicular recruitment and thin endometrium (<7 mm), switching to tamoxifen in subsequent cycles improves endometrial thickness.
