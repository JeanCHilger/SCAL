Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency thermal ablation of uterine fibroids: medium-term follow-up. Previous studies have shown that radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) of uterine fibroids through a percutaneous ultrasound (US)-guided procedure is an effective and safe minimally invasive treatment, with encouraging short-term results. The aim of this study was to assess the results in terms of volume reduction and clinical symptoms improvement in the midterm follow-up of fibroids with a diameter of up to 8 cm. Eleven premenopausal females affected by symptomatic fibroids underwent percutaneous US-guided RFA. Symptom severity and reduction in volume were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The mean symptom score (SSS) before the procedure was 50.30 (range 31.8-67.30), and the average quality of life (QOL) score value was 62 (range 37.20-86.00). The mean basal diameter was 5.5 cm (range 4.4-8) and the mean volume was 101.5 cm(3) (range 44.58-278 cm(3)). The mean follow-up was 9 months (range 3-12 months). The mean SSS value at the end of the follow-up was 13.38 (range 0-67.1) and the QOL 90.4 (range 43.8-100). At follow-up the mean diameter was 3.0 cm (range 1.20-4.5 cm), and the mean volume was 18 cm(3) (range 0.90-47.6 cm(3)). In 10 of 11 patients we obtained total or partial regression of symptoms. In one case the clinical manifestations persisted and it was thus considered unsuccessful. In conclusion, US-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and effective treatment even for fibroids up to 8 cm.
