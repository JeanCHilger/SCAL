Tuboovarian abscess after saline infusion sonohysterography: an unusual complication. A 45-year-old woman, nulligravida, who underwent saline infusion sonohysterography for infertility evaluation experienced fever and pelvic pain 7 days after the procedure. Transvaginal ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral tuboovarian abscesses (TOA). Because of persistent febrile morbidity despite treatment with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics, the TOA were drained under computed tomography guidance. We believe is the first reported case of TOA after saline infusion sonohysterography.
