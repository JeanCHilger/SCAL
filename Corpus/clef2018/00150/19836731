Colorectal endometriosis: benefits of long-term follow-up in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. In this retrospective cohort study, three groups of patients were included: 60 women who underwent endometriosis surgery with colorectal segmental resection, 40 women with surgical evidence of bowel endometriosis who underwent endometriosis removal without bowel resection, and 55 women affected by moderate or severe endometriosis with at least one endometrioma and deep infiltrating endometriosis but without bowel involvement. The results of a long-term ambulatory follow-up showed that if colorectal endometriosis was present, postoperative pain regression was more frequent, and among patients with bowel endometriosis the rate of recurrence was lower if segmental resection was performed.
