Obesity and altered arterial structure in young women with micropolycystic ovary syndrome. to compare echographical cardiovascular risk factors between obese and non-obese patients with micropolycystic ovarian syndrome (MPOS).in this transversal study, 30 obese (Body Mass Index, BMI>30 kg/m(2)) and 60 non-obese (BMI<30 kg/m(2)) MPOS patients, aging between 18 and 35 years old, were included. The following variables were measured: flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, thickness of the intima-media of the carotid artery (IMT), anthropometric data, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP). The women had no previous medical treatment and no comorbidity besides MPOS and obesity. For statistical analysis, the non-paired tand Mann-Whitney's tests were used.obese weighted more than non-obese patients (92.1+/-11.7 kg versus 61.4+/-10.7 kg, p<0.0001) and had a larger waist circumference (105.0+/-10.4 cm versus 78.5+/-9.8 cm, p<0.0001). The SBP of obese patients was higher than that of the non-obese ones (126.1+/-10.9 mmHg versus 115.8+/-9.0 mmHg, p<0.0001) and the IMT was also bigger (0.51+/-0.07 mm versus 0.44+/-0.09 mm, p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between the groups as to FMD and carotid rigidity index (beta).obesity in young women with MPOS is associated with higher blood pressure and alteration of arterial structure, represented by a thicker intima-media of the carotid artery.
