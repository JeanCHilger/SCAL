Ultrasound monitoring in patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization after methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy. To compare sonographic characteristics of the endometrium and follicles during in-vitro fertilization (IVF) before and after methotrexate (MTX) treatment for ectopic pregnancy.This retrospective study, conducted at Conception Hospital from January 2000 to July 2007, included all patients diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy resulting from IVF treatment that was treated with MTX and who then underwent another IVF cycle. We compared the number and size of follicles and the endometrial thickness and quality on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin injection in the cycles before and after the MTX treatment to determine whether MTX had any effect.Eleven patients were included in the study. The median interval between the IVF cycle resulting in ectopic pregnancy and the first IVF cycle after MTX therapy was 180 (range, 150-900) days. There was no statistically significant difference between the before and after MTX treatment groups with respect to number of follicles (14 (3-20) vs. 9 (4-16), P = 0.12), follicle size (16.5 (14.7-21.7) mm vs. 17.8 (14.9-19.8) mm, P = 0.37), endometrial thickness (10.0 (9.5-12.0) mm vs. 10.0 (7.5-14.0) mm, P = 0.31) or endometrial quality (P = 0.32). Four women became pregnant during the IVF cycle following MTX treatment.Ultrasound monitoring showed no modification of the characteristics of the endometrium or follicles during IVF after MTX treatment for ectopic pregnancy.
