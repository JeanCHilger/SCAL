Ovarian cystadenoma and ectopic pregnancy. A case report. A 40-year-old woman without symptoms, with a three-week amenorrhea, and with no previous pregnancy history. Three months before she followed treatment with clomifeno and no other risk factors. A measure of beta fraction is performed, finding a probable pregnancy of 3-4 weeks. A new measure of beta fraction is made three weeks later with an ultrasound, finding an important increment in measure, but without evidence of intrauterine pregnancy in the ultrasound. A new ultrasound is made seven weeks after her last period, finding a mass in the left ovary, but without increment in beta fraction. At week ten, she presents an uterine bleeding during a trip, which is diagnosed as a probable mole without any further medical treatment and from the 12th week, there is a considerable decrement in the beta fraction measure, without any other symptom, but the persistent adnexal mass at the left ovary, with irregular septum images at ultrasound. A laparotomy is performed finding an ectopic pregnancy surrounded by a serum cystadenoma.
