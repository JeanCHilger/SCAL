Diagnosis of deep infiltrating endometriosis: accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal 3D ultrasonography. To compare two different imaging modalities, magnetic resonance (MR), and three-dimensional sonography (3DUS), in order to evaluate the specific role in preoperative work-up of deep infiltrating endometriosis.33 women with endometriosis underwent 3DUS and MR followed by surgical and histopathological investigations. Investigators described the disease extension in the following sites: torus uterinus and uterosacral ligaments (USL), vagina, rectovaginal-septum, rectosigmoid, bladder, ovaries. Results were compared with surgical and histopathological findings.Ovarian and deep pelvic endometriosis were found by surgery and histology in, respectively, 24 (72.7%) and 22 (66.6%) of the 33 patients. Sensitivity and specificity values of 3DUS for the diagnosis of endometrial cysts were 87.5% and 100%, respectively those of MRI were 96.8% and 91.1%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of 3DUS for the diagnosis of deep infiltrating endometriosis in specific sites were: USL 50% and 94.7%MR accurately diagnoses deep infiltrating endometriosis 3DUS accurately diagnoses deep infiltrating endometriosis in specific locations.
