Current strategies in radiotherapy for cervical and endometrial carcinoma. We used combinations of taxan-based neoadjuvant and adjuvant full-dose chemotherapy and aggressive combined radiotherapy including clinical target volume extension, increased total dosage, hyperthermia, cryo- and local chemotherapy as radiosensitizers, for treatment of invasive and locally-advanced breast cancer or endometrial carcinoma with poor prognosis. 3D-ultrasound/CT/MRI--based designing of radiotherapy and monitoring of dynamic definition of target volume and "high risk volume" in organs at risk in cases of tumor progression was an indispensable measure. As a result, no local recurrence was reported in 73% for 36 months.
