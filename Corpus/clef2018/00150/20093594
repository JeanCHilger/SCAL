Advances in sonographic detection of ovarian cancer: depiction of tumor neovascularity with microbubbles. The purpose of this article is to discuss and illustrate the use of contrast-enhanced transvaginal sonography for the early detection of ovarian cancer and suggest how this technique may best be used to distinguish benign from malignant ovarian masses.Microbubble-enhanced transvaginal sonography can enhance the evaluation of ovarian masses by early detection of tumor microvascularity.
