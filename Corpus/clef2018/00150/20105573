Polypoid arteriovenous malformation in the jejunum of a child that mimics intussusception. Polypoid arteriovenous malformations, which are localized in the colon, are extremely rare in adults, with only 7 cases published to date. Here we present the case of a 6-year-old girl with a jejunal polypoid tumor that a sonogram and a computed tomographic scan have shown to resemble intussusception. Histologically, numerous large ectatic veins intermixed with small-caliber arteries, venules, arterioles, and capillaries were observed in the intestinal wall. A retrospective computed tomographic scan 3-dimensional angiographic reconstruction demonstrated that this may be a diagnostic characteristic. Clinical and morphologic comparisons with previously reported cases were discussed.
