Menstrual dysfunction in rural young women and the presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome. The present study was done to show the incidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in rural young women with menstrual irregularities and the correlation with different variables. During the study period, 19,339 women had attended as a gynaecological outpatient unit. A total of 9,096 (47%) of them were of 15-34 years age, of whom 1,182 (13%) had menstrual disturbances. Out of the 1,182 young women, 216 were the study subjects as per inclusion-exclusion criteria, but only 200 could be studied. After complete clinical, ultrasonographic and biochemical evaluation, it was revealed that PCOS is common in rural young women of low socioeconomic class. Such women presenting with menstrual irregularities need to be investigated for the presence of other endocrine disorders which may be present with or without PCOS. PCOS was diagnosed in 100 (50%) women. Of the 100 without PCOS, five had thyroid disorders and of the other 95, 49 (51%) had polycystic ovaries on sonography. Significantly more study objects had a family history of hypertension, diabetes and menstrual irregularities in their mothers. A state of hyperinsulinaemia indicated by a low fasting glucose to insulin ratio was present, even in non-obese women with PCOS.
