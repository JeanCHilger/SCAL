Sonohysterosalpingography versus hysterosalpingography in the evaluation of uterine and tubal infertility. The evaluation of the role of sonohysterosalpingography with saline with air as a contrast solution (HYCOSY), in the assessment of uterine cavity and tubal patency, versus hysterosalpingography (HSG) and laparoscopy with dye test combined with hysteroscopy.Prospective study of 95 infertility patients, with ages 25-40 years (median 31), in which HYCOSY was compared with HSG regarding the diagnostic acuracy for uterine cavity pathology and tubal patency, and compared to laparoscopy with dye test combined with hysteroscopy as gold standard.The sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the diagnostic of uterine cavity pathology was: HYCOSY versus hysteroscopy of 72.1%, 96.15%, 93.93% and 80.64% respectively HSG versus hysteroscopy was 83.3%, 60.7%, 63.6% and 81.6%HYCOSY can be used in combination with HSG for selecting the patients that need further more invasive investigations, in order to describe uterine and tubal pathology.
