Dietary glycemic index and load in relation to risk of uterine leiomyomata in the Black Women's Health Study. High dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) may promote tumorigenesis by increasing endogenous concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or the bioavailability of estradiol. In vitro studies have shown that uterine leiomyoma (UL) cells proliferate in response to IGF-I and display increased IGF-I gene expression and protein synthesis. Previous epidemiologic studies suggest that a high GL is a risk factor for endometrial and ovarian cancers, which, like UL, are hormone-responsive tumors.We investigated the relation of dietary GI and GL with UL risk in the Black Women's Health Study.In this prospective cohort study, we followed 21,861 premenopausal women for incident UL from 1997 to 2007. Diet was assessed in 1995 and 2001 with food-frequency questionnaires. We used Cox regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs, controlled for potential confounders.During 162,604 person-years of follow-up, there were 5800 cases of UL diagnosed by ultrasound or surgery. Dietary GI was weakly associated with UL risk overall (IRR for highest compared with lowest quintile: 1.09 95% CI: 0.99, 1.19Our results suggest that high dietary GI and GL may be associated with an increased UL risk in some women. The observed associations warrant investigation in future studies.
