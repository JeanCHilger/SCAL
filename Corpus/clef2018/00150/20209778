Large ovarian cyst associated with pregnancy. Case report. The incidence of adnexal masses in pregnancy is rather low. The diagnosis has become more common with the routine use of ultrasonography in prenatal care. The management of adnexal masses during pregnancy remains controversial. Ultrasonography can characterise correctly the adnexal mass and avoid antepartum surgery. We present the case of a 32 years old gravida, IV gesta, I para, with an ovarian cystic tumour that enlarged during pregnancy from 7 cm to 20 cm. The tumour was correctly characterised by ultrasound exam (Sassone 3) and surgery was not indicated. The pregnancy evoluated well and the patient delivered at term by c. section and ovariectomy was also performed. The postpartum evolution was good.
