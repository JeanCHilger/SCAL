Ultrasonographic characteristics of ovarian carcinosarcoma. To summarize the ultrasonographic characteristics of ovarian carcinosarcoma (OCS).Totally 12 patients with OCS have been detected in our department. All patients underwent surgical resection and the OCSs were confirmed pathologically. Ultrasound examination was performed before operation. Imaging features were analyzed retrospectively for bilaterality, size, and tumor solidity (cystic or solid). Presence of ascites and other evidence of peritoneal seeding, adjacent organ invasion, and surgical staging were also evaluated.Unilateral OCSs were found in 11 patients and bilateral OCSs in one patient one side was missed by ultrasound). Nine OCSs were solid, and 3 were mixed (solid and cystic). The diameter of the largest dimension was less than 10 cm in 4 cases, 10-20 cm in 7 cases, and larger than 20 cm in one case. Other ultrasonographic findings including peritoneal seeding and direct invasion into the adjacent organs were seen in 8 patients. Surgical stages were International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification c and b in one patient each, c in 9 patients, and in one patient.OCSs usually present as large, hypoechoic, solid, and aggressive tumors, combined with frequent peritoneal seeding and adjacent organ invasion.
