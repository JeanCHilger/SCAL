Virtual hysterosalpingography: a new multidetector CT technique for evaluating the female reproductive system. Recent advances in reproductive medicine have generated a demand for more accurate imaging methods for identifying the specific cause of female infertility and other gynecologic disorders. Virtual hysterosalpingography is an emerging modality in which aspects of the established technique of hysterosalpingography are combined with the cutting-edge technology of multidetector computed tomography (CT) to allow a comprehensive and highly accurate evaluation of both the female reproductive system and the pelvic anatomy generally. Unlike ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, multidetector CT is capable of depicting both the external and internal surfaces of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and other pelvic organs, providing high-resolution data that are suitable for two- and three-dimensional reconstructions and virtual endoscopic views. Thus, virtual hysterosalpingography may prove to be superior to other noninvasive modalities for evaluating tubal patency. Moreover, in comparison with conventional hysterosalpingography, which may involve cervical clamping, virtual hysterosalpingography is painless. Because of the health risks associated with ionizing radiation, the use of another modality (eg, MR imaging, US) may be preferred if the presence of a focal uterine lesion is strongly suspected. However, virtual hysterosalpingography with multidetector CT may provide a diagnostic advantage in complex cases.
