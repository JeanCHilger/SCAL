Management of asymptomatic ovarian and other adnexal cysts imaged at US: Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference Statement. The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a panel of specialists from gynecology, radiology, and pathology to arrive at a consensus regarding the management of ovarian and other adnexal cysts imaged sonographically in asymptomatic women. The panel met in Chicago, Ill, on October 27-28, 2009, and drafted this consensus statement. The recommendations in this statement are based on analysis of current literature and common practice strategies, and are thought to represent a reasonable approach to asymptomatic ovarian and other adnexal cysts imaged at ultrasonography.
