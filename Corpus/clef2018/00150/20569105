Atherogenic metabolic profile in PCOS patients: role of obesity and hyperandrogenism. To investigate glyco-lipidic metabolism and androgenic profile in a cohort of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) divided according to Rotterdam phenotypes and body mass index (BMI).A prospective case-control study.Gynecology department in a teaching hospital. Patients. A total of 223 PCOS women and 25 healthy control women were studied.Patients and controls were subdivided into three groups according to their BMI: normal weight (18.5 ≤ [BMI] ≤24.9 kg/m(2)), overweight (25.0 ≤ BMI ≤29.9 kg/m(2)), or obese (BMI ≥30.0 kg/m(2)) and according to Rotterdam criteria of PCOS. Main outcome measures. Pituitary-gonadal axis assessment including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, PRL, testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-S, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and inhibin B. Metabolic parameters included cholesterol (Chol), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and apolipoproteins (APO) AII and B as well as serum fasting insulin, glucose and HOMA-IR.Serum fasting insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, TG and HDL were significantly higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. Additionally, serum levels of Chol, LDL and TG were significantly higher and HDL levels were significantly lower in obese PCOS women compared with overweight/normal PCOS irrespective of Rotterdam phenotypes. Free testosterone index but not androstenedione or total testosterone significantly correlated with TG, HDL and APO B. No significant correlations were detected between gonadotropins, inhibin B or estradiol with metabolic parameters studied.Obesity but not overweight in PCOS is associated with dyslipidemia. Hyperandrogenic women showed the most atherogenic lipid profiles.
