Development of morphologically dominant follicles is associated with fewer metabolic disturbances in amenorrheic women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a pilot study. To determine if amenorrheic women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) demonstrate ultrasonographically detectable changes in follicle population.Sixteen women with PCOS reporting the absence of menses for more than 3 months were enrolled in the study. Subjects had a physical examination, fasting blood tests and two transvaginal ultrasound scans spaced 1 month apart. In cases where evidence of a morphologically dominant follicle (≥ 10 mm in diameter) occurred, subsequent ultrasound scans were performed to determine the fate of the dominant follicle. Differences in total follicle population, maximum follicle diameter and clinical, hormonal and metabolic features were determined.Forty-four percent of subjects showed changes in follicle population of 6-10 follicles and 37% showed changes in follicle population of > 10. Maximum follicle diameters ranged between 5.4 and 33.0 mm. Four subjects demonstrated follicle diameters ≥ 10 mm. Of those who developed dominant follicles, two subjects ovulated, one subject developed a persistent anovulatory follicle and the dominant follicle regressed in the remaining subject. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS were similar among women that did or did not develop dominant follicles (menstrual cycle length, P = 0.880 hirsutism score, P = 0.809Amenorrheic women with PCOS demonstrate changes in follicle population that are consistent with active follicle growth and regression despite prolonged periods of anovulation. Morphologic selection occurs in amenorrheic women and attainment of dominant follicles is associated with improved metabolic status.
