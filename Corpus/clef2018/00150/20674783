Complications of hysteroscopic and uterine resectoscopic surgery. Adverse events associated with hysteroscopic procedures are in general rare, but, with increasing operative complexity, it is now apparent that they are experienced more often. A spectrum of complications exist ranging from those that relate to generic components of procedures such as patient positioning and anesthesia and analgesia, to a number that are specific to intraluminal endoscopic surgery (perforation and injuries to surrounding structures and blood vessels). The response of premenopausal women to excessive absorption of nonionic fluids deserves special attention. There is also an increasing awareness of uncommon but problematic sequelae related to the use of monopolar uterine resectoscopes that involve thermal injury to the vulva and vagina. The uterus that has previously undergone hysteroscopic surgery can behave in unusual ways, at least in premenopausal women who experience menstruation or who become pregnant. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in these adverse events, as well as the use or development of several devices, have collectively provided the opportunity to perform hysteroscopic and resectoscopic surgery in a manner that minimizes risk to the patient.
