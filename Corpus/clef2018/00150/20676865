Heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder: report of two cases. This report presents two cases of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder. In case 1, the patient was a 43-year-old man who presented with diarrhea and fever. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a sessile polypoid lesion in the body of the gallbladder that grew over 2 months. Gallbladder carcinoma was suspected and a cholecystectomy was performed. Examination of an intraoperative frozen specimen of the elevated lesion in the body of the gallbladder suggested a gallbladder carcinoma invading the subserosal layer. A bile duct resection and regional lymph node dissection were performed. However, the postoperative permanent sections revealed heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder. Case 2 was an 80-year-old man. Screening abdominal ultrasonography revealed a sessile polypoid lesion in the gallbladder. This lesion was correctly diagnosed as heterotopic gastric mucosa in the gallbladder by the intraoperative frozen examination. The pertinent literature on this topic is reviewed.
