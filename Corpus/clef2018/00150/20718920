Use of 3D imaging and awareness of GEC-ESTRO recommendations for cervix cancer brachytherapy throughout Australia and New Zealand. A 2005 survey of practices indicated limited use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities and planning methods in cervix cancer brachytherapy in Australia and New Zealand. However, advancing technologies and published recommendations are influencing change. This survey aims to identify both changes in practice and awareness and uptake of Groupe European de Curietherapie of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) recommendations.A survey was emailed to all radiotherapy departments with brachytherapy facilities. Twenty departments practise brachytherapy for cancer of the cervix. The survey consisted of five questions enquiring about use and type of 3D imaging rate of reimaging and replanningA 100% response rate was obtained. Sixty-five per cent of departments use 3D CT imaging to plan brachytherapy insertions. Thirty per cent of departments use two-dimensional (2D) x-rays. Four departments (20%) use a combination of imaging modalities including CT, ultrasound and MRI. Sixty-five per cent of departments reimage and replan for each insertion. Four departments (20%) contour, prescribe dose and report treatment according to GEC-ESTRO recommendations.There has been a marked increase in the use of 3D imaging and awareness of GEC-ESTRO recommendations. Implementation and reporting of image-based gynaecological brachytherapy is strongly dependent on local resources and infrastructure.
