Pregnancy within the uterine scar of a prior Caesarean section. Rarely, but with increasing frequency, we detect pregnancies within the uterine scar of a prior Caesarean section. These ectopic pregnancies entail a risk of severe bleeding and uterine rupture, and thus constitute a threat to the pregnant woman's life, underlining the necessity of awareness about these complications. Vaginal bleeding and/or mild to moderate lower abdominal pain are symptoms seen in half of the women. The diagnosis is made by sonography and criteria for these are listed. We here present the most recent studies on treatment strategies, follow-up and future fertility.
