Three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound--clinical implementation in benign gynecological disorders. The implementation of three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal (TV) ultrasound (US) in gynecology increases progressively. The method is successfully used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of benign gynecological pathology--congenital anomalies of the female reproductive system, fibroids, endometriosis, adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, pelvic inflammatory disease, adnexal masses, ectopic pregnancy, etc. This review describes the current use of 3D TV US in gynecological practice.
