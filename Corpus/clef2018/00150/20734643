Congenital rhabdomyoma--prenatal diagnosis with three-dimensional ultrasound of two cases with different pregnancy outcome. Congenital rhabdomyoma is the most common benign tumor of the fetal heart. Usually it occurs as a single or multiple lesions located within the ventricles and it is often associated with tuberous sclerosis after birth. We present two cases of congenital rhabdomyoma diagnosed in the third trimester with three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound. Both cases had different pregnancy outcome.
