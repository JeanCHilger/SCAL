Learning curve of transvaginal ultrasound for the diagnosis of endometriomas assessed by the cumulative summation test (LC-CUSUM). A specific statistical tool (the cumulative summation test for learning curve or LC-CUSUM) was used to monitor the learning curve of four trainees for the diagnosis of endometriomas by transvaginal ultrasound. A large intertrainee variability in the learning curves was found, justifying a tailored training to learn this diagnosis.
