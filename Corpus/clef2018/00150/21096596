Automatic colon polyp flagging via geometric and texture features. Computer Tomographic Colonography, combined with computer-aided detection (CAD), is a promising emerging technique for colonic polyp analysis. We present a CAD scheme for polyp flagging based on new texture and geometric features that consider both the information in the candidate polyp location and its immediate surrounding area, testing multiple sizes. The proposed algorithm is tested with ground truth data, including flat and small polyps, with very promising results.
