A pelvic "blue" node. What's your diagnosis?. We report a case of 31-year-old woman presented with a chronic pelvic pain and a 3-cm left ovarian cyst on ultrasonography. At the time of laparoscopy, we observed two blue peritoneal lesions at the pelvic insertion of left round ligament. Histopathological examination of a biopsy showed a pigmentation due to a decorative tattoo of the left thigh.
