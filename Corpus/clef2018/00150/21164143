Seminal vesicles and diabetic neuropathy: ultrasound evaluation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ultrasound characteristics of the seminal vesicles (SV) of infertile patients with diabetes and neuropathy, and possible changes in relation to duration of diabetes. Sixty infertile patients with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic neuropathy were selected. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to duration of diabetes (group A ≤ 5 years, group B between 5 and 15 years, and group C ≥ 15 years). A pathological control group of 20 infertile patients without diabetes and a real control group of 20 healthy fertile men were selected and compared. Patients underwent prostate-vesicular transrectal ultrasonography and sperm analysis. The following ultrasound parameters were recorded: 1) body anteroposterior diameter (APD) 2) fundus APD
