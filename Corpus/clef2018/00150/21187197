Can hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography replace hysterosalpingography in confirming tubal blockage after hysteroscopic sterilization and in the evaluation of the uterus and tubes in infertile patients? The objective of the study was to assess the accuracy of hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) in establishing tubal patency or blockage and evaluating the uterine cavity by comparing it with hysteroscopy laparoscopy (HLC) or hysterosalpingography (HSG).This study was a chart review evaluating infertility patients and patients who had undergone hysteroscopic sterilization who underwent both HyCoSy and HLC or HyCoSy and HSG at private offices associated with university hospitals. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of HyCoSy were calculated.HyCoSy compared with HLC had a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 82%, and HyCoSy compared with HSG was 100% concordant. Uterine cavities evaluated by sonohysterography and hysteroscopy were 100% concordant.HyCoSy is accurate in determining tubal patency and evaluating the uterine cavity, suggesting it could supplant HSG not only as the first-line diagnostic test in an infertility workup but also in confirming tubal blockage after hysteroscopic sterilization.
