Assessment of endometrial morphology and histology in postmenopausal women. Evaluate in outpatients, the endometrial morphology and histology of non-bleeding postmenopausal women.We conducted a descriptive study where 52 menopausal women were selected, between 50 and 60 years of age, who had not used hormone replacement therapy in the last six months and did not present any kind of vaginal bleeding after menopause. These women underwent ultrasound examination, hysteroscopy and biopsy, and then endometrial findings were analyzed.Of the 52 women selected, thirty two (61.5%) had normal ultrasound, normal uterine cavity with atrophic endometrium, hysteroscopy, confirmed by endometrial biopsy. Twenty (38.4%) had hysteroscopic and histologic alterations and only five women showed by ultrasound an endometrial thickness of more than five millimeters.Diagnostic Hysteroscopy associated with aspiration biopsy (Pipelle) performed in the day care facility can reveal endometrial alterations that cannot be diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound.
