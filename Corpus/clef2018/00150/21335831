A development of surgical simulator for training of operative skills using patient-specific data. At the Advanced Medical Research Center at Yokohama City University School of Medicine, we have been developing a practical surgical simulator for renal surgery. Unlike already commercialized laparoscopic surgical simulators, our surgical simulator is capable of using patient-specific models for preoperative training and improvement of laparoscopic surgical skills. We have been evaluating the simulator clinically with the aim of using it in renal surgery training at Yokohama City University Hospital. The simulator can be applied to other types of laparoscopic surgery, such as gynecological, thoracic, and gastrointestinal. Here, we report on the technical aspects of the simulator.
