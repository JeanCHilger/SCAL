Screening pelvic tumours for hereditary risk of ovarian neoplasms, a cancer center experience. As part of a study in the North of France for screening pelvic tumours with plasma proteomic analysis, we included 82 women with hereditary risk of ovarian cancer. We report here the consequences of organized screening with usual tests. CA 125 sampling and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound by a radiologist were systematically conducted every 6 months. Seventy-two patients were eventually evaluable. Two incident cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis (FIGO IIIB, malignant epithelial serous high-grade tumors) were discovered in two asymptomatic women with a deleterous BRCA1 mutation (2.7%). We did not observe any other primary cancer cases but an ovarian metastasis of a breast cancer. Forty women went off the study: 32 had a prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Consistent with the literature, biannual screening tests combining CA125 and pelvis ultrasound is ineffective for early detection of a pelvic tumor of tubal or ovarian origin. Testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious mutations is then crucial for suspected family syndromes of breast and ovarian cancer. For women carrying a deleterous mutation on BRCA1/2 a salpingo-oophorectomy is the only way, only the time of this surgery is debatable.
