Multidetector computerized tomography enteroclysis vs. rectal water contrast transvaginal ultrasonography in determining the presence and extent of bowel endometriosis. To compare the accuracy of multidetector computerized tomography enteroclysis (MDCT-e) and rectal water contrast transvaginal ultrasonography (RWC-TVS) in determining the presence and extent of bowel endometriosis.This prospective study included 96 patients of reproductive age with suspicion of bowel endometriosis. Patients underwent MDCT-e and RWC-TVS before operative laparoscopy. Findings of MDCT-e and RWC-TVS were compared with histological results. The severity of pain experienced during MDCT-e and RWC-TVS was measured by a 10-cm visual analog scale.Fifty-one patients had bowel endometriotic nodules at surgery. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for the diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis were 95.8% (46/48), 100.0% (48/48), 100.0% (46/46), 96.0% (48/50) and 97.9% (94/96) for MDCT-e and 93.8% (45/48), 97.9% (47/48), 97.8% (45/46), 94.0% (47/50) and 95.8% (92/96) for RWC-TVS. MDCT-e was associated with more intense pain than was RWC-TVS.MDCT-e and RWC-TVS have similar accuracy in the diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis, but patients tolerate RWC-TVS better than they do MDCT-e.
