Outcomes in the ultrasound follow-up of the Essure micro-insert: complications and proper placement. To review the use of three-dimensional ultrasound follow-up of the Essure micro-insert placement at three months for the identification of misplaced coils and complications.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of reproductive age women requesting permanent sterilization in a tertiary care ambulatory women's clinic. Women who underwent placement of the Essure micro-insert were assessed for appropriate positioning of the Essure micro-insert coil using three-dimensional ultrasound as well as hysterosalpingography when indicated.A total of 610 women who had undergone the Essure procedure with ultrasound follow-up at three months were retrospectively reviewed and in 524 (86%) the location and shape were both normal. The remaining 86 (15%) required hysterosalpingography to confirm proper placement, 34 because of a non-diagnostic ultrasound and the remaining 52 for a complication noted on ultrasound, including perforation, proximal or distal migration of the device, or device expulsion.Ultrasound can be used at three months after Essure placement to identify normal placement as well as misplaced and perforated devices.
