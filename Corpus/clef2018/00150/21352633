Successful delivery of a twin pregnancy in a bicornuate uterus (uterus bicornis unicollis) by bilateral Caesarean section. MÃ¼llerian duct anomalies occur in 0.1% to 3% of women, and they are often associated with reproductive problems such as miscarriage, premature labour, premature rupture of the membranes, or malpresentation. Having a twin pregnancy in a patient with a bicornuate uterus (uterus bicornis unicollis) is rare, especially if it is a spontaneous conception.A 40-year-old primigravid woman conceived a twin dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy after three years of primary infertility. She was found on 3-D ultrasound examination to have a bicornuate uterus with one fetus in each horn The prenatal course was uncomplicated. At 38 weeks' gestation, twin babies were successfully delivered by elective bilateral low transverse Caesarean section.Because the incidence of such pregnancies is very low, it remains unclear whether a twin pregnancy in a bicornuate uterus is better delivered vaginally or by elective Caesarean section.
