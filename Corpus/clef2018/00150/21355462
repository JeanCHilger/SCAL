Development of secondary ovarian lesions after hysterectomy without oophorectomy versus unilateral oophorectomy for benign conditions: a retrospective analysis of patients during a nine-year period of observation. The effect of retained one or both ovaries on the de novo ovarian pathologies required re-operation after hysterectomy due to benign gynecologic conditions were investigated retrospectively. This study was done to determine the occurrence of disease in retained ovaries after hysterectomy.A retrospective analysis of patient charts was performed, comparing the patient reports of women who had secondary ovarian lesions those whose previously undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy or without oophorectomy in our Department during the nine year period of observation (2000-2009). The study included 1242 women with at least one ovary saved after hysterectomy for benign indications.De novo ovarian disease was established in 5.1% of patients of hysterectomy without oophorectomy and in 17.6% of patients of at least one ovary saved after hysterectomy for benign indications (p = 0.005). Ovarian pathology requiring re-operation developed in 3.8% of patients who underwent hysterectomy without oophorectomy and in 5.9% of patients who underwent hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy (p = 0.536).Women with unilateral oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy had more than twice the risk of secondary ovarian lesions, compared with those without oophorectomy at hysterectomy. Determinants, such as age, parity and gravidity must be considered when deciding whether or not to perform oophorectomy at hysterectomy.
