The effect of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate on preterm birth in women with an ultrasound-indicated cerclage. We sought to determine if 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) reduces the rate of preterm birth (PTB) in women with an ultrasound-indicated cerclage (UIC). We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of women with a previous spontaneous PTB and current UIC placement for cervical length (CL) < 25 mm at < 23 (6)/ (7) weeks. The study group consisted of women treated with 17P the control group consisted of women not treated with 17P. Primary outcome was spontaneous PTB < 35 weeks. Secondary outcomes included PTB < 32 weeks, PTB < 28 weeks, gestational age at delivery, and birth weight. A total of 58 women were identified
