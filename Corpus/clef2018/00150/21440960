Primary epithelioid trophoblastic tumor with a synchronous breast carcinoma detected only with FDG-PET/CT Scan. Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor is a recently described, rare and distinctive type of gestational trophoblastic tumor. We report the case of a 31-year old patient who had a full-term pregnancy 18 months before presentation. She had a right axillary lymph node metastasis and was referred for FDG-PET/CT scan for evaluation of distant metastasis and to detect primary malignancy. The axillary lymph node biopsy revealed metastatic breast carcinoma. FDG-PET/CT revealed increased uptake of right axillary lymph node, soft tissue density lesion with a diameter of 24 mm on left cervical region with increased FDG uptake, increased uptake on cervical region and left inguinal lymph node with increased uptake. Pelvic MRI imaging and ultrasonography were negative for malignancy in cervical region. Biopsy of the lesion was consistent with epithelioid trophoblastic tumor in cervical region. Gestational trophoblastic tumor was not suspected because she had no signs such as abnormal vaginal bleeding. FDG-PET/CT demonstrated the primary lesion in cervical region. We report a rare case of primary epithelioid trophoblastic tumor detected only with FDG-PET/CT scan which synchronized with breast carcinoma.
