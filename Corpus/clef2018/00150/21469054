Calculi in a blindly ending ureteric bud - an unusual cause for an overactive bladder syndrome and dyspareunia. The current case report describes a blindly ending ureteric bud filled with calculi as a cause for an overactive bladder syndrome and dyspareunia which was therapy-resistant for 5 years. The symptoms could be solved by an interdisciplinary collaboration of urologists and gynaecologists in a pelvic floor centre. A transurethral resection of the ureteric bud with removal of the calculi was performed. This case report confirms the need of extensive diagnostic measures if an overactive bladder syndrome presents as therapy-resistant.
