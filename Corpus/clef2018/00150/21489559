Pelvic ultrasonography in the evaluation of central precocious puberty: comparison with leuprolide stimulation test. To compare the ovarian and uterine structure demonstrated sonographically with baseline and leuprolide-stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol values in females with suspected precocious puberty.Retrospective chart review. Fifty females (age 3.1 to 9.5 years) underwent stimulation testing with leuprolide (20 Î¼g/kg) and pelvic ultrasonography. Subjects were grouped as (1) prepubertal (baseline and stimulated LH and estradiol in prepubertal range) (2) early pubertal (baseline LH and estradiol in prepubertal range but stimulated LH or estradiol in pubertal range)Baseline and stimulated LH and stimulated estradiol significantly correlated with ovarian and uterine volumes. Ovarian and uterine volumes were significantly higher in females in the pubertal group than in females in the prepubertal group. No significant differences were noted in the ovarian or uterine dimensions between the prepubertal and early pubertal groups. There was significant overlap in ovarian and uterine volumes among females in all three groups.Contrary to leuprolide stimulation, pelvic ultrasonography alone cannot distinguish between prepubertal females and those in the early stages of puberty.
