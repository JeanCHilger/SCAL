Feasibility of 3.0T pelvic MR imaging in the evaluation of endometriosis. Endometriosis represents an important clinical problem in women of reproductive age with high impact on quality of life, work productivity and health care management. The aim of this study is to define the role of 3T magnetom system MRI in the evaluation of endometriosis.Forty-six women, with transvaginal (TV) ultrasound examination positive for endometriosis, with pelvic pain, or infertile underwent an MR 3.0T examination with the following protocol: T2 weighted FRFSE HR sequences, T2 weighted FRFSE HR CUBE 3D sequences, T1 w FSE sequences, LAVA-flex sequences. Pelvic anatomy, macroscopic endometriosis implants, deep endometriosis implants, fallopian tube involvement, adhesions presence, fluid effusion in Douglas pouch, uterus and kidney pathologies or anomalies associated and sacral nervous routes were considered by two radiologists in consensus. Laparoscopy was considered the gold standard.MRI imaging diagnosed deep endometriosis in 22/46 patients, endometriomas not associated to deep implants in 9/46 patients, 15/46 patients resulted negative for endometriosis, 11 of 22 patients with deep endometriosis reported ovarian endometriosis cyst. We obtained high percentages of sensibility (96.97%), specificity (100.00%), VPP (100.00%), VPN (92.86%).Pelvic MRI performed with 3T system guarantees high spatial and contrast resolution, providing accurate information about endometriosis implants, with a good pre-surgery mapping of the lesions involving both bowels and bladder surface and recto-uterine ligaments.
