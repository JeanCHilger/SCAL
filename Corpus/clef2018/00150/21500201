Angiosarcoma of the ovary arising in a mucinous cystadenoma. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with a pelvic mass extending into the upper abdomen. Transabdominal sonography revealed a complex left adnexal mass. Color Doppler imaging and spectral Doppler analysis showed increased vascularity with low impedance blood flow signals, suggestive of neovascularization. The patient underwent a laparotomy and a 56-kg predominantly cystic tumor was removed from the left adnexal region. The patient died 3 months later with pulmonary metastases and massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Postmortem resampling of the ovarian tumor initially diagnosed as mucinous cystadenoma showed nodular areas of malignant pleomorphic cells consistent with angiosarcoma.
