Potential role of 3DUS in infants and children. The objective of this review is to discuss basic technical aspects as well as potential pediatric applications of three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS). Different 3DUS-techniques are already commercially available. Most commonly, a transducer-integrated motor drives a scan-head to acquire a volumetric dataset, which is then reconstructed and viewed using various post-processing techniques. It has been proved feasible to apply 3DUS with pediatric transducers in typical pediatric investigations. Based on our own experiences and on review of the literature, 3DUS can be successfully used in infants and children for brain, spine, cardiac, urinary tract (particularly assessment of hydronephrosis, and virtual cystoscopy), and female genital (e.g., for assessment of uterine malformations) US, and for various other applications, particularly in small parts. Power Doppler data can be integrated, allowing 3DUS-angiography. Thus, 3DUS promises to become a useful adjunct for imaging children, particularly as it enhances ultrasound by offering additional, previously inaccessible planes, rendering options and surface assessments. 3DUS should be increasingly exploited, thus hopefully helping reduce the need for more invasive or burdening (e.g., ionizing radiation) investigations in children.
