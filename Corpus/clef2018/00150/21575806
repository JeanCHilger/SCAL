Clinical management of the short cervix. Cervical cerclage is associated with prolongation of gestation in singleton pregnancies with prior spontaneous preterm delivery and a short cervix on vaginal ultrasonography in the mid-trimester. Ultrasound screening of cervical length is not indicated in low-risk singleton pregnancies and in women with multiple gestations. 17Î±-Hydroxyprogesterone does not prevent preterm delivery in twin gestations with a short cervix. Cervical cerclage may cause detrimental effects in twin gestations. Vaginal pessary for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a short cervix is currently under active investigation.
