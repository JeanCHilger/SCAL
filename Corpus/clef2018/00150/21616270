Ovarian fibroma with marked ascites and elevated serum levels of CA-125 in a young girl. We report a case of ovarian fibroma with marked ascites and elevated serum CA-125 levels in a young girl. Ovarian fibromas are rare in children. They usually present as a solid mass and may be associated with ascites and elevated serum CA-125 levels. Because of their solid nature and these associations, they can be mistaken for a malignant tumor, resulting in unnecessary oophorectomy. Ovarian fibromas are benign neoplasms, and the prognosis is extremely good. Surgical management should be an ovarian-sparing tumor excision. Although uncommon in pediatric patients, ovarian fibromas should be included in the differential diagnosis of ovarian mass in children.
