Ultrasonographic evaluation and anti-mullerian hormone levels after laparoscopic stripping of unilateral endometriomas. To evaluate the ovarian reserve after laparoscopic stripping of unilateral endometriomas by comparing the operated and non-operated ovaries.Bilateral ovarian volumes, antral follicle counts, and stromal blood flows were assessed by ultrasonography and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels were analysed in 36 patients who had undergone laparoscopic cystectomy for unilateral ovarian endometrioma.Mean antral follicle counts (AFC) of the operated side ovaries were significantly lower on the second postoperative day (3.1 ± 2.4 vs 5.2 ± 3.7 p<0.05) and in the third month (3.7 ± 2.1 vs 6.4 ± 2.7Although laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas seems to affect the ovarian reserve in terms of AFCs, it does not have a significant negative impact at the end of three months as assessed by ovarian volumes, Doppler indices and AMH levels. Endometrioma surgery techniques are important in preserving normal functioning ovaries and further studies are necessary for optimising these surgical approaches.
