Cervical ectopic pregnancy diagnosed by point-of-care emergency department ultrasound. Although rare, cervical ectopic pregnancy (EP) represents a potentially lethal variation of a common first-trimester disease entity.We report a case of low abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding diagnosed as a cervical EP by point-of-care ultrasound.Familiarity with cervical EP and its sonographic appearance is essential for emergency physicians because it can be easily mistaken for an intrauterine pregnancy or other obstetric/gynecologic pathology, such as an incomplete abortion or nabothian cyst. The management of each of these differs substantially, making accurate diagnosis crucial.
