Comparison of success rates of 'transvaginal aspiration and tetracycline sclerotherapy' versus 'only aspiration' in the management of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts. To investigate the value of tetracycline sclerotherapy for management of recurrent or persisting non-neoplastic ovarian cysts in comparison to the aspiration without sclerotherapy.Ninety-six patients with proven non-neoplastic ovarian cysts were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients underwent cyst aspiration together with tetracycline sclerotherapy (n=48). Group 2 patients underwent only cyst aspiration without tetracycline sclerotherapy (n=48). Then, all patients were followed up monthly with ultrasonography for 12months. The procedure was considered to have failed if the recurring cyst, detected by ultrasound, was 4cm in size or greater.There were no differences between the two groups regarding demographic data, initial cyst volume and tumor markers. Recurrence rates within 12months were 14.6% in group 1 and 50% in group 2 (P<0.001).Based on the recurrence rates, we suggest transvaginal aspiration together with tetracycline sclerotherapy rather than only simple transvaginal aspiration in the management of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts.
