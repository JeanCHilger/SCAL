Conservative management of hyperreactio luteinalis: a case report. Hyperreactio luteinalis (HL) is characterized by bilaterally enlarged ovaries containing multiple self-limited theca lutein cysts and is usually associated with increased production of human chorionic gonadotropin in the presence of trophoblastic disease or multiple pregnancies. About 30 cases of HL have been reported in patients with normal singleton pregnancies, and most of these patients required surgical intervention during their first pregnancy because of ovarian torsion or to rule out of ovarian malignancy. However, the accurate diagnosis of HL by means of laboratory tests and magnetic resonance imaging and the exclusion of ovarian malignancy in asymptomatic pregnant woman may avoid unnecessary surgical intervention or termination of pregnancy. The present report describes case of HL in a woman with a normal singleton pregnancy in whom conservative management allowed the preservation of both ovaries.
