Ultrasound evaluation of intra-abdominal sites of disease to predict likelihood of suboptimal cytoreduction in advanced ovarian cancer: a prospective study. To analyze in advanced ovarian cancer patients the ability of ultrasound to evaluate the extent of intra-abdominal disease and to predict the likelihood of suboptimal cytoreduction.Into this prospective study, 147 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were enrolled consecutively between January 2005 and October 2008. All patients underwent standard laparotomy and maximal surgical effort was attempted. To create a new scoring system to predict suboptimal cytoreduction we considered the following sonographic parameters: peritoneal carcinomatosis, bowel mesentery involvement, omental involvement, massive pelvic involvement, ascites and liver and/or spleen metastases. Those parameters achieving a negative predictive value ≥ 50% and a positive predictive value ≥ 50% in predicting suboptimal cytoreduction were included in the ultrasound scoring system, which was then calculated for each patient.Ultrasound allowed a virtually conclusive diagnosis of massive pelvic involvement (sensitivity, 94% specificity, 97%), parenchymal liver metastases of any size (sensitivity, 93%Ultrasound examination is able to assess intra-abdominal disease in advanced ovarian cancer patients, with satisfactory concordance with laparotomic findings. Our ultrasound score can predict suboptimal cytoreduction and might be clinically useful.
