Male infertility and adult polycystic kidney disease--revisited: case report and current literature review. Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is one of the most common inherited disorders affecting one in 800-1000 live births. Extra-renal manifestation of APKD is not uncommon. Cysts involving the male and female reproductive system have been reported. However, fertility is affected only in male subjects. Among cysts involving the reproductive system, seminal vesicle cysts have been reported to be the most common. The effect of seminal vesicle cysts on male fertility has been controversial. Current literature reports that majority of men remain fertile. However, uraemia and its implications on fertility and abnormal semen parameters in men with seminal vesicle cysts must be taken into consideration. We herein present two patients with APKD with contrasting semen parameters and also review the current literature.
