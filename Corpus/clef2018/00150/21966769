Comparison of laparoscopic vs. laparotomy treatment in ovarian teratomas. Benign cystic teratoma is one of the most common benign tumors of the ovary, according to international series represents between 44 and 62% of all ovarian tumors diagnosed in women younger than 40 years.To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety between laparoscopy and laparotomy in the management of ovarian teratomas, as well as the recurrence between both techniques.Retrospective, clinical series study involving 169 cases of ovarian teratomas operated at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatolog√≠a Isidro Espinosa de los Reyes in the period comprehended between 2000-2008. The cases were divided into the ones solved by laparoscopy, corresponding to group 1 (102 cases) and 67 cases solved by laparotomy, corresponding to group 2.Group 1 (laparoscopic approach) consisted of 102 patients (60.3%), and group 2 (laparotomy approach) had 67 patients (39.7%). Surgical bleeding: 55.7 +/- 21.4 mL vs. 91.6 +/- 29.2 mL (p < 0.0001), hospital stay: 1.6 +/- 0.57 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.42 days (p < 0.0001), surgical time: 110.3 +/- 27.2 vs. 83.6 +/- 26.9 minutes (p < 0.0001), teratoma size: 7.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 11.5 +/- 4.2 cm (p < 0.0001) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Teratoma rupture had 57.8% incidence (59 cases) in group 1, and 16.4% in group 2 (11 cases). Laparoscopy was a risk factor for broken open for ovarian cyst (OR: 6.9 CI 95%: 3.3-14.8). Not a single case was complicated by chemical peritonitis in any study group.Laparoscopic approach to teratomas is a safe and efficient procedure, it does not increase complications in comparison to the laparotomy approach it presents less bleeding and short hospital stay, offering a quick recovery.
