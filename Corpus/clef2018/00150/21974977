Ovarian morphology in premenstrual dysphoria. Ovarian cyclicity is a prerequisite for premenstrual dysphoria (PMD), as illustrated by the fact that this condition is effectively eliminated by ovariectomy or by treatment with a GnRH agonist. Despite the possibility of differences in ovarian function between women with and without PMD, no study comparing ovarian morphology in these two groups has ever been published. Fifty-two women were recruited for this study 26 had premenstrual dysphoria, fulfilling criteria slightly modified from those of the premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and 26 were asymptomatic age-matched controls. Ovarian morphology was assessed using transvaginal 7 MHz ultrasonography on day 5 after the start of menses, and venous blood was sampled for hormone analysis on days 3 and 8, the expected day of ovulation, and day -4 of the menstrual cycle. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the prevalence of polycystic ovaries (PCO), the total number of follicles, the total ovarian volume or serum levels of androgen hormones. In addition, serum free testosterone levels in late premenstrual phase showed an inverse association to premenstrual symptoms of irritability and a similar inverse association trend to symptoms of depressed mood. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of ovaries with fewer than five antral or growing follicles was significantly higher in women with PMD than in controls (p=0.016). While the results do not support a role for PCO or androgen hormones in eliciting late luteal phase irritability, the possible relationship between oligofollicular ovaries and PMD deserves further study.
