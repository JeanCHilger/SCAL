Value of three-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue in the assessment of tubal patency. To investigate the accuracy of transvaginal three-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography using SonoVue (3D SonoVue-HyCoSy) in the assessment of Fallopian tubal patency.We recruited 75 infertile patients undergoing 3D SonoVue-HyCoSy before standard diagnostic laparoscopy with chromotubation (lap and dye). Tubal patency was assessed by automated 3D coded contrast imaging (3D SonoVue-HyCoSy), and the findings were compared with the results of lap and dye.For detecting tubal patency among the 150 Fallopian tubes assessed, 3D SonoVue-HyCoSy had a sensitivity of 93.5%, specificity of 86.3%, positive and negative predictive values of 87.8% and 92.6%, respectively, and diagnostic accuracy of 90.0%. The test-positive rates of 3D SonoVue-HyCoSy vs lap and dye were not significantly different (82/150 vs 77/150, P > 0.05).3D SonoVue-HyCoSy should be considered clinically valuable as a practical, non-invasive, primary investigatory tool for evaluating tubal patency.
