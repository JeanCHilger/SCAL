Forgotten intrauterine devices presenting with pre- and postmenopausal bleeding: a case series. We present two cases of retained intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs). The first presented with perimenopausal bleeding and dysmenorrhoea and the symptoms were resolved following the removal of an IUCD. The second presented with postmenopausal bleeding and had a Lippes loop in the uterine cavity. The symptoms resolved after the removal of the device.
