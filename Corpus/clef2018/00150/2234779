Vaginal ultrasound as a screening method for detection of adnexa tumors in postmenopause?. 424 ovaries of 212 postmenopausal women not on hormone treatment were examined by vaginal ultrasound. 155 patients had no clinical complaints, 57 patients showed atypical uterine bleeding. 48 pathological findings could be detected sonographically (11.3%). Among the histologically clarified cases were 2 asymptomatic ovarian cancers. Altogether, the vaginosonography proved to be a very simple and effective method to detect ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women.
