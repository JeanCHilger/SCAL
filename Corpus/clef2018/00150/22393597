Research advancement of FTIR-MSP mapping and application value in forensic science. Fourier transformation infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR-MSP) mapping technique can collect the infrared information from micro-samples and scan the tissue slides and cells. The infrared spectral information of pixels from the collected regions is recorded and infrared spectral maps are constructed by computer software. The 2D and 3D mapping images are reflected based on the distributions of absorbance bands. The biochemical compositions, molecular distribution, metabolic changes of tissues and cells are analyzed by the technique due to infrared spectroscopy being sensitive to biomolecules. The article reviews the recent research of FTIR-MSP mapping and explores the future potential value in forensic science practice.
