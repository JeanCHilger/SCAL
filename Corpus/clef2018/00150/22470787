Case report of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, review of its sonographic and magnetic resonance findings, and distinction from other gallbladder pathology. A case of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is presented with a brief review of its sonographic and magnetic resonance features. These imaging features are also compared to those seen in gallbladder adenomyomatosis and gallbladder carcinoma. While there are many overlapping imaging findings in these entities, it is important to recognize distinguishing characteristics so a correct surgical approach is chosen. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy attempted with existing xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis has an increased surgical complication rate compared to open cholecystectomy and often necessitates intraoperative conversion to open cholecystectomy.
