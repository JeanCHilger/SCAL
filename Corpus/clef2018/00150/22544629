Thymic volume in healthy, small for gestational age and growth restricted fetuses. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that a difference in thymic size exists between small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses, likely constitutional, and intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses because of placental causes.We studied 27 SGA and 36 control fetuses. SGA was defined as fetal abdominal circumference (AC) and birthweight <10th percentile for gestational age. We defined as constitutional SGA those with normal uterine and umbilical artery Doppler flow velocity waveforms (FVW), and as IUGR those with abnormal uterine FVW. IUGR were further divided based on normal or abnormal umbilical FVW. Fetal thymic volume (TV) was acquired by three-dimensional ultrasound and reconstructed with virtual organ computer-aided analysis. To correct for the influence of fetal size on thymic dimension, TV/AC ratio was calculated.Controls presented a higher TV/AC compared with each group of SGA (p < 0.001). TV/AC was significantly lower in IUGR with abnormal umbilical FVW compared with both constitutional SGA (p = 0.01) and IUGR with normal umbilical FVW (p = 0.01).The differences in TV/AC between constitutional SGA and IUGR with abnormal umbilical FVW suggest that, in the latter, a specific 'trigger' might compromise trophoblastic invasion and thymic development however, some kind of alteration of the immune system might occur in all SGA fetuses.
