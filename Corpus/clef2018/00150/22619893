Comparison of the accuracy of transvaginal sonography and hysteroscopy for the diagnosis of endometrial polyps at Rajavithi Hospital. To compare the accuracy of Transvaginal Sonography (TVS) and Hysteroscopic diagnosis (HD) for diagnosis of endometrial polyp diseases.A retrospective study was conducted and based on the medical records of endometrial polyp patients who were submitted to histological diagnosis during January 1st, 2005-December 31st, 2010 at Rajavithi Hospital. Apart from histological findings which are final, all patients had been submitted to both TVS and HD tests. The statistical analysis considered percentage,sensitivity, specificity and accuracy and compared the accuracy effectiveness of TVS and HD.The present study examined sixty endometrial polyp patients who were women whose mean age was 31-40 years. Sensitivity,specificity and accuracy for diagnosis of endometrial polyps by TVS were 60%, 33.3% and 57.6%, respectively where as those by HD were 93.3%, 33.3% and 87.9%, respectively. The present study noted that the HD showed superior accuracy compared to TVS (P < 0.001) in the endometrial polyp diagnosis.Particularly, for endometrial polyp diagnosis, hysteroscope was more sensitive and accurate than transvaginal sonography
