Preoperative management of patients with gynecologic malignancy complicated by existing venous thromboembolism. In treating gynecologic malignancies, we sometimes encounter patients in whom venous thromboembolism (VTE) has developed before surgery. Few reports exist on preoperative management of VTE. We conducted a study to determine the optimum preoperative management strategy for patients with gynecologic malignancy and existing VTE.We reviewed the clinical records of patients treated between April 2004 and March 2010 in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mie University Hospital. During this period, 654 exploratory or therapeutic laparotomies were performed for gynecologic malignancy. All patients were assessed by ultrasound for VTE before and after surgery. Twenty-five of the 654 patients (3.8%) had preoperative VTE. We reviewed the 25 cases and evaluated the management method and outcomes in terms of VTE.Most preoperative VTEs were located in a crural vein (23 cases 92%)Our preoperative management of existing VTE appears to be insufficient. Shorter or no interruption of antithrombotic therapy and/or another intervention such as inferior vena cava filter placement may be necessary in patients with preoperative VTE.
