Multiple atypical polypoid adenomyoma of the uterus. Atypical polypoid adenomyoma (APA) of the uterus is a rare neoplasm that predominantly occurs in premenopausal woman. It typically appears as a polypoid mass with a mixture of hyperintensity and hypointensity on T2-weighted MRI. We report a case of a 45-year-old woman with multiple APAs (33 and 22 mm). She underwent hysteroscopic resection. The diagnosis of APAs was histologically made by irregularly proliferating atypical endometrial glands that were admixed with a stroma. This is the first case of multiple APAs with radiological findings. It is important to recognize the possible multiplicity of APA for proper diagnosis.
