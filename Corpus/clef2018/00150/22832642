Paratesticular tumors. Description of our case series through a period of 25 years. Paratesticular tumors are masses of slow and indolent growth and in most cases of benign nature (70 %), being that  the case,  the treatment of choice is simple extirpation of the lesion and follow-up, based on observation only. On those identified as malignant  (30 %),  treatment is more complex, consisting in radical orchiectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. This work tries to describe our case  series of paratesticular tumors over the last 25 years and to make a comparative analysis with the information published in the world literature.To describe our experience with paratesticular tumors, their incidence, demographic data and treatment over a period of 25 years.Descriptive study where we analyzed clinical data of 16 patients with the diagnosis of paratesticular tumor treated at Mostoles Hospital  between 1984 and 2010 analyzing the age, type of tumor, treatment and follow-up.Mean age was 50 years (range: 16-88), benign tumors were detected in 76 % of the cases and malignant in  24%.  The tumor  more frequently  found in our series was leiomyoma (23.5%), with slight predominance of the right side (53 %) the most  frequent location was the  epididymis (50%) and mean size was 4.9 cm of diameter. The mean follow up was 34 months without complications or tumor relapse  in any patient.Despite only three-quarters of paratesticular tumors are non-malignant, it is always advisable to do intraoperative  pathological  analysis of all this masses. Having a non-malignant diagnosis, the treatment of choice is simple extirpation of the mass.  In our study the majority  of the tumors were diagnosed in adult age (average 51 years), the most frequent was leiomyoma and the most common  location was the epididymis.
