Resection of intraocular tumors (partial lamellar sclerouvectomy) in the pediatric age group. To describe the outcome of intraocular tumor resection by partial lamellar sclerouvectomy (PLSU) in the pediatric age group.Retrospective, interventional case series.We included 37 patients who underwent PLSU for intraocular tumors under age 21 years.Medical records were reviewed for clinical, operative, and histopathologic features.Globe salvage, visual acuity, surgical side effects, tumor control, and tumor-related metastasis and death.The mean patient age was 9 years (median, 10 range, 0.25-17) and there were 22 (59%) females and 15 (41%) males. The tumor involved mainly the iris (n = 27A surgically challenging procedure, PLSU can achieve control of selected intraocular tumors. Medulloepithelioma responds poorly to local resection and in most cases enucleation is required. If the globe is salvaged, visual acuity is â‰¥ 20/40 in 64% of children.The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any of the materials discussed in this article.
