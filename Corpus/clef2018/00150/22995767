Laparoscopic cystectomy for the treatment of benign ovarian cysts in children: an analysis of 21 cases. To evaluate the outcomes of treatment with minimal invasive surgery in children with benign ovarian cysts.Retrospective chart review.Maternity and children hospital.Between May 2007 and May 2011, 21 children were treated by laparoscopic method for ovarian cysts at our clinic. The age, symptoms, ultrasonographic findings, operation records and follow-up times were retrospectively evaluated.The mean age was 13.2 years. One patient presented with findings of torsion and another presented with findings of rupture both were urgently operated on. The other patients presented with intermittent abdominal pain and were operated on under elective basis. The mean cyst size was 8.4 cm (5-13 cm). One patient with necrotic ovary and salpinx due to torsion underwent salpingo-oophorectomy while the others were administered ovary-preserving cystectomy. Only 4 patients required iv paracetamol as an analgesic in the postoperative period. Two patients were discharged on the second postoperative day while the remaining 19 patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. During a mean follow-up of 14 months, no recurrence was seen in this period. Cosmetic appearance was good in all patients.The authors demonstrated that laparoscopic cystectomy was a technically feasible and safe method in the treatment of benign ovarian cysts, associated with short hospitalization, minimal analgesic requirement, and a good cosmetic appearance.
