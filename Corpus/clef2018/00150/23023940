Tumor volume and subvolume concordance between FDG-PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. To compare [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)/positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluating patients with cervical cancer. We compared tumor characteristics on FDG-PET and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to evaluate concordance of two functional imaging techniques.Twenty women with cervical cancer underwent pretreatment FDG-PET/CT and pelvic MRI. Images were rigidly fused by pelvic anatomy using coregistration software. Tumor contours on PET images were generated by autosegmentation of the region containing at least 40% of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV). DWI contours were generated by manual segmentation. Tumor volume similarity was evaluated using the [PET]/[ADC] volume proportion, Dice's coefficient, and the mean SUV isothreshold at the surface of each ADC contour. Tumor subvolume similarity was evaluated with analysis of variance (ANOVA).The [PET]/[ADC] volume proportion was 0.88 ± 0.14. Dice's coefficient between PET and ADC tumor contours was 0.76 ± 0.06. The mean SUV isothreshold at the ADC-delineated tumor surface was 34 ± 4%. Subvolumes with increased metabolic activity on FDG-PET also had more restricted diffusion on DWI (P < 0.0001, ANOVA).Concordance of functional imaging was observed between FDG-PET and DWI for cervical cancer. Tumor subvolumes with increased metabolic activity on FDG-PET also have greater cell density by DWI.
