Effects of acute exercise on the diameter of the spermatic vein, and duration of reflux in patients with varicocele. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute exercise on the diameter of the spermatic vein, and on the duration of reflux in patients with varicocele.The study included 38 patients with complaints of infertility and scrotal pain between 2009 and 2010. The diagnoses were made by physical examination and colour Doppler ultrasound, with both performed before and after exercise tests.The mean age of the participants was 25.7 Â± 4.9 years. During the first examination, the grades of the varicoceles detected were as follows: grade I, n = 7 II, n = 10This study demonstrates that acute exercise increases the spermatic vein diameter and reflux time in patients with varicoceles. These outcomes demonstrate that acute exercise may be an aggravating factor for varicocele, as seen in chronic exercise.
