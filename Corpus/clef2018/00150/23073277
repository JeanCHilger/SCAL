The cardiovascular effects of premature ovarian failure. Previous studies have shown that cardiovascular risk is increased in premature ovarian failure (POF). To determine the effects of POF on different parameters of cardiovascular health, we investigated the relationship between POF and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), endothelial function, carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and left ventricular diastolic function.We compared 23 female POF patients (mean age 37.8 ± 10.8 years) with 20 gender and age-matched healthy controls. Circulating CD133(+)/34(+) and CD34(+)/KDR(+) EPCs were determined by using flow-cytometry. Ultrasound assessment of endothelial function by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and CIMT was made. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was assessed by standard 2D and M-mode echocardiography and tissue Doppler velocities.Brachial artery FMD was significantly impaired in patients with POF compared with CG (6.3 ± 1.9% vs 10.4 ± 3.7%, p<0.05). Furthermore, circulating EPCs were lower among patients with POF compared to controls for CD133(+)/34(+) and CD34(+)/KDR(+) cells (p<0.05). There was a significant correlation between serum estradiol levels and EPC number (CD 133+/34+) (r=0.329, p<0.05). POF patients had increased CIMT compared to controls (0.67 ± 0.17 vs 0.43 ± 0.10, p<0.05). When diastolic functions were assessed, patients with POF had lower Epeak, Apeak and mitral CP and higher DT and IVRT (p<0.05, respectively).Our findings indicate that endothelial function as well as circulating EPCs, CIMT and diastolic function are significantly affected in young women with POF which may have an adverse long-term effect on cardiovascular prognosis.
