Quadruplet pregnancy complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with spontaneous ovulation. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) commonly occurs as a complication of ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins. Spontaneous OHSS is an extremely rare event, but can occur as a result of stimulation with pregnancy-derived hCG. We herein report a case of quadruplet pregnancy complicated by OHSS with spontaneous ovulation. The patient had previously undergone ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate plus FSH. After that, she conceived spontaneously and developed OHSS after three weeks of amenorrhea. The OHSS was managed by conservative treatment and improved at six weeks of gestation. However, a quadruplet pregnancy became apparent on ultrasound examination. The patient therefore elected to have an induced abortion. Besides the conception in the cycle without administration of exogenous gonadotrophins, the symptoms in this case had the same kinetics as iatrogenic OHSS caused by ovarian stimulation.
