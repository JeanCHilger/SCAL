Subcutaneous angioleiomyoma of the nasal tip. Report of a rare case. Angioleiomyoma is a rare benign tumor of smooth muscle origin. It has been reported in many anatomical sites, but it is very rare in the nose. This article describes the case of a 46-year-old woman, with a subcutaneous vascular leiomyoma of the nasal tip. She reported a small painless mass. The skin which was covering it became strongly erythematous at high temperatures, with an annoying increase of the sensitivity. There are no specific imaging techniques capable of characterizing the vascular leiomyoma, however sonography represents an excellent modality for initial evaluation of this kind of lesion. We chose excision with an open rhinoplasty approach for treatment of the lesion. Obvious and disfiguring scars do not remain with this surgical approach. The patient had immediate and complete relief of her symptoms, the aesthetic result is very good and her satisfaction is complete.
