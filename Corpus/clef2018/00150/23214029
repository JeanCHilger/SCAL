The capacities of ultrasound study and magnetic resonance imaging of small pelvic masses after hysterectomy. The purpose of the study was to develop the ultrasound study (USS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) semiotics of small pelvic masses after hysterectomy, to comprehensively use USS and MRI for the diagnosis of these masses, and to define indications for MRI. One hundred and seventy-five female patients with small pelvic masses after hysterectomy were examined. For the specification of the pattern of small pelvic masses and their differential diagnosis, USS and MRI were carried out in 175 and 72 patients, respectively. Four groups of the masses were identified of them there were tumor-like masses of the uterine appendages in 67 (38.2%) patients, ovarian tumors in 31 (17.7%), other additional masses of the small pelvis in 27 (15.4%), and a mixed variant of its masses in 50 (28.5%). The findings suggest that it is reasonable to concurrently use USS and MRI in the diagnosis of small pelvic masses following hysterectomy for the specification of their pattern and their differential diagnosis. The benefit of MRI is that information images of the basic structures of the small pelvis can be obtained in patients with a marked commissural process after hysterectomy in the absence of limitations in large mass sizes. Practical guidelines were proposed to comprehensively use USS and MRI for the diagnosis of small pelvic pathology.
