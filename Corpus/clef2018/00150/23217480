Comparison of laparoscopy and laparotomy in the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. To compare the operative findings, operative procedure and complications, postoperative complications and hospital stay in patients with ectopic pregnancy managed by laparoscopy and conventional laparotomy.A cross-sectional, observational study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal, from October 2009 to October 2010.All patients with ectopic pregnancy confirmed during surgery, were included in the study. Patients with preoperative diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy but confirmed not to be so during surgery were excluded. Data regarding the studied variables were collected by interviewing patients postoperatively, reviewing the charts and operative notes and by following-up the patients till discharge.There were a total of 32 cases of ectopic pregnancy which was 4.4% of total deliveries during the study period. Twelve patients (37.5%) were managed by laparoscopy and 20 patients (62.5%) by laparotomy. All the patients who underwent laparoscopy and 40% patients who underwent laparotomy were haemodynamically stable pre-operatively. Laparoscopy was mostly performed for tubal abortion (40%) and unruptured ectopic pregnancy (25%) whereas laparotomy mostly for ruptured ectopic pregnancy (70%). Salpingectomy was the commonest procedure in both routes of surgery. One patient in the laparoscopy group and 4 patients (20%) in laparotomy group had complications with two of the latter requiring admission in intensive care unit.Laparoscopy is feasible and safer than laparotomy in the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy.
