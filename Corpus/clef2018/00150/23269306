Advanced ultrasound training for fourth-year medical students: a novel training program at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Ultrasound training and education in medical schools is rare, and the foci of current ultrasound curricula are limited. There is a significant need for advanced ultrasound training models in medical school curricula to reduce educational burdens for physician residency programs and improve overall physician competency.The authors describe and evaluate the advanced ultrasound training program developed at The Ohio State University College of Medicine (OSU COM). The OSU COM program is a longitudinal advanced ultrasound curriculum for fourth-year medical students pursuing specialties that require frequent use of focused ultrasound. One hundred fifty student participants have completed the yearlong program to date. Participants engage in didactic lectures, journal club sessions, hands-on training, teaching and patient-modeling activities, and complete a final project. Experienced Ohio State University Medical Center faculty are recruited from specialties that frequently use ultrasound (e.g., emergency medicine, internal medicine, obstetrics-gynecology). A multimodal instructional assessment approach ensures that ultrasound training yields experience with cognitive, behavioral, and constructive learning components. The authors discuss the benefits of the program as well as its challenges and future directions.The advanced ultrasound training program at OSU COM demonstrates a novel approach to providing ultrasound training for medical students, offering a feasible model for meeting training guidelines without increasing the educational requirements for residency programs.
