Value of 3-dimensional and power Doppler sonography for diagnosis of endometrial polyps. To investigate whether the endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, and endometrial and subendometrial vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index were useful for diagnosing endometrial polyps in infertility.Transvaginal and 3-dimesional power Doppler sonography was performed to calculate the endometrial echogenicity, endometrial thickness, endometrial volume, and endometrial and subendometrial vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index, followed by hysteroscopy in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (postmenstrual days 3-7). A total of 555 patients were selected, and 4 groups were defined according to the comparison of sonographic and hysteroscopic diagnoses: group A (sonographically positive but hysteroscopically negative), group B (sonographically and hysteroscopically negative), group C (sonographically negative but hysteroscopically positive), and group D (sonographically and hysteroscopically positive).A total of 426 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. Significantly higher endometrial thickness and volume were found in groups C and D compared with groups A and B (P < .05). There were no significant differences among the 4 groups in terms of the endometrial and subendometrial vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index (P > .05). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of endometrial thickness and volume in predicting endometrial polyps were 62.7%, 69.8%, 26.9%, and 91.9% and 39.3%, 88.2%, 35.8%, and 89.7%, respectively. Combined sonographic evaluation (sonographic echogenicity, endometrial thickness, and endometrial volume) showed higher sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (65.6%, 89.0%, 50.0%, and 93.9%) compared with a single indicator.A combination of endometrial echogenicity, thickness, and volume on sonography may be better than a single indicator for predicting endometrial polyps in infertility. However, the endometrial or subendometrial vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index are not useful for prediction.
