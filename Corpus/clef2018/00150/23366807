Segmentation of small bowel tumor tissue in capsule endoscopy images by using the MAP algorithm. State of the art algorithms for diagnosis of the small bowel by using capsule endoscopic images usually rely on the processing of the whole frame, hence no segmentation is usually required. However, some specific applications such as three-dimensional reconstruction of the digestive wall, detection of small substructures such as polyps and ulcers or training of young medical staff require robust segmentation. Current state of the art algorithms for robust segmentation are mainly based on Markov Random Fields (MRF) requiring prohibitive computational resources not compatible with applications that generate a great amount of data as is the case of capsule endoscopy. However context information given by MRF is not the only way to improve robustness. Alternatives could come from a more effective use of the color information. This paper proposes a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) based approach for lesion segmentation based on pixel intensities read simultaneously in the three color channels. Usually tumor regions are characterized by higher intensity than normal regions, where the intensity can be measured as the vectorial sum of the 3 color channels. The exception occurs when the capsule is positioned perpendicularly and too close to the small bowel wall. In this case a hipper intense tissue region appears at the middle of the image, which in case of being normal tissue, will be segmented as tumor tissue. This paper also proposes a Maximum Likelihood (ML) based approach to deal with this situation. Experimental results show that tumor segmentation becomes more effective in the HSV than in the RGB color space where diagonal covariance matrices have similar effectiveness than full covariance matrices.
