Retract-ligate-unroof-biopsy: a novel approach to the diagnosis and therapy of large nonpedunculated stromal tumors (with video). We report a novel technique of retract-ligate-unroof-biopsy (RLUB) for the diagnosis and treatment of large nonpedunculated upper GI stromal tumors originating from the muscularis propria.Proof-of-concept evaluation of the RLUB technique.Pilot and feasibility study.Tertiary care center.Sixteen patients (median age 71 years) fulfilling the following inclusion criteria: poor surgical candidates with lesions that are broad based with a benign appearance, originating from the muscularis propria, size 2 cm or larger.A double-channel endoscope was used to simultaneously retract the stromal tumor while advancing an endoloop beyond the tumor for ligation. The overlying tissue was incised ("unroofed") to expose and partially enucleate the tumor, and multiple biopsy samples were obtained. After unroofing, an additional endoloop was placed below the previous one by using the loop-over-loop technique to reinforce enucleation and ischemic ablation.Successful ligation, immunohistochemistry and mitotic index yield, therapeutic ablation, adverse events.Technical success was achieved in 13 of 16 patients (81%). Immunohistology of biopsy specimens: GI stromal tumor (n = 10), leiomyoma (n = 3). Twelve of 13 patients (92%) with follow-up (median 22 weeks, range 1-82.5 weeks) had confirmed tumor ablation by endoscopy and EUS. One patient with partial resolution was re-treated, but was subsequently lost to follow-up. Delayed bleeding occurred in 2 patients that required hospitalization and blood transfusions, both successfully controlled with repeat endolooping. One patient reported transient pain.Single center, single operator, small sample size.The RLUB technique is feasible as a platform for full-thickness treatment of stromal tumors. Limitations encountered included technical challenges and delayed bleeding. Further developmental work is needed.
