Feasibility of a new two-step procedure for office hysteroscopic resection of submucous myomas: results of a pilot study. To assess the feasibility of a new two-step technique for office hysteroscopic resection of submucous myomas.Between January 2010 and December 2011, all consecutive patients of reproductive age with symptomatic lesions sonographically diagnosed as single mainly intracavitary (G1 or G2) myoma ≤4.0 cm were eligible to participate in a prospective study. They underwent a two-step hysteroscopic procedure, which included preparation of partially intramural myomas with incision of the endometrial mucosa and the pseudocapsule covering the myoma in the first step, and excision of the myoma by means of diode laser four weeks later. All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis and without anesthesia.A total of 43 women (mean age 36.7 years) were included. The two-step myomectomy technique was successfully performed in 34 (79.1%) patients. All myomas ≤18 mm were successfully enucleated as compared with 85% of 19-30 mm, and 0% of ≥30 mm (P<0.001). Also, myomas located in the anterior/posterior walls and those located in the fundus/lateral walls were enucleated in 87.9% and 50% of cases, respectively (P=0.020). Success of surgery was not influenced by the initial type of myoma.The new two-step hysteroscopic myomectomy carried out as an outpatient procedure and without anesthesia is feasible for the excision of symptomatic submucous fibroids.
