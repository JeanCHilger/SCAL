The effects of drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol + metformin on ovarian ultrasonographic markers, body fat mass index, leptin, and ghrelin. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is considered as the most common endocrinopathy among women of reproductive age. Oral contraceptives (OCs) and metformin are one of the main drug groups in the long-term treatment of PCOS. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol + metformin on ultrasonographic markers, body fat mass (BFM) index, leptin-ghrelin.This was a prospective clinical study conducted at Kocaeli University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology on 42 PCOS patients. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups [Group I (n = 22): drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol (DEE) Group II (n = 20): drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol + metformin (M)] according to Body Mass Index (BMI) findings. Patients were evaluated in terms of leptin-ghrelin, ultrasound, and body fat distribution before and 6 months after therapy. Main outcome measures were to investigate the effects of drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol + metformin on ovarian ultrasonographic markers, BFM index, leptin, and ghrelin.In patients with higher BMI, ovarian volume, numbers of follicles, stromal area, and echogenicity have been reported to be larger. In group II, a negative correlation between ghrelin and abdominal fat mass after treatment has been noted, whereas in group I a positive correlation between leptin and abdominal fat mass after treatment has been observed.Addition of metformin could have beneficial effects on abdominal fat mass. Stromal area measurement and assessment of fat mass with Dual X-ray Absorptiometry could be helpful as a quantitative way of measurement.
