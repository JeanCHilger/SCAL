Three new cases of palmar fasciitis with polyarthritis including a patient with atypical mutilating osteolysis. We managed three patients who had both palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis coexisting with gynecological malignancies. The first patient was followed up for 3 years, during which she experienced mutilating osteolysis of the fingers and very severe inflammation as assessed by osteoarticular ultrasonography. The second patient had active synovitis by ultrasonography without structural joint damage. Finally, in the last patient, magnetic resonance imaging showed synovitis and extensor tenosynovitis of the fingers. The many differential diagnoses of this paraneoplastic syndrome are discussed.
