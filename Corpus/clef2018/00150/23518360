"Habitual adnexal torsions"--recurrence after two oophoropexies in a prepubertal girl: a case report and review of the literature. Recurrent adnexal torsion rarely affects girls. Various surgical techniques for its prevention are available. We describe a case of recurrent asynchronous bilateral torsions in a prepubertal patient.An 8-year-old girl first presented with a right adnexal torsion and underwent a laparoscopic untwisting. During the following 3 years, 4 additional laparoscopies were required for treatment of left adnexal torsions. Although undergoing bilateral utero-ovarian ligament plication twice, torsion recurred. After examining the various options, we fixated the left ovary to the sidewall just below the pelvic brim.In the absence of clear evidence, treatment should be flexible and dependent on the individual case. Thorough patient education is imperative in order to prevent a delay in diagnosis and treatment of recurrent adnexal torsion.
