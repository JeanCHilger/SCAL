Comparison of transvaginal 3D sonohysterography with outpatient hysteroscopy in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. To compare transvaginal three-dimensional sonohysterography (3D SHSG) and outpatient hysteroscopy with regards to diagnostic accuracy, procedure time, and patient discomfort with a prospective randomized controlled cohort study in a teaching hospital in London. The study included a population group of 49 women with abnormal uterine bleeding from varied ethnic backgrounds, of which 44 completed the study. Subjects with pregnancies, pelvic infections, large uteruses, suspicious or diagnosed pelvic malignancies, and who did not meet the criteria for day surgery, were excluded.Patients were randomized into two groups: group 1 had hysteroscopy followed by SHSG while group 2 had SHSG followed by hysteroscopy. Diagnostic accuracy, procedure time, and patient discomfort of SHSG in comparison to hysteroscopy were studied.A total of 44 patients completed the study. The average age of the study population was 44.8 years and the mean parity was 1.8. Nulliparas represented 34.03% of the study population and the average duration of symptoms was 14.8 months.In the investigation of women with abnormal bleeding in an outpatient setting, both hysteroscopy and SHSG are comparable in the diagnosis of intracavity lesions, pain rating, and procedure time. However patient acceptability of SHSG was significantly more when compared to outpatient hysteroscopy.
