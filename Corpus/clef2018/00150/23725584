Prospective ultrasonographic follow-up of synthetic mesh in cohort of patients after vaginal repair of cystocele. We sought to validate a sequence of ultrasonographic mesh measurements to determine the relevant time points in the postoperative monitoring of mesh size.Mesh was measured preoperatively ex vivo, prior to insertion, in 25 patients scheduled to undergo vaginal repair of cystocele involving insertion of a Ugytex™ transobturating polypropylene mesh. A 2D/3D perineal ultrasound scan was performed at the end of the surgical procedure (D0), then on third day after surgery (D3) and 6 weeks (W6) after the operation. Medio-sagittal view was used to measure mesh total length and the sagittal arc (length between the most distant points of the mesh).Time-course changes in sagittal arc were marked by a 8% increase on D3 (with respect to D0) and a 20% decrease at W6 (with respect to D3). Mesh total length at W6 on average corresponded to 74% (±20) of mesh total length measured on D3.This study showed the changes in the mesh ultrasonographic measurements following vaginal placement by vaginal route. The D3 ultrasound scan should appear to be suitable as a reference for subsequent ultrasonographic monitoring.
