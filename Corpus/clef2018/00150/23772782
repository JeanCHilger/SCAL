Turner syndrome patients' ultrasound profile. Evaluate the uterus and ovary by ultrasonography, considering the genotype, pubertal development and hormonal levels.Cross-sectional study of 53 (7-53 years old) patients with Turner syndrome considering pubertal development by Tanner stage, puberty induced or not and the ultrasound examination.The patients were 10 prepubertal and 43 with pubertal signs. Uterus was found adequate in 12 (57.1%) patients and all had spontaneous puberty. Hypoplasic uterus was found in all prepubertal patients and in 28 (52.8%) patients pubescent. The ovaries were visualized bilaterally in 32 (60%) patients and unilaterally in 15 (27.7%). Ovaries were appropriate bilaterally in eight (15.1%). In pubertal patients, the average volume being significantly higher in those with spontaneous puberty (p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). We found no significant difference in uterine volume, when considered estrogen route and karyotype.The ultrasonographic pattern in patients with spontaneous puberty without secondary failure was appropriate. The karyotype and the route estrogen therapy were not related to the standard of ultrasound study of the uterus and ovary.
