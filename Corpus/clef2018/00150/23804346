First experience using 4-dimensional hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue for assessing fallopian tube patency. This study was conducted to describe our first experience using transvaginal 4-dimensional (4D) hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography with SonoVue (Bracco International BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) for diagnosis of fallopian tube patency. The study was prospective and conducted in a university hospital setting. The sonographic procedures included 2-dimensional transvaginal sonography for evaluating uterine and ovarian mobility, observing intubation, and determining the initial plane and 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography for observing periovarian and pelvic diffusion. Ninety-six outpatients visiting infertility clinics underwent 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography. All patients finished the examination successfully. A total of 192 fallopian tubes were assessed, of which 95 (49.5%) were classified as type A (the tube was patent, and the contrast agent flowed smoothly through it), 72 (37.5%) as type B (the tube was patent, but the contrast agent did not flow smoothly inside it), and 25 (13.0%) as type C (blocked). Sixteen patients underwent laparoscopy or laparoscopy combined with hysteroscopy 28 tubes (87.5%) were concordant with laparoscopy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and Youden index for 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography versus laparoscopy were 81.8%, 90.5%, 81.8%, 90.5%, and 0.72 respectively. In total, 92.7% of patients did not require a hospital stay after 4D hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography, and none need resuscitation. The others stayed in the hospital for clinical observation because of a severe vasovagal reaction or severe pain but received only bed rest without any medical treatment. Forty patients (41.7%) felt slight pain
