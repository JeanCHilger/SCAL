Multimodality 3-dimensional volumetric ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology with an emphasis in HDlive technique. HDlive (high-definition live or real-time US), a new ultrasound software, combines a movable virtual adjustable light source in a software that calculates the proportion of light reflecting through surface structures, depending on light direction. The light source can be manually positioned to illuminate the desired area of interest. The ultrasound technician can control light intensity to create shadows that enhance image quality. HDlive is an innovation that will render even more realistic images of fetal anatomy and of gynecologic lesions. The full potential of this new technology is yet to be determined and deserves scientific evaluation.
