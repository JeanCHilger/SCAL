Influence of functional status of ovaries on results of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. The controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is an integral part of infertility treatment. Its main objective is to obtain oocytes with a highest developmental potential. The stimulation protocols involving the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and gonadotropins are considered as the most efficient. Despite many years of use, some aspects of controlled ovarian stimulation has not yet been clarified, especially the role of the functional status of ovaries before hormonal stimulation. The aim of study was to assess the influence of the functional status of ovaries on the results of the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.The retrospective study included female patients suffering from infertility The patients were divided into two groups depending on ultrasonographic appearance of ovaries before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. The patients with small antral follicles < 6 mm in diameter were selected into group I. The patients with five or more antral follicles > or = 8 mm in diameter in each ovary were included into group II. The patients from both groups underwent similar treatment process. The major area of interest was the number, type and quality of oocytes obtained from patients from both groups after ovarian puncture.A retrospective study was conducted on 635 infertile patients (group I 382, group II 253). Altogether, 4055 oocytes were obtained in the group I and 2555 oocytes in the group II. The mean number of MII oocytes in group I was 9,2 and 8,7 in group II p < 0.05. There were significantly more MI oocytes in group I than II. The mean numbers of immature oocytes were comparable between groups. The athretic and dysmorphic oocytes were more prevalent in group II.The results of the present study indicates that the functional status of ovaries before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation plays pivotal role for the treatment outcome.
