Recurrent spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation in a virgin girl. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) develops due to the release of vasoactive mediators induced by excessively luteinized and enlarged ovaries. Most OHSS cases are iatrogenic subsequent to ovulation induction. We report the first case of recurrent OHSS developed during normal menstral cycle in a virgin girl, diagnosed with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging.
