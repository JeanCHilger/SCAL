Factors that predict poor clinical course among patients hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease. The aim of this study was to identify factors that can predict clinical course among patients hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).Ninety-three patients who needed hospitalization with a diagnosis of PID were retrospectively studied. Patients who were discharged within 7 days by conservative treatment were defined as favorable course cases (n = 44). Patients who needed more than 7 days of hospitalization and/or surgery were defined as poor course cases (n = 49). Twenty variables were evaluated by univariate and logistic regression analysis: age, history of pregnancy/delivery, gynecological open/laparoscopic surgery, PID, oral contraceptives/intrauterine device use and intrauterine operation before onset, body temperature, signs of peritoneal irritation, vomiting/diarrhea, abnormal vaginal discharge, endometriosis/fibroid/adenomyosis/any cystic lesion detected by ultrasonography, white blood cell counts/C-reactive protein (CRP) levels . The cut-off value was calculated by receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis.Factors associated with poor clinical course were advanced age (P < 0.01), history of gynecological open surgery (P < 0.05), any cystic lesion detected by ultrasonography (P < 0.05) and high CRP levels (P < 0.05). High CRP levels and intrauterine operation before onset were independently associated with poor clinical course. The cut-off value for CRP was 4.4 mg/dL.This study identified variables that can predict poor clinical course of PID. These results can assist gynecologists with identifying patients at risk and optimizing the choice of management.
