Congenital urethral polyps in the pediatric population. Congenital urethral polyps are a rare entity. Most commonly, they present as benign posterior urethral growths in the pediatric male patient. However, reports of urethral polyps in female patients or even those with an anterior urethral location can also be found in the literature. Patients can present with a spectrum of symptoms including dysuria, hematuria, and obstructive type urinary complaints. Diagnosis in these cases includes a combination of medical imaging (e.g. ultrasound, fluoroscopic, CT or MRI), direct endoscopic visualization, and final surgical pathology. Treatment involves surgical removal either via an endoscopic or open approach.
