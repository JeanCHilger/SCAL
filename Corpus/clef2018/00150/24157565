Usefulness of clinical, ultrasonographic, hysteroscopic, and immunohistochemical parameters in differentiating endometrial polyps from endometrial cancer. To evaluate the usefulness of clinical, ultrasonographic, hysteroscopic, and immunohistochemical parameters in differentiating endometrial polyps from endometrial cancer.Cross-sectional study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Tertiary public hospital, university teaching center.Eighty-two women who underwent hysteroscopic polypectomy and 20 women who underwent surgery to treat endometrial cancer.Analysis of medical records and immunohistochemical assessment of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and endothelial markers CD34 and CD105.Among women with endometrial cancer and endometrial polyps, respectively, mean age was 63 and 57 years (p = .01), 89% and 67% were postmenopausal (p < .05), and 85% and 30.5% had postmenopausal bleeding (p < .01). No sonographic parameter enabled differentiation of endometrial polyp from cancer. Of patients with endometrial cancer, 72% exhibited signs suggestive of hyperplasia, and endometrial polyps were diagnosed during hysteroscopy. Estrogen receptors (≥ 2 vs ≥ 1 p < .001) and progesterone receptors (≥ 3 vs ≥ 2Ultrasonographic parameters and endothelial markers did not enable differentiation of polyps from endometrial neoplasia. Postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial hypervascularization along with vascular atypia at diagnostic hysteroscopy showed a greater association with endometrial cancer.
