Surgical removal of an intravenous leiomyoma with intracardiac extension and pulmonary benign metastases. Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) with right intracardiac extension or pulmonary benign metastases (PBM) is rare. We report a case of 51 year-old woman, who underwent successful extensive double stage surgical removal of the intracardiac IVL extension associated with a pulmonary limited resection where the cystic bullae and PBM were found, and a month later gynaecological operation. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of such a combination.
