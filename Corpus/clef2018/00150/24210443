Three-dimensional volumetric sonography in gynecology: an overview of clinical applications. Three-dimensional (3D) sonography can significantly improve on the diagnostic ability of two-dimensional sonography of the pelvic organs. 3D sonography has become a problem-solving technique in the evaluation of a variety of gynecologic disorders involving the uterus, adnexa, and pelvic floor. It allows an accurate depiction of the uterine cavity and outline of the uterus in the coronal plane. 3D sonography is less expensive than other modalities, is convenient, and does not have the risk of radiation or potential nephrotoxicity from contrast that other imaging modalities have. It is a cost-effective tool to assess the pelvic organs.
