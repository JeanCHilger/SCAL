Sonography of female genital hernias presenting as labia majora masses. Inguinal herniation of the ovary or uterus presenting as a labia majora mass is a rare congenital condition that may be complicated by strangulation, torsion, and infertility. A labial mass in a prepubertal female patient can represent an inguinal hernia, a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, a congenital labial cyst, leiomyoma, an abscess, lipoma, or lymphangioma. With a large differential diagnosis and an often limited physical examination, imaging plays an importance diagnostic role. We present 3 cases in which a labial mass contained an ovary alone and both ovaries and the uterus. We demonstrate sonographic findings and discuss the utility of sonography in the diagnosis of genital hernias and in detecting potential complications.
