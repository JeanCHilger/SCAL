Uterine perforation during 3-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy in patients with cervical cancer: Baskent University experience. This study aimed to determine the incidence and characteristics of uterine perforation at our department using 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT)-based brachytherapy (BRT). The characteristics of the patients presenting with perforation and impact of the perforation on the treatment course were also analyzed.The clinical and radiologic data of 200 patients with biopsy-proven cervical cancer treated using CT-based BRT were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had undergone tandem-based intracavitary BRT, and 67 patients had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before BRT.Of the 200 patients, 17 (8.5%) had uterine perforation. Of the 626 applications with CT images, 30 (4.8%) resulted in uterine perforation. The median age of patients with perforation was higher (68 years range, 44-89 years) than that of the patients without perforation (59 yearsOlder age, larger tumors, a retroverted uterus, and a stenotic cervical os were all predisposing factors for uterine perforation during BRT. Preoperative MRI is a feasible and safe method to decrease the risks of uterine perforation and could be used preoperatively in centers where intraoperative ultrasonography is not used in routine practice.
