The impact of adnexal torsion on antral follicle count when compared with contralateral ovary. In women with adnexal torsion, there is an absence of data whether ovarian reserve is affected when treated by detorsion and conservative surgery. We aimed to evaluate ovarian reserve by counting the antral follicles and estimating the ovarian volume in the operated side compared with the contralateral ovary.A case-control study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).In vitro fertilization center, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine and Etlik Zubeyde Hanim Women's Health and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.Patients who underwent conservative surgery because of adnexal torsion between January 2008 and August 2012 were retrospectively investigated from patient files and computer-based data. Eighteen patients were eligible for the study protocol and further evaluated for their ovarian reserve with ultrasonography.Comparing ovarian reserve in the torsioned and contralateral sides with ultrasonography by physicians who were blind to the previously operated side.The mean age was 28.3 ± 5.8 years. The mean antral follicle count on the operated and contralateral ovaries were 12.3 ± 8.4 and 11.3 ± 7.4, respectively (p = .23). The respective figure for ovarian volume was 7.6 ± 4.2 and 9.1 ± 5.3 mL (p = .063). Among 3 patients seeking to become pregnant, 1 of them conceived spontaneously and one achieved pregnancy with clomiphene citrate use.The finding of the current study suggests that ovarian reserve reflected by the antral follicle count is not compromised in patients treated with detorsion of the twisted adnexa.
