Emergency point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of hematocolpometra and imperforate hymen in the pediatric emergency department. A 12-year-old girl presented to the pediatric emergency department with a history of difficulty voiding and was found to have a firm, tender suprapubic mass on examination. Transabdominal emergency point-of-care ultrasound was used at the bedside to diagnose hematocolpometra due to an imperforate hymen. The diagnosis was confirmed by a comprehensive abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in the radiology suite. The patient was discharged on oral contraceptive medication and scheduled for an outpatient surgical hymenectomy following consultation with the gynecology service.
