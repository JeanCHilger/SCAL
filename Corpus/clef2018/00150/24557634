Clinical significance of 3D ultrasound compared to MRI in uterine malformations. Congenital uterine anomalies often remain asymptomatic until they cause problems, for example during pregnancy. We studied the diagnostic aspects of two- and three-dimensional ultrasound and MRI.63 women referred for suspected uterine anomalies were studied: In the first group (until July 2008) with 2 D-US and MRI, in the second group (from August 2008) additionally with 3 D-US these women also had diagnostic or therapeutic operative confirmation. In the third group, only 3D-US was used.In all women 3D-US was possible and successful. The most common anomaly was a subseptate uterus, while a septate uterus was less frequent, and uterus bicornis (unicollis) and uterus didelphys (bicornis bicollis) were rare. The women in the first two groups all underwent at least diagnostic hysteroscopy, and some (subseptate or septate uterus) underwent operative hysteroscopy. After preoperative volume imaging, laparoscopies were required less often. 3D-US diagnoses as judged by intraoperative findings were correct in 100 % of cases, while the MRI diagnoses in the same group were correct in only 7/13 cases.Since the introduction of volume imaging (MRI, later 3 D-US), laparoscopy during hysteroscopic septum resection was not necessary in the majority of cases. 3D-US brings the diagnostics of uterine anomalies back into the hands of the gynecologist and can provide the gynecological surgeon with a higher subjective degree of certainty during operative hysteroscopy.
