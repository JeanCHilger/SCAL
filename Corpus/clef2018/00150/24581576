Diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional sonohysterography compared with office hysteroscopy and its interrater/intrarater agreement in uterine cavity assessment after hysteroscopic metroplasty. To compare the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional sonohysterography (3D-SIS) and office hysteroscopy in uterine cavity assessment after hysteroscopic metroplasty (HM) and determine the interrater/intrarater agreement for 3D-SIS.Prospective observational study.University hospital, private hospital, and clinic.One hundred forty-one women undergoing HM for septate uterus with a history of miscarriage and/or infertility.3D-SIS and office hysteroscopy at 6-8 weeks after HM.Shape of the uterine cavity, length of the fundal notch (≥1 or <1 cm), and the presence of intrauterine adhesions were assessed, and the interrater/intrarater agreement of 3D-SIS was evaluated in 30 randomly selected patients.Uterine abnormalities were detected with the use of hysteroscopy in 18 (12.8%) of 141 women. 3D-SIS was highly accurate (97.2%), sensitive (97%), and specific (100%), with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 85%. The diagnostic values of hysteroscopy and 3D-SIS were not significantly different (McNemar test). 3D-SIS showed substantial interrater/intrarater agreement regarding overall uterine cavity evaluation (κ = 0.79 and 0.78, respectively).3D-SIS demonstrated substantial interrater/intrarater agreement for the postoperative evaluation of the uterine cavity, being as diagnostically accurate as hysteroscopy. The use of second-look hysteroscopy may be limited to cases that require reoperation.
