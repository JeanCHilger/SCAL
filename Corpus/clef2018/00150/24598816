Diagnostic and clinical value of 3D gel installation sonohysterography in addition to 2D gel installation sonohysterography in the assessment of intrauterine abnormalities. To study the diagnostic value of three-dimensional gel instillation sonography (3D GIS) in addition to two-dimensional (2D) GIS in the assessment of intrauterine abnormalities. Secondly, the clinical value of 3D GIS in the planning for hysteroscopic procedures was evaluated.A prospective cohort study was performed from 2008 till 2010. All women with a suspected intrauterine abnormality on 2D GIS suitable for hysteroscopic resection or with recurrent postmenstrual bleeding were planned for a hysteroscopic procedure. Diagnostic accuracy tests were calculated for the detection of fibroids and polyps with both histology and hysteroscopy as the reference standard. For the assessment of type and size of fibroids hysteroscopy was used as the reference standard. We compared the planning for type of hysteroscopy based on 2D GIS findings with the combined 2D-3D GIS findings.In total 110 patients were analysed. In comparison to histology, addition of 3D GIS did not change sensitivity or specificity substantially in the discrimination between fibroids and polyps. In comparison to hysteroscopy, sensitivity increased for detecting fibroids and polyps, without major interference with the specificity. Despite an improved accuracy after the addition of 3D GIS, the planning for hysteroscopic procedures did not improve substantially.In daily practice, the addition of 3D GIS to 2D GIS improved the accuracy for the detection of polyps and fibroids compared to hysteroscopy, but only marginally improved the planning of hysteroscopic procedures, and therefore the clinical relevance seems to be limited.
