Polycystic ovarian syndrome and congenital uterine anomalies: the hidden common player. To study the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and congenital uterine (MÃ¼llerian) anomalies in infertile patients. The ultimate aim was to check for a common factor linking both reproductive health problems.A prospective observational study.Tertiary referral infertility center.3,900 infertile patients were included. The diagnoses of PCOS and uterine anomalies were made. Patients with or without PCOS were correlated to the presence or absence of uterine anomalies and statistically assessed.Study of the prevalence of PCOS/uterine anomalies in the studied population and the ratio of coexistence.The prevalence of PCOS in the studied cohort was 10.48 %. 409 (10.48 %) patients were confirmed to have PCOS, while 204 (5.23 %) were with confirmed uterine anomalies. Of the patients with confirmed PCOS, almost one-third (n = 149, 31.4 %) had uterine anomalies, while in patients with confirmed uterine anomalies, almost three-fourths (n = 149, 73 %) had PCOS.There is evident association between PCOS and uterine anomalies in infertile patients. We suggest a genetic rather than a developmental defect to be a possible common player for the development of both PCOS and uterine anomalies.
