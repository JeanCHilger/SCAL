Comparison between two protocols for thawed embryo transfer: natural cycle versus exogenous hormone replacement. There are two most popular protocols for Frozen Embryo Transfer: the natural and the E2&P4 replacement cycles. There is still a controversy whether one is superior over the other.To compare the outcome in patient groups undergoing FET following these protocols.About 1235 FET cycles were retrospectively analyzed during a period of 12 years. In 798 cycles (group A), the natural cycle protocol was used, and in 437 cycles (group B), the exogenous E2&P4 administration protocol was used.The average patient age was 32.11 ± 0.27 years in group A and 32.94 ± 0.19 years in group B (p<0.05). The endometrial thickness was 9.54 ± 0.11 mm and 8.95 ± 0.13 mm in groups A and B, respectively (p<0.001). The peak serum E2 level was 162.51 ± 8.97 pg/mL and 250.78 ± 33.67 pg/mL in groups A and B, respectively (p<0.001). The implantation, clinical pregnancy, and ongoing pregnancy rates in groups A and B were 6.47%, 12.91%, and 10.4% versus 4.26%, 8.47%, and 5.95%, respectively (p<0.05).Natural endometrial preparation yields better outcome in compare with exogenous E2&P4 in FET cycles with higher endometrial thickness, implantation, and clinical pregnancy rates.
