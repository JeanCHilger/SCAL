Menometrorrhagia. Menometrorrhagia is a frequent cause of medical consulting. After exclusion of pregnancy, main aetiologies are the uterine (polyp, myoma, adenomyosis, cancer) or adnexial abnormality (ovarian cyst or cancer), the disorders of hemostasis (Willebrand...), the dysfunctional uterine bleeding. A clinical examination is necessary to provide an accurate diagnosis and find complications such as anaemia. Pelvic ultrasound examination and endometrial biopsy are required to eliminate endometrial cancer. The treatment of menometrorrhagia consists of symptomatic treatment (tranexamic acid, levonorgestrel intrauterine device) and specific treatment of its cause (hysteroscopic resection of myom, polyp, endometrectomy, hysterectomy).
