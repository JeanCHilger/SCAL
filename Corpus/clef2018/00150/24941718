The correlation between ultrasonography and histopathology in the management of gall bladder polyps. The diagnosis of gall bladder polyps has increased greatly due to widespread implementation of abdominal ultrasound.Between February 2005 and February 2010 a total of 39 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed for suspected gall bladder polyps. We retrospectively analysed these patients pre-operative ultrasound and histopathology report.The study comprised 10 male and 29 female symptomatic patients with a mean age of 51.4 years. Histopathology demonstrated seven true polyps and 23 pseudopolyps. There were no cases of malignant specimens and nine cases of chronic cholecystitis. The positive predictive value (PPV) of ultrasonography for gall bladder polyps was 0.77 and the PPV for true polyps 0.18.PPV for the identification of true gallbladder polyps using ultrasound remains very low at 0.18. We suggest that more advanced imaging modalities are required to improve this figure and enhance patient management.
