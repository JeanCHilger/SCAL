Anti-Mullerian Hormone: an indicator for the severity of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Features of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) including sonographic aspects, androgens, LH and LH/FSH ratio as well as Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) were evaluated according to their diagnostic potency in detecting different degrees of PCOS severity.80 women with PCOS diagnosed according to the Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group 2003 and 48 controls were enrolled between 2011 and 2013. PCOS patients fulfilling all Rotterdam criteria were defined as having severe PCOS (n = 59), while patients showing oligo-/amenorrhoea and polycystic ovaries but without hyperandrogenemia were defined as having mild PCOS (n = 21). All patients were treated at the University Hospital of Essen, Germany.The strongest group difference between controls and severe PCOS patients was observed for AMH showing an age-adjusted odds ratio of 2.56 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.00-3.27 p < 0.0001]. Age-adjusted receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95 % CI: 0.80-0.95) for AMH and 0.94 (95 % CI 0.88-0.98) for antral follicle count did not differ significantly in their ability to discriminate between severe PCOS patients and controls. AMH showed higher AUC estimates than androgens, ovarian volume, LH and LH/FSH ratio and an AUC of 0.80 (95 % CI: 0.65-0.91) for detecting mild PCOS.To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the diagnostic potency of AMH, sonographic aspects, androgens, and LH/FSH ratio according to different PCOS subgroups while accounting for the age-dependency of AMH. In cases where vaginal scans are not feasible or in patients without hyperandrogenemia AMH may be used as a surrogate parameter in PCOS diagnosis, superior to androgens and gonadotropins.
