Primary omental pregnancy with secondary implantation into posterior cul-de-sac: laparoscopic treatment using hemostatic matrix. Primary omental pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy. Only a few reported cases have been treated using laparoscopy. Hemostasis after trophoblast removal can be challenging. A 25-year-old primigravida in week 8 of pregnancy was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of missed abortion. An ultrasound scan showed an empty uterine cavity and a gestational sac with a 15-mm embryo dorsal to the uterus, indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. The preoperative serum concentration of human chorionic gonadotropin was 33 600 U/mL. Laparoscopy was performed, which revealed an omental pregnancy invading the peritoneum of the Douglas pouch. After laparoscopic removal of the ectopic pregnancy with partial omentectomy, diffuse bleeding from the crater between both sacrouterine ligaments was treated using the gelatin-thrombin matrix (FloSeal). The final histologic analysis confirmed the omentum as the primary site of the ectopic pregnancy (multiple chorionic villi and decidua within the omental fat). The postoperative period was uneventful. This case expands the classic Studdiford criteria. Secondary peritoneal ectopic pregnancy implantation can occur not only after tubal rupture or expulsion of tubal ectopic pregnancy but also after primary implantation at any other ectopic site. The laparoscopic approach to abdominal pregnancy is safe and feasible if there is sufficient intraoperative hemostasis. The hemostatic matrix facilitates quick and effective control of bleeding.
