Unusual case of OHVIRA syndrome with a single uterus, unrecognized before labor and followed by an intrapartal rupture of obstructed hemivagina. The acronym for obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) was created to describe patients with an obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly and enables inclusion of other uterine anomalies except uterus didelphys. The main goal of this article is to present a rare case of OHVIRA syndrome with intrapartal rupture of obstructed hemivagina.We present an unusual case of OHVIRA syndrome with single uterus, uterine septum (previously resected by hysteroscopy) and renal agenesis, unrecognized before labor and followed by an intrapartal rupture of obstructed hemivagina.Various symptoms, included in OHVIRA acronym, are a result of different morphologic variants included in this syndrome. Most likely, in our case, the absence of communication between the cervical canal/patent vagina and the obstructed hemivagina prevented formation of mucocolpos or hematocolpos. This rare clinical variant made our MRI diagnosis of obstructed hemivagina, as well of the entire OHVIRA syndrome, ineffective. We did not find OHVIRA cases in the literature with a single septate uterus and single cervix, associated with obstructed hemivagina diagnosed during and after labor and presented with intrapartal rupture of hemivagina. Because of lack of guidelines, the final decision about management of the labor in such rare cases of OHVIRA syndrome is difficult.
