Results of a prospective thyroid ultrasound screening program in adenomatous polyposis patients. Patients with adenomatous polyposis may be at increased risk for developing thyroid cancer (TC). However, screening guidelines for TC in these patients are not well established.Patients with a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis, and gene mutation-negative adenomatous polyposis enrolled in our Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Family Registry were eligible for a screening thyroid ultrasound (US). Findings were reviewed by the study endocrinologist and intervention and/or follow-up determined.Fifty patients underwent screening thyroid US. Thirty-four (68%) patients had abnormal findings on US, including 27 (79%) with thyroid nodules. In 7 patients, US-detected thyroid nodules met established criteria for fine-needle aspiration. Of the 6 patients who underwent fine-needle aspiration, 2 (4%) were diagnosed with papillary TC. Both of these patients were female.A large proportion of adenomatous polyposis patients will have abnormal results on thyroid US, including suspicious-appearing thyroid nodules that when biopsied are malignant. Female patients have an apparently greater risk of developing TC. Polyposis patients, especially women, should be offered participation in a thyroid US screening program.
