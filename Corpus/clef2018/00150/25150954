Preoperative treatment with letrozole in patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy of large uterine myomas: a prospective non-randomized study. To assess the efficacy of preoperative treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in premenopausal women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy of large uterine myomas.Prospective non-randomized assessor-blind comparative trial.This study included 80 patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy of large uterine myomas (≥8cm). Forty patients were treated with a combination of oral letrozole (2.5mg/day) and norethindrone acetate (2.5mg/day) continuously in the three months prior to surgery (group A) and 40 patients received no treatment before surgery (group B). The total operative time (mean±SD, range) was significantly lower in group A (121.5±19.9min 89-181min) than in group B (134.4±16.8minThe total operative time, the time required to close the hysterotomies and the intraoperative blood loss significantly decrease after preoperative treatment with letrozole. Future randomized studies should compare the efficacy of preoperative administration of AIs and GnRHa prior to laparoscopic myomectomy.
