Radiological findings in duodenal tuberculosis: a 15-year experience. To evaluate the radiological findings of duodenal tuberculosis with particular emphasis on the barium findings.A retrospective analysis of 805 cases of gastrointestinal tuberculosis from January 1997 to December 2011 over a period of 15 years was conducted. Thirty two cases (4%) of duodenal tuberculosis were found. The diagnosis of duodenal tuberculosis was based on histopathology following surgery or endoscopic biopsy from the duodenum, ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology/biopsy of lymph nodes or response to anti-tubercular treatment. The patients' clinical presentation was broadly classified into obstructive features and dyspeptic features. Single and/ or double contrast upper gastrointestinal barium studies were reviewed in each case for the segment involved, presence and length of strictures, ulcerations, polypoidal masses, extrinsic impression and complications (viz. perforations and fistulae).The study included 20 males and 12 females with age range of 7-70 years (mean age 26.6 years) Twenty-seven (84.3%) patients presented with obstructive symptoms and five (15.6%) had predominantly dyspeptic symptoms. The radiological findings in patients with obstructive symptoms were duodenal strictures (n = 19), extrinsic compression (n = 10) and polypoidal intraluminal mass with luminal narrowing (n = 3). Among the patients presenting with dyspeptic symptoms, the most common findings was duodenal ulcerations (n = 3). Perforation was seen in 4 cases and fistulisation in 2 cases. A multiplicity of findings was noted in 7 patients.Barium studies though not specific for duodenal tuberculosis helped to delineate the mucosal lesions and define the nature, level, and extent of obstruction in these patients.
