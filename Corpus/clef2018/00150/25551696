Adnexal masses in pregnancy. With the advent of routine obstetrical ultrasound, the diagnosis of an adnexal mass in pregnancy has become increasingly common. Although the reported incidence and expected clinical course varies based on the gestational age at the time of diagnosis and the criteria used to define an adnexal mass, the majority of adnexal masses diagnosed in pregnancy are benign and are likely to resolve without complication or intervention. This review will discuss the epidemiology of adnexal masses in pregnancy, diagnostic tools, potential complications, and management options during pregnancy.
