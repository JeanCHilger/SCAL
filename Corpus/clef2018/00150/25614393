Usefulness of diagnostic indices comprising clinical, sonographic, and biomarker data for discriminating benign from malignant ovarian masses. The objective of this study was to review the accuracy of indices combining several diagnostic variables, in comparison to other models, sonography alone, and biomarker assays, for predicting benign or malignant ovarian lesions. Different single modalities were reviewed. The most useful complex models were International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) sonographic logistic regression model 2 (area under the curve, 0.949), risk of malignancy index-cancer antigen 125-human epididymis protein 4 (0.950), risk of malignancy algorithm (0.953), pelvic mass score (0.960), non-IOTA logistic regression model (0.970), and histoscanning score logistic regression model (0.970). None of the indices was superior to an expert subjective sonographic assessment (0.968). For women with adnexal tumors, indices with high accuracy are available that are applicable in clinical practice and comparable to an expert subjective sonographic assessment for discriminating benign from malignant masses.
