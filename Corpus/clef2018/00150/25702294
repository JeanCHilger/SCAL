Sigmoidal polyp with adenocarcinoma discovered by transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasonographic virtual colonoscopy. Adenocarcinoma of the colon represents the third most frequent cause of death from cancer, being surpassed only by lung and stomach cancer. Early screening and diagnosis of polyps are important for a good prognosis. Based on a clinical case, a novel approach is presented for screening of sigmoidal polyps and neoplasia using transvaginal 2D, 3D mode in women. This novel and simple technique can be used to visualize the sigmoid diverticula during routine gynecological examination via 3D transvaginal ultrasound probe.
