Sonographic characteristics of the uterus in asymptomatic women after second-trimester medical termination of pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sonographic characteristics of the uterus after apparently uncomplicated second-trimester medical termination of pregnancy and to follow the evolution of these findings until the return of menstruation.Twenty-three women who requested termination of pregnancy at gestational ages between 14 and 20 weeks were recruited. Uterine characteristics were measured by 2- and 3-dimensional transvaginal with or without transabdominal sonography. The uterine anteroposterior diameter, length, and width, endometrial thickness, presence of an endometrial mass, intrauterine vascularity, and endometrial volume were measured within 24 hours, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after termination, and during the postmenstrual phase.The mean uterine anteroposterior diameter, uterine length, uterine width, endometrial thickness, and endometrial volume ± SD deceased gradually from 66.1 ± 9.7 to 40.9 ± 5.3 mm, 131.4 ± 14.7 to 81.3 ± 13.8 mm, 84.6 ± 10.3 to 54.2 ± 7.6 mm, 25.6 ± 8.1 to 4.5 ± 2.6 mm, and 39.4 ± 22.6 to 2.5 ± 2.1 mL, respectively, from within 24 hours after termination to the postmenstrual phase. Endometrial masses were identified in 8 women (34.8%) within 4 weeks after termination, which could persist for up to 8 weeks. However, all endometrial masses resolved after menstruation. Minimal and moderate endometrial vascularity was detectable in up to 21.7% after termination none was detectable in any women after menstruation.This study provides information on the normal sonographic parameters of the uterus after second-trimester medical termination of pregnancy, which has been lacking in the literature. Also, our findings suggest that all endometrial masses regress with time therefore, asymptomatic women with an incidental finding of an endometrial mass can be followed without the need for an immediate intervention.
