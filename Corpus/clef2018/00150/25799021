Comparison of contrast-enhanced isotropic 3D-GRE-T1WI sequence versus conventional non-isotropic sequence on preoperative staging of cervical cancer. To compare contrast-enhanced isotropic 3D-GRE-T1WI sequence vs. conventional non-isotropic sequence in terms of image quality, estimated signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR), relative tumor contrast and performance of cervical cancer staging.This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. Seventy-one patients (47 Â± 9.4 years), with pathologically-confirmed cervical cancer underwent axial contrast-enhanced 1 mm3 isotropic 3D-GRE-T1WI sequence (herein referred to Isotropy), and 3-mm-thick non-isotropic sagittal and coronal sequences. Image quality score, eSNR and relative contrast between tumor to myometrium, gluteal muscle, and fat respectively, were compared between 3-mm-thick reconstructed images from Isotropy and directly scanned non-isotropic images by paired t-test. Difference in tumor staging obtained from Isotropy and combined Three-planes including reconstructed axial images, directly scanned sagittal and coronal sequence were compared by McNemar test.Both sequences showed similar image quality. Reconstructed images demonstrated higher eSNR, equal or lower relative tumor contrast compared with non-isotropic images. Compared with performing diagnosis on Three-planes, both reviewers showed higher accuracy when diagnosing vaginal invasion on Isotropy (p = 0.039 and 0.003, respectively).Compared with non-isotropic sequence, 3.0T MR isotropic 3D-GRE-T1WI sequence exhibited better eSNR, providing more reliable clinical information for preoperative staging of cervical cancer.
