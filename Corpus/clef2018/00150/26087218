Agressive small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type, surgery and oncological treatment: case report. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary (SCCOHT) is a rare tumor typically affecting young women. It is a highly malignant tumor accompanied with poor prognosis, early relapse and low survival rates. The most significant prognostic factor is stage of the disease. Due to above mentioned factors there are no guidelines for therapy of this rare tumor. We present a case of 22-years-old patient initially treated with antibiotics under diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. Due to persistent mass at left adnexa, she was indicated for diagnostic laparoscopy, converted to laparotomy and left adnexectomy with frozen section revealing unspecified malignant tumor of left ovary. A conservative operation was performed and, after diagnosis of SCCOHT was established, the patient was indicated for adjuvant chemotherapy.
