Application of Combined Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Transvaginal Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound in the Diagnosis of Endometrial Carcinoma. Objective. The goal of this study was to explore the clinical value of combining two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal contrast-enhanced ultrasounds (CEUS) in diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Methods. In this prospective diagnostic study, transvaginal 2D and 3D CEUS were performed on 68 patients with suspected EC, and the results of the obtained 2D-CEUS and 3D-CEUS images were compared with the gold standard for statistical analysis. Results. 2D-CEUS benign endometrial lesions showed the normal uterine perfusion phase while EC cases showed early arrival and early washout of the contrast agent and nonuniform enhancement. The 3D-CEUS images differed in central blood vessel manifestation, blood vessel shape, and vascular pattern between benign and malignant endometrial lesions (P < 0.05). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of transvaginal 2D-CEUS and 2D-CEUS combined with 3D-CEUS for diagnosis of benign and malignant endometrial lesions were 76.9%, 73.8%, 64.5%, 83.8%, and 75.0% and 84.6%, 83.3%, 75.9%, 89.7%, and 83.8%, respectively. Conclusion. 3D-CEUS is a useful supplement to 2D-CEUS and can clearly reveal the angioarchitecture spatial relationships between vessels and depth of myometrial invasion in EC. The combined use of 2D and 3D-CEUS can offer direct, accurate, and comprehensive diagnosis of early EC.
