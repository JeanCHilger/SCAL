Uterine anomalies in women with recurrent pregnancy loss. One percent of couples trying to have children are affected by recurrent miscarriage. These pregnancy losses have different pathogenetic (genetic, endocrine, anatomic, immunologic, microbiologic, haematologic and andrologic) backgrounds, but recurrent miscarriage remains unexplained in more than half of the affected couples.To explore risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss the authors studied the incidence of anatomic disorders of the uterine cavity occur in Hungarian women with recurrent miscarriage.Medical records of 152 patients with recurrent miscarriage were analyzed retrospectively. In order to explore disorders of the uterine cavity hysteroscopy or 3-dimensional sonography in 132 women, hysterosalpingography in 16 and hysterosalpingo-sonography in 4 patients were used.Incidence of anomalies in the uterine cavity was found in women with recurrent miscarriage to be 15.8%. A variety of the uterine anomalies was found including uterine septum in 6.5%, endometrial polyp in 2.6%, arcuate and bicornuate uteri both in 2% and 2%, submucosal myoma in 1.3 %, and intrauterine synechiae in 1.3%.These findings suggest that morphologic disorder of the uterine cavity is frequent in Hungarian women with recurrent miscarriage. Therefore, assessment of the uterine anatomy is recommended in such patients.
