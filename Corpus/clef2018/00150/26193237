Uterus neuroendocrine tumor - a severe prognostic factor in a female patient with alcoholic cirrhosis undergoing chronic hemodialysis. There is increased evidence that end-stage renal disease patients, especially the hemodialyzed population, may present various unexpected forms of complications, contributing to a poor prognosis. Furthermore, neuroendocrine tumors, rarely encountered in daily practice, present in dialyzed individuals can significantly exacerbate the inflammatory condition with negative impact on patients' quality of life. We present an unusual case of uterus neuroendocrine tumor with multiple metastases in a 49-year-old female hemodialyzed patient with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis and uterus fibromatous. Multiple endoscopic techniques (e.g., upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, upper and lower echoendoscopy), histological evaluation of biopsy samples from involved areas (the operatory piece) were performed in order to complete and refine the diagnosis.
