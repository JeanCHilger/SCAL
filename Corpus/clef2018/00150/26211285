Polycystic ovaries: what's news in 2015?. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a very common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with important clinical implications (fertility issues, hirsutism, metabolic abnormalities). The Endocrine society has published in 2013 a series of diagnostic and treatment recommendations, followed by the European society of endocrinology in 2014. Recently, advances have been made in the measure of androgen biomarker and the evaluation of ovarian morphology with 3D ultrasound techniques. New treatments have emerged for fertility problems associated with the syndrome (ex. letrozole).
