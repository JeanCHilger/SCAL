Successful resolution of persistent trophoblastic disease after partial mole with the EMA-CO regimen. A 29-year-old nullipara with partial hydatidiform mole at 8 weeks had pre-evacuation hCG levels of 275,000 mIU/ml. Free beta-hCG levels were measured as 3% (normal value below 4%). The patient developed persistent gestational trophoblastic disease, failed to respond to methotrexate and actinomycin D, but has responded to combination chemotherapy with EMA-CO. Such a response to EMA-CO was not reported previously.
