Twin pregnancy involving complete hydatidiform mole and partial mole after five years of amenorrhoea. A case of twin pregnancy involving a single fetus and complete hydatidiform mole in a 56-year-old woman after 5 years of amenorrhoea is reported. The patient presented with threatened abortion and was managed with bed rest and blood transfusion. Six weeks after admission and at 20 weeks gestation, she had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a molar pregnancy and a fresh stillbirth with molar degeneration of the placenta. The uterine cavity was evacuated by suction curettage after delivery and plasma, BHCG was negative 4 weeks subsequently. In a case of pregnancy after a long period of amenorrhoea in the older woman, molar degeneration is a strong probability.
