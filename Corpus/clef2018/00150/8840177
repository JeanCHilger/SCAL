Transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of diffuse adenomyosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic capability of transvaginal ultrasound in detecting diffuse adenomyosis. One hundred and seventy-five women, mean age 45.8 years (range 37-62), were studied by TV ultrasound before hysterectomy for benign uterine pathology. The sonographer diagnosed adenomyosis in 19 patients, whereas the pathologist diagnosed adenomyosis in 15 women making ex novo diagnoses in 2 cases. The sensitivity of TV ultrasound was 86.6%, the specificity 96.2%, the positive predictive value 68.4%, and the negative predictive value 98%. In conclusion, this study showed that TV ultrasound is an important and advanced tool in the diagnosis of diffuse adenomyosis.
