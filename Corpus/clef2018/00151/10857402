Estimate of osteoporosis fracture risk with ultrasound bone assessment. Multiple studies suggest that ultrasound measurement of the bone can be a rapid, cheap, and radiation-free alternative to determine the fracture risk. In this paper the ultrasound measurement of the bone was performed among 288 postmenopausal women, and the influence of gynecologic history and factors related to lifestyle on the obtained values was examined.One hundred nineteen healthy postmenopausal women and 169 women with previous osteoporotic fractures were included in the study. Both weight and height were determined and a clinical questionnaire was administered to assess factors related to bone mineral density. The values of broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) were obtained with a contact ultrasound analyzer.Among women without fractures the mean BUA and SOS values (64.1 [14.9] and 1,601.1 [34.5], respectively) were significantly higher than mean BUA (48.8 [17.3]) and SOS (1,573 [57.8]) values among women with fractures (p < 0.001). Using the logistic regression analysis for predicting fracture risk, the model that suited best was that including BUA (OR = 0.668 [0.544-0.818]), age (OR = 1.102 [1.055-1.151]), age at postmenopause (OR = 0.794 [0.731-0.862]) and height (OR = 0.932 [0.883-0.983]). The area under the curve for this model was 0.871.BUA and SOS values are lower among women with osteoporotic fractures. The fracture risk can be predicted by means of a model including the variables BUA, age, postmenopausal age, and height.
