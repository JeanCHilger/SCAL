State and development of uterine myoma embolization in Germany. To evaluate the current situation and implementation of embolization of uterine leiomyomas into the treatment concept in women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas in Germany.A questionnaire addressing the clinical background of uterine myomas, recommended treatment concepts, preclinical evaluation, technical approach and complications was sent to 164 departments of gynecology and radiology in Germany.33 radiological departments and 19 gynecological departments submitted a completed questionnaire. Only 7 departments of radiology reported to have own experience with embolization of uterine leiomyomas, while only 2 departments of gynecology considered embolization as an alternative treatment option in patients with symptomatic leiomyomas. 18/33 radiological departments offer this treatment option but get no patient referrals. Agreement was found concerning the indications for treatment, preclinical evaluation by ultrasound and MRI, preferable location of treatable fibroids, technical approach and pain management.The embolization of uterine leiomyomas in patients with symptomatic myomas is regardless of the well documented high efficacy and low complication rate not yet an established treatment option in Germany. Interventional radiologists and gynecologists have to evaluate the indications for the embolization of uterine leiomyomas together before the procedure is advised to the patient, because it seems mandatory to add this procedure to the standard armamentarium of treatment options in uterine myomas.
