Portable ultrasound scanners. Portable ultrasound scanners have become an increasingly significant part of the ultrasound market as their capabilities have advanced to rival those of conventional full-sized scanners. For this Evaluation, we examined seven portable scanners from four suppliers: GE, Philips, Siemens, and SonoSite. We found that these units meet all our performance criteria, offer most or all of the appropriate features for their intended applications, and are generally comparable to conventional units for those applications. Because the scanners offer comparable technical performance, our ratings focus primarily on the features and probes available. Each scanner is judged on its suitability for specific applications (such as comprehensive cardiac studies and vascular access guidance). We then translate these judgments into product ratings tailored to five hospital areas--the cardiology department, emergency department, obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) department, radiology department, and vascular lab. All seven scanners are rated at least Acceptable for the departments in which they are likely to be used. We have given Preferred ratings to those scanners that can be used as a department's only unit. This article also discusses how the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard relates to portable ultrasound, pinpoints some of the measurement and calculation errors that can be particular problems for inexperienced users, and reviews the warranty and contract services available for ultrasound scanners.
