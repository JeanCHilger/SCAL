Struma ovarii: US and CT findings. We describe the ultrasound and CT findings in a case of struma ovarii. Ultrasound showed a multicystic mass with a well-vascularized solid part. CT demonstrated a multilocular cystic mass with calcifications and solid, enhancing components. To prevent radical surgery, struma ovarii should be included in the differential diagnosis when a mixed, multilocular, teratoma-like tumour of the ovary shows a well-vascularized, enhancing, central solid component.
