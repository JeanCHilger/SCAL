The best treatment for recurrent endometrial cancer is still uncertain, although weekly paclitaxel has shown some promise in the management of this disease. In this report we present a patient with recurrent endometrial cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel. Serial power Doppler angiography was used to assess the effects of therapy.
