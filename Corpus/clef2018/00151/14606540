Prenatal craniofacial morphogenesis: four-dimensional visualization of morphogenetic processes. Basic research concerning craniofacial development presently runs along two pathways, namely the molecular and the morphometric. This gap needs to be bridged.Using histological serial sections of human fetuses computer-aided three-dimensional reconstructions were made (Software Analysis, SIS) with special focus given to all anatomical structures of the orofacial region of the growing head.All reconstructions can be viewed from any rotation and they are available for virtual dissection according to anatomical rules. As an example, the prenatal development of the human mandible with the formation of the mental foramen therein is described. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of bone, cartilage and nerves is presented in three dimensions in different developmental stages. The interaction of tissues with possible morphogenetic interaction is discussed.This work serves as a reference system for prenatal development in comparison with pathological development.
