Transurethral treatment of ejaculatory duct obstruction in infertile men. Ten cases of ejaculatory duct obstruction with midline cyst, complaining of male infertility, were treated with transurethral incision. They had azoospermia or oligozoospermia, and physical examination did not show any abnormal findings. Serum levels of testosterone, LH, and FSH were within normal limits. The diagnosis of ejaculatory duct obstruction with midline cyst was made by transurethral ultrasonography and vasography. Thereafter, patients underwent transurethral incision of the verumontanum with a cold knife. Semen volume increased in all patients, and sperm concentration and/or motility improved in 7 patients (70%). Pregnancy was achieved by 3 couples (30%). Incision of the ejaculatory duct via an endoscopic technique could improve seminal findings and subsequent fertility.
