Sonohysterography compared with endometrial biopsy for evaluation of the endometrium in tamoxifen-treated women. This study was performed to compare endometrial biopsy and sonohysterography for evaluation of the endometrium in tamoxifen-treated women.Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to identify 51 consecutive tamoxifen-treated women who had sonohysterography and correlative endometrial biopsy for evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding or thickened endometrium of greater than 8 mm. Endometrial biopsy and sonohysterographic results were compared in all women, and for 27 (53%) women who had hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage, endometrial biopsy and sonohysterographic findings also were compared with surgical pathologic findings.Thirty-two (63%) of 51 sonohysterograms revealed endometrial polyps 4 (8%) showed endometrium of greater than 5 mmIn tamoxifen-treated women, sonohysterography provides a significant improvement in sensitivity for diagnosis of endometrial polyps compared with endometrial biopsy.
