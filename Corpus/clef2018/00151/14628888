Preoperative diagnosis of fallopian tube cancer by imaging. Primary cancer of the fallopian tube (FTC) is among the most unusual gynecologic malignancies and rarely is diagnosed correctly before surgery. The imaging results of eight patients with FTC and four with benign tubal disease were analyzed. FTCs were small cystic or solid masses that typically were shaped like a sausage, a snail, or a gourd, regardless of clinical stage.
