Minilaparotomy with a mini-pfannenstiel incision for the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in Africa. to evaluate the usefulness of an exploratory minilaparotomy under local anaesthesia in cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy.Prospective study of the management of all cases of unruptured suspected ectopic pregnancy at the Gynaecological and Obstetrical Clinic at the Dakar University teaching hospital from 1 January, 2000, to 31 December, 2002.44 unruptured ectopic pregnancies were recorded. The typical patient had no or few previous deliveries and was 30 years old 27% of the patients presented risk factors for ectopic pregnancy.
