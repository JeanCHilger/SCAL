Diagnosis and treatment of polypoid lesion of the gallbladder. To discuss the principles of diagnosis and treatment of the polypoid lesion of gallbladder.Clinical and pathological features of 342 cases were analysed.Totally 328 patients with benign polypoid lesions (including 234 cholesterol polyps, and 74 adenomas), and 14 patients with malignant polypoid lesions (including 10 adenocarcinomas and 4 adenomas with malignant changes) were included. Two hundred and forty-seven cases (72.2%) had symptoms. Seventy-eight point six percent of patients with malignant polyps were over 50 years of age, and while 29.9 percent of patients with non-malignant polyps were over 50 years. The lesions were more than 1 cm in 91.7% of the malignant polyps and in only 13.2% of the benign polyps. One hundred percent of malignant polyps, and 46 percent of benign polyps were single polyp.Cholesterol polyps, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas are the most common lesions in polypoid lesion of the gallbladder. Cholecystectomy should be done in patients with symptoms. The risk factors for malignancy are the age of the patient (> 50), the size (> 1 cm), and number (single) of the polypoid lesions. In asymptomatic patients, cholecystectomy can be justified after integrated analysis.
