Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) of bone in the management of postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is becoming a major problem for healthcare institutions as it has a growing social and economic impact. The incidence of osteoporotic fractures is constantly increasing due to the increase in life expectancy. The gynaecologist plays an important role in establishing a "biological zero" in each perimenopausal patient, and controlling the rate of bone loss during postmenopausal period.Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has been widely used for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis and represents a strong risk factor for fractures, but it presents several limitations with regards to diagnosis, treatment follow-up and differential diagnosis of secondary osteoporosis. In these last years quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique has been introduced for the evaluation of bone status in postmenopausal women and several in vitro and clinical studies have demonstrated the reliability of the examination in terms of: reproducibility, evaluation of fracture risk, treatment follow-up, differential diagnosis. QUS has proven to be equally capable in the prediction of future osteoporosis related fractures in comparison to DXA. Large-scale cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated the applicability of QUS in screening the female population during the climacteric period. QUS technique seems to be very efficient in identifying "fast losers", identifying subjects at risk for osteoporosis requiring second-level investigation (DXA, X-ray), diagnosing secondary osteoporosis.If QUS is used in a systematic and rational manner in clinical practice, it is a valid technique for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.
