Quinacrine female nonsurgical sterilization (QS): endometrial assessment by vaginal ultrasonography in 128 women. Investigate effectiveness, safety and endometrial pattern after QS.This study began in March 1999 and ended March 18, 2003 128 women received transcervical insertions of quinacrine. Follow-up visits with ultrasound were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12-month intervals.Two pregnancies occurred, one at 25 months, the other at 37. Adverse events (AE) were: yellow vaginal discharge, headache, mild abdominal pain, vaginal pruritus, nausea and transient decrease in endometrial thickness. One patient had allergic reaction. A third insertion was done in case of vaginal bleeding (16.4%). One year after QS 10% still had amenorrhea, which may be the result of the fact that 73% of our patients had received DMPH. Once inside the uterus, the dissolved quinacrine could be seen within seconds, via ultrasound as a "Lake of Quinacrine" which stays for up to two hours. Frequently, a transverse vaginal ultrasonographic view of the uterine cavity showed plug-like echogenic points at the cornua.Quinacrine sterilization is safe and effective. The echogenic points need to be more thoroughly studied in order to affirm whether ultrasonography may identify the blockage of the tubes. Since early pregnancy is due to imperfect tubal closure, the use of ultrasound may prevent failure. However, pregnancy due to later recanalization cannot be avoided.
