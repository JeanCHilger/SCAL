Combined use of progesterone challenge test and endometrium thickness evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography in the preventive management of postmenopausal women. Endometrial thickness was evaluated in apparently normal postmenopausal women by transvaginal ultrasonography and the results were compared with the response to the progesterone challenge test (PCT). A positive correlation between amount of withdrawal bleeding after PCT and endometrial thickness was found, also demonstrated by the significative correlation between bleeding length and endometrial thickness. Among women referring withdrawal bleeding, 100 and 22% of cases classified as overt flow and spotting, respectively, were characterized by pathologic histological findings. The combined use of these two procedures is suggested as an effective screening mean in the preventive endometrial management of apparently normal postmenopausal women to select candidates for diagnostic invasive procedures.
