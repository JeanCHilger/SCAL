Uterine artery embolization for fibroids does not have adverse effects on ovarian reserve in regularly cycling women younger than 40 years. To evaluate the impact of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for fibroids on ovarian reserve in women younger than 40 years.Prospective study.University-based reproductive endocrinology unit.Twenty regularly cycling women aged 33-39 years undergoing UAE for fibroids. All had cycle day 3 FSH levels <10 mIU/mL.Measurements of serum FSH and E2 levels and of the total ovarian volume and antral follicle number by transvaginal ultrasonography on day 3 of the menstrual cycle preceding UAE and on day 3 of the cycles occurring in months 3, 6, and 12 after UAE.Preprocedural and postprocedural hormone levels, ovarian volumes, and antral follicle numbers.There were no significant changes from baseline in the mean day 3 FSH and E2 levels, ovarian volume measurements, and antral follicle numbers measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after UAE.Although this study might be not sensitive enough to conclude that UAE for fibroids does not interfere with a woman's ovarian status, these data indicate that in this series of reproductive-aged women UAE did not have short- or mid-term effects on ovarian reserve as assessed by hormonal and sonographic parameters.
