Modification of ultrasonographically measured endometrial thickness after discontinuation of adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate endometrial changes after five years of tamoxifen treatment by measuring endometrial thickness with transvaginal ultrasonography.Fifty-five asymptomatic postmenopausal women who had assumed tamoxifen, 20 mg daily, for five years were controlled six months after discontinuation of the therapy. Of these 42 were followed-up at 12 months. Statistical analysis was performed using the analysis of variance for repeated measures and the Anova test p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We found a significant reduction in endometrial thickness at six months (p = 0.0046) and at 12 months (p = 0.0003) but not between six and 12 months (p = 0.06).A statistically significant reduction in endometrial thickness after discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy was found. This can probably be attributed to the cessation of the estrogenic side-effects of tamoxifen therapy.
