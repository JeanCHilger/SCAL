Postmenopausal endometrial cancer screening: is there a correlation between transvaginal sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness and body mass index? The aim of this study was to correlate the body mass index with transvaginal sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in a cohort of postmenopausal women who were admitted for endometrial cancer surveillance.Transvaginal sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness was performed in 97 postmenopausal women who attended the gynecology clinic for endometrial cancer screening with no history of hormone replacement therapy and correlated with body mass index. Baseline characteristics including age, years since menopause and body mass index were recorded for each subject. The relationship between transvaginal sonographic endometrial thickness and baseline characteristics was assessed in each.Body mass index was significantly correlated with years since menopause (r = 0.292, p = 0.004) and age (r = 0.243, p = 0.01) but not with endometrial thickness (r = -0.07, p = 0.454). Endometrial thickness versus time since menopause correlation was found to be significant (r = 0.274, p = 0.03) in patients with a body mass index lower than 30.The present findings indicate that endometrial thickness does not differ with body mass index in the screening of postmenopausal women for endometrial cancer.
