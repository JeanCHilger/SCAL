Pitfalls of gynaecological ultrasonography. Pitfalls in gynaecological ultrasonography may arise during acquisition of images, processing and interpretation. Physical interactions between the ultrasound and body structures may produce artifacts. Physiological processes such as functional ovarian cysts may mimic lesions. Different pathological processes may produce similar ultrasonographical appearances. To minimise errors in interpretation of gynaecological ultrasonography, one needs to be aware of the limitations of ultrasonography, and the similarities in the appearances of various physiological and pathological processes.
