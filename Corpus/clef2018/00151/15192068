Sonographic assessment of non-malignant ovarian cysts: does sonohistology exist? Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) is feasible and accurate in the differentiation between non-malignant and malignant ovarian abnormalities. However, despite the clinical relevance, the accuracy of TVU in the differentiation between the many different non-malignant cysts is unknown.Between 1992 and 2002, all women who had surgery at our centre because of a non-malignant ovarian cyst were included prospectively in this study. The sonographic characteristics as well as the expected histological diagnosis (the 'sonohistological diagnosis') were evaluated pre-operatively. This diagnosis was compared with the histopathological diagnosis, and diagnostic parameters [with 95% confidence interval (CI)] of the sonohistological diagnosis were calculated. Logistic models, with the sonographic characteristics as variables, were constructed for each histopathological diagnosis.A total of 406 women were included consecutively. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the sonohistological diagnosis was 60% (95% CI 0.56-0.65). Only in cases of simple ovarian cysts did the diagnostic accuracy of the respective logistic model exceed that of the sonohistological diagnosis (0.88 versus 0.81, P < 0.01). The diagnostic accuracy of the sonohistological diagnosis for endometriotic and dermoid ovarian cysts was significantly better compared with the respective logistic model (0.84 versus 0.71, P < 0.01 and 0.87 versus 0.82, P = 0.03, respectively).In approximately half of the non-malignant ovarian cysts, TVU is capable of distinguishing between the different histopathological diagnoses of non-malignant ovarian masses. Only in the diagnosis of simple ovarian cysts might use of the logistic models be helpful.
