Leiomyoma arising from the tunica albuginea of the testis: sonographic findings. Leiomyomas are benign neoplasms that may arise from any structure or organ containing smooth muscle. The majority of genitourinary leimyomas are found in the renal capsule, but this tumor has also been reported in the epididymis, spermatic cord, and tunica albuginea. Sonography is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating intrascrotal pathology, but the sonographic appearance of leiomyomas arising from the tunica albuginea have rarely been reported. We report a case of such a leiomyoma that was diagnosed sonographically.
