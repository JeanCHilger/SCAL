Sclerotherapy with 5% tetracycline is a simple alternative to potentially complex surgical treatment of ovarian endometriomas before in vitro fertilization. Conventional treatment of endometriosis involves drainage and removal of the cyst wall, which often results in inadvertent resection of normal ovarian tissue. We previously reported that 12 patients were successfully treated with sclerotherapy using 5% tetracycline. We now report our experience with sclerotherapy before in vitro fertilization (IVF) in an additional 20 patients with ovarian endometriomas.Prospective, cohort.Private practice.Women (n = 32) with sonographic evidence of an ovarian endometrioma were offered sclerotherapy in lieu of laparoscopy.Sclerotherapy was performed under conscious sedation and transvaginal ultrasound guidance. An 18-gauge, single-lumen needle was inserted into the endometrioma, and the cyst contents were sequentially aspirated and flushed with sterile saline until the aspirated fluid was clear. Tetracycline (5%) (5-10 mL) was then instilled into the cyst. Saline was injected into the cul-de-sac to dilute any tetracycline that may have leaked. The fluid was then removed. Ultrasound was performed 6 weeks later to assess the efficacy of treatment.Resolution of endometrioma and subsequent IVF pregnancy rate.Complete resolution was observed in 24 (75%) of 32 patients, at follow-up exam. Repeat aspiration of watery fluid was required in eight patients before resolution. Repeat treatment with tetracycline was needed in two patients. Only one patient did not ultimately respond. In vitro fertilization was performed in 28 patients an ongoing gestation resulted in 16 (57%) from the next cycle.Sclerotherapy with 5% tetracycline is a simple, effective (and, in our limited series, safe) alternative to surgical intervention for treatment of endometriomas before IVF.
