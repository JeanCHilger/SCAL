Endometrial thickness. Prognostic factor in assisted reproduction?. Most authors coincide that an endometrial thickness lesser than 8 mm has a very low pregnancy rate.To determine if the measurement of endometrial thickness by vaginal ultrasound has a prognostic value over the pregnancy rate in patients with endometrial preparation for an embryo transfer in cycles of frozen embryos and ovum donation.Retrospective and comparative.A total of 100 cycles were analyzed in the group of frozen embryo transfer and 71 cycles in the group of ovum donation, we subdivided these two groups into two more groups, one with an endometrial thickness of 8 mm or less and the other with more than 8 mm.There is a significant difference in the group of frozen embryo transfer regarding the age of the patients (p = 0.009). The pregnancy rate in the group of frozen embryo transfer with an endometrial thickness of 8 mm or less was 14.7% and of 37% in the group with more than 8 mm, with a significant difference (p < 0.01). When we analyzed the cycles of ovum donation, we did not found a significant difference, and we found a pregnancy rate of 47% in the group with endometrial thickness of 8 mm or less, and 40% in the other group.In the present study we found that the measurement of the endometrial thickness of more than 8 mm in the patient undergoing a frozen embryo transfer has a predictor value.
