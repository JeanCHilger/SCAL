Splenosis and pelvic pain. A report of a case and literature review. Initially described by Buchbinder and Lipkoff in 1929, esplenosis is the transplant of the splenic heterotopy weave in the abdominal cavity. It is observed after the splenic traumatic rupture and appendectomy. It occurs also during the embryonic development. The most frequent places where it takes place are: the intrathoraxic cavity, intraperitoneal, retroperitoneo, and brain. Although the presence of this ectopic splenic weave is symptomatic, this pathology can be evident by pain in the pelvis or it can be confused with other pathologies such as hemangiomas of intestine, and endometriosis including metastasis carcinoma. It is impossible to predict which patients will develop the splenosis after the splenic trauma. The time of rupture or damage of the splectonomy and the amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity are not related with the number of implants. The symptoms are the clue. When the splenosis is diagnosed incidentally in a symptomatic patient, the complete surgery removal is not indicated. However this surgery is recommended when the abdominal pain or the diagnosis is uncertain. In this paper a case with a secondary pelvic pain, probably due to a tubaric abortion, agreeing with secondary splenosis and a traumatic splenic rupture, is reported.
