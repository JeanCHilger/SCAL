Ultrasound training: the virtual patient. To evaluate an ultrasound training system designed to standardize teaching and learning of gynecological sonography using a virtual model.The 'virtual patient' was based on a three-dimensional freehand ultrasound system that allows two-dimensional sonographic offline investigations of previously recorded cases, imitating a real gynecological scan. In the first test phase designed to check the congruence of real and virtual scans, 25 doctors experienced in ultrasound examined three virtual cases. During the second test phase we assessed whether training with the virtual patient helped to establish a satisfactory practical knowledge of gynecological ultrasound. This phase was carried out with 24 medical students without ultrasound experience.All 25 doctors successfully investigated the three cases and generated an accurate diagnosis for the first and second cases. In the third case 14 doctors made the correct diagnosis (uterus bicornis). The measurements of endometrial thickness and the diameter of a fibroid yielded acceptable results compared with the original investigation. After a short standardized video-based instruction, all 24 medical students were able to perform a basic transvaginal scan and to inspect the uterus, ovaries and the urinary bladder. Measurements of endometrial thickness by all students deviated minimally from the actual measurement.Training with the virtual patient appears to be comparable to performing a live gynecological ultrasound investigation and allows standardized ultrasound teaching and learning.
