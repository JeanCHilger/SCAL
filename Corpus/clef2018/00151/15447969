Isolated torsion of the hydrosalpinx: a rare presentation. Isolated torsion of the Fallopian tube is a rare occurrence, which generally presents in the reproductive age group. It is difficult to diagnose on imaging and the diagnosis is established after laparoscopy. This report describes an unusual presentation of an uncommon condition in a perimenopausal 48-year-old woman who presented with lower abdominal discomfort. The clinical and imaging features led to a suspicion of ovarian neoplasm. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed torsion of a left sided hydrosalpinx with benign serous cystadenoma of the left ovary. Torsion of the Fallopian tube is a rare event in the perimenopausal age group. It should however be included in the differential diagnosis of lower abdominal pain and recognition of imaging features may allow early surgical intervention.
