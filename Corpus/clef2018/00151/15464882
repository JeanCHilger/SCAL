Imaging diagnosis of congenital uterine malformation. Congenital anomaly of the female reproductive system is associated with higher rate of infertility, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, premature birth and postpartum bleed. Because of the variable clinical pictures of obstruction of menstrual flow in adolescence to hypomenorrhea, vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and fertility problems in adult life, early and accurate diagnosis is difficult. Complete uterine and vaginal septum can be easily confused with uterus didelphys. Management of these two m√ºllerian duct anomalies is different. With improved treatment methods for complete relief of symptoms and prevention of further sequelae, comprehensive evaluation is important to identify the underlying problem and formulate appropriate therapeutic plan. The embryology, classification, and clinical presentation of uterine malformation, advantages and limitations of diagnostic methods including hysterosalpingogram, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, laparoscopy, and hysteroscopy are discussed. The imaging features of different types of uterine anomalies are illustrated.
