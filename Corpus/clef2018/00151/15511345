Increased implantation and pregnancy rates obtained by placing the tip of the transfer catheter in the central area of the endometrial cavity. The influence of endometrial cavity length (ECL) on implantation and pregnancy rates after 400 embryo transfers was studied prospectively in a population with the indication of IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The tip of the transfer catheter was placed above or below the half point of the ECL in a randomized manner. Two analyses were performed: (i) absolute position (AP) embryo transfers were divided into three groups according to the distance between the end of the fundal endometrial surface and the catheter tip (DTC - distance tip catheter): AP1 (n = 212), 10-15 mm
