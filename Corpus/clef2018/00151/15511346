Partial hydatidiform mole following the transfer of single frozen-thawed embryo subsequent to ICSI. Hydatiform mole is a gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by the dominance of dispermic fertilization. Micromanipulation techniques in assisted reproduction technologies have enabled direct evaluation of the zygotes and the formation of pronuclei in the zygote. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of oocytes ensures that only a single spermatozoon enters the ooplasma. This study reports a case of partial hydatiform mole following the transfer of day 3 frozen-thawed embryo. ICSI was used as the assisted fertilization method because there was male factor infertility due to severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Possible predisposing factors for partial hydatidiform mole after ICSI are also discussed.
