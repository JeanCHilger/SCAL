Computer-aided diagnosis for CT colonography. CT colonography, or virtual colonoscopy, is a promising alternative screening tool for colon cancer. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for CT colonography has the potential to increase radiologists' diagnostic performance in the detection of polyps and to reduce variability of the diagnostic accuracy among readers. Technical developments have advanced CAD for CT colonography substantially during the last several years. This paper describes the key techniques used for CAD for detection of polyps and masses in CT colonography, the current detection performance, and challenges and the future of CAD.
