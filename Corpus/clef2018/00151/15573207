Twin intrauterine and cornual gestation in a case of triplet pregnancy. Ectopic implantation with in-vitro fertilization-embryo transfer may occur in the cornu or tubal stump, which is otherwise rare. Our patient with previous left salpingostomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy had 4 embryos transferred through in vitro fertilization out of which 3 were successfully implanted with twin intrauterine gestation and cornual pregnancy. The cornual pregnancy ruptured at 12 weeks of gestation and the twin intrauterine pregnancy had a successful outcome.
