Recombinant activated factor VII as a life-saving therapy for severe postpartum haemorrhage unresponsive to conservative traditional management. Postpartum haemorrhage remains the main cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Treatment aims at maintaining hemodynamic circulation and preventing shock by stopping blood loss both medically and surgically. We report two cases of major postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony. Patients developed haemorrhagic shock and severe coagulation disorders (nadir values of PTT were <10% and fibrinogen was <0.1 g/l). Well-codified medical (ocytocin, sulprostone) and surgical management (ligation of both hypogastic arteries in the two cases completed by staged uterine ligation in one case) failed to stop bleeding. Recently, several case reports described successful use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in scheduled surgery, trauma and major postpartum haemorrhage. Thus, after transfusion of more than one blood mass and failure of surgical haemostasis to stop bleeding, rFVIIa (60 microg/kg) was given. A single iv bolus injection stopped ongoing diffuse haemorrhage in the two cases. No further transfusion was required afterwards in both patients. RFVIIa might thus be a strong complementary agent in the management of major postpartum haemorrhage. Optimal dose, timing and safety characteristics of rVIIa administration remain to be determined. One patient developed four weeks later thrombosis of both ovarian veins, a complication that can be related to either rFVIIa or to the staged uterine ligations performed during surgery.
