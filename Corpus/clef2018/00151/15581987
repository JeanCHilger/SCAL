Malignant mesenchymoma arising from a uterine leiomyoma in the menopause. Malignant mesenchymoma is a rare tumor and location in the uterus is even rarer. We describe the first case of malignant mesenchymoma arising from a uterine fibroid in the menopause.A 64-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and underwent surgery for a large "uterine fibroid" with suspicious features on ultrasound scan. The mass had developed after the menopause. Histology showed benign leiomyomatous tissue with malignant areas consistent with malignant mesenchymoma.We report the first case of malignant mesenchymoma arising from the uterus in menopause. Certain radiological features may be associated with this tumor.
