A phase I study of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of single- and multiple-dose anastrozole in healthy, premenopausal female volunteers. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in healthy, premenopausal women.Phase I, single-center study.Infertility clinic.Twenty-six women with regular ovulatory cycles: 20 received either a single dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg anastrozole, or remained untreated 6 received five daily doses of 10 mg or 15 mg anastrozole.Anastrozole was administered on cycle day 2 for the single-dose groups and on days 2-6 for the multiple-dose groups. Ultrasound follicular development and endometrial biopsies were performed. Safety was determined from adverse event reports and laboratory parameters.Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety.The pharmacokinetics of anastrozole were linear, predictable, and consistent with previously published data in healthy volunteers. In the single-dose groups, E2 levels reached their nadir 3-6 hours after administration, decreasing by an average of 39% from baseline. Follicle-stimulating hormone levels rose by 13%, 52%, 49%, and 75% in the 5-mg, 10-mg, 15-mg, and 20-mg groups, respectively, at approximately 24 hours after dosing. Most subjects recruited just one mature follicle, with no apparent effect on endometrial maturation. No safety concerns were noted.Anastrozole was well tolerated and suppressed E2 levels, with a resultant increase in FSH.
