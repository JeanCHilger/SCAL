Ovarian changes after abdominal hysterectomy for benign conditions. To investigate any change in the ovaries, including early follicular serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level, total ovarian volume, total antral follicle count, and ovarian stromal blood flow, in patients who had undergone abdominal hysterectomy for benign conditions.Fifteen women with abdominal hysterectomy and conservation of ovaries for benign conditions and who were between 29 and 44 years old were recruited to undergo three-dimensional ultrasound examination with power Doppler to assess total ovarian volume, total antral follicle count, and vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) of ovarian stromal blood flow. Serum FSH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were checked on the same day. The results of the assessments were considered taken during the early follicular phase if the estradiol and progesterone levels were basal. Fifteen age-matched healthy women underwent the same assessments on the second day of menstruation.Women with hysterectomy had significantly elevated serum FSH level and lower ovarian stromal blood flow indices, including VI, FI, and VFI, as compared with healthy women. The total antral follicle count and the total ovarian volume were similar between the two groups.These changes may suggest altered ovarian function after hysterectomy.
