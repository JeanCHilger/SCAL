Myometrial invasion and cervical invasion by endometrial carcinoma: evaluation by CO2-volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE). To assess myometrial invasion and cervical invasion by endometrial carcinoma, using CO2-volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) enabling more precise evaluation of depth of tumor invasion.CO2-VIBE was performed in 21 cases of endometrial carcinoma (Stage Ia-IIb) prior to treatment. The images were interpreted by performing multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), and the findings obtained from the images (degree of myometrial invasion and presence or absence of cervical invasion) were assessed in comparison with the histopathological diagnosis.The sites of the endometrial carcinoma lesions were clearly visualized by the CO2-VIBE method. Evaluation of the degree of myometrial invasion enabled a high correct diagnosis rate of 90.5%, and evaluation for the presence of cervical invasion also allowed a high correct diagnosis rate of 90.5%.VIBE permits evaluation of any plane desired by means of thin slices, and it is a truly revolutionary method for preoperative evaluation of depth of invasion of endometrial carcinoma that enables highly accurate determination of the extent of lesion sites and degree of invasion before treatment.
