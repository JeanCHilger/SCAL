Pilot study prospectively evaluating the use of the measurement of preoperative sonographic endometrial thickness in postmenopausal patients with endometrial cancer. The value of sonographic evaluation of the endometrial thickness as a screening or a prognostic tool for endometrial cancer remains controversial. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the endometrial thickness in women with known endometrial cancer to assess the predictive value of this modality and its preoperative use in this disease.In a prospective, nonrandomized trial, 29 patients with pathologically confirmed endometrial cancer had preoperative transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial thickness evaluated. Body mass index (BMI) and endometrial thickness were recorded and correlated with surgical and pathologic information.The median age at diagnosis of endometrial cancer was 61.6 years (range, 48-87 years). Tumor grade was as follows: grade 1, 23 grade 2, 3Although patients with endometrial cancer and a high BMI are likely to have a thickened endometrial stripe, endometrial thickness does not correlate with tumor grade or stage. The use of preoperative transvaginal ultrasound in diagnosed endometrial cancer appears limited.
