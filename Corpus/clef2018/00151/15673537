Case report. Uterine lipoma: advantage of MRI over ultrasound. Pure fatty tumours of the uterus are exceedingly rare. A case of uterine lipoma demonstrated on ultrasound and MRI with pathological correlation is described. Ultrasound suggested the presence of a uterine lipoma but MRI permitted an unequivocal diagnosis. The usefulness of the various imaging methods is discussed in correctly diagnosing this entity and avoiding unnecessary surgery in the asymptomatic patient.
