Gender differences in patients needs and concerns to diagnostic tests for possible cancer. Little is known about the difference between the concerns of men and women prior to undergoing diagnostic tests for cancer.A convenience sample of 129 outpatients completed a survey.No statistically significant differences were found between male and female patients however, patients evaluated for gender-specific cancers reported a significantly (P < .01) higher mean score for concerns related to sexuality, reproductive ability, and intimate relationships. Almost half (46%) of the patients reported not receiving any or not enough information before the procedure.Men and women have similar concerns however, there are significant differences in the concerns of patients undergoing a procedure for a gender-specific versus a non-gender-specific cancer. Some patients reported inadequate procedural information, suggesting that improvements are needed in communication and health education efforts.
