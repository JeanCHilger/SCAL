Interactive 3D segmentation using connected orthogonal contours. This paper describes a new method for interactive segmentation that is based on cross-sectional design and 3D modelling. The method represents a 3D model by a set of connected contours that are planar and orthogonal. Planar contours overlayed on image data are easily manipulated and linked contours reduce the amount of user interaction.1 This method solves the contour-to-contour correspondence problem and can capture extrema of objects in a more flexible way than manual segmentation of a stack of 2D images. The resulting 3D model is guaranteed to be free of geometric and topological errors. We show that manual segmentation using connected orthogonal contours has great advantages over conventional manual segmentation. Furthermore, the method provides effective feedback and control for creating an initial model for, and control and steering of, (semi-)automatic segmentation methods.
