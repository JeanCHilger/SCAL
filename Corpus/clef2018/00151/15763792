Medical management of uterine fibroids with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera): a pilot study. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo Provera) in the treatment of menorrhagia attributed to uterine fibroids and to determine whether it reduces fibroid volume. Twenty premenopausal women with menorrhagia attributed to uterine fibroids received Depo Provera (150 mg/month) for 6 months. Control of bleeding was assessed by menstrual diary, haematologic parameters (Hb) and uterine and fibroid size measured sonargraphically. Following a period of 6 months after the initiation of Depo Provera, 30% became amenorrhoeic, 70% noticed improvement in their bleeding pattern and 15% had an increase in their haemoglobin levels. The mean uterine and fibroid volume was also reduced by 48% and 33%, respectively. Medical therapy with Depo Provera with symptomatic fibroids causes significant improvement in bleeding pattern as well as a reduction in fibroid volume.
