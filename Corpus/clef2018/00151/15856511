Evaluation of postmyomectomy uterine scar. To determine preoperative and intraoperative factors that affect the healing pattern of a myomectomy uterine incision and to estimate the incidence and outcome of postmyomectomy hematoma demonstrated with sonography.This observational longitudinal prospective study followed the course of patients diagnosed with at least 1 leiomyomata. Each patent was scheduled for abdominal myomectomy. Preoperative assessments included sonographic measurement of the uterine volume as well as identification of the numbers and sites of the leiomyomata. Detailed operative notes were reported for every patient. Transvaginal sonography was performed for all cases on day 2, day 7, and at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of postoperative hematoma versus preoperative and postoperative factors that possibly affect uterine healing.We found a statistically significant reduction of the uterine volume on follow-up (P < 0.001) of the 169 women enrolled. Hematoma in the myomectomy bed was observed postoperatively in 40 (24%) 28 (17%) and 12 (7%) patients on day 2, day 7, and 1 month, respectively. A preoperative myoma size greater than 110 cm(3), the use of a tourniquet, and the experience of the surgeon were significantly correlated with formation of uterine scar hematomas.The postoperative sonographic diagnosis of wound hematoma may be used as an indicator of wound healing that is usually complete within 3 months. Use of a tourniquet is frequently associated with hematoma formation. Myomectomy should usually be performed by an experienced surgeon without a tourniquet, using microsurgical principles, especially when the sizes of the leiomyomata exceed 110 cm(3).
