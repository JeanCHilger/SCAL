Diagnosis of early intramural ectopic pregnancy. Intramural ectopic pregnancy is a very rare diagnosis. Establishing a diagnosis is difficult and is often made intraoperatively. Demonstration of a live extrauterine gestation is the only specific sign of such a pregnancy. A small number of ectopic pregnancies are interstitial or cornual pregnancies. Rupture of an intramural ectopic pregnancy is a serious clinical complication. Diagnosis of this ectopic pregnancy can sometimes be made using 2-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), but it may also require 3-dimensional TVS. We present the case of a 25-year-old gravida 0, para 0 woman with amenorrhea lasting 6(+5) weeks. Previous surgery included a right adnexectomy for torsion of a right dermoid cyst. The patient's serum hCG was elevated. TVS provided a detailed view of the endometrial cavity. The results of 2-dimensional TVS suggested the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. The sonogram showed a gestational sac with an embryonic pole and a yolk sac, which was separated from the endometrium. Use of 3-dimensional TVS demonstrated a live embryo in a gestational sac surrounded by myometrium below the right cornu lying outside the endometrium. This finding was confirmed by laparotomy and the conceptus was excised. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 7 days after surgery. In our case, the previous adnexectomy was an identifiable risk factor. Nonetheless, making a diagnosis of an intramural pregnancy was challenging. Suspicion may arise when sonography has revealed an intramural gestational sac.
