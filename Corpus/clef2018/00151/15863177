Three-dimensional ultrasound to assess the response to treatment in gynecological malignancies. To report the potential role of 3D ultrasound to assess the response to treatment in gynecological malignancies.The volumes and three 3D power Doppler indices are measured in one case of cervix carcinoma and in one case of ovarian carcinoma with primary radio- and/or chemotherapy before and after treatment.After treatment, tumor volume, vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization-flow index (VFI) were reduced in both two cases.3D ultrasound may provide a new method to assess the response to treatment in gynecological malignancies.
