Ultrasound diagnosis of complete abortion can reduce need for curettage. One hundred and fifty-five patients presenting with signs of incomplete abortion were evaluated by ultrasound. Of these, 112 (72.26%) were found to have retained products of conception and were treated by dilatation and curettage. The remaining 43 (27.74%) were found on ultrasound to have no products of conception and were followed-up conservatively. Only one of the latter group of patients needed admission later for dilatation and curettage this patient was found to have a small sub-mucus fibroid and endometritis. Predictive value for those not requiring D & C was 97.6%, suggesting that this test may be useful in identifying those patient who have had a complete abortion.
