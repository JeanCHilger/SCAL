Bilateral testicular gunshot injuries. Gunshot injuries to the testicles are rare and usually result in testicular atrophy. In the case of severe bilateral testicular injuries, this could cause not only infertility but also the need for lifetime testosterone-substitution. We report an 18-year-old patient with bilateral testicular gunshot injury. During the surgical exploration an orchiectomy of the complete ruptured left testicle was necessary. Debridement of the damaged tissue and a partial orchiectomy was performed on the right side. After the operation, the patient developed an incretory hypogonadism and oligozoospermia. During follow-up, an improvement in the sperm count and of the hormonal status occurred. These finally reached normal levels. After genital traumata, immediate surgical exploration should be performed. Based on the above results, the patient benefits from conservative debridement and primary repair of the injured testicle, if possible. An improvement in hormonal status and sperm parameters after testicular injury and consecutive testicular malfunction can occur. Regeneration of the testicular tissue seems possible.
