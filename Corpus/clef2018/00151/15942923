A new three-dimensional automatic bodymarker system for transvaginal ultrasonography. To evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of a newly developed three-dimensional automatic bodymarker system for transvaginal ultrasonography.A bodymarker system which utilizes an electromagnetic field to specify the probe position was developed. Software was written which enabled the positional information of the probe and the ultrasound image to be simultaneously displayed on a personal computer. The bodymarker was displayed as a three-dimensional graphic model. The differences between the estimated and the actual position--i.e. the error--for both position (x, y and z) and angles (azimuth, elevation and roll) of the probe were measured. The movement of the probe was then evaluated in healthy female volunteers and the comparative time required for ultrasound examination was determined.Both the position and the angles of the probe were accurately shown in the computer display. The errors were 1.0 mm and 0.7 degrees (median) for position and angle, respectively. The system was also shown to work well in healthy female volunteers. Calibration of the new system required only 5.0 seconds, compared with an average of 7.6 seconds for the conventional bodymarker.The newly developed three-dimensional automatic transvaginal bodymarker system provides an accurate indication of probe position and its tilting angle. It works well in healthy female volunteers and speeds up the examination time. It may be clinically useful for transvaginal ultrasound examination.
