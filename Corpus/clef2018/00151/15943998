Non-puerperal uterine inversion associated with endometrial carcinoma--a case report. Non-puerperal uterine inversion is rare, and a case associated with endometrial carcinoma is even rarer. It is difficult to diagnose the condition preoperatively and most cases are diagnosed at surgery.We describe a case of uterine inversion associated with endometrial carcinoma. Initially, the patient was thought to have a cervical adenocarcinoma and treated with chemotherapy however, a diagnosis of uterine inversion was made with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography during pre-surgical chemotherapy. We performed total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.MRI and ultrasonography can be extremely useful tools for diagnosing uterine inversion.
