Applications of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecological surgery. Gynecologists are well trained in office-based ultrasound, but are less experienced in the field of intraoperative ultrasound. Many gynecologic procedures may benefit from the use of real-time ultrasonography. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current use of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecologic procedures.Evaluation and assessment of the value of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecological procedures is essentially non-existent. The role of intraoperative ultrasound in gynecology is in its infancy, with anecdotal experience and literature involving predominantly case reports. Intraoperative ultrasound is helpful in laparoscopic myomectomy, particularly when the uterine contour is normal. It is also useful in defining pelvic anatomy in cases of complex reproductive procedures. Intraoperative ultrasound improves precision in characterizing ovarian lesions, particularly in the setting of endometriomas or dermoid cysts. It has been shown to decrease both operative time and complication rates in dilation and curettage procedures. Intraoperative ultrasound reduces recurrence and re-operation rates after hysteroscopy by facilitating more-complete resection of uterine myomas. Ultrasound guidance improves the efficiency of embryo transfer in in-vitro fertilization and could potentially be beneficial in other 'blind' gynecological procedures.Intraoperative ultrasound appears to be a safe and valuable tool for the gynecologic surgeon. Ultrasound improves visualization of anatomy, reduces complication and re-operation rates, and facilitates completion of more cases via less-invasive endoscopic approaches.
