Leiomyoma of the urinary bladder floor: diagnosis by transvaginal ultrasound. We studied a case of leiomyoma of the bladder floor in a woman with excretion urography, voiding cystourethrography, abdominal echography, computed tomography scan, and transvaginal echography. This last technique gave us the most accurate information about localization of the mass and its relation to adjacent organs. With these data we were able to indicate the most suitable surgical access. We think that this new application of the transvaginal echography should be included in the study of bladder flow masses in the female.
