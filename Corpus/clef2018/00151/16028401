Measurement of endometrial volume and endometrial thickness for assessment of endometrial receptivity in assisted reproductive techniques. The authors investigated the role of 3D endometrial volume measurements as a predictor of clinical pregnancy in ART and comparison between endometrial volume and endometrial thickness in order to find the better predictor for endometrial receptivity in ART. Endometrial volume emerged recently as a new efficient predictor of endometrial response to hormonal stimulation and successful implantation. In this clinical study, participated 58 infertile patients undergoing IVF-treatment, during the period from 01.01.2004 till 01.01.2005. Endometrial volume of < 2 ml on the day of Embryotransfer (ET) was a better predictor for low endometrial receptivity, than Endometrial thickness on the same day and resulted in significant lower IVF clinical pregnancy and implantation rates. Endometrial volume > 2 ml on the day of ET was a positive predictor for ART outcome.
