Papillary adenofibroma of the cervix: a case report. Adenofibroma is an extremely rare benign biphasic neoplasm that is classified into the mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumor group. It typically affects the endometrium, but may occur in the cervix or in an extrauterine location. Preoperative diagnosis of this tumor is usually difficult. We describe the case of a 55-year-old woman with papillary cervical adenofibroma, which appeared as a cervical mass containing multiple cystic components on transvaginal ultrasound. This lesion appears to be clinically and histologically benign but must be differentiated from malignant lesions of the uterus, particularly from adenosarcoma, which can be suggestive of adenofibroma. Accurate diagnosis of these benign tumors permits appropriate counseling of patients.
