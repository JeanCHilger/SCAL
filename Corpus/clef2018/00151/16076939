Absence of polycystic ovary syndrome features in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women despite significant hyperinsulinemia and truncal adiposity. HIV-infected women increasingly demonstrate insulin resistance and fat redistribution characterized by relative truncal adiposity. It is unknown whether insulin resistance and truncal adiposity are associated with features of the polycystic ovary syndrome in this population.The objective of the study was to characterize ovarian morphology and reproductive indices in a large cohort of HIV-infected women in comparison with healthy age- and body mass index-matched control subjects.The study was conducted at an academic medical center.Eighty-eight HIV-infected women were compared with 94 age- and body mass index-matched healthy control subjects.Androgen, SHBG, and gonadotropin levels and ovarian morphology were measured.HIV-infected subjects demonstrated increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (101 +/- 6 vs. 71 +/- 5 cm2 P < 0.0001), increased VAT to s.c. adipose tissue ratio, and a trend toward decreased abdominal s.c. adipose tissue. Fasting insulin (12 +/- 1 vs. 6 +/- 1 microIU/mlThese data demonstrate that among HIV-infected subjects with severe abdominal fat accumulation and hyperinsulinemia, common features of polycystic ovary syndrome are not seen.
