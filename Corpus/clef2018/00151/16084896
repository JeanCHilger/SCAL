Three dimensional/four dimensional ultrasound-guided embryo transfer using the maximal implantation potential point. To evaluate the use of maximal implantation potential (MIP) point in conjunction with a 3D/4D ultrasound in order to facilitate embryo transfers and potentially improve pregnancy rate.Retrospective, observational study.IVF Center.Between October 1, 2002, and August 27, 2004, 1,222 patients who underwent 3D/4D-ultrasound guided embryo transfers.Ultrasound-guided embryo transfer using a 3D/4D ultrasound machine and the MIP point.Procedure feasibility with improved visibility.Embryo transfers were performed at the MIP point and the pregnancy rate was 36.66% (average patient age, 37.6 years). Physicians reported improved visualization and a greater accuracy in the placement of embryos within the uterine cavity.The MIP point can be immediately identified and individualized for each patient. Embryo transfers at the MIP were associated with good implantation and pregnancy rates.
