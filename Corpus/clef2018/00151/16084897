Confirmation of Essure microinsert tubal coil placement with conventional and volume-contrast imaging three-dimensional ultrasound. To determine the accuracy of ultrasound in the assessment of proximal fallopian tube positioning of the Essure microinsert coil 3 months after postprocedure.Prospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Reproductive-age women in a tertiary care hospital.Reproductive-age women presenting with a request for permanent contraception.Hysteroscopic sterilization with the Essure microinsert coil and conventional or volume-contrast three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging 3 months after the procedure.Coil position on ultrasound.Forty-eight of the 50 patients had successful placement of the Essure coils, and three patients required a second attempt on one tube. Conventional or volume-contrast (3D) ultrasound showed proper positioning of the coils within the proximal fallopian tube in 42 women (84%) five women (10%) required hysterosalpingogram to show appropriate positioning. Two patients (4%) required laparoscopic tubal sterilization, and one patient (2%) was lost to follow-up.Transvaginal ultrasound is an acceptable method of confirming proper placement of the Essure microinsert coil within the proximal fallopian tube 3 months after the procedure.
