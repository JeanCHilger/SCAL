The value of ultrasound in diagnosis of male infertility. The number of male patients with clinical presentation of infertility, especially secondary infertility after infections, is increasing every day. Contemporary urological standards in defining male infertility include ultrasound examination. Ultrasound examination of the scrotum using color doppler is of great importance.Testicular atrophy, microlithiasis and varicocele are the most common causes of male infertility. Microlithiasis and classical testicular microlithiasis are not directly associated with infertility. Gray scale sonography is used in evaluation of the dilatation of the testicular veins, but color Doppler made a real contribution in revealing subclinical varicocele. Transrectal ultrasound is used in a number of pathological conditions of prostate, seminal vesicles and ducts. In cases of obstructive azoospermia it is important to find out the cause, such as focal prostatitis, cysts, ejaculatory ducts obstruction or absence of vas deferens.Ulltrasound is a noninvasive method easy to perform, which provides information without postexamination consequences such as strictures or obstructions, which are possible after invasive deferentography. Ultrasound guided biopsy, provides a new minimally invasive diagnostic tool in current urology.
