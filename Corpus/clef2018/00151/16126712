Restoration of ovarian function after orthotopic (intraovarian and periovarian) transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue in a woman treated by bone marrow transplantation for sickle cell anaemia: case report. Ovarian function after orthotopic transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue has been restored in women with malignant disease. Here the techniques are adapted for a non-cancer patient. In 1999, right oophorectomy was performed in a 21 year old woman before chemotherapy, prior to bone marrow transplantation. Ovarian cortex was frozen, according to a strict protocol. After thawing, ovarian cortex was reimplanted into the ovary and in a peritoneal window close to the ovary in 2004. Four-and-a-half months after reimplantation, LH, FSH, 17beta-estradiol and progesterone levels, as well as ultrasonography, demonstrated the presence of an ovulatory cycle. After this cycle, the patient experienced two other ovulatory cycles, evidenced by FSH and 17beta-estradiol concentrations, as well as ultrasound demonstration of a follicle. Follicular development was clearly observed in both the intraovarian site (1st and 2nd cycle) and the peritoneal window (3rd cycle). Restoration of endocrine ovarian function occurred after ovarian cortical strips, biopsied and cryopreserved before chemotherapy, were reimplanted into the ovary itself and a periovarian peritoneal window.
