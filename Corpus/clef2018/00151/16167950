Hormonal and sonographic assessment of ovarian reserve before and after laparoscopic ovarian drilling in polycystic ovary syndrome. This prospective observational study aimed to assess ovarian reserve after three different methods for induction of ovulation in 60 women between 30 and 40 years old with polycystic ovary syndrome. Women were equally divided into three groups. Group I included women who responded to clomiphene citrate. Women enrolled in groups II and III were subjected to either unilateral or bilateral ovarian drilling, respectively. Ovarian reserve testing was performed once before and three months after treatment. Basal serum inhibin B level showed a significant decrease after bilateral drilling compared with predrilling level (53.8 +/- 13.5 vs 46.3 +/- 6.2 pg/mL P= 0.031). The antral follicle counts and summed ovarian volume showed a significant decrease after bilateral drilling (16.5 +/- 1.3 vs 14.9 +/- 2.1
