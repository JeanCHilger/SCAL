Massive edema of the ovary: a case report and review of the pertinent literature. Massive edema of the ovary is a rare entity affecting mainly young women. It is often misdiagnosed for a malignancy, posing the young patient at risk for over-treatment with resultant loss of hormonal function and fertility.A 13-year-old premenarchal girl presented with a large solid pelvic mass after recurrent episodes of self-limited abdominal pain. With a working diagnosis of malignant ovarian tumor, an exploratory laparotomy was done in which a twisted ovarian mass was found and excised completely. Pathological examination of the mass revealed massive edema of the ovary with hemorrhagic necrosis.After extensive review of the literature, it seems most cases were over-treated, as was ours. This entity should be suspected in women at the fertile age range with solid enlargement of the ovary and definite treatment should be undertaken only after confirmed pathological diagnosis. Conservative treatment is feasible and should be the rule in these cases, where fertility preservation is mandatory.
