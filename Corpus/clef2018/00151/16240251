Topographical anatomy of the female pelvis in ultrasound. Achieving a high quality gynaecological ultrasound examination requires thorough knowledge of topographic anatomy. To date, there are no guidelines for a standardised course of the examination. The goal of the study was to define exact planes by means of cross-sectional anatomy and then to standardise the gynaecological ultrasound examination with the transabdominal, introital and transvaginal technique.We developed a software tool based on IDL (Interactive Data Language) for the female data set of the Visible Human Project which generates free determinable planes in the volume. The organs of the female pelvis were divided into landmark- and target structures according to the ultrasonic visibility and the variability of the position, shape and structure. From this, a course for the gynaecological ultrasound examination was created and verified on 65 patients each with an inconspicuous ultrasound finding. In addition, the average duration of the examination was determined.The landmark structures could be demonstrated in all patients. Five planes were defined for each technique, and the course of the whole examination with 15 exact planes was described. The average duration of the examination was 4.5 minutes.As of now, the digitally reconstructed anatomical illustrations have achieved the best image resolution and quality regardless of the position of the plane in the examination volume. The standardised course of the gynaecological ultrasound examination can serve as a basis for the improvement of training quality and the evaluation of a general gynaecological ultrasound screening.
