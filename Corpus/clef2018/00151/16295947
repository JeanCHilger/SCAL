Primary intramural fibroma of the left ventricle with a late apparent symptomatology. We report a case of a 13-year-old girl who was admitted to the emergency department with syncope. She had been diagnosed in infancy with a large intramural fibroma of the left ventricle, but had been free of any clinical symptoms during the last decade. The patient underwent a thorough and detailed clinical and imaging study. We discuss the contribution of new non-invasive imaging modalities to the diagnosis of primary cardiac tumours and focus on the dilemmas of the paediatrician concerning the management of cardiac fibromas.
