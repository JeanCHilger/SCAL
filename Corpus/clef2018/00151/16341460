The retroverted uterus: ignored to date but core to prolapse. The retroverted uterus has been largely ignored in urogynaecological research to date. The prevalence of the retroverted uterus is 79% more common in the urogynaecological patient population (34%) than in the general gynaecological population (19%). Its diagnosis requires the use of (a) transvaginal ultrasound with (b) an empty bladder. Recent data demonstrate that the prevalence of grade 2-4 uterine prolapse for a retroverted uterus is 4.5 times that for an anteverted uterus. Alternatively, 69% grade 2-4 uterine prolapse involves the retroverted uterus. The retroverted uterus, when diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound (bladder empty), is far more common in urogynecology patients due to their higher incidence of prolapse.
