A rare aetiology of the post-partum fever: ovarian vein thrombophlebitis. To clarify the contribution of the doppler and the CT in the balance aetiology of a fever of the post-partum and to connect it with a thrombophlebitis of ovarian vein.Five patients presented there post-partum a fever with pointed abdominal painful syndrome. A doppler and a CT were performed.Doppler showed a hypoechoic tubular structure located forward and laterally with regard to the psoas with a flat spectre in pulsed Doppler in every case. CT confirmed the diagnosis of a thrombophlebitis of the right ovarian vein in three cases and left in two cases. Evolution after anticoagulation and an antibiotic therapy was favourable with regression of clinical signs and doppler evaluation.In front of any fever of the post-partum, it is necessary to evoke a thrombophlebitis of the vein ovarian, although it is about a rare aetiology. In spite of the superiority of the CT-scan and RP imaging for such a diagnosis, doppler is a simple and reproducible diagnostic tool for the monitoring which must be practised in first intention.
