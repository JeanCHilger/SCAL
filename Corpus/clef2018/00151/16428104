Paediatric Intra-abdominal Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumour. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is a rare solid tumour mimicking malignancy with locally aggressive growth and recurrence even after complete resection. We report the case of a 10-year-old girl with an intra-abdominal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. This clinical and pathological entity should be differentiated from other malignant sarcomatous lesions when encountered intraoperatively. It is almost impossible to differentiate inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour from other malignancies preoperatively the diagnosis is often confirmed by careful microscopic examination or immunohistochemical markers after surgical resection. Total excision of the tumour with life-time follow-up is needed because of the risk of recurrence.
