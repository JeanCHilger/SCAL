Asymptomatic struma ovarii: a case report. Struma ovarii is a rare ovarian neoplasm. This tumor is generally benign, although malignant transformation has been reported. The preoperative diagnosis is generally difficult. Thyroid hormones may be produced and in a few cases asymptomatic women may develop definitive clinical hypothyroidism after resection of struma ovarii. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic resection of an asymptomatic right ovarian mass. The pathologic diagnosis was struma ovarii. The postoperative period was uneventful and her thyroid function remained normal.
