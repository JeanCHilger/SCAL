Anastrozole versus tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer and tamoxifen-induced endometrial pathology. To investigate the effect of switching from adjuvant tamoxifen to anastrozole (Arimidex) treatment in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer and histologically proven tamoxifen-induced benign endometrial pathology.Two hundred twenty-six postmenopausal women who had received adjuvant tamoxifen 20 mg/d (> or =12 months, < or =48 months) and developed abnormal vaginal bleeding and/or an asymptomatic endometrial thickness >10 mm [measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)] were subjected to hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage (D&C). Thereafter, 171 patients were randomized in a phase III study to continue tamoxifen treatment (n = 88) or switch to anastrozole 1 mg/d (n = 83). Patients were monitored for < or =42 months using TVUS at 6-monthly intervals.At study entry, there were no significant differences in vaginal bleeding, endometrial thickness, and histologic findings between the two treatment groups. Throughout the treatment period, there was no significant difference in recurrent vaginal bleeding between groups [anastrozole, 4 of 83 (4.8%) tamoxifen, 9 of 88 (10.2%)Switching from tamoxifen to anastrozole treatment significantly reduced the need for a second hysteroscopy and D&C due to recurrent vaginal bleeding or thickening of the endometrium in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with tamoxifen-induced endometrial abnormalities.
