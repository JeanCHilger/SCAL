Endometrial thickness in Japanese women with hypertension or/and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was: (a) to examine whether the endometrium of postmenopausal women with hypertension (HT) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) was thicker than that of healthy controls (HC) and (b) whether endometrial thickness (ET) was associated with endometrial cancer risk factors.A total of 242 postmenopausal women were included in this study. Thirty women with type 2 DM, 49 women with HT, 23 women with DM and HT and 140 HCs were studied. Clinical evaluation of all women was done using TVS and endometrial cytology.In the 140 HCs, the mean ET of nulliparous women was larger than multiparous women (3.0 mm versus 1.6 mm, p = 0.017). However, there was no significant relationship between ET and other clinical parameters such as a history of sterility or BMI. There was no significant difference in ET amongst the four groups. The relationship between ET, age, pregnancy history, menopause age, BMI and presence of DM or HT were analyzed using stepwise multivariate analysis. There was no significant relationship between these risk factors and ET (p = 0.063).The risk factors such as age, pregnancy history, menopause age, BMI and presence of DM or HT were not related to ET in Japanese women.
