Clinical significance of cystoscopy in transrectal prostate biopsy. The clinical significance of cystoscopy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer remains open to discussion. We have always performed cystoscopy with prostate biopsy and have discovered bladder cancer in some patients. The present study investigated the clinical significance of performing cystoscopy with prostate biopsy. Subjects were 458 patients who underwent cystoscopy and ultrasound-guided transrectal prostate biopsy from January 1998 to December 2004. Mean age of subjects was 71.3 years (range, 52-93 years). Prostate biopsy was performed modified Eskews systematic 5-region prostate biopsy (12 core). Some abnormalities were found in 43 of the 458 patients (9.3%). Among these 43 patients, bladder cancer was found in 11 patients (2.4%), and transurethral resection bladder tumor (TUR-Bt) was performed on all 11 patients. Pathological staging of bladder cancer was pT1 and G2 in all cases. Bladder stones were seen in 13 patients (2.8%), benign bladder tumor in 5 patients (1.1%), urethral polyp in 7 patients (1.5%), urethral stenosis in 6 patients (1.3%) and ureteral stones associated with ureterocele in 1 patient (0.2%). Appropriate examinations and treatments were performed for all cases. Cystoscopy may be needed at the time of prostate biopsy because: the above-mentioned abnormalities were first discovered on cystoscopy and the frequency of bladder cancer was 2.4% for the total patient population, and endoscopic surgery was performed.
