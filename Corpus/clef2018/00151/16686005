A hybrid cutting approach for hysteroscopy simulation. An integral element of every surgical simulator is the ability to interactively cut tissue. A number of approaches have been suggested in the past, the most important being mesh subdivision by introducing new elements and mesh adaptation by adjusting existing topology. In this paper we combine these two methods and optimize them for our training system of hysteroscopic interventions. The basic methodology is introduced in 2D, a first extension to 3D is presented and finally the integration into the simulator described.
