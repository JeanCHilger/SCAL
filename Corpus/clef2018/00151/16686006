Hydrometra simulation for VR-based hysteroscopy training. During hysteroscopy a hydrometra is maintained, i.e. the uterus is distended with liquid media to access and visualize the uterine cavity. The pressure and flow induced by the liquid are crucial tools for he gynecologists during surgery to obtain a clear view of the operation site. This paper presents two different aspects of hydrometra simulation, namely the distension of the uterine muscle and the liquid flow simulation in the cavity. The deformation of the organ's shape is computed offline based on finite element calculations whereas the flow is approximated on the fly by solving the simplified Navier-Stokes equations. The real-time capabilities of the presented algorithms as well as the level of fidelity achieved by the proposed methods are discussed.
