Prevalence of testicular microlithiasis in an asymptomatic population. Testicular microlithiasis is a rare, usually asymptomatic, finding of the testes associated with various genetic anomalies and infertility. It is also widely believed that testicular microlithiasis is strongly associated with testicular tumor. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the true prevalence of testicular microlithiasis in an asymptomatic population by means of ultrasound screening.Healthy male volunteers (17-42 years old) were recruited from the annual Army Reserve Officer Training Corps training camp at Manisa, Turkey. A screening genitourinary history was obtained and a physical examination and screening scrotal ultrasound scan were performed.All men diagnosed with testicular microlithiasis underwent complete clinical evaluations, physical examinations and determination of tumor markers. Fifty-three men with testicular microlithiasis were identified from the 2179 ultrasound scans, giving a prevalence of testicular microlithiasis of 2.4% in this asymptomatic population. The age (mean+/-SD) of subjects with testicular microlithiasis was 23.9+/-4.2 years (range 20-31 years).Our results suggest that there is no significant association between TM and testicular cancer, although it is difficult to rule out such an association without further studies with a longer follow-up period.
