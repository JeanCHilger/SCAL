Features of morphometry of ultrasound and endometrial histology in the anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome women. To investigate the relationship between ultrasonographic features of endometrium and the relation of histological staging of the endometrium and sexual hormone levels in anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women.Seventy-six anovulatory PCOS patients and 32 women with normal ovulation were enrolled in this study. Ultrasonographic examination, and transmission electron microscope were used to observe endometrium. The expressions of nulear antigen associated with cell proliferation Ki-67 and calcitonin were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The sexual hormone levels were measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay.In 11 patients the endometrium showed secretory change out of 76 anovulatory PCOS patients. The frequency of secretory change of the endometrium was not increased with the increase of menses-biopsy interval (P > 0.05). The frequency of abnormal stroma was significantly lower in tripleline endometria than those in non-tripleline endometria (9% vs 43%, P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the anovulatory PCOS group showed a significant higher expression of Ki-67 in the glandular cell of the secretory phase endometrium (P < 0.05). In the proliferative endometrium, anovulatory PCOS group had more cell organelles than those of the control group. The endometrium showed insufficient secretory changes in the anovulatory PCOS patients.Proliferative and secretory stage of the endometrium in the anovulatory PCOS group show abnormal features. The abnormal stroma may contribute to the hyperechonic images of the endometrium in the anovulatory PCOS patients.
