Ovarian and uterine ultrasonography in healthy girls between birth to 18 years. The aim of our study was to determine the pattern of female reproductive organ growth in Indian girls from birth to 18 years of age and to correlate the uterine length, mean ovarian volume (MOV) and Fundo Cervical Ratio (FCR) with chronological age, bone age and pubertal breast staging. A cross sectional study was performed on 218 girls from birth to 18 years of age. Height, weight, stage of puberty, X-ray for bone age and transabdominal ultrasounds were performed on all girls. Higher chronological age, bone age and increase in breast stage significantly predicted higher MOV (P < 0.001) and higher uterine length (P < 0.001). The MOV, uterine length and FCR are positively correlated with chronological age, bone age, height, weight and breast staging. Data from present study may be useful in screening cases of precocious puberty and other disorders that may need further evaluation.
