Inversion mode display of 3D sonography: applications in obstetric and gynecologic imaging. Three-dimensional sonography involves volume acquisitions of sonographic data that can be displayed in a variety of ways, including surface rendering and multiplanar reconstruction. A new method of displaying sonographic volumes is called the inversion mode, which displays the cystic portions within the entire volume as echogenic areas. The gray-scale portion of the image becomes transparent, and the cystic areas become brightly visible in three dimensions.This article shows the applications for this method of volume sonography display and shows the importance of being able to visualize all of the cystic areas concurrently within a volume.
