Three-dimensional sonography of the endometrium and adjacent myometrium: preliminary observations. By evaluating a series of patients undergoing pelvic sonography with routine 2-dimensional (2D) as well as 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images in the coronal plane, we attempted to characterize the types of additional information that can be obtained.Ninety randomly selected patients undergoing transvaginal pelvic sonography were imaged according to a standard 2D protocol. A 3D uterine volume was then acquired in the sagittal plane and reconstructed in the coronal plane. The endometrium and surrounding myometrium were evaluated for architecture, masses, the relationship of masses to the endometrial cavity, and the anatomic configuration of the cavity.Ninety-one studies were obtained. Additional findings were obtained on the coronal view in 28 studies (30.8%). No additional findings were obtained in 63 studies (69.2%). Normal endometrial and myometrial findings were obtained by conventional 2D imaging in 42 of 91 patients. Of this group, additional findings were shown in 2 (5%) patients. Forty-nine of the 91 patients had abnormal findings by 2D imaging. Additional information was obtained in 26 (53%) of these patients. Added information included uterine anomalies, better definition of the endometrium, more accurate delineation and location of endometrial polyps, location of leiomyomas, visualization of cystic areas within the myometrium, and confirmation of the location of intrauterine devices.The 3D reconstructed view of the endometrium and adjacent myometrium appears to be most helpful after a conventional transvaginal study, showing abnormalities within the endometrium and myometrium but being of little added benefit if the conventional findings are normal.
