Right ventricular metastasis of uterine squamous cell carcinoma. This imaging case report demonstrates abnormal right ventricular masses of primarily unknown origin. The woman was admitted because of right heart failure symptoms. Echocardiography showed the masses exclusively related to the right ventricular endomyocardium and extending through the entire length and breadth of the ventricle. Systolic function was normal without evidence of outflow tract obstruction. The patient died in 3 days because of multisystem failure. Autopsy findings confirmed metastasis on the right ventricle and histopathology demonstrated the infrequent finding of metastasis from uterine squamous cell carcinoma, which had been operated on 5 years before.
