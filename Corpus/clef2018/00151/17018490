Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on a uterine arteriovenous malformation. The effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) on uterine arteriovenous malformations (AVM) is not well known.A 37-year-old woman with a previous cesarean was diagnosed as having a uterine AVM after a spontaneous abortion with massive vaginal bleeding. The AVM decreased in size from 5.1 x 3.8 cm to 1.4 x 1.0 cm after 6 months of therapy with a GnRHa. Uterine artery embolization conducted after the GnRH therapy resulted in complete disappearance of the AVM. The patient's menstrual cycles and ovulation resumed 3 months after uterine artery embolization.Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy reduced the size of the uterine AVM. Thus, GnRHa therapy may be useful for uterine AVM in situations where uterine artery embolization must be postponed.
