Laparoscopy or laparotomy in the treatment of ovarian teratomas?. Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cyst), are the most common germ cell tumours of the ovary in women of reproductive age. They are usually asymptomatic until they reach considerable size. Frequently, ultrasonography is diagnostic.81 patients who had surgery in 3rd Departament of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Medicine, Lódź, from 2000 to 2005 for benign cystic teratomas were analyzed.86 teratomas were removed from 81 patients. 31 patients had surgery via laparoscopy and 50 via laparotomy. The mean age was found to be 34,5 years. 39 patients were asymptomatic. The tumours diameter ranged from 1 to 19 cm. In 46 cases there were cystectomies performed sparing fragments of healthy ovarian tissue, in 24 cases ovariectomies and in 11 panhysterectomies were made. All removed lesions histologically appeared benign cystis ovarian teratomas without any signs of malignancy.The teratomas are composed of mature tissues derived from the three germ cell layers. In our study histologic examination revealed 16 cases of neurogenic tissue. One of the possibility of ovarian teratoma's treatment is operative laparoscopy. When the laparoscopy is not possible or inadvisable, the laparotomy is still irreplaceable.
