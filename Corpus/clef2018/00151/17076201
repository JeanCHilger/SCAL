The influence of ovarian tumour histopathological diagnosis on prognostic values of the sonomorphological index. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the helpfulness of sonomorphological index in preoperative diagnosis of ovarian tumours.686 patients diagnosed and treated because of adnexal tumours were analyzed. At the admission day the patient underwent an ultrasonographical examination that stated morphology of tumour using the sonomorphological index (SM).The sonomorphological index demonstrated high prognostic values: accuracy - 80.6% sensivity - 86.7%In all histopathological types of malignant and benign tumours mentioned above, the use of the sonomorphological index require caution. To increase accuracy of preoperative diagnosis based on ultrasonographical examination, additional Doppler examination and also biochemical markers concentration should be considered.
