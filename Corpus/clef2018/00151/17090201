Fetiform teratoma (homunculus). Fetiform teratoma (homunculus) is a term that has been given to a rare form of ovarian teratoma that resembles a malformed fetus. There are very few reported cases of this entity in the English language literature. In this report, we document a case of fetiform teratoma in a 23-year-old woman, gravida 0, who initially presented with a chief complaint of dyspareunia. The clinical and pathologic aspects of this rare entity are presented here, with a review of the English literature. Differentiating fetiform teratoma from the more highly developed fetus-in-fetu and ectopic pregnancy is also discussed.
