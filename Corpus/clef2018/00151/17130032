Saline sonohysterosalpingographic findings in infertile Nigerian women. This paper describes the findings in the first 100 women who underwent saline sonohysterosalpingography (SHG) at two privately owned health facilities in Enugu, South East Nigeria. This was a prospective study of the first 100 consecutive women presenting with infertility to the authors at Mbanefo Hospital and Hansa Clinics, both in Enugu, South-East geopolitical zone of Nigeria from 1 May 2005 to 20 January 2006. Saline sonohysterosalpingography was carried out in the standard way in these women. The findings were analysed using simple percentages and means +/- SD. The procedure was completed in 98 women, while in two others it was not possible to cannulate the uterine cavity. A total of 61 of the women had normal uterine musculature, 37 had interstitial fibroids and two had sonographic features of adenomyosis. Regarding the endometrial cavity, 93 women had a normal endometrium, four had a submucosal fibroid, one had intrauterine adhesions, while the endometrial cavity could not be assessed in two women who could not be cannulated. No case of submucosal polyp or uterine septa or other congenital uterine anomalies was seen. As assessed sonologically, 77 of the study subjects had bilateral patent tubes, while five had unilateral tubal patency. In one woman, there was uncertainty about tubal patency or blockage in two women, the tubes could not be assessed because of non-cannulation of the uterine cavity and in 15 women, both tubes were blocked. A total of 74 women had normal ovaries
