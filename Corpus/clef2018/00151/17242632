Raloxifene improves the ovariectomy-induced impairment in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. To examine the effect of raloxifene on the endothelial dysfunction caused by surgical menopause.Ten premenopausal women who underwent gynecological surgery with ovariectomy were divided into two groups. Five participants used raloxifene (60 mg/d) for 7 days staring 1 week after the surgery, and the other five participants did not use raloxifene. We examined the changes in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery using ultrasonography. Vasodilation in response to nitroglycerin was also studied. We also measured the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity to examine the change in arterial stiffness in these participants before and after surgical menopause.In both the raloxifene and control groups, a significant decrease in FMD was observed 1 week after the surgery. Although no further changes in FMD were observed in the control group at 2 weeks after surgery, FMD was significantly increased in the raloxifene group. No remarkable changes in nitroglycerin or brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were observed after surgery in either group.Raloxifene rapidly restored FMD that was impaired after surgical menopause. Therefore, raloxifene may be effective for ameliorating and maintaining endothelial function in premenopausal women who undergo ovariectomy.
