Uncomplicated full term pregnancy after da Vinci-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy. Laparoscopic surgery with the assistance of the da Vinci robotic system has been recently introduced in gynaecology, as this new technology provides three-dimensional vision and easier suture capability. This study reports, for the first time, the case of an uncomplicated full term pregnancy after laparoscopic myomectomy with the assistance of the da Vinci robotic system. The patient was a 35-year-old woman presenting with secondary infertility and a single 3 cm, predominantly intramural, fundal myoma. Following surgery, she conceived with minimal intervention therapy and delivered a healthy term infant by Caesarean section. The successful outcome suggests that this advancement can restore reproductive capacity with improved suturing capability of the uterine wall. More studies are needed to establish indications and outcome of the technique according to the number, size and location of fibroids.
