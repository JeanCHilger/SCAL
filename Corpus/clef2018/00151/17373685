Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiographic features of fetal cardiac tumor. We present a case of fetal cardiac tumors diagnosed using conventional 2-dimensional (2D) fetal echocardiography and real-time 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography. Conventional 2D echocardiography revealed multiple cardiac tumors involving the right atrium, interventricular septum, and right and left ventricles. Real-time 3D echocardiography with instantaneous volume rendering showed the cardiac tumors in motion. The advantages and disadvantages of real-time 3D fetal echocardiography are discussed.
