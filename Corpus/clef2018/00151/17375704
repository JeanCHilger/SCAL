Evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding by transvaginal 3-D hysterosonography and diagnostic hysteroscopy. To compare 3-D hysterosonography (3-DHS) and diagnostic hysteroscopy in women with abnormal uterine bleeding.Of 248 women with abnormal uterine bleeding who were referred to our department, 3-D hysterosonography and hysteroscopy were performed in 242 women and the results were estimated. In six women 3-DHS could not performed because of cervical stenosis. Sensitivity and specificity of 3-DHS compared to those of hysteroscopy.From the 242 women who underwent examination, we found 30 patients with polyps, 22 with myomas, four with mullerian anomalies, ten with endometrial cancer, 12 with adhesions and 165 with a normal uterine cavity. There was agreement between the two methods in 28 cases of polyps, 22 cases of myomas, four cases of mullerian anomalies, ten cases of endometrial cancer, eight cases of adhesions and in 165 cases of normal endometrium. The sensitivity and specificity of 3D hysterosonography was 93.5% and 99.4%, respectively, with a positive prognostic value (PPV) of 98.6% and a negative prognostic value (NPV) of 97%. The sensitivity and specificity of hysteroscopy was 98.7% and 99.4%, respectively, with a PPV of 98.7% and a NPV of 99.4%.Three-D hysterosonography accurately assessed intrauterine pathology.
