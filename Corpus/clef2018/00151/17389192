Successful treatment of uterine arteriovenous malformation with percutaneous embolization. Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare condition and can be life-threatening if not managed properly. We report a case that was diagnosed by typical ultrasound imaging and treated successfully with uterine arterial embolization.A 28-year-old female, gravida 4, para 3, abortus 1, presented with massive vaginal bleeding 19 days after a termination of pregnancy due to fetal anomaly. After a dilatation and curettage 3 years previously, typical ultrasound image findings and a declining pattern of serum beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin), acquired AVM was highly suspected. The patient underwent bilateral uterine arterial embolization. Four weeks later, there was nearly complete resolution of the AVM and the patient's menstrual cycle was restored 6 weeks after embolization.AVM can be diagnosed at an early stage with the aid of history taking and ultrasound. Percutaneous embolotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for AVM, especially when fertility preservation is desired.
