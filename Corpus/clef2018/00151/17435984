Imaging features of postpartum uterine rupture: a case report. We present a case report on a postpartum uterine rupture with the history of a previous cesarean section. During the diagnosis of rupture, ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging of the uterus were obtained. Ultrasound examination did not result in substantial information. CT and magnetic resonance imaging established the correct diagnosis. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, and the diagnosis was confirmed. Diagnostic qualifications of these three instruments were compared.
