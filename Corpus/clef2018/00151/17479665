Robotic surgery in gynecology. Robotic technology is nothing more than an enhancement along the continuum of laparoscopic technological advances and represents only the beginning of numerous more forthcoming advances. It constitutes a major improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, ease, and comfort associated with the performance of laparoscopic operations. Instrument articulation, downscaling of movements, absence of tremor, 3-D image, and comfort for the surgeon, assistant and scrub nurse are all new to the practice of laparoscopy. In our hands, robotic operative times for simple and radical hysterectomy are shorter than those obtained by conventional laparoscopy. Robotic technology is preferable to conventional laparoscopic instrumentation for the surgical treatment of gynecologic malignancies and most operations for benign disease of certain complexity such as hysterectomy myomectomy, and invasive pelvic endometriosis.
