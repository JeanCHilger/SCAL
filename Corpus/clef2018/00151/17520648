Surgical techniques: robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with the da Vinci surgical system. Advanced gynecologic pathology and the surgical limitations of conventional laparoscopy have often been cited as impediments to converting hysterectomy from a procedure predominantly performed by laparotomy to one accomplished by laparoscopy. Recently, the use of robotic technology as a means to facilitate the laparoscopic completion of a hysterectomy was introduced.Application of robotic-assistance with the da Vinci surgical system to complete a laparoscopic hysterectomy.Advantages to this approach have been the improved dexterity and precision of the instruments coupled with three-dimensional imaging. Published preliminary data have shown feasibility and safety to this approach.The following paper demonstrates a safe and efficient surgical technique for completing a robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with the da Vinci Surgical System.
