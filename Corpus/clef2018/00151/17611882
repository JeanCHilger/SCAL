Magnetic resonance findings of clear-cell adenocarcinofibroma of the ovary. We report the magnetic resonance (MR) findings of clear-cell adenocarcinofibroma of the ovary. A huge multilocular cystic tumor with solid components was seen in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavity. Thickened cyst wall had low intensity on T2-weighted images, which suggested abundant fibrous tissue. Its mural nodules were strongly enhanced on contrast enhancement, which reflected malignant epithelial growth. Adenocarcinofibroma of the ovary is a rare tumor, but MR findings may be helpful to reach the correct diagnosis.
