Incidental findings in the maxillofacial area with 3-dimensional cone-beam imaging. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the location, nature, and occurrence of incidental findings in maxillofacial structures on 3-dimensional cone-beam volumetric scans done for dental diagnostic purposes and to look for associations between these findings and symptoms in orthodontic patients.Images from 500 consecutive maxillofacial 3-dimensional scans were examined. The patient sample consisted of 252 orthodontic patients, 172 implant patients, 33 endodontic patients, 34 temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder patients, and 10 others.The overall rate of incidental findings was 24.6% (123 patients of 500). The highest rate of incidental findings was in the airway area (18.2%), followed by TMJ findings (3.4%), endodontic findings (1.8%), and others (1.2%). In the orthodontic group, the incidences were airway findings, 21.4% TMJ findings, 5.6%For clinical diagnosis, the data should be interpreted with a full history of clinical signs and symptoms, and with detailed communications with radiological colleagues and other specialists to comprehensively evaluate possible underlying diseases.
