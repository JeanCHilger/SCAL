Pseudotumour in the bladder as a complication of total hip replacement: ultrasonography, CT and MR findings. We report a pseudotumour in the urinary bladder following total hip replacement with review of the literature. Pseudotumour in the urinary bladder as a late complication of total hip replacement is an extremely rare condition. In this case, cross-sectional imaging modalities including sonography, CT and MR showed a hypervascular polypoid mass in the urinary bladder and adjacent wall thickening with a band connecting between the mass and the acetabulum. Histopathological diagnosis confirmed acute and chronic inflammation with calcification.
