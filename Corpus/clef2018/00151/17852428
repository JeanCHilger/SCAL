Anti-Müllerian hormone levels and antral follicle count in women enrolled in in vitro fertilization cycles: relationship to lifestyle factors, chronological age and reproductive history. The aims of this prospective study were to investigate the relationship between anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC), and to determine whether these markers of ovarian reserve correlate with lifestyle factors, ethnicity, chronological age and reproductive history. Participants were 136 normo-ovulatory women undergoing infertility work-up within 3 months of their first ovarian stimulation cycle for in vitro fertilization. On day 3 of a spontaneous menstrual cycle, a blood sample for measurement of plasma AMH levels was taken and a transvaginal ultrasound scan to determine the AFC (follicles measuring 2-5 mm in diameter) was performed. Information about smoking, body mass index, alcohol consumption, ethnic origin, chronological age, age at menarche, years since menarche and gravidity were recorded using a case report form. The main outcome measures were plasma AMH concentrations and total number of small antral follicles (AFC). Median plasma levels of AMH were 2.0 ng/ml (interquartile range 1.1-3.6) and AFC was 10 (interquartile range 7-15). A positive correlation between AMH and AFC (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001) was found. AMH and AFC correlated negatively with age (r = -0.30, p < 0.001 and r = -0.27, p = 0.001 respectively) and number of years since menarche (r = -0.23, p = 0.007 and r = -0.21, p = 0.015 respectively), but not with any of the other measures. Circulating AMH levels and AFC correlated with each other and declined significantly with age. There were only weak, non-significant, correlations with lifestyle factors and reproductive history. These putative markers could be used individually or together to assess the age-related decline of ovarian function in normo-ovulatory candidates for IVF.
