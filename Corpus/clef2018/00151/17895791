Transparent rendering of intraluminal contrast for 3D polyp visualization at CT colonography. We developed a classifier that permits transparent rendering of both tagging material and air to facilitate interpretation of tagged computed tomographic (CT) colonography. With this technique, a reader can simultaneously appreciate polyps on endoluminal views both covered with tagging material and against air, along with unmodified 2-dimensional CT images. Evaluated with 49 polyps from 26 patients (data from public National Library of Medicine, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant), 3 readers were able to determine the presence/absence of polyps in tagged locations with equivalent accuracy compared with polyps in air. This method offers an alternative way to visualize tagged CT colonography.
