Cytogenetic testing of anembryonic pregnancies compared to embryonic missed abortions. The objective of this study is to determine the rate of abnormalities detected by cytogenetic testing of first trimester miscarriages, in patients with and without an embryonic pole seen on ultrasound.A retrospective study of 272 D&Cs for missed abortions in an academic infertility practice from 1999 to 2006. Karyotype results were compared with transvaginal ultrasound findings. Chi-squared analysis was used with a P < 0.05 for significance.There was a high rate of abnormal karyotypes in all miscarriages (65%). Rates of abnormal karyotypes were 58% and 68% in cases with anembryonic gestations and those with a fetal pole seen, respectively (P > 0.05).The high rate of abnormalities detected in both groups suggests that useful results can be obtained from chromosomal testing of the POC regardless of ultrasound findings. Further studies on the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of chromosomal testing are needed.
