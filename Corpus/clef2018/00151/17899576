Three-dimensional transvaginal sonography in local staging of cervical carcinoma: description of a novel technique and preliminary results. To evaluate the feasibility of three-dimensional multiplanar sonography in the local staging of cervical carcinoma.Between January 2005 and May 2006, 14 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma underwent transvaginal volume ultrasound examination prior to primary surgery. Parametrial invasion was evaluated in the coronal plane, while both bladder and rectal invasion were evaluated in the sagittal plane. Ultrasound findings were compared with surgical and histological results.In 12 of the 14 cases, three-dimensional ultrasound findings were compatible with pathology results. In the remaining two cases, either infiltration of right parametrium or rectal invasion were suspected at ultrasound but not confirmed at pathology.Despite the small number of patients evaluated, three-dimensional multiplanar sonography appears to be a promising technique in the local staging of cervical carcinoma.
