Paraovarian adrenal rest with MRI features characteristic of an adrenal adenoma. We report MR and sonographic imaging features of an incidentally detected paraovarian adrenal rest in a 44-year-old woman who was being evaluated for menorrhagia. This is the first report of chemical shift imaging identifying the presence of lipid within an adrenal rest as well as rapid washout of contrast. Both of these MR characteristics are typically seen with an adrenal adenoma.
