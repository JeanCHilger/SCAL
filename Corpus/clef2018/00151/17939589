Endometrial stripe thickness and pregnancy outcome in first-trimester pregnancies with bleeding, pain or both. To determine the association between endometrial stripe (ES) thickness and pregnancy outcome in women with a symptomatic first-trimester pregnancy and to determine how vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain and 1 human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level affect ES thickness.Data on ES thickness, serum hCG, presence of pain, characterization of vaginal bleeding and ultimate clinical outcome were collected for 576 women presenting to the emergency room.ES was thinner with increased vaginal bleeding and associated with hCG level and pregnancy outcome. The mean ES for ectopic pregnancies (EPs) was 9.56 +/- 4.87, for intrauterine pregnancies was 12.12 +/- 6.0 and for spontaneous abortion was 10.19 +/- 6.10. Ninety-nine percent of patients with EP had an ES <21 mm, and 100% had one < or =25 mm.There was considerable overlap in ES for the 3 pregnancy outcomes, making it a poor diagnostic test. Nevertheless, ES >21 mm in a woman with no evidence of a gestational sac excludes EP with 96% specificity. A patient with a stripe >25 mm may be expectantly managed.
