Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasonography in infertility and reproductive endocrinology. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound is an easy and noninvasive technique in the clinical practice of obstetrics and gynecology. It can be used in the analysis of morphologic anatomy and volume measurement and is highly reproducible. Power Doppler ultrasound can further depict and quantify the microcirculation of the target organ or the region of interest. The aim of this review is to report the present status and the development of 3D ultrasonography, as well as 3D power Doppler in the field of infertility and reproductive endocrinology. 3D ultrasound may help us investigate the functional and potential roles in various pathologic conditions of the female pelvis. Furthermore, 3D ultrasound may also provide substantial assistance in the clinical application of infertility and reproductive endocrinology.
