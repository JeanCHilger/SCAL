Sonographic findings in women with complications after hysterectomy. To study the role of abdominal ultrasound in the management of complications after emergency or elective hysterectomy.The study compared 102 women who had complications after emergency peripartum hysterectomy (study group) with 102 women who had complications after elective hysterectomy for fibroids (control group).The study group had a lower mean age (31.1+/-2.1 vs 40.1+/-3.4 years) but higher parity (3.0+/-1.3 vs 2.0+/-1.2) compared with the control group. The primary complication in the study group was abdominal mass or distension (55.9%) compared with chronic abdominal pain (49.0%) in the control group. The leading sonographic abnormality in the study group was pelvic abscess (9.8%) while hydrosalpinx (6.9%) was more common in the control group. There was no statistical difference in the findings between the groups. Management of complications included ovarian cystectomy and drainage of pelvic abscesses.Ultrasound facilitates accurate diagnosis of complications after hysterectomy and enhances management.
