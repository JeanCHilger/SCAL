Transvaginal ultrasonography combined with water-contrast in the rectum in the diagnosis of rectovaginal endometriosis infiltrating the bowel. This prospective study evaluated the efficacy of transvaginal ultrasonography combined with water-contrast in the rectum (RWC-TVS) in the diagnosis of rectal infiltration in 35 women with rectovaginal endometriosis ultrasonographic findings were compared with surgery and histology. The sensitivity of RWC-TVS in identifying rectal infiltration reaching at least the muscular layer was 100%, the specificity was 85.7%, the positive predictive value was 91.3%, and the negative predictive value was 100%. In 4 of 5 (80.0%) nodules reaching the submucosa, the depth of infiltration was underestimated by RWC-TVS. The RWC-TVS reliably determined the largest diameter of the endometriotic nodules and was well tolerated by the patients.
