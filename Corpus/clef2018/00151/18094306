Benign renal neoplasms in adults: cross-sectional imaging findings. A broad spectrum of benign renal neoplasms in adults shows characteristic ontogeny, histology, and tumor biology. Benign renal tumors are classified into renal cell tumors, metanephric tumors, mesenchymal tumors, and mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumors. Select benign tumors show characteristic anatomic distribution and imaging features. However, because of overlapping of findings between benign and malignant renal tumors, histologic evaluation may be required to establish a definitive diagnosis. Accurate preoperative characterization facilitates optimal patient management.We attempt to provide a comprehensive, contemporary review of benign renal neoplasms that occur in adults, focusing on cross-sectional imaging characteristics.
