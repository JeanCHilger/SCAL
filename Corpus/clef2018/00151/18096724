Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional power Doppler vascular indices in assessment of solid and cystic-solid adnexal masses. The purpose of this study was to assess the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional (3D) power Doppler angiography-derived vascular indices in evaluation of vascularized solid and cystic-solid adnexal masses.Stored 3D power Doppler angiographic volume data from 12 consecutive women with a diagnosis of a complex adnexal mass (6 cystic-solid and 6 solid) evaluated and treated at our institution were retrieved from our database for analysis. Two examiners performed the calculations blinded to each other. Calculations were performed offline in a computer using Virtual Organ Computer-Aided Analysis software (plane A, 9 degrees rotation step) to assess volume and vascularization (vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index) from solid areas within the tumor. In all cases, a definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility was assessed by calculating the intraclass and interclass correlation coefficients for each index.All tumors proved to be malignant after surgical removal. Intraobserver reproducibility for both examiners and interobserver reproducibility were high for all indices (interclass correlation coefficient > 0.95).Three-dimensional power Doppler angiography is a reproducible technique for offline assessment of stored 3D volume data of vascularized adnexal masses.
