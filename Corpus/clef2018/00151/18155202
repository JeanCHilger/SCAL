Pre-cycle saline infusion sonography minimizes assisted reproductive technologies cycle cancellation due to endometrial polyps. Pre-ART cycle screening with saline infusion sonohysterography is effective at limiting cycle cancellation caused by endometrial polyps to 0.5%. Although a thickened lining at the time of baseline ultrasound can be indicative of a uterine polyp, a normal endometrial lining does not eliminate the possibility that a polyp will be discovered during the cycle.
