Effect of quality of gynaecological ultrasonography on management of patients with suspected ovarian cancer: a randomised controlled trial. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for differentiating between benign and malignant adnexal masses is proportional to the expertise of the operator. However, we do not know whether improved diagnostic accuracy will affect the management of these tumours. We assessed the effect of the quality of gynaecological ultrasonography on the management of patients with suspected ovarian cancer in a randomised controlled trial.165 patients who were referred to the regional gynaecological cancer centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK), between June 7, 2004, and April 23, 2006, with suspected adnexal tumours met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 150 patients were randomly assigned to either level II (routine) ultrasonography (n=73) or to level III (expert) ultrasonography (n=77). The primary endpoint was the number of major surgical staging procedures (including a laparotomy and at least an oophorectomy and omental biopsy) in each group of the study. Secondary endpoints were: total number of surgical procedures number of minimally invasive procedures (eg, operative laparoscopy or ultrasonography-guided cyst aspiration)More major surgical staging procedures for suspected ovarian cancer were done in the level II group than in the level III group of the study (27 of 73 [37%] vs 17 of 77 [22%], respectively difference between groups 15% [95% CI 0-29]Improved quality of ultrasonography has a measurable effect on the management of patients with suspected ovarian cancer in a tertiary gynaecology cancer centre, and results in a significant decrease in the number of major staging procedures and a shorter inpatient hospital stay.
