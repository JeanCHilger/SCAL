Adnexal masses: understanding and management. Asymptomatic adnexal masses have become common findings due to the widespread use of the transvaginal ultrasound. Most asymptomatic adnexal masses are benign, but malignancy should still be excluded. The assessment of women with adnexal masses, intended to detect the ones suspicious for malignancy, includes the medical history, physical examination, ultrasound scan with Doppler flows, and, in some cases, the CA-125 levels. Once the patient has completed the primary assessment, the important decision is whether to follow her conservatively (if a benign condition is probable), or to proceed to surgery (if malignancy is suspected). This review discusses the evaluation, differential diagnosis, and general approach to adnexal masses, and proposes a management flow chart.
