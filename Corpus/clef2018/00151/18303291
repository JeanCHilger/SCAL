Intrauterine device found in an ovarian carcinoma. Displacement of an intrauterine device (IUD) through the perforation site is a rare but one of the major complications. Theoretically, an extrauterine IUD can be located anywhere in the abdominopelvic cavity. It may be asymptomatic or may cause serious complications, including infection, fistula, organ perforation, or bowel obstruction. However, there is no report of IUD located within an ovarian carcinoma to our knowledge, and our report is the first case of an IUD found in the center of an ovarian cancer.
