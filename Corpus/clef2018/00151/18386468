TV sonographic assessment in postmenopausal women with bleeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the usefulness of transvaginal sonography for the detection of endometrial disease in postmenopausal women with bleeding. This study involved 275 postmenopausal women aged 47-81 years (median 62). None of them were on hormone replacement therapy and all had had amenorrhea for more than one year. Concerning the age of the study patients, we confirm that endometrial cancer occurs at any age, but more commonly in ages above 58 years. Transvaginal sonography was performed in all women. About 89.2% of malignant diseases were discovered in the study women whose endometrial thickness was above 4 mm, but we also found endometrial cancer in 10.2% of the cases in women whose endometrial thickness was below 4 mm. In postmenopausal symptomatic women premalignant or malignant causes of bleeding can not be excluded with just transvaginal ultrasound.
