Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma mimicking ectopic pregnancy managed with laparoscopy -- case report. Nongestational ovarian choriocarcinomas are extremely rare and pose diagnostic challenges in reproductive-aged patients because of elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). A 23-year-old nulliparous Chinese woman with nongestational ovarian choriocarcinoma escaped diagnostic testing and was initially treated for an ectopic pregnancy. Three months after her first visit, a diagnostic laparoscopy demonstrated a nongestational ovarian choriocarcinoma. Comprehensive surgical staging was performed by laparoscopy. The tumor was confined to the left ovary. The patient was categorized as FIGO Stage IA. She was given four courses of combined chemotherapy after laparoscopic surgery and has been disease-free for 36 months.
