The evaluation of endothelial function with flow-mediated dilatation and carotid intima media thickness in young nonobese polycystic ovary syndrome patients existence of insulin resistance alone may not represent an adequate condition for deterioration of endothelial function. To evaluate endothelial function with flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in young nonobese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.Prospective case-control study.Healthy volunteers and nonobese young PCOS patients in clinical research.Thirty-nine PCOS patients with mean age of 22.82 +/- 5.53 years and 30 body mass index- and age-matched healthy controls were evaluated.Insulin resistance was calculated with area under the curve, quantitative insulin sensitivity check, and the Matsuda index. Endothelial function was assessed with FMD and carotid IMT by ultrasonography.Antropometric, hormonal, biochemical (insulin and glucose, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, hs-c-reactive protein, and homocysteine levels, and so forth), FMD, and IMT were measured.There was a significant insulin resistance in PCOS patients. Serum FSH, total and free testosterone, cortisol, androstenedione, and DHEA-S levels of PCOS patients were also higher than control subjects, but we could not find any significant difference in terms of endothelial function determined with FMD.Existence of insulin resistance alone may not be an adequate factor for deterioration of endothelial function and carotid IMT in young, nonobese patients with PCOS. Other factors such as duration of insulin resistance, older age, presence of obesity, and inflammatory markers may play an important role in this process.
