Seizure type, antiepileptic drugs, and reproductive endocrine dysfunction in Indian women with epilepsy: a cross-sectional study. There is paucity of data regarding occurrence of reproductive endocrine disorders in Asian women with epilepsy (WWE) on antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy.To determine the occurrence of reproductive endocrine disorders in Indian WWE, by seizure type and the AED use.Consecutive 427 reproductive age WWE receiving various AEDs were screened for the occurrence of menstrual abnormalities, weight change, and hirsutism. Of these, 53 WWE with menstrual disturbances and/or hirsutism were further evaluated for ovarian morphology and reproductive hormonal profile.Menstrual abnormalities and/or hirsutism were observed in 83 of 427 (19.4%) WWE irrespective of epileptic seizure type of these, 50 (60.2%) received valproate, 21 (25.3%) received carbamazepine, 11 (13.3%) received phenytoin, and one (1.2%) received phenobarbitone as the primary AED. Almost half of valproate-treated women had significant weight gain and obesity. Among 53 of 83 women evaluated further, 23.5% and 63.6% of valproate-treated women, 25% and 58.3% of carbamazepine-treated women, and none and 20% of phenytoin-treated women had polycystic ovaries (PCO) and hyperandrogenemia (HA), respectively. Valproate-treated women had significantly higher frequency of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (11.8% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.0001) and mean serum testrosterone levels (1.78 vs. 1.36 ng/ml, p = 0.03), compared with women treated with other AEDs.Limitations include small number of women in antiepileptic subgroups and a high drop out rate in women who underwent ultrasound and endocrinological investigations.Menstrual abnormalities, weight gain, obesity, and PCOS are frequent and significantly higher in WWE receiving valproate, independent of seizure type.
