Primary malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the uterus: findings on sonography, CT, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the sonographic, contrast-enhanced CT, and gadolinium-enhanced MRI findings of primary malignant mixed m√ºllerian tumors (MMMTs) of the uterus.Uterine MMMT most commonly presents as an intracavitary mass with coexistent dilatation of the endometrial canal. Tumors tend to appear hyperechoic on sonography, heterogeneously hypodense and ill defined on contrast-enhanced CT, and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images with signal abnormalities indicating subacute hemorrhage on T1-weighted MR images. Myometrial invasion is common and has a predilection for the uterine fundus.
