Three-dimensional power Doppler vascular network assessment of adnexal masses: intraobserver and interobserver agreement analysis. The purpose of this study was to assess intraobserver and interobserver agreement for tumor vascular network evaluation as assessed by 3-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography for discriminating benign from malignant adnexal masses.Stored 3D power Doppler angiographic volume data from 39 women with a diagnosis of a vascularized adnexal mass who were evaluated and treated at our institution were retrieved from our database for analysis. Two different examiners (observer A, with 6 years of experience in 3D sonography and observer B, with 1 year of experience) reviewed 3D sonograms blinded to each other. Three-dimensional vascular network reconstruction was done with surface rendering in the color mode. Malignancy was considered in the presence of at least 2 of the following: irregular branching, vessel caliber changes, microaneurysms, and vascular lakes. A definitive histologic diagnosis was obtained in all cases. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement rates were estimated by calculating the kappa index.Twenty (51%) tumors were malignant, and 19 (49%) were benign. Intraobserver agreement was good for observer A (kappa = 0.69) and moderate for observer B (kappa = 0.54). Interobserver agreement was moderate (kappa = 0.49).We found intraobserver and interobserver agreement to be moderate for 3D power Doppler assessment of the vascular network in adnexal masses.
