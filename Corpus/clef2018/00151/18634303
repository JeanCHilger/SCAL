Capacities of ultrasound study in the diagnosis of diffuse gastric carcinoma. By using 237 verified cases of diffuse carcinoma and benign diseases of the stomach as an example, the authors assess the capacities of routine transabdominal ultrasound study (USS) of the stomach in the diagnosis of tumors and present their modification of the procedure facilitating the imaging of problem areas. In the authors' opinion, the symptoms of thickening of the wall of the stomach and abnormalities in its normal five-layered structure indicate diffuse gastric carcinoma. The authors consider USS to be a supplement to the basic diagnostic techniques--X-ray study and gastroscopy.
