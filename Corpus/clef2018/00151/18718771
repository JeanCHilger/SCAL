Randomised trial of flush saphenofemoral ligation for primary great saphenous varicose veins. The aim of this study was to assess different techniques of saphenofemoral ligation in the treatment of primary varicose veins.One hundred and eighty-two patients (210 legs) with primary saphenofemoral junction incompetence were randomised to standard saphenofemoral ligation (transfixion with an absorbable suture) (SSL) or flush saphenofemoral ligation (oversewing with 4/0 polypropylene) (FSL). All legs underwent additional great saphenous vein stripping and multiple phlebectomies. Patients underwent assessment preoperatively, and at 6 weeks, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively with clinical examination, duplex imaging and completion of the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score (AVVSSS).A total of 148 patients (172 legs) attended follow-up at 2 years postoperatively. Recurrent varicose veins were visible in 30 legs (33 per cent) in the SSL group and 26 legs (32 per cent) in the FSL group (P=0.90). Neovascularisation was present in 20 groins (22 per cent) in the SSL group and 15 groins (19 per cent) in the FSL group (P=0.57). Nine cases of neovascularisation in the SSL group and five in the FSL group directly resulted in clinical recurrence (P=0.37).Flush ligation of the saphenofemoral junction confers no advantage over standard ligation with respect to clinical recurrence and neovascularisation.ISRCTN20235689 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).
