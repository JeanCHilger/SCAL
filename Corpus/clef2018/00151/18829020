Two-dimensional HyCoSy with contrast tuned imaging technology and a second-generation contrast media for the assessment of tubal patency in an infertility program. To compare the efficiency of hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography performed with air and saline (Hydro-HyCoSy) with HyCoSy performed with contrast media (SonoVue) and contrast-tuned imaging technology (CnTI-SonoVue-HyCoSy) considering hysterosalpingography (HSG) and laparoscopy (LPS) as reference tests and to evaluate the learning curve of this procedure.Retrospective study.Reproductive unit of a university hospital.Forty-two infertile female patients.HyCoSy were performed with a 2.4-mm intrauterine catheter. Patients underwent HSG or LPS as controls.Mean age, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, kappa value, and diagnostic accuracy were evaluated for statistical analysis.Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of Hydro-HyCoSy were 91%, 71%, 55%, and 95%, respectively, while for CnTI-SonoVue-HyCoSy they were 87%, 84%, 69%, and 94%. The diagnostic accuracy of Hydro-HyCoSy and of CnTI-SonoVue-HyCoSy were 77% and 85%, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.52 and 0.66, respectively. CnTI-SonoVue-HyCoSy does not require a learning curve period.CnTI-SonoVue-HyCoSy is more accurate than Hydro-HyCoSy for the assessment of fallopian tubes. The very high normal predictive value of Hydro-HyCoSy suggests that this procedure could be performed as a screening examination, whereas CnTI-SonoVue-HyCoSy could be used as a second-step technique.
