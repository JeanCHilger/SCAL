Higher metabolic risk in Chinese women fulfilling the NIH diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome. Only about 63% of Chinese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) as diagnosed by the 2003 Rotterdam criteria fulfilled the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria. Although the NIH criteria are not generally applicable to the Chinese population, women fulfilling the NIH criteria have higher metabolic risk than those who do not and so carry the most clinical significance.
