Ultrasound findings in amenorrhoeic women with vaginal bleeding. To document sonographically identifiable causes of vaginal bleeding in secondarily amenorrhoeic women of child bearing age.A retrospective study of ultrasonographic findings among 102 secondarily amenorrhoeic women of childbearing age with vaginal bleeding was carried out. Ultrasound scan was carried using Siemens Sonoline SL1 equipment with 3.5MHz and 5.0MHz transducers75(73.2%) patients had pregnancy-related conditions, 14(13.7%) had normal, non-pregnant uteri while the remaining 13 (12.8%) had other gynaecological conditions namely pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), uterine fibroids and ovarian masses. Though pregnancy-related conditions are the major causes of vaginal bleeding in amenorrhoeic women of childbearing age, PID, fibroids and ovarian masses are possible findings.Ultrasound examination is vital in the elucidation of vaginal bleeding in amenorrhoeic women. Pregnancy related conditions are not the only significant cause of amenorrhoea complicated by vaginal bleeding.
