Flow differences between endometrial polyps and cancer: a prospective study using intravenous contrast-enhanced transvaginal color flow Doppler and three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound. To evaluate whether assessment of blood flow by transvaginal color Doppler and three-dimensional power Doppler imaging, enhanced by intravenous contrast, may be useful in the differentiation between benign endometrial polyps and endometrial cancer.A prospective study was performed comparing 17 women with benign endometrial polyps and 17 women with endometrial cancer. Transvaginal color Doppler and three-dimensional power Doppler angiography were performed before and after injection of intravenous contrast. The pulsatility index (PI) and the resistance index (RI) of the polyp feeding vessel or central vessel in malignant lesions, as well as the power Doppler endometrial flow indices vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI), were calculated before and after enhancement by contrast, and compared between the two groups of women.PI (mean difference +/- SD, 0.68 +/- 0.22 95% CI, 0.23-1.13Transvaginal color Doppler examination enhanced by intravenous contrast may help to discriminate between benign endometrial polyps and cancer. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings.
