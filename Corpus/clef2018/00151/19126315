Gynaecological ultrasound in community sexual and reproductive health clinics. Many women seen in community sexual and reproductive health (SRH) clinics have gynaecological problems and a pelvic ultrasound scan forms part of their investigation. We present a retrospective analysis of 24 months' provision of a gynaecological ultrasound service in the Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health, Southwark Primary Care Trust, London, UK.A total of 327 women attended for ultrasound examination 258 required a pelvic scan and 69 had an Implanon-related problem. Of the women analysed, 152 were managed entirely in the communityWe believe we have demonstrated that gynaecological ultrasound can be performed in the community. This seems to be acceptable to patients and also reduces the requirement for hospital appointments.
