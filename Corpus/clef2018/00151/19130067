Primary ovarian adenomyoma in a woman with endometrial polyp: a case report and review of the literature. An adenomyoma presenting outside the uterus is an extremely rare entity and only three cases of primary ovarian adenomyoma have been reported up to date.We report the fourth case of ovarian adenomyoma in a 45-year-old woman with an endometrial polyp. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a solitary endometrial polyp with an enlarged left ovary which appeared heterogenous with isoechoic and mildly hyperechoic pattern.Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy was performed and histologic examination revealed an adenomyoma arising primarily in the ovary.
