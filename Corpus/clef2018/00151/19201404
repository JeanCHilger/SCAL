Three-dimensional power Doppler imaging in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. To determine the role of three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler imaging in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) of the uterine artery and ovary were measured by two-dimensional (2D) Doppler imaging, while vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) were measured by 3D power Doppler in 25 patients with PCOS and 25 women with normal menstrual cycles used as a control group.Uterine artery PI and RI were significantly higher (P<0.001) and ovarian PI and RI were significantly lower (P<0.001) in women with PCOS compared with controls. Ovarian VI and VFI were significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with the control group (P<0.001).3D power Doppler indices were higher in women with PCOS than in the control group and were positively correlated with 2D color Doppler indices, and clinical and hormonal parameters. High 3D power Doppler indices may be useful as one of the diagnostic criteria for PCOS.
