Early endometrial changes following successful implantation: 2 and 3-dimensional ultrasound study. To study of the possible role of ultrasound (US) measurements of the endometrium in the prediction of IVF outcome.28 infertile women underwent US measurements of endometrial thickness and volume on day of ET and two weeks later. US measurements were compared between day of ET and two weeks later, and between those who conceived and those who did not.While in the group of patients who conceived (n = 7) endometrial thickness and volume rose significantly between day of hCG and two weeks later, no differences were observed in patients (n = 21) who did not.The dynamic changes in endometrial volume and thickness between day of ET and two weeks later may predict IVF treatment outcome.
