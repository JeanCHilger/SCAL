Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy without bipolar coagulation or sutures using a gelantine-thrombin matrix sealant (FloSeal): first support of a promising technique. As a important part of endocrine surgery, laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard for the treatment of benign symptomatic ovarian cysts refractory to medical treatment. In fact, the stripping technique seems to be the most common technique used for ovarian cyst surgery. After stripping the cystic wall, the subsequent bleeding of the ovarian stromal wound ground is usually controlled by bipolar coagulation or/and by suturing. Potentially, the surgery-induced ovarian tissue damage will be increased by heat and/or by sutures. In respect to intraovarian hemostasis, the use of gelantine-thrombin-matrix might protect from additional ovarian tissue damage, which is of great importance for the ovarian reproductive function in woman. For the first time, our data do support a promising laparoscopic technique demonstrating ovarian cystectomy without any bipolar coagulation and/or suturing of ovarian tissue using a gelantine-thrombin-matrix sealant (FloSeal) as a new tool to control post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding.
