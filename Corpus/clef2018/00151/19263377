Dermatofibroma mimicking malignancy on integrated F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT. A 31-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer underwent an F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. The PET-CT demonstrated focal nodular uptake in the subcutaneous tissue of the back adjacent to the paraspinal muscles. Color Doppler ultrasonography examination demonstrated a vascular solid mass. The patient underwent biopsy followed by excision. The pathologic diagnosis was dermatofibroma. Although benign, dermatofibromas can have intense FDG uptake.
