Diagnostic imaging of menometrorrhagia. Menometrorrhagia is a frequent cause of medical consulting. After a clinical examination showing the uterine origin of bleeding and that excludes a cervical or vulvo-vaginal origin, transvaginal sonography (TVS) represents the first-line technique examination. TVS allows to identify endometrial diseases (atrophy, polyps or diffuse hyperplasia), endometrial carcinoma, myometrial disorders (adenomyosis, leiomyoma or vascular abnormalities), and adnexal disorders. Color Doppler sonography and hysterosonography are useful complementary tools for ultrasound performance improvement. MR imaging should be performed if TVS is not contributive or is highly recommended for staging of uterine cancers. All these techniques provide useful information for optimal planning treatment.
