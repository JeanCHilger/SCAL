Hierarchy for diagnostic and etiological management in menometrorrhagia. A strategy to establish the diagnosis and the etiology of menorrhagia is necessary for an adaptated therapeutic care. The cross-examination must endeavour to assess bleedings and their clinical impact, and concentrate on specific pathology (such as hemostasis disorders). Clinical examination may eliminate cervical vaginal pathologies and estimate uterine volume. The diagnosis of pregnancy should always be considered and eliminated and that of iron deficiency anemia will be helpful. Explorations of hemostasis balance will be recommended according to clinical and biological features. Hormonal measurement are not contributive, except in diagnosis of SOPK. Endometrium biopsy with the Pipelle will be systematically performed after 40 years of age or in case of risk factors of endometrial cancer. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the first line exam to recommend in case of proved menorrhagia. Hysteroscopy and hysterosonography will be recommended if ultrasonography is not informative enough, or in case of medical treatment failure. MRI is recommended in an second intention (in case of multiple uterine fibroids, or suspected adenomyosis, and if an arterial embolization is required).
