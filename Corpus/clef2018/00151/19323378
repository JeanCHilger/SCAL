Testicular microlithiasis: ultrasonic diagnosis and correlation with male infertility. To study the sonographic appearance of testicular microlithiasis (TM) and its correlation with male infertility.We conducted high-resolution 2D ultrasound examination for 1 198 patients with scrotal diseases, including 379 with infertility and 819 with other testicular diseases.TM was found in 21 of the infertile men (5.54%) and 12 of the other 819 fertile patients (1.47%). TM was correlated with male infertility (r = 0. 115, P < 0.01), with a higher incidence in the infertile patients than in patients with other testicular diseases (P < 0.05). Sonography of TM showed high-echo dots in the testicular parenchyma, sparse, sporadic or converted, about 1 mm in diameter and without shadow.The sonographic appearance of TM, with its obvious features, is conducive to the definite diagnosis of the disease. TM is correlated with male infertility.
