Can quantitative three-dimensional power Doppler angiography be used to predict ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome? To test the hypothesis that ovarian vascularity is increased in women developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and to assess its value as a predictor of OHSS during in-vitro fertilization (IVF).118 subjects undergoing their first cycle of IVF had a three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound scan in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle preceding IVF treatment. 18 of them developed moderate or severe OHSS and 100 subjects had normal ovarian response. Antral follicle count, ovarian volume, and ovarian vascularity (vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) were compared between OHSS and control groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the predictive value of these variables against age, body mass index and basal follicle-stimulating hormone level for the development of OHSS.The ovarian blood flow indices VI (11.1 +/- 11.6 vs. 8.6 +/- 7.3% P = 0.23), FI (38.0 +/- 4.8 vs. 38.0 +/- 5.5Women developing OHSS during IVF do not demonstrate an increased ovarian blood flow as measured by 3D ultrasound but do have a significantly higher antral follicle count, which is the only significant predictor of OHSS.
