Gallbladder carcinoma presenting as a pelvic mass with elevated serum testosterone: a case report. The differential diagnoses for pelvic masses with elevated CA 125 and serum testosterone are many, including primary tumors and metastases from nongynecologic primary cancers.A 63-year-old woman presented with a pelvic mass, abdominal pain and virilization. CA 125 and testosterone were elevated (74 U/mL and 384 ng/dL, respectively). Preoperative clinical diagnosis was suggestive of Sertoli-Leydig tumor. Final diagnosis was stage IV primary gallbladder malignancy with metastases to the ovaries.Ovarian metastases from other sites can clinically mimic primary ovarian tumors. In women with complex pelvic masses, metastasis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis.
