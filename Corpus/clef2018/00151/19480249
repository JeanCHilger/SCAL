Risk of malignancy index for adnexal masses. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the risk of malignancy index (RMI) and retrospective analysis of patients presenting with adnexal masses to our clinic for treatment.Data of 137 women who had adnexal masses were included in the analysis. A simple algorithm called "risk of malignancy index" (RMI) reported by Jacobs includes menopausal status, ultrasound morphologic features and serum CA125 level. The RMI values were detected for each patient and analyzed to detect the relationship between benign and malign groups of the patients. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL USA). Sensitivity and specificity was calculated for RMI in diagnoses of ovarian cancer by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.A total of 137 patients with adnexal masses were operated on. Mean age and SD of 137 patients were 30.64 +/- 10.05. Fourteen patients (10.2%) had malignant disease and 123 patients (89.8%) benign pathology. ROC analysis of the RMI showed that the values of area under the curve were significantly high with a value of 0.883 (p < 0.001).The RMI is a simple scoring system and has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of malignant adnexal masses. Application of the RMI in clinical practice may provide a rational basis for specialists to treat patients with adnexal masses before diagnostic surgery.
