Virtual hysterosalpingography and hysteroscopy: assessment of uterine cavity and fallopian tubes using 64-detector computed tomography data sets. Hysterosalpingography is the primary technique in providing coarse information on the morphology of endometrial cavity and fallopian tubes. In this preliminary study, 64-detector computed tomography was used for three-dimensional imaging of endometrium and fallopian tubes.
