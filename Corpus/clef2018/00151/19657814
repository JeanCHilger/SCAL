Secondary amenorrhoea with high inhibin B level caused by parasitic ovarian leiomyoma. A 35-year-old patient attended the clinic after 1 year of primary infertility and 9 years secondary amenorrhoea. Her BMI was 21.9 kg/m². Transvaginal scan examination showed a small uterus with 1.7 mm thick endometrium. The left ovary was quiescent and measured 2.9 cm x 61.2 cm x 62.1 cm. 3D images manipulation showed a large (96.9 cm³) solid mass attached to the right ovary. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level was 3.8 IU/l, oestradiol was 57 pmol/l and testosterone was 0.9 nmol/l. She had normal thyroid indices, serum prolactin, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol levels. Inhibin B and luteinising hormone (LH) blood levels were high at 408 pg/ml and 19.5 IU/l, respectively. The mass was shelled laparoscopically off the right ovary, and proved histologically to be a parasitic leiomyoma. She resumed regular menstruation 1 month after surgery and conceived in her fourth cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported relating high inhibin B and luteinising hormone blood levels to an ovarian leiomyoma.
