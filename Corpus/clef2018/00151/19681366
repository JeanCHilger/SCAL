An analysis of the category BIRADS, histopathologic results, the imaging procedure and the surgical approach.We made 78 procedures. 56% under mammography guidance and 44% by ultrasound. 23% of biopsies with histopathological result of malignancy and 77% were benign, the outcome depended on the category of BIRADS granted.
