Primary ovarian dysfunction contributes to the hypogonadism in women with Prader-Willi Syndrome. To investigate the etiology of hypogonadism in women with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS).Ten women aged 23 +/- 5.5 years with PWS and 10 age- and BMI-matched controls were included. Blood samples were drawn and abdominal ultrasounds were performed on days 2-4 of spontaneous cycles or at random from amenorrheic women. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B (INB), gonadotropins, sex steroids, TSH, prolactin, ovarian volume and antral follicle count (AFC) in PWS women were compared with results from controls and the reference ranges.Compared to controls, PWS women had lower INB (mean +/- SD = 17.6 +/- 12.8 pg/ml vs. 110.6 +/- 54.5 p = 0.0002) and AMH levels (1.18 +/- 0.86 ng/ml vs. 3.53 +/- 2.42Our results suggest a unique follicular stage-specific insult in women with PWS. Thus, primary ovarian dysfunction is a major component of hypogonadism in PWS.
