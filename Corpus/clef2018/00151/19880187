An amphiphilic ruthenium(II)-polypyridyl appended porphyrin as potential bifunctional two-photon tumor-imaging and photodynamic therapeutic agent. An amphiphilic porphyrin appended with a Ru(II)-polypyridyl complex (Ru-P) showing a moderate two-photon absorption cross-section (178.0+/-26.8GM), high singlet oxygen quantum yield and rapid cellular uptake was synthesized. In vitro study using human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells showed that Ru-P exhibited a strong two-photon induced fluorescence upon uptake, lysosomal localization and potent two-photon induced cytotoxicity. These results show that Ru-P, which was designed to enhance its cellular uptake, can potentially be used as an efficacious bifunctional two-photon tumor-imaging and photodynamic therapeutic agent despite its moderate two-photon absorption cross-section.
