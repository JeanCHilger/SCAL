Creation of a uterine scar endometrioma after uterine perforation at the time of a dilation and evacuation. Nonovarian endometriomas typically present as a slow-growing, painful abdominal mass in or around the site of a previous surgery. There can be considerable variation, however, because some masses grow rapidly and are not associated with pain whereas others cause patients significant discomfort and associated symptoms. The case of a 31-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 2, who had development of a uterine scar endometrioma after perforation during a dilation and evacuation, is examined. This is an unusual case considering the rate of uterine perforation at the time of gynecologic procedures and the lack of data related to the creation of nonovarian endometriomas.
