Clinical outcomes for various causes of infertility with natural-cycle in vitro fertilization combined with in vitro maturation of immature oocytes. The clinical outcomes of different infertility causes (tubal factor, male factor, unexplained infertility, combination of tubal and male factors, and other/mixed factors) with natural-cycle in vitro fertilization/maturation (IVF/M) treatment were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the rates of IVM, IVF, and cleavage as well as the clinical pregnancy (30.4%-46.9%) and live birth rates among the five subgroups, which suggests that natural-cycle IVF/M is a suitable treatment for infertility of various causes with acceptable pregnancy and live birth rates.
