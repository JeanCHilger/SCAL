Evaluation of uterine anomalies: 3D FRFSE cube versus standard 2D FRFSE. The purpose of this study was to compare a novel MRI sequence-3D fast-recovery fast spin-echo (FRFSE) cube-with a standard 2D FRFSE sequence for the investigation of uterine anomalies.Compared with 2D FRFSE, 3D FRFSE cube provides superior image quality and improved 3D reconstructions in a shorter acquisition time and enables excellent visualization of uterine anatomy in any orientation, regardless of the original scanning plane.
