Sonographic bladder volumetry in children: comparison of conventional B-mode sonography and automatic volumetry with a handheld scanning device without imaging. Evaluation of a handheld sonographic tool for the automatic estimation of bladder volume in comparison with conventional sonography in children under clinical conditions.139 children (age: 30 days - 17 years) were examined with both conventional sonography and the handheld scanning device BVI 6200. For conventional sonography two different formulas were used to calculate the bladder volume.The mean error of the three methods was 22.4 % for the handheld tool, 37.4 % for the most frequently used prolate ellipsoid formula in conventional sonography, and 23 % for an alternative formula recommended in the literature. In 19 cases the first automated sonography scan showed a false-negative result (empty bladder), while the automatically calculated volumes were between 17 and 60 ml in 5 cases of empty bladder. In one of these cases a megaureter and in another an ovarian cyst were detected by conventional ultrasound.Since pathologies are not visualized and can be misinterpreted as a nonempty bladder, the automated method should only be used in follow-up studies. In every case automated volumetry should be performed repeatedly to avoid false-negative results.
