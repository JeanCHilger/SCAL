Linear measurement of polyps in CT colonography using level sets on 3D surfaces. CT colonography has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to optical colonoscopy for the screening of polyps which are the precursors to colon cancer. Accurate polyp measurement is crucial as the size of a polyp is considered an indication of its potential for malignancy. We present a novel method for the automatic measurement of polyps. It is based on a level set algorithm capable of evolving on the surface of a 3D object represented by a triangular mesh. It is guided by curvature features and is capable of segmenting the polyp neck, that is, the ridgeline/crestline formed around the polyp by its merging to the colon wall. Our method was validated on 40 polyp surfaces obtained from real clinical data. A 3D manual measurement was used as the reference standard. A correlation of 0.825 was found between polyp measurements from our new method and the reference standard.
