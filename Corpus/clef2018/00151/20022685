IVF outcome in women with PCOS, PCO and normal ovarian morphology. To examine the outcome of IVF in women who have normal ovaries, ovulatory PCO or PCOS.Analysis of a prospectively collected database in an assisted conception unit in a university teaching hospital including 290 women <37 years of age undergoing their first IVF cycle. The main outcome measure was severe OHSS requiring hospitalization.Severe OHSS rates were significantly higher in women with PCO (12.6%) and PCOS (15.4%) compared to those with normal ovaries (2.7%). Coasting was used significantly more often. Live birth rates per cycle started are similar among women with PCO (38%), PCOS (37%) and normal ovaries (40%).Women with ovaries of polycystic morphology are at increased risk of developing severe OHSS and of requiring avoidance techniques such as coasting, regardless of ovulatory status. However, live birth rates per cycle are similar to women with normal ovaries.
