Coexistence between carotid artery stenosis and colorectal adenomatous polyps in middle-aged men. Colorectal neoplasia and cardiovascular disease appear to share common risk factors. This study aimed to investigate the association between the thickness of the intima-media complex (IMT) or carotid artery stenosis (CAS) on carotid artery ultrasonography and the presence of colorectal adenomas in middle-aged asymptomatic men.This study was conducted among 1,877 asymptomatic male subjects, 40-59 years, who underwent both carotid artery ultrasonography and colonoscopy for routine health examination. Clinical information was collected from a standardized questionnaire, physical examination and blood tests.The prevalence of overall colorectal adenomatous polyps (APs) was 31.4% (591/1,877). The subjects were divided into two groups according to the presence of APs in the colorectum. The prevalence of IMT >or=10 mm was significantly higher in the subjects with CAS than in those without CAS (10.1 vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001). CAS was more prevalent in the AP-positive group than in the AP-negative group (40.5 vs. 30.2%, p = 0.001). Moreover, CAS was more prevalent in the advanced AP-positive group than in the advanced AP-negative group (15.2 vs. 8.2%, p = 0.048).This study suggests that there is a relationship between colorectal AP and CAS, probably due to common risk factors.
