Contemporary pediatric gynecologic imaging. Ultrasound is the primary screening modality for the evaluation of pediatric gynecologic maladies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used progressively more in this field, particularly for the evaluation of complex pelvic masses and congenital anomalies. However, ultrasound remains the preferred modality due to the excellent visualization, the dynamic nature of the examination modality, lack of ionizing radiation and sedation risks, and comparatively lower cost. MRI is generally a second-line examination and is preferred over computed tomography as it does not involve the use of ionizing radiation. Additionally, visualization of the female reproductive system anatomy with MRI is superior to computed tomography, the latter being reserved generally for tumor staging. Fluoroscopic examinations and abdominal radiographs can provide additional information that may support a diagnosis.
