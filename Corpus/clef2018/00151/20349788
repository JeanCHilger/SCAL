Sonographic value in diagnosis of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. To investigate the sonographic characteristics of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts (HOC) and to avoid unnecessary surgery.113 cases of suspected HOC underwent sonographic and clinical follow-up for three months.104 cases were clinically diagnosed with HOC as the masses disappeared naturally. The mean length of the greatest diameter was 5.12 +/- 1.33 cm, and the mean period of disappearance was 3.5 +/- 2.4 weeks. There were four patterns of the image: 21 cases (20.2%) showed a diffused dense echo pattern, 25 cases (24.0%) displayed a mixed pattern, 30 cases (28.8%) expressed a sponge-like pattern and 28 cases (27.0%) exhibited a cystic pattern. Ring blood flow with high velocity and low resistance was detected in 41 cases (40%) and there was no internal blood flow.HOC showed characteristic features on sonography, which provided useful information to differentiate HOC from ovarian tumors.
