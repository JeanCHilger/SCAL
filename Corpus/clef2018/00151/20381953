Grid analysis improves reliability in follicle counts made by ultrasonography in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Poor reliability has been reported when counting the total number of follicles in polycystic ovaries using conventional two-dimensional (2-D) ultrasound viewing methods. In the current study, we report good reliability in follicle counts when observers imposed a programmable grid system over the viewing window. Four observers estimated total follicle counts in 45 ovarian ultrasound scans by compartmentalizing the ovary into 9 to 12 grid sections and performing focused follicle counts per section. The mean number of follicles counted per ovary was 44.6 +/- 2.3. The level of inter-observer agreement when making follicle counts was 0.82 and total follicle counts did not differ among observers. The level of intra-observer agreement was 0.93 which further corroborated the utility of this method for making dependable follicle counts. In summary, the ability to obtain reproducible follicle counts will help to establish reliable diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology.
