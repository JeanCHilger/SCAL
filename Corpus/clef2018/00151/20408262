Clinical and morphological features of gallbladder cholesterosis in children. Although that the first reports of cholesterosis gall bladder were in the second half of the XIX century, there is still insufficient information about the frequency of its detection in children. According to some researchers, this disease was detected in patients aged 13 to 14 years. In other periods of childhood gallbladder cholesterosis is considered to be casuistic rarity. Multiyear study conducted by the authors in the study of diseases of biliary tract showed that almost a third of children had combined with cholelithiasis with gallbladder cholesterosis. However, prior to cholecystectomy is diagnosed only 5% of children. In connection with this the aim of our work was to learn the peculiarities of the clinical picture and morphological changes in children at gallbladder cholesterosis. Material and methods. There were observed 54 children with gallbladder cholesterosis (GBC) aged from 1 year to 15 years (20 girls, 34 boys) . The diagnosis was confirmed histologically in the walls of GB. Gallbladder cholesterosis was differentiated from polyps and concrements of GB in the performance of traditional and endoscopic ultrasound. According to testimony performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdominal cavity. The material was processed statistically using a specially program developed by Medstat. Results. There were showed clinical course features and morphological picture of the gallbladder wall. There were brought the attention of pediatricians to the reversibility of the pathological process in childhood, which suggests alternative methods of treatment in gallbladder cholesterosis the in children--traditional treatment.
