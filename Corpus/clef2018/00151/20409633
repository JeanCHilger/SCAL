Adenomyosis has no adverse effects on IVF/ICSI outcomes in women with endometriosis treated with long-term pituitary down-regulation before IVF/ICSI. To establish the effect of adenomyosis on IVF/ICSI outcomes in infertile patients with endometriosis who were pretreated with long-term (>/=3 months) GnRH-agonist prior to IVF/ICSI.Retrospective study in 74 infertile patients with surgically proven endometriosis who were treated with IVF/ICSI between January 2002 and March 2007. The diagnosis of adenomyosis was based on transvaginal ultrasound criteria. All patients were pretreated with long-term (>or=3 months) GnRH-agonist prior to IVF/ICSI.90.4% of the patients were diagnosed with endometriosis rASRM stages III-IV. Adenomyosis was demonstrated in 27% of them and was predominantly located in the posterior wall of the uterus. The following IVF/ICSI outcomes were found: a mean duration of GnRH-agonist use prior to IVF/ICSI of 5.35 months (3-26) a mean dosage of FSH used of 208IU (75-450)Adenomyosis had no adverse effects on IVF/ICSI outcomes in infertile women with proven endometriosis who were pretreated with long-term GnRH-agonist.
