The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents. In women, the definition of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has become broad and includes several possible phenotypes. Because several features of PCOS may be in evolution in adolescents, we suggest that only firm criteria should be used to make a diagnosis of PCOS during adolescence. Hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, and ovarian morphology change during adolescence and are discussed individually. Adolescents with incomplete criteria for a firm diagnosis of PCOS should be followed up carefully and may be diagnosed at a later time.
