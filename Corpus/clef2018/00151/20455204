Florid polypoid endometriosis of the cervix with left ureteric obstruction: a mimic of cervical malignancy. Polypoid endometriosis, in contrast to typical (non-polypoid) endometriosis, presents as masses that project from a serosal or mucosal surface or from the lining of an endometriotic cyst. Generally large, these masses can simulate a malignant tumor on imaging and at surgery. We report a case of florid polypoid endometriosis arising from the cervix with extension into the left parametrium and involving the left ureter, mimicking a locally advanced cervical malignancy on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.
