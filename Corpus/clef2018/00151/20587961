An estimate of the rate of growth of a juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma in a 15 year old child. Juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF) is an uncommon fibro-osseous lesion occurring in the facial bones. It has been recognised as a separate histopathological entity among the fibro-osseous group of lesions. Fibro-osseous lesions of the craniofacial bones are difficult to classify and treat however a common factor to all is the conversion of the bone to benign fibrous tissue with a varying degree of mineralised tissue. This case describes a 15 year old patient with a juvenile aggressive ossifying fibroma (JAOF) and an estimate of the rate of growth of such a rare lesion.
