Adnexal torsion: a predictive score for pre-operative diagnosis. Adnexal torsion (AT) is difficult to diagnose and requires immediate surgery. The aim of this study was to develop a simple score for assisting in the pre-operative diagnosis of AT in women with acute pelvic pain.Using data from a retrospective cohort of 142 patients with acute pelvic pain, we developed a score based on multiple logistic regression after a jackknife procedure. We validated the score in a prospective cohort of 35 women with acute pelvic pain.Five criteria were independently associated with AT confirmed by surgery: unilateral lumbar or abdominal pain [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 4.1 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.2-14.0]This easy-to-calculate score may prove useful for diagnosing AT in patients with acute pelvic pain seen at general or gynaecology emergency departments.
