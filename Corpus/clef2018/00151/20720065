MR imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass can be used to guide patient care and reduce the costs of investigation and treatment. Most indeterminate masses result from common benign conditions, and women with such masses can avoid unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. For the minority of women in whom indeterminate masses are malignant, use of MR imaging rather than a "wait and watch" strategy of interval re-examination with ultrasonography offers a more timely diagnosis. There are simple diagnostic steps in the MR imaging assessment that direct a problem-solving, tailored approach based on signal characteristics and morphology.
