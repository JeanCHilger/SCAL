Quality of transfer. Biologist and clinician's point of view. Embryonic transfer is one of the briefest procedures in the long-lasting chain of events occurring during an infertility treatment. Embryo transfer is, however, one of the most crucial steps in assisted reproductive technologies. The realization of this ultimate gesture involves the control of numerous parameters that exert an impact on its success. These various influential factors engage the multidisciplinary team: biologist, clinician... to permanently search for ways to optimize embryo transfer outcome.
