Exaggerated placental site mimicking placental site trophoblastic tumor: case report and literature review. Exaggerated placental site is defined as a non-neoplastic trophoblastic lesion featuring exuberant infiltration into the endometrium and myometrium by intermediate trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Exaggerated placental site can occur following normal or ectopic pregnancy, abortion, or hydatidiform mole. We encountered a case of reactive exaggerated placental site seven months following normal pregnancy that clinically mimicked placental site trophoblastic tumor. Few reports have described the clinical course, histopathology and differential diagnosis of exaggerated placental site we present our patient's case together with histopathological observations and review of related literature.
