Late recurrence of malignant melanoma mimicking ovarian malignancy. Malignant melanoma (MM) is an extremely malignant tumor with an unpredictable profile of spread and variable periods of remission.We describe an unusual case of malignant melanoma metastatic to the omentum occurring seven years after diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous malignant melanoma in the patient's arm. She received surgery and chemoimmunotherapy. To date, nine months after detection of malignant melanoma metastatic to the omentum, the patient is alive with no clinical and radiological metastatic disease.The diagnosis of omentum malignant melanoma in a living patient is uncommon, thus very few individuals and referral centers can build up an adequate experience of handling this disease. Optimal management has been a challenge and a subject of debate and has not yet been established.
