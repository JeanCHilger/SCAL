3D CT-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer: clinical impact on late rectal bleeding and local control. To identify the impact of 3D CT-based high-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy (ICR) on late rectal bleeding (LRB) and local control (LC) in patients with cervical cancer.The outcomes of 97 consecutive patients treated with 3D CT-based ICR (3D-ICR) were compared with those of 133 consecutive historical patients with conventional 2D brachytherapy planning (2D-ICR). The median follow-up periods were 41 and 56 months for the 3D and 2D groups, respectively.The overall rectal bleeding rate was similar between the groups (42% for 3D-ICR vs. 44% for 2D-ICR) however, the incidence of severe LRB was higher in the 2D-ICR group than in the 3D-ICR group (13% vs. 2%, respectivelyThe implementation of 3D-ICR in radiotherapy for cervical cancer can reduce the incidence of severe LRB and may improve the LC rate.
