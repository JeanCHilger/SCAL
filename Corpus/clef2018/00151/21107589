The relationship between serum testosterone levels and bladder storage symptoms in a female population with polycystic ovary syndrome. To examine the relationship between bladder symptoms and serum testosterone levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 140 patients diagnosed with PCOS according to ESHRE/ASRM criteria in two clinics were evaluated for the effects of testosterone on bladder symptoms. The effect of testosterone on bladder symptoms was quantified by self-administered pelvic pain and urgency/frequency questionnaire (PUFq) and an extra special question performed for urge incontinence. Ultrasonographic bladder capacity and postvoid residual volume were also recorded in all patients. Correlation between serum testosterone level and total, symptom and bother scores of PUFq, score of each question of PUFq separately, and ultrasonographic findings were analyzed.The median (range) age, testosterone, DHEAS, estradiol, glucose, urine pH, urine density, ultrasonographic bladder capacity, and PUFq score were 25 years (17-40), 53 ng/dl (25-229), 258 Âµg/dl (92-645), 74 pg/ml (20-184), 81 mg/dl (62-128), 5.5 (4.8-7.0), 1.015 (1.001-1.028), 400 ml (100-650), and 2.5 (0-23), respectively. Significant positive correlation was found between serum testosterone level and total, symptom and bother scores of PUFq, symptom of dyspareunia, urgency, nocturia, and bladder/pelvic pain. There was no correlation between serum testosterone level and ultrasonographic findings such as bladder capacity, postvoid residual volume and symptom of frequency.This study indicates that women who have higher serum testosterone level are more likely to report bladder symptoms.
