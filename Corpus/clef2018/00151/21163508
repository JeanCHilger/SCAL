Exvivo ultrasound attenuation coefficient for human cervical and uterine tissue from 5 to 10 MHz. Attenuation estimation and imaging in the cervix has been utilized to evaluate the onset of cervical ripening during pregnancy. This feature has also been utilized for the acoustic characterization of leiomyomas and myometrial tissue. In this paper, we present direct narrowband substitution measurement values of the variation in the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient in ex vivo human uterine and cervical tissue, in the 5-10 MHz frequency range. At 5 MHz, the attenuation coefficient values are similar for the different orientations of uterine tissue with values of 4.1-4.2 dB/cm, 5.1 dB/cm for the leiomyoma, and 6.3 dB/cm for the cervix. As the frequency increases, the attenuation coefficient values increase and are also spread out, with a value of approximately 12.6 dB/cm for the uterus (both parallel and perpendicular), 16.0 for the leiomyoma, and 26.8 dB/cm for the cervix at 10 MHz. The attenuation coefficient measured increases monotonically over the frequency range measured following a power law.
