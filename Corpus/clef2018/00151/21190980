Sonographic measurement of mesenteric fat predicts presence of fatty liver among subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome. Visceral fat is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver. In this study, we examined the relationship between mesenteric fat thickness and other sonographic indices of adiposity and the presence of fatty liver among subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 117 Chinese subjects with PCOS were evaluated (mean age, 28.6 ± 6.5 yr mean body mass index, 24.3 ± 5.3 kg/m(2)). Anthropometric measurements and metabolic risk profile, including a standard oral glucose tolerance test, were assessed in all subjects. All subjects underwent an ultrasound examination for measurement of thickness of mesenteric, preperitoneal, and sc fat as well as evaluation for fatty liver.Forty-six (39.3%) of the subjects had fatty liver. PCOS subjects with fatty liver had higher body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and systolic blood pressure a more unfavorable lipid profile with higher triglycerideFatty liver is present in a significant proportion of Chinese patients with PCOS. Sonographic measurement of mesenteric fat is an independent determinant of fatty liver among subjects with PCOS and identifies subjects at increased cardiovascular risk.
