Serum paraoxonase 1 activity, asymmetric dimethylarginine levels, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. To evaluate endothelial function via serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels, paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Prospective case-control study.University hospital.Thirty patients with PCOS with a mean age of 24.33 Â± 4.50 years and 30 healthy controls matched for body mass index (BMI) and age.Endothelial function was assessed biochemically with serum ADMA levels and serum PON1 activity and functionally with brachial artery FMD by ultrasonography.Serum ADMA levels, serum PON1 activity, brachial artery FMD, hormonal and biochemical parameters.Patients with PCOS had higher levels of free testosterone and insulin, and higher waist-hip ratio and Ferriman Gallwey scores when compared with the controls. Fasting glucose and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not different between the groups. There was no statistically significant difference in ADMA levels between two groups. Serum PON1 activity and brachial artery FMD were statistically significantly lower in women with PCOS. There was negative correlation between ADMA and PON1 in patients with PCOS.Serum PON1 activity and brachial artery FMD, as markers of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, were statistically significantly lower in women with PCOS compared with healthy controls matched for age and BMI. Endothelial dysfunction may be seen at earlier ages in patients with PCOS.
