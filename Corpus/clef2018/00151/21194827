Efficacy of mefenamic acid and hyoscine for pain relief during saline infusion sonohysterography in infertile women: a double blind randomized controlled trial. To evaluate the efficacy and level of satisfaction from mefenamic acid and hyoscine when used for pain relief during saline infusion sonohysterography.In this double blind randomized controlled trial, 141 nulliparous women were allocated to receive 500 mg of mefenamic acid, 10mg of hyoscine or a placebo, which was packed in the same outer capsule. Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) was performed 30 min later by one operator. Pain and satisfaction scores were evaluated using a 10 cm visual analog scale. Baseline characteristics, pain and satisfaction scores were compared among the three groups. Pain scores were recorded before, after catheter insertion, during, immediately after, and 30 min after the procedure.No statistically significant differences were found in baseline characteristics, pain and satisfaction scores among the three groups. Maximum pain during SIS was 4.40 ± 3.34, 4.67 ± 3.14 and 4.85 ± 3.19 in the mefenamic acid, hyoscine and placebo groups respectively. There was a 31.1% prevalence of intrauterine abnormality and the most frequent finding was endometrial polyp.There is no benefit in using mefenamic acid and hyoscine in the prevention of pain occurring from SIS.
