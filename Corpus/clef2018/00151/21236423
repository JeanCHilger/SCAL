Hyperstimulation during IVF cycles does not modify dimensions of small subserosal and intramural leiomyomas. To evaluate the influence of IVF on the dimension of leiomyomas, we selected 72 women with small intramural or subserosal leiomyomas and assessed the size of these lesions before and after the treatment cycle. The mean ± SD diameters of the tumors at these two time points were 20.5 ± 9.5 and 20.6 ± 10.2 mm, respectively, thus supporting the conclusion that IVF does not influence the growth of these lesions.
