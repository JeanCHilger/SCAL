Comparison of diagnostic accuracy of saline infusion sonohysterography, transvaginal sonography and hysteroscopy. We aimed to compare the accuracy of transvaginal sonography (TVS), saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) and hysteroscopy (HS) for uterine pathologies among infertile women. A total of 346 patients were selected for operative hysteroscopy, following SIS after TVS. SÄ°S was performed with a Cook Soft 500 IVF catheter. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated to compare the accuracy of TVS, SIS and hysteroscopy for uterine abnormalities. SIS showed a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 100% and PPV of 100% for endometrial hyperplasia, and a sensitivity and NPV of 100% for polypoid lesions. For submucosal myoma SIS showed a sensitivity of 99% with PPV of 96%. Hysteroscopy had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 98%, 83%, 96% and 91%, respectively for overall uterine pathologies. Finally, SIS seems to be superior to TVS, for uterine pathologies, with respect to hysteroscopy as the gold standard.
