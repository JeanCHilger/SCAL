Correlation between testicular parenchymal echogenicity and male infertility. To verify the correlation between echogenicity of testicular parenchyma and male fertility parameters.The study included 101 patients who referred to the urologists for couple infertility. Male patient underwent anamnestic assessment, physical examination, screening for hormonal serum levels (FSH, LH, testosterone, prolactine), sperm analysis, sperm culture and testicular ultrasound with registration of testicular volume and mean testicular echogenicity. The data has been recorded in a database and analyzed for possible statistical correlations.The variable "mean testicular echogenicity" was compared with every response variable. Non-statistical significance was found between mean testicular echogenicity and mean serum levels of testosterone, prolactin, and patient age or with the single semen sample parameters.Mean testicular echogenicity does not correlate with any of the male fertility parameters examined. Higher numbers are needed to define the possible role of parenchymal echogenicity to predict infertile patients.
