Evaluation of endometrial and subendometrial vascularization and endometrial volume by 3-D power Doppler ultrasound and its relationship with age and pregnancy in intrauterine insemination cycles. To measure endometrial volume and endometrial-subendometrial vascularization by 3-D power Doppler ultrasound in patients undergoing cycles of artificial insemination with ovarian stimulation, to evaluate their relationship with patients' age and pregnancy development.We included patients with primary and secondary infertility of one year of evolution. We measured vascular indexes and endometrial volume by 3-D power Doppler ultrasound.Seventy-nine consecutive cycles were studied. Endometrial volume average was 4.7 Â± 2.66 ml. We did not find any difference between the endometrial volumes in women who did versus did not become pregnant (9 vs. 70 women, respectively). The endometrial vascular index was significantly higher in patients aged between 31 and 33 years old. In patients between the ages of 31 and 33, both the endometrial flow index (FI p = 0.017) and the endometrial vascular FI (p = 0.013) were higher. At the subendometrial area, the vascular FI was lower in women older than 33 years old (p = 0.024), while the FI was higher in patients that achieved pregnancy (p = 0.047).Endometrial volumes were independent of pregnancy development. Endometrial and subendometrial vascularization FIs were significantly higher in younger women. The subendometrial FI was significantly higher in patients who achieved pregnancy.
