Assessment of postoperative postvoid residual bladder volume using three-dimensional ultrasound volumetry. The aim of our prospective study was to assess the concordance between postvoid residual volumes (PVR) of the urinary bladder obtained by two different three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound (US) volumetric methods (VOCAL and XI VOCAL) and with measurement by the catheter in postoperative patients who have undergone radical hysterectomy. The 3-D sonographic volume-determination of PVR with both methods correlated significantly with the actual amount of PVR by the catheter. The accuracy of both 3-D US volumetric methods was significantly higher under 300 mL of PVR. Bland-Altman plots were generated to examine limits of agreement. Both noninvasive 3-D sonographic methods are appropriate for the correct volume-determination of PVR following radical hysterectomy. Thus, we may avoid routine, albeit often unnecessary, catheterization to measure postoperative residual bladder volumes and subsequently the incidence of lower urinary tract infection may be reduced and better postoperative comfort for patients may be permitted.
