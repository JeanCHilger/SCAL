Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog therapy of uterine fibroid: analysis of results obtained with buserelin administered intranasally and goserelin administered subcutaneously as a monthly depot. From January 1987 to February 1988 patients affected by uterine fibroid were offered medical treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs as an alternative to surgery. The aim was to compare results obtained with two different analog formulations. 42 patients were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal buserelin, preceded by a short period of subcutaneous injections (500 micrograms thrice daily for 10 days) or subcutaneous goserelin. Treatment was always started in the luteal phase. Response to therapy was evaluated through periodic clinic, endocrine and echotomographic controls. There were no significative differences in fibroid reduction between the two treatment groups. After 6 months of treatment, a fibroid reduction of more than 30% of the initial volume was observed in 16 patients in the buserelin group and in 18 patients in the goserelin group. The fibroid regrowth observed in all patients during the follow-up period severely limits the usefulness of this medical approach to selected clinical cases.
