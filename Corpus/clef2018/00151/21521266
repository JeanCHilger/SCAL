Uterus and ovaries in girls and young women with Turner syndrome evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. To determine uterine and ovarian size in Turner syndrome (TS) and to compare uterine and ovarian size evaluated by transabdominal ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in girls with TS and two groups of controls.A cross-sectional study.Forty-one girls with TS (17·0 ± 3·3 years, range 11·2-24·9 years), 50 healthy age-matched controls (16·9 ± 3·2 years, range 12·5-25·0 years) and 107 Tanner-stage-matched controls (15·0 ± 3·2 years, range 10·1-24·2).Uterine and ovarian volume by US and MRI.Ovaries were detected in 37% in TS by US and in 55% in TS by MRI (P = 0·1). Total ovarian volume was lower in TS compared to both groups of controls (TS vs C-US: median 1·1 ml (range 0·1-29·3) vs 11·52 ml (1·9-77·9), P = 0·001, TS vs C-MRI: 1·0 ml (0·1-34·2) vs 13·2 ml (2·4-30·1), P < 0·0005). Mean difference in total ovarian volume measured by MRI and US in patients with TS was 2·3 ± 3·8 ml (P = 0·01). Mean uterine volume by MRI was lower in TS compared to controls (29·5 ± 25·1 vs 54·3 ± 23·3 ml, P < 0·0005). Uterine volume by US was lower in TS at Tanner stage B5 compared to controls (TS vs C: 33·6 ± 18·2 vs 50·2 ± 18·0 ml, P = 0·007).A larger ovarian volume was detected by MRI in TS compared to US. This finding is important with the advancements of performing ovarian biopsies for cryopreservation and later reimplantation. Mean uterine volumes by MRI and US in fully matured TS were lower compared to controls despite appropriate hormonal replacement therapy in TS.
