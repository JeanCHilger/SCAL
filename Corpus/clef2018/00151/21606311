Does the type of intrauterine device affect conspicuity on 2D and 3D ultrasound? The objective of our study was to assess the conspicuity and position evaluation of intrauterine devices (IUDs) on 2D ultrasound and 3D ultrasound in nongravid patients.Review of the ultrasound database for the period from July 2008 through June 2009 was performed for identification of patients with IUDs, of the type and position of the IUD, and of the patient's presenting symptoms. The conspicuity of the IUD on 2D sagittal and transverse planes and 3D coronal views was scored according to a 7-point scale. Data analysis was performed using the Student t test and the Pearson chi-square test.Of the 269 patients with IUDs who had undergone ultrasound during the study period, 180 patients had a copper IUD 59, a levonorgestrel-releasing deviceThe levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is significantly less conspicuous than the copper IUD on 2D imaging. Three-dimensional ultrasound enhances the conspicuity of both types of IUD.
