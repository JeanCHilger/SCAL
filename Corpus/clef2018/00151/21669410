Abnormal expression of growth differentiation factor 9 and bone morphogenetic protein 15 in stimulated oocytes during maturation from women with polycystic ovary syndrome. To investigate the expression pattern of two oocyte-secreted factors-growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BM15)-during oocyte maturation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in controls and to evaluate the expression differences in oocytes between the two groups.Case-control study.University-affiliated hospital.Twenty-five oocytes were obtained from 12 patients with PCOS and 82 oocytes from 56 controls.None.The abundance of GDF9 and BMP15 mRNA in oocytes of the germinal vesicle (GV), metaphase I (MI), and MII stage.The expression of GDF9 and BMP15 mRNA displayed dynamic changes during oocyte maturation in controls after ovarian stimulation, with a decline at the MI stage and an increase to the peak at the MII stage. However, their expression in oocytes from patients with PCOS demonstrated a reduced state without any dynamic change.The results suggest that the expression of GDF9 and BMP15 in oocytes from patients with PCOS cannot reach the normal level even after ovarian stimulation and that the expression pattern is abnormal during oocyte maturation, which may be associated with impaired oocyte quality and developmental competence in PCOS.
