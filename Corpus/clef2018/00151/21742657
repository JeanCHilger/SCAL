An alternative system for transvaginal removal of dermoid cyst and a comparative study with laparoscopy. The objective was to introduce a new system for transvaginal removal of ovarian cyst and to evaluate its feasibility. With a new transvaginal system, ultrasound-assisted culdotomy, and laparoscopy supported cystectomy if vaginal procedure failed. The authors conducted a retrospective review in which 35 cases using new vaginal ovarian cystectomy were compared with 40 cases of laparoscopic cystectomy for the treatment of dermoid cyst. All cystectomies were completed without conversion to laparotomy and complications. In a case from vaginal group, laparoscopy was required. No differences existed in operating time, hemoglobin decrease, and C-reactive protein value between groups. Laparoscopically supported vaginal ovarian cystectomy with ultrasound-guided culdotomy was equivalent to laparoscopic cystectomy as to invasiveness and preserved the option of a completely vaginal approach. When a presumed benign dermoid cyst is located in cul-de-sac, this operation may represent a preferable alternative to an exclusively laparoscopic or exclusively vaginal ovarian cystectomy.
