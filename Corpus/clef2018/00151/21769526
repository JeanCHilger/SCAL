Menstrual irregularity and poly cystic ovarian syndrome among adolescent girls--a 2 year follow-up study. To study the clinical outcome after a gap of 2 years, among adolescent girls with confirmed menstrual irregularity and with or without ultrasound diagnosed polycystic ovaries.136 adolescent girls from a cohort of 301 girls between 15 and 17 years of age with confirmed menstrual irregularity, with or without ultrasound diagnosed polycystic ovaries, were assessed in detail after a gap of 2 years. Present menstrual history and symptoms as well as signs of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were recorded, apart from ultrasound scanning of abdomen. PCOS was diagnosed using Rotterdam's consensus criteria and a comparative analysis was done among cases with and without PCOS.In the phase-II study done after a gap of 2 years, there was a statistically significant lower percentage of irregularities in menses, acne and enlarged thyroid, but a statistically significant increase in hirsuitism as compared to Phase-I study. Of the 136 cases reported, 36.0% cases were found to have PCOS and 63.9% cases were normal. Comparison of the two groups showed a statistically significant higher percentage difference in prevalence of irregular menses (59.9%), hirsuitism (56.3%), acne (17.8%), obesity (17.3%), polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (47.8%) and clinical hyperandrogenism (56.1%) among those with PCOS as against those without PCOS.The results of this study support screening for menstrual irregularity, obesity and signs of clinical hyperandrogenism for early diagnosis of PCOS in an effort to improve the reproductive health of adolescent girls.
