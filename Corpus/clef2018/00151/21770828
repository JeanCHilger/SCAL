Evaluation of body fat distribution in PCOS and its association with carotid atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to compare body fat distribution in PCOS with healthy controls and to investigate the factors associated with carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT) and insulin resistance.A case control study was conducted in 46 women with PCOS and 43 age matched controls. Anthropometrical measurements, hormonal levels, lipid and glucose profile were evaluated. Body fat thickness in four regions and carotid IMT were measured. Body fat distribution was compared between groups. Correlation of these parameters with carotid artery IMT and insulin resistance was investigated.Visceral and subcutaneous fat thickness and the mean carotid artery IMT were significantly higher in PCOS subjects (p < 0.01). In correlation analysis, age, body mass index (BMI) and waist hip ratio (WHR) showed correlation with carotid artery IMT (r = 0,55, p < 0,001 r = 0.41, p < 0.008 and r = 0.34 p = 0.03, respectively), whereas visceral fat thickness presented a correlation with HOMA-IR index as a sign of insulin resistance.Fat accumulation is more prominent in visceral and subcutaneous regions in PCOS. Increased BMI and abdominal type of obesity are closely related to the increased carotid artery IMT and insulin resistance. Weight control and regional weight loss are important part of the treatment for the future health of women with PCOS.
