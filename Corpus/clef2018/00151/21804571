Seminal vesicles and diabetic neuropathy: ultrasound evaluation in patients with couple infertility and different levels of glycaemic control. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound characteristics of the seminal vesicles (SVs) of infertile patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic neuropathy (DN) and to investigate possible changes in ultrasound characteristics related to glycaemic control. To accomplish this, 45 infertile patients with type 2 DM and symptomatic DN were selected. Twenty healthy fertile men and 20 patients with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia without DM represented the control groups. DM patients were arbitrarily divided into three groups according to glycaemic control level (A=glycosylated haemoglobin <7% B=glycosylated haemoglobin between 7% and 10%
