Endometrial/uterine corporeal volume ratio (EV/UCV) as predictor of malignancy in women with postmenopausal bleeding. To evaluate the role of endometrial/uterine corporeal volume ratio for the prediction of endometrial malignancy in cases of postmenopausal bleeding.Endometrial volumes and uterine body volumes excluding cervices measured by VOCAL (virtual organ computer-aided analysis) were estimated in 160 women with postmenopausal bleeding. Endometrial/uterine corporeal volume ratios were calculated for all. Endometrial biopsies and histopathological results were obtained for all. One hundred normal postmenopausal women were included as controls.Histopathological results of the 160 women with postmenopausal bleeding revealed 53 atypia, 27 endometrial cancer and 80 benign conditions. An endometrial/uterine volume (EV/UCV) ratio of a cutoff value >0.017 was predictive of malignancy. Endometrial/uterine volume ratio was more sensitive than endometrial volume and endometrial thickness for prediction of endometrial cancer.An endometrial/uterine volume ratio (EV/UCV) >0.017 is predictive of malignancy. (EV/UCV) was more accurate in the prediction of malignancy than endometrial thickness and endometrial volume.
