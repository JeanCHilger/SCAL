Male accessory gland infection frequency in infertile patients with chronic microbial prostatitis and irritable bowel syndrome: transrectal ultrasound examination helps to understand the links. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of male accessory gland  infection (MAGI) in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) plus  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to compare the sperm parameters of patients  with or without MAGI. In addition, another objective of this study was to  evaluate the ultrasound characterization of the anatomical space between the  posterior wall of the prostate and the anterior wall of the rectum using  transrectal ultrasonography. Fifty consecutive patients with the following  criteria were enrolled: 1) infertility, 2) diagnosis of CBP, and 3) diagnosis  of IBS according to the Rome III criteria. The following 2 age-matched control  groups were also studied: infertile patients with CBP alone (n = 56) and  fertile men (n = 30) who had fathered a child within the previous 3 months.  Patients and controls underwent an accurate patient history administration of  the National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index and  the Rome III questionnaires for prostatitis and IBS, respectively
