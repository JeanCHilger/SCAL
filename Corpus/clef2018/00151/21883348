Impaired gallbladder motility and the effect of metformin therapy in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.   Impaired gallbladder (GB) emptying is a well-documented contributor to gallstone formation. The aim of this study was to evaluate GB motility in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  The study population consisted of 36 PCOS patients and 20 healthy controls. GB volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula (π/6 × L × D × W) after three-dimensional measurements were made by ultrasound [length (L), width (W) and depth (D)]. Following the determination of fasting GB volume (V0), patients were given a standard liquid meal. GB volume measurement was then repeated after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 90 min. Gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) was calculated after each measurement. PCOS patients were re-evaluated after a 12-week course of metformin therapy at a dose of 1000 mg/day.  Mean baseline GB volume (V0) was significantly higher in the patient group compared to the control group (27·2 ± 12·5 cm(3) vs 13·3 ± 7·0 cm(3) , P < 0·001). While baseline GBEF values were similar between groups, increases in GBEF were significantly lower in the PCOS group starting from 20 min after consumption of a standard test meal. A 12-week course of metformin therapy resulted in significant improvements in GB volume and GBEF values with a reversal of metabolic and hormonal abnormalities.  For the first time in the literature, we managed to demonstrate impaired GB motility in patients with PCOS. Metformin therapy not only improves the metabolic and hormonal imbalances associated with PCOS but also has a positive influence on GB motility.
