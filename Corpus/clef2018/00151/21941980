Intestinal surgery and surgery of urinary tract in treatment of recurrent cervical cancer--case report. A case of a 31-year-old patient admitted to the Institute with a diagnosis of recurrent cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy and radiation therapy 12 months before. The patient had intestinal and urinary obstruction and also the tumor compressed the iliac blood vessels superficially. She underwent clinical examination, pelvic and abdominal ultrasound and multislice CT scan. A recurring tumor with a diameter of 7 cm was diagnosed. It was localized in the left parailiac and obturator region and infiltrated the left ureter, left bladder side wall, sigmoid colon and iliac blood vessels superficially. The patient had left pelvic sidewall relapse, so she underwent a palliative surgical procedure. We evacuated the complete tumor together with the infiltrated parts of the left ureter, sigmoid colon and bladder. At the end of operation left ureterocystoneostomy was performed as well as the Hartmann procedure with anus praeter insertion. There were no significant postoperative complications. After the surgical treatment of the recurrence, we suggested that the patient continue treatment of her disease with chemotherapy.
