Clinical application of 64-slice computed tomographic angiography-based virtual colonoscopy in the diagnosis of colonic tumors. To investigate the clinical value of 64-slice computed tomographic angiography (CTA)-based virtual colonoscopy in the diagnosis of colonic tumors.Philips/Brilliance 64 CT volumetric scanning was performed in 8 patients with colonic cancer and 2 with colonic polypi identified by postoperative pathological examination. Mimics software was used for surface rendering of the intestine with the Marching Cubes algorithm for 3-dimensional (3D) virtual endoscope (VE) reconstruction and CTA-based 3D reconstruction of the large intestine and the surrounding structures. The location, volume and appearance of the lesions displayed by the virtual techniques were compared with the pathological results.The 3D reconstruction was successfully completed in all the 10 cases, and the imaging diagnoses showed a total match with the pathological diagnoses. No significant differences were found between virtual endoscopy and CT virtual endoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy combined with digital model reconstruction provided valuable information for accurate identification of the position of the lesions and the complex adjacent anatomical structures.Virtual colonoscopy based on 64-slice CTA, when combined with 3D reconstruction technique, allows accurate display of the colonic lesions and potential metastasis, which can be crucial for clinical staging and surgical planning of colonic cancer.
