Plasma renin and aldosterone levels in obese and non-obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome. To assess plasma renin and aldosterone levels in obese and non-obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Obese women (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m2 group A, n=34) and non-obese women (BMI<25 kg/m2Obese and non-obese women with PCOS had higher luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, androstenedione, testosterone, and insulin levels as compared to women in the control group (p<0.05). Women with PCOS had significantly higher renin levels (group A: 50.2±4.9 picoU/mL, group B: 39.9±2.7 picoU/mL, and group C: 24.6±2.6 picoU/mL), plasma renin activity (group A: 3.7±0.3 ng/mL/h, group B: 3.6±0.3 ng/mL/h, and group C: 2.2±0.4 ng/mL/h), and aldosterone levels (group A: 31.2±3.3 ng/dL, group B: 29.3±2.9 ng/dL, and group C: 22.2±3.9 ng/dL) as compared with controls.Significant differences exist in plasma renin and aldosterone levels between obese and non-obese women as compared with polycystic ovary syndrome and normal controls.
