Predictive values of the ultrasound parameters, CA-125 and risk of malignancy index in patients with ovarian cancer. Assessment of predictive values for CA-125, ultrasound features (US) and risk of malignancy index (RMI) in ovarian malignancy.115 patients, divided into: 1) group-A (n = 41)--ovarian malignancy group-B (n = 74)--benign ovarian tumor1) patients of group-A were older (p < 0.05) CA-125 < 35 U/ml predominated in group-B (p < 0.001)CA-125 and US, as single criteria were not accurate. RMI is good indicator only in correlation with CA-125.
