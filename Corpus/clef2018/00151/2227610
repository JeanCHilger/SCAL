Transvaginal ultrasound is an effective method for screening in polycystic ovarian disease: preliminary study. To assess the usefulness of transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) for screening in polycystic ovarian (PCO) disease, we symptomatically and endocrinologically compared 9 cases (group A) with PCO noted by transabdominal ultrasound scanning (TAS) with 8 cases (group B) with PCO noted by TVS only. No difference in the mean value of LH/FSH ratio, E1/E2 ratio and testosterone was observed between the two groups. However, the frequency of endocrine abnormalities, menstrual disorders and hypertrichosis in group A was significantly more than in group B. Therefore, we suggest that the stage of PCO noted by TAS is more progressive than that noted by TVS only and TVS is useful for screening of PCO disease.
