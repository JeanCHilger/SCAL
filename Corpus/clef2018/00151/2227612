Treatment of large fibroids with high doses of gestrinone. Twenty-four women with large, myomatous uteri, measuring between 218.7 and 2,920 cm3 were treated with gestrinone, a tri-enic steroid with antiestrogen and antiprogesterone properties. In order to saturate the receptors of the large myomata, the doses used to treat these women were twice the recommended dosage of 2.5 mg, 3 times weekly, used to treat smaller tumors. The treatment lasted 6 months to 1 year. In all cases there was a reduction in uterine volume. In the 24 patients, the mean uterine volume of 724.9 cm3 on admission decreased to 450.73 cm3 at 6 months. For 14 patients treated for a full year, the mean uterine volume of 689.73 cm3 decreased to 329.22 cm3. Menstruation was suppressed in all patients by the end of the 2nd month of treatment. Episodic bleeding occurred in 6 patients but in only 1 did this last longer than 1 week. Other symptoms such as pelvic discomfort and dysuria disappeared or were significantly alleviated by the 2nd month of treatment. Side effects included seborrhea, acne, nervousness, myalgia and arthraglia, hoarseness and mild hirsutism but all these symptoms were promptly reversed following discontinuation. The mean increase in weight was 3.4 kg in 6 months. No menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and depression developed during this trial. Six patients complained of excessive sweating. Blood glucose creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, pyruvic and glutamic transaminases remained within the normal range.
