Laparoscopic-assisted resection of juvenile polyp of the jejunum in a 3-year-old girl. Sporadic juvenile polyp of the jejunum is exceedingly rare, reported only once in the English literature. We describe a 3-year-old girl with a long-lasting history of chronic iron deficiency anemia and a delayed diagnosis of jejunal polyp. The lesion was eventually discovered by ultrasonography and successfully resected using a laparoscopic-assisted transumbilical approach.
