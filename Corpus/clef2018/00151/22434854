A uterovaginal septum and imperforate hymen with a double pyocolpos. The presence of both a uterovaginal septum and imperforate hymen is described in a young patient presenting with ongoing chronic pelvic pain and a double pyocolpos. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed. The patient underwent laparoscopic adesiolysis, hymenotomy with drainage of 200 mL of pus, and excision of a complete longitudinal vaginal septum. Over the past 5 years of regular follow-up examinations, the patient has always reported regular menstrual cycles and an absence of pelvic pain.
