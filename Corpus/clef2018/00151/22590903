Primary pelvic hydatid cyst an unusual cause of cystic adnexal image (mass). Hydatid cyst is a parasitic human infection which is endemic in North Africa. It is more frequently localized in the liver and the lung. Involvement of others sites is usually secondary to these primary localizations. We report 2 exceptional cases of primary pelvic hydatid cyst diagnosed respectively in a 37-year-old and in a 48-year-old women. These cases will focus on the different characteristics of the infection, and the benefit of including epidemiologic arguments in using the diagnostical approach of adnexal masses.
