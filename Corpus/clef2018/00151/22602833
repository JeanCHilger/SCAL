Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma of uterus. Fibroid most commonly presents in the reproductive age group and presence of fibroid with postmenopausal bleeding is a rare entity and all investigations and measures should be done to rule out leiomyosarcoma. A 45-year-old female had attained menopause 3 year back and developed postmenopausal bleeding since 2 months, with palpable mass, of 24 weeks size. Ultrasonography showed multiple whorled mass lesions, endometrium and myometrium could not be seen separately. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy was performed. Intraoperative findings showed 24 weeks uterine mass with size 17.5×15.5×11.5 cm and weight 1.9 kg with multiple, intramural fibroids. Cut section of removed specimen showed black and yellow necrotic and haemorrhagic areas with degenerative changes suggestive of malignancy. Histopathology reported epithelioid leiomyosarcoma.
