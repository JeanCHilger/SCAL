Three cases of laparoscopic myomectomy performed during pregnancy for pedunculated uterine myomas. Laparoscopic myomectomy during pregnancy is indicated when symptoms related to uterine myomas persist despite pharmacologic therapy however, currently there is very little information concerning its safety.We report three cases of antepartum laparoscopic myomectomy performed to manage complicated myomas requiring surgical intervention.In particular, we report for the first time in literature the laparoscopic removal of two myomas in a patient during a single surgery performed in the 19th week of pregnancy followed by additional multiple myomectomy at the time of the cesarean section. All surgeries were without complication.Our experience suggests that laparoscopic myomectomy may be performed safely during pregnancy even more studies are needed to establish the exact rate of adverse events.
