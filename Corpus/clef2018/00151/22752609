The pregnancy outcome in women with incidental diagnosis of septate uterus at first trimester scan. Septate uterus seems to be strongly associated with an adverse pregnancy outcome. However, the possible relationship between septate uterus and miscarriage has only been retrospectively ascertained. The aim of our study was to describe the reproductive outcome in women with incidental diagnosis of malformed uterus at first trimester scan.Women at their first pregnancy attending our centre for a routine viability scan with an incidental suspicion of uterine anomaly at standard sonography were submitted to transvaginal volume ultrasound. All the cases with a 3D diagnosis of septate uterus were prospectively recruited and followed up.Overall 24 patients with a single intrauterine pregnancy were included at a median gestational age of 8.2 weeks. The cumulative pregnancy progression rate, as quoted by Kaplan-Meier algorithm, was 33.3% due to the occurrence of early (â‰¤ 13 weeks) or late miscarriages (14-22 weeks) in 13 and 3 cases, respectively.The pregnancy outcome is poor if a septate uterus is incidentally diagnosed in the early stage of a viable intrauterine pregnancy.
