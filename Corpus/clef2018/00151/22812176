Posplacenta intrauterine device. Guide wires not visible. Little information exists about the follow- up of the strings of intrauterine device (IUD) applied posplacenta. When the strings are of 10 cm in length are within the uterine cavity should be visible after postpartum involution.To know the incidence of visible strings of intrauterine device (IUD) after posplacental insertion and to establish guidelines of follow-up when strings are not seen.A prospective cohort study of 530 women with posplacental insertion of T Cu 380-A IUD with strings 10 cm long. Follow-up was at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after IUD insertion, at each visit women were questioned about IUD expulsion or removal and the cervix was inspected to visualize the strings of IUD. We analyzed the cumulative incidence of visible strings and procedures that were performed to locate the IUD when strings were not seen.At one year of follow-up the IUD was in situ in 398 women (75.1%), there were 44 expulsions (8.3%), 24 removals (4.5%) and 64 lost to follow up (12.1%). In women with IUDs in situ the strings were seen in 90.2% (n = 359) and were not seen in 9.8% (n = 39). In 65 women uterine cavity was probed identifying the IUD in situ in 64 cases, we performed 33 pelvic ultrasounds with IUDs in situ in 31 cases and in 2 cases with IUD in the cervical canal..Strings of IUD after postplacental insertion was seen in most women at one year of follow up. When we are reasonably sure the woman is not pregnant, interventions for the location of the IUD should be avoided. A pelvic ultrasound should be the initial procedure and usually sufficient to locate IUDs whose strings are not visible.
