Application of micro-computed tomography-based 3D visualization in diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer. To define the optimal development time of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) venography in cervical cancer patients and establish 3D CT-based digital  pelvic model of the patients.Thirty patients with cervical cancer stratified by FIGO surgical staging underwent micro-CT scanning of the arterial phase and the venous phase with a delay time of 70, 90 and 120 s. The images were interpreted independently by two experienced radiologists to define the optimal development time in venous phase and establish the imaging diagnosis. Based on the pelvic CT scan data, we segmented the images using the abdominal medical image-3D visualization system followed by 3D image reconstruction to establish the 3D digital pelvic model using FreeForm Modeling System to modify the reconstructed images.The optimal images were obtained by scanning with a 90-sec delay time. Micro-CT was not sensitive to IB1 phase or earlier phases (1/5), but efficient in advanced stages (â‰¥IB2 phase). In our cases, 25 were diagnosed by micro-CT with a diagnostic accuracy of 64%. Based on these CT data, the pelvic 3D model covering the main organs, vessels, cervical neoplasm, and supplying vessels of the tumor in the pelvic cavity were successfully reconstructed to allow spatial observations of the uterus and the neighboring organs.The 3D digital pelvic model reconstructed provides a means for staging cervical cancer and facilitates further surgical simulation studies.
