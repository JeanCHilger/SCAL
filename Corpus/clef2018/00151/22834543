High-precision MRI-guided adaptive brachytherapy for cervical carcinoma. Over the past 20 years advances in radiological technology have led to dramatic changes in cervical cancer management. External beam radiotherapy has evolved radically as a result of these changes. More recently, though, three-dimensional (3D) image guidance and volume-based prescribing has been adopted into cervical cancer brachytherapy. This overview covers the science and technology behind magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided adaptive brachytherapy and explains why it is now considered the new international standard of care.
