Genitourinary symptoms in patients with adenomyosis. Adenomyosis causes problems in women, including dysmenorrhea and abnormally heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding however, its etiology is unknown. We hypothesized that urinary symptoms are frequent in patients with adenomyosis and that they affect the patients' quality of life.We conducted a pilot study from September 2011 to December 2011. Ninety-one patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis comprised the study group (adenomyosis group). Ninety-four women with a normal-appearing uterine myometrium on ultrasound comprised the control group. Patients filled out two validated questionnaires, the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7). Patients also underwent a pelvic examination and urinary symptoms were recorded. Groups were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test.The frequency of urinary symptoms was significantly higher in the adenomyosis group than in the control group (P = 0.0001), including stress urinary incontinence, urgency, daytime frequency, urge urinary incontinence, and dyspareunia. Total UDI scores were significantly higher in the adenomyosis group than those in the control group (P < 0.0001), as were IIQ scores of questions regarding social relations (P < 0.05).Our results suggest that urinary tract dysfunction is associated with adenomyosis and that urinary symptoms may affect patients' quality of life.
