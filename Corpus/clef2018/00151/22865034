Endometrial thickness measurement throughout a menstrual cycle in non-obese infertile patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. To analyze the changes in the endometrial thickness in infertile polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients throughout an entire menstrual cycle and compare the changes to those seen in infertile patients without PCOS.This prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in a total of 58 non-obese, infertile women with PCOS. The endometrial thickness was measured at three different times throughout the menstrual cycle by ultrasound. Age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched control group consisted of 62 non-obese infertile patients without PCOS. Demographic, hormonal and the ultrasonographic measurements of the two groups were compared.Day 3 levels of LH were significantly different between the groups (p=0.013). Ovarian volume measurement was significant between the groups (p=0001). All the endometrial thickness measurements in the early, mid-cycle and late luteal phases were also significantly different p=0.001 for all.The study demonstrated an increased endometrial stripe measurements throughout a menstrual cycle in infertile patients with PCOS, when compared to infertile patients without PCOS.
