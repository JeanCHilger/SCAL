Mesial side ovarian incision for laparoscopic dermoid cystectomy: a safe and ovarian tissue-preserving technique. To evaluate safety and efficacy, in terms of spillage risk and ovarian tissue preservation, of mesial incision for laparoscopic dermoid cystectomy.Randomized controlled trial.University.Sixty-seven women with dermoid cysts.Laparoscopic dermoid cystectomy performed by mesial incision (33 patients, study group) or antimesial incision (34 patients, control group).Spillage of intracystic content rate, operative times, chemical peritonitis rate, and intraoperative blood loss (ΔHb) as primary outcomes. Postoperative ovarian reserve (ΔFSH levels, basal antral follicle number, mean ovarian diameter, and peak systolic velocity at 3 and 12 months after surgery) as secondary outcome.Spillage of intracystic content rate and operative time were significantly lower in the study than in the control group. None developed chemical peritonitis. ΔHb was higher in the study group but not significantly. During the follow-up, median FSH values were significantly lower in the study group, with no differences in the E(2) levels. Moreover, median basal antral follicle number, median ovarian diameter, and median peak systolic velocity were significantly higher in the study group.Ovarian mesial-side incision appears to be a safe as well as tissue-sparing technique..
