The use of Le Fort I Approach in the resection of an extensive ossifying fibroma. Ossifying fibroma (OF) is a well-defined benign neoplasm characterized by slow growth and predilection for the posterior mandible site, usually treated by conservative surgical approaches. In this context, Le Fort I Approach (LFIA) has been increasingly used providing good visualization and an easy access to the lesion. It also allows removal of the lesion quickly. Although there are case reports using LFIA for the management of benign neoplasms, odontogenic cysts and tumors of the middle third of face, to our knowledge, only one article describes the use of surgical LFIA for OF of the maxilla. Thus, the objective of this study was to report the second paper on the use of horizontal osteotomy of the maxilla in the resection of an extensive OF and conduct a brief literature review on this surgical approach.The following case report describes a 33-year-old man who was diagnosed with OF. Oral examination showed a painless swelling of hard consistency, covered by normal mucosa in edentulous alveolar ridge of the maxillary posterior region of the right side. Tomographic slices revealed that the image with mixed density had a centrifugal growth, with expansion of the buccal and lingual cortical with an upper displacement of the maxillary sinus. The patient was admitted to the hospital for surgical resection of the lesion via LFIA. Satisfactory functional results were obtained after 18-month follow-up period. In addition, no recurrence or clinical complaints were noted.LFIA shall be considered as a feasible option when planning surgery for removal of extensive benign lesions located in midfacial region because it is a predictable technique and routinely performed by the oral and maxillo-facial surgeons.
