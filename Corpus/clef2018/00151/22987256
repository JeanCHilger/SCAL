Doppler of the uterine arteries combined with endometrial thickness correlate well with the degree of pituitary suppression in women treated with long-acting GnRH agonists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries and its association to endometrial thickness as a method to confirm pituitary suppression after administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues in assisted reproduction treatment cycles.A total of 70 patients using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for pituitary suppression for in vitro fertilization treatment were studied. To confirm down-regulation, serum estradiol levels and endometrial thickness were evaluated 10 days after gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues administration. When estradiol was <30 pg/ml and endometrial thickness was <3 mm, pituitary suppression was confirmed. Doppler velocimetric measurements were performed at the same day to study the pulsatility index of the uterine arteries, until pituitary suppression was confirmed.All 70 patients had normal ovarian morphology. For the patients who had estradiol levels ≤30 pg/ml, the mean pulsatility index of the uterine arteries was 2.95 ± 0.79 and for those who had levels >30 pg/ml the mean PI was 2.22 ± 0.8 (p = 0.005). For the patients who had endometrial thickness ≤5 mm the mean PI was 2.86 ± 0.82 and for those with endometrial thickness >5 mm the mean PI was 2.17 ± 0.79 (p = 0.004). Using a cut-off point of 2.51 for the pulsatility index, to compare to estradiol levels, we observed a sensitivity of 72.7 % and specificity of 71 %. The combination of Doppler velocimetric and endometrial thickness showed a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 82.3 %.Doppler velocimetric analysis of the uterine arteries can be an important tool in the diagnosis of the down-regulation after the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and might help simplify assisted reproduction programmes.
