Spontaneous perforation of pyometra in an elderly woman: a case report. Pyometra is an uncommon gynecologic condition that usually develops in elderly women. Most of the cases result from cervical occlusion by malignant or benign tumors, surgery, radiotherapy, or atrophic cervicitis. A spontaneous perforation of the uterus with generalized peritonitis is an extremely rare complication of pyometra and carries significant morbidity and mortality. Establishing a correct diagnosis preoperatively is not easy due to the non-specificity of the symptoms. The authors present a case report of peritonitis caused by spontaneously perforated pyometra that was diagnosed intraoperatively. The cervical canal was not occluded and the cause of perforation remains obscure.
