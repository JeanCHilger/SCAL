Sonographic appearances of soft tissue angioleiomyomas: differences from other circumscribed soft tissue hypervascular tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sonographic features of angioleiomyomas with priority given to the vascular pattern to help in the differential diagnosis from other hypervascular soft tissue tumors.The inclusion criteria for this retrospective and nonblinded study were fulfilled in 33 patients with circumscribed hypervascular soft tissue tumors based on pathologic identification. Thirteen cases were angioleiomyomas 9 cases were nonsubungual glomus tumorsAll of the angioleiomyomas were hypoechoic (100% [13 of 13]), a statistically significant result (P = .001). The type 1 vascular pattern was observed in 69% of the angioleiomyomas (9 of 13 P = .029), and the statistically significant shape was round (38% [5 of 13]Most angioleiomyomas reveal a homogeneously hypoechoic echo texture with a circumscribed margin and show straight and linear vessels in the tumor with convergence to one point on color Doppler sonography. These characteristics may be helpful when differentiating angioleiomyomas from other circumscribed hypervascular soft tissue tumors.
