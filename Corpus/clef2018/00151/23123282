Preoperative imaging of deeply infiltrating endometriosis in: Transvaginal sonography, rectal endoscopic sonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Compare the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS), rectal endoscopic sonography (RES), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before deeply infiltrating endometriosis surgery.A retrospective study with 25 deeply endometriosis patients underwent the three imaging examinations before surgery. Calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for the different locations: ovaries, uterosacral ligaments and torus, rectovaginal septum, rectosigmoid junction, bladder.Ovarian and deep pelvic endometriosis was found in surgery and confirmed by histology in all patients. Sensitivity and specificity are respectively: for ovaries: 88.2% and 71% of TVUS 80% and 81.2% of RESWe found that TVUS is the more performant for endometriomas, it is MRI for torus, uterosacral ligaments and little bladder lesions, RES for rectovaginal septum and rectosigmoid junction. So in the clinical practice, the three imaging examinations are complementary for the preoperative assessment of deeply endometriosis.
