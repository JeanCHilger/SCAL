Incidental genitourinary findings on obstetrics/gynecology ultrasound. Ultrasound is the standard-of-care imaging modality for initial imaging in obstetrics and gynecology. Given the close proximity of the genitourinary system to the uterus and adnexa, it is not surprising that these studies can result in the discovery of incidental genitourinary findings such as ureterocele, ectopic ureter, bladder mass, ureteral stones, cystitis, bladder diverticulum, and pelvic kidney. Recognition of the etiology of these findings is important for appropriate diagnosis and, at times, patient care. Many of these findings are truly incidental and clinically unimportant but other times can be related to the patient's chief complaint.
