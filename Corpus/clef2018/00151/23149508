Two-/three-dimensional transperineal sonography of complicated tape and mesh implants. Transperineal sonography (TPS) affords dynamic evaluation of suburethral slings using tensionless vaginal tape and mesh implants used to treat complications associated with surgical procedures of the pelvic floor. This review describes and illustrates the TPS findings in postoperative complications such as recurrent prolapse, cystocele, enterocele, and rectocele. The potential use of live 3-dimensional TPS to delineate the dynamics aspects of pelvic floor disorder is also mentioned.
