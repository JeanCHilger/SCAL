Split daily recombinant human LH dose in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism: a nonrandomized controlled pilot study. This prospective controlled nonrandomized pilot study was conducted to investigate whether split daily doses of recombinant human LH (rHLH) is more efficacious than the single daily dose in supporting follicular development and ovulation in primary hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH).
