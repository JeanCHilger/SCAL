The effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound in combination with cisplatin using a Xenograft model of cervical cancer. To determine whether the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation combined with cisplatin, compared with HIFU ablation, and cisplatin alone, facilitates tumor necrosis and reduces tumor volume in an animal model.The cervical cancer cell line SiHa was cultured and injected subcutaneously into female BALB/c nude mice. Animals that developed tumors were randomized to four groups: treatment with HIFU ablation and cisplatin (i.p. injection, 100 mg/mouse twice per week) cisplatin treatment aloneOut of the 32 animals that developed tumors, 25 had tumors able to be measured through subcutaneous palpation in the pretreatment period (control, n=7 HIFU ablation, n=7HIFU ablation combined with cisplatin facilitates reductions in tumor volume and increases in tumor necrosis and could be useful as another option in treating patients with cervical cancer.
