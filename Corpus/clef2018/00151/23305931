Management of ovarian cysts during pregnancy: Lille's experience and literature review. The aim of our study was to evaluate the practice of Lille in the management of ovarian cyst during pregnancy and to compare our results with data from the literature.The study was a retrospective cohort of Lille University Hospital between 1st January 2007 and 31st December 2010. The inclusion was based on the ultrasound diagnosis of an ovarian cyst greater or equal to 30mm during pregnancy. Obstetrical and neonatal data, surgical techniques and indications were analyzed.Seventy-one patients had a diagnosis of ovarian cyst during pregnancy, i.e., 0.35% of pregnancies followed at the University Hospital of Lille during the study period. The diagnosis took place in the first quarter in the majority of cases, at 12.30±6.99 weeks of amenorrhea (WA). Most often, the ovarian cyst is monitored during pregnancy, which has been strictly the case in 63.38% of cysts (45 patients). Fourteen patients had to be operated during pregnancy (19.72%). There were 7 emergency interventions and 7 programmed intrapartum interventions. Five intrapartum laparoscopies were performed at a mean term of 14.75±2.63 WA, and 9 laparotomies were performed at a mean term of 18.88±4.57 WA. Twelve ovarian mass surgeries were performed per caesarean section. Operated cysts are most often organic cysts (74.39%). No malignancies were observed, and 3 cases of borderline tumors were diagnosed. There were no obstetrical or neonatal complications.A simple monitoring is possible if the cyst is benign, less than 6cm and does not change. Surgery is required in an emergency or in case of suspicious signs of complications or malignancy. Laparoscopy can be widely used until the 2nd quarter. Lille's attitude respects the recommendations is consistent with the literature.
