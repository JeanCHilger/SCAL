Two- and three-dimensional ultrasonography and sonohysterography versus hysteroscopy with laparoscopy in the differential diagnosis of septate, bicornuate, and arcuate uteri. To estimate the diagnostic accuracy and to compare the diagnostic value of 3-dimensional sonohysterography (3D-SIS), 3-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography (3D-TVS), 2-dimensional sonohysterography (2D-SIS), and 2-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography (2D-TVS) (initial and expert diagnosis) in the differential diagnosis of septate, bicornuate, and arcuate uteri.Prospective clinical study (Canadian Task Force II-2).University hospital and private hospital and clinic.A total of 117 women with a history of recurrent abortions or infertility and a 2D-TVS initial diagnosis of a septate, bicornuate, or arcuate uterus.Expert 2D-TVS, 3D-TVS, 2D-SIS, and 3D-SIS performed by experienced examiners and hysteroscopy with laparoscopy to establish the final diagnosis.Hysteroscopy performed in conjunction with laparoscopy (HL) detected 23 arcuate, 60 septate, 22 bicornuate, and 12 normal uteri. 3D-SIS showed perfect diagnostic accuracy (100.0%) in general detection of uterine abnormalities, compared with initial 2D-TVS (77.8%), expert 2D-TVS (90.6%), 2D-SIS (94.0%), and 3D-TVS (97.4%). In the overall diagnosis of uterine anomalies, all of the diagnostic methods had statistically significantly better diagnostic value than initial 2D-TVS (p < .001), whereas 3D-SIS was the only method that was better than expert 2D-TVS (p < .001).Although 3D-SIS was identical to HL, with the highest accuracy, there was no significant difference in diagnostic value between 3D-TVS with 2D-SIS and 3D-SIS or between expert 2D-TVS and 3D-TVS with 2D-SIS. The high diagnostic value of these ultrasonographic tools questions the need for endoscopy in the differential diagnosis of the most common congenital uterine anomalies.
