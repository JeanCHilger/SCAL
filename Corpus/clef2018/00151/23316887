Ultrasonographic assessment of skin thickness in patients with PCOS - a case-control study. To measure skin thickness in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in comparison to controls and to examine a possible association with sex steroids, body mass index, lipid profile and hyperinsulinemia.Thirty patients with confirmed PCOS were compared to thirty-two women presenting for infertility workup. Skin thickness was measured using high-resolution ultrasound in a standardized area, blood samples were collected once at presentation.Patients with PCOS showed a statistically significant thicker skin than women in the control group (0.95 mm (±0.093 mm) versus 0.85 mm (±0.077 mm, p < 0.0001)). LH, estradiol, testosterone, the free androgen index, triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and body mass index were significantly increased in PCOS - patients. No correlation between hyperinsulinemia and skin thickness was seen.PCOS - patients showed a greater skin thickness in comparison to women without PCOS. This might be due to proliferative effects of sex steroids such as estrogens and testosterone and metabolic derangements on skin thickness.
