HDlive ultrasound images in assisted reproduction treatment. The volume ultrasound technology software known as the HDlive technique represents an innovative tool, a step towards an even more realistic anatomical visualization of pelvic organ structures. HDlive can help improve physician-patient communication with the aid of life-like images and might prove useful in the field of assisted reproduction treatment. The clinical application of this novel ultrasound technology in assisted reproduction treatment deserves scientific evaluation.
