Uterine artery embolization for leioyomas, ultrasonography and angiography aspects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degree of fibroid shrinkage which well correlates with symptom regression, and thus to assess the effectiveness of the procedure.31 patients were included in the trial after selection. All the patients were thoroughly evaluated before embolization, the following day and at a month after but also at 3 months for 10 of them. A certain protocol was followed passing through well established steps. The purpose was to discover and rule out any associated possible disease and to assess and grade the symptoms, ultrasound and angiographic aspects.Regarding the uterus, its volume evolution registered a descending trend, the mean decrease at 30 days being of 25% (-81,6 cm³) and at 90 days of 52%(-173,15 cm³). The fibroids also decreased statistically, the mean global variation at 30 days registering a decrease of -17,66 cm³(27%) and 61% at day 90. The mean global reduction at 30 days was of 44% (-33,18 cm³) and of 62% (-60,85 cm³) at 90 days. Absence of uterine anastomoses lead to proper fibroid decrease whereas their presence diminished the chances.The uterine and fibroid volumes registered a statistical volume decrease at 30 and 90 days in comparison with the volumes before embolization. Absence of uterine anastomoses led to proper fibroid decrease. Longer evaluation time is needed for an accurate evaluation of volume reduction degree.
