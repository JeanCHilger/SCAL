Mild hydronephrosis after uncomplicated hysterectomy. To explore differences in the incidence of hydronephrosis following different hysterectomy methods for benign gynecological disease.Retrospective chart review of ultrasound findings on all patients undergoing simple hysterectomy for benign gynecological pathology between July 2004 and September 2008. Elective renal ultrasonography was performed pre-operatively and within 3 days after hysterectomy as part of the routine follow-up in our hospital.Of 385 eligible patients, six were excluded because of pre-existing hydronephrosis or suspected intra-operative ureteral injury. In the resulting group of 379 patients, abdominal (33.3%), vaginal (11.8%) or laparoscopic hysterectomy (54.9%) was performed. The last group included total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH, 20.3%), laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LASH, 19.3%), and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH, 15.3%). Overall, 56.7% of patients showed mild hydronephrosis (5-15 mm pelvicalyceal dilatation) after surgery. Mostly, it occurred unilaterally. The incidence varied according to the type of procedure, the highest being documented following vaginal hysterectomy (64.4%) and the lowest after LASH (46.6%), but this did not reach statistical significance.Mild hydronephrosis is a frequent finding after uncomplicated hysterectomy for benign pathology in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Although not statistically significant, there may be variability of mild hydronephrosis depending on the hysterectomy method.
