Thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology: is there a place to virtual cytology? Telecytology has been used for education, training, and consultation. Cytological studies from gynecological, nongynecological and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) specimens (including studies of thyroid FNAC) analyzed the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of telecytology-based predominantly on static digital images. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic reproducibility of virtual cytology by measuring intraobserver and interobserver agreements among two cytopathologists, using the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) nomenclature. 502 glass slides from 222 cases of thyroid FNAC were retrieved and scanned by a high-resolution scanner generating whole slides images (virtual cytology). Conventional and virtual cytology were analyzed by a skilled cytopathologist and the intraobserver agreement rate was 77.5% with the corresponding κ value of 0.54, suggesting a moderate agreement between both methods. A second cytopathologist analyzed the same slides only by virtual cytology and the interobserver agreement rate was 80.2% with the corresponding κ value of 0.57, suggesting a moderate agreement between both cytopathologists. The virtual cytology resulted in a higher proportion of aspirates classified as nondiagnostic (20.3 and 14.9% for the first and second cytopathologist, respectively) as compared to conventional cytology (8.1%). Regarding specific diagnostic categories as defined by the BSRTC nomenclature, the follicular lesion of undetermined significance category presented the lowest concordance rates, corresponding to 5.9% intraobserver agreement and no (0.0%) interobserver agreement. We suggest that virtual cytology can be an alternative to conventional cytology in assessment of thyroid FNAC specimens, but nondiagnostic aspirates obtained by virtual cytology should be reassessed by conventional cytology.
