Postmenopausal bleeding due to a Cu-7 intrauterine device retained for thirty years. A retained intrauterine device is a rare, but easily correctable, cause of postmenopausal bleeding (PMB).A 64-year-old woman presented to her gynecologist with PMB. Sonographic evaluation of the endometrium revealed the presence of a Cu-7 IUD retained for at least 30 years. Hysteroscopically assisted retrieval of the IUD resulted in complete resolution of symptoms.A retained IUD should be considered in the differential diagnosis for PMB. In addition, the authors recommend pelvic sonography as the first-line diagnostic modality for PMB to aid the diagnosis of retained IUD as well as other pathology.
