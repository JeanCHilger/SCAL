Conservative treatment for complex neonatal ovarian cysts: a long-term follow-up analysis. We aimed to investigate safety and effectiveness of a conservative approach for complex neonatal ovarian cysts and its long term impact on fertility.Neonates with congenital complex ovarian cysts were conservatively managed and followed from the perinatal period to adolescence. Statistical analysis included Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, the Kaplan-Meier method, and the receiver operating characteristic curve.The post-natal progressive dimensional reduction of diagnosed ovarian cyst was statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed the probability of persistence of the cyst was up to 5% at the age of 25 months. Long term follow-up revealed both ovaries visible at US in 60% of adolescent patients.Conservative management of asymptomatic complex neonatal ovarian cysts can be safely undertaken. As far as the chances of the ovarian tissue to survive conservative treatment are concerned, the results are not encouraging.
