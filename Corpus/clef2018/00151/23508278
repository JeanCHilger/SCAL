Endometrial cancer: preoperative staging using three-dimensional T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and diffusion-weighted MR imaging at 3.0 T: a prospective comparative study. To prospectively assess the efficacy of 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using the three-dimensional turbo spin-echo T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted technique (3D-TSE/DW) compared with that of conventional imaging using the two-dimensional turbo spin-echo T2-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced technique (2D-TSE/DCE) for the preoperative staging of endometrial cancer, with pathological analysis as the reference standard.Seventy-one women with endometrial cancer underwent MR imaging using 3D-TSE/DW (b = 1,000 s/mm(2)) and 2D-TSE/DCE. Two radiologists independently assessed the two imaging sets. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for staging were analysed with the McNemar test the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) were compared with a univariate z-score test.The results for assessing deep myometrial invasion, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Az, respectively, were as follows: 3D-TSE/DW-observer 1, 87 %, 95 %, 85 % and 0.96 observer 2, 92 %, 84 %, 94 % and 0.95Accuracy of 3D-TSE/DW was at least equivalent to that of the conventional technique for the preoperative assessment of endometrial cancer.• New techniques in MR imaging help assess patients with endometrial cancer. • A 3D T2-weighted TSE sequence seems equally as accurate as conventional techniques. • Three-dimensional TSE/DW imaging does not require intravenous contrast material and is relatively quick. • Tumour extent of endometrial cancer can be clearly shown on diffusion-weighted images. • Junctional zone can be visualised well on 3D-TSE T2-weighted images.
