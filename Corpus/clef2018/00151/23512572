Impact of contrast-enhanced computed tomography colonography on laparoscopic surgical planning of colorectal cancer. To evaluate the impact of contrast-enhanced computed tomography colonography (CE-CTC) on laparoscopic surgery planning in patient with stenosing colorectal cancer.Sixty-nine patients with endoscopically proven colorectal cancer underwent CE-CTC, after incomplete conventional colonoscopy. Two experienced radiologists evaluated site, length, and TNM staging of colorectal cancers on three-dimensional double contrast enema-like views, 2D axial and multiplanar reconstructions. All the patients underwent colorectal resection and surgery bulletin, pathology of surgical specimens, and radiological follow-up at about 8 months were used as reference standard.The detection rate of colorectal cancer was 100 % (75/75) CE-CTC allowed for a diagnosis of a synchronous colorectal cancer in five patients (7 %). CE-CTC correctly judged the site of the lesions in all the casesInformation given by CE-CTC concerning colorectal cancer location and synchronous colonic cancers and polyps changed the laparoscopic surgical strategy in almost 14 % of patients.
