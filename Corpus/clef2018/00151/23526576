Endoscopic ultrasound in Barrett's oesophagitis with dysplasia. With the advent of conservative therapies including photodynamic therapy and endoscopic mucosal resection for Barrett's and high grade dysplasia, accurate staging has become increasingly important. We report our experience with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in these patients.Retrospective review of 25 consecutive patients referred for EUS for assessment of Barrett's with high grade dysplasia and /or stricture or polyp. The findings were compared with subsequent surgical pathology, or endoscopy and biopsy follow up.Nine patients were found to have invasive tumour on EUS and this was confirmed in all 9 either by oesophagectomy, OGD and oncology follow up, or by endoscopic mucosal resection. Eight patients underwent oesophagectomy, 5 for invasive tumour and 3 for dysplasia only, with pathological agreement with EUS findings in 7 out of 8 cases. The one discrepancy was a EUS case of mucosal thickening only with no invasion, but pathology showed a T1 lesion. Thirteen patients with no evidence of invasion were managed conservatively, with 11 patients being followed up for 6-12 months with serial OGD and biopsy, and no cases of more invasive disease occurring. Therefore, in our experience the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of EUS in complex Barrett's is 90%, 100% and 100% respectively.EUS is valuable in the assessment of high grade dysplasia in cases where conservative therapy is being considered, defining those with more deeply invasive tumour for whom radical treatment is the only option.
