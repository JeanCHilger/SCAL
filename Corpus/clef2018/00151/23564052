Effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound on sexual function in the treatment of uterine fibroids: comparison to conventional myomectomy. Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women. As a new minimally invasive clinical technology, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been widely applied to the treatment of uterine fibroids, but no study using objective criteria has evaluated the effect of HIFU on sexual function.A total of 100 premenopausal patients were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial (RCT). The brief index of sexual functioning (BISF-W) was used to evaluate changes in sexual function. Differences in the outcome were calculated for each individual before treatment and at 3 and 6 months after treatment, and changes were compared between the HIFU group (HIFUG) and the myomectomy group (MYG).Preoperative BISF-W scores were similar in both groups (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the two groups at 3 and 6 month after treatment. Within the groups, patients reported less arousal and less problems at 3 month compared to baseline. There was a trend toward improved sexual satisfaction and overall quality of sexual life in both groups 6 months after treatment compared with the baseline, although it failed to reach statistical significance except for the dimensions of relational satisfaction and problems affecting sexuality.Sexual function improved on average to some degree after both HIFU and conventional myomectomy.
