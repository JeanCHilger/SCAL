Value of the Linton-Nachlas balloon for the management of post-partum hemorrhage: a series of 25 cases. Post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) is the first cause of maternal mortality in France. Uterine tamponade is an alternative in the management of PPH. We investigated the efficiency of the Linton-Nachlas balloon in treating severe PPH in a French Guiana center where interventional radiology is not available.In this retrospective study, 25 women with severe PPH were included. Severe PPH is defined by the persistence of PPH despite sulprostone treatment. All women included in the study gave birth by vaginal delivery. The Linton-Nachlas balloon (Coloplast(®), France) used for digestive hemorrhage was inserted transvaginally. The primary endpoint for the efficiency was stopping PPH.The use of this balloon stopped the bleeding for 24 out of 25 patients (96 %). There was one case in which the treatment by the balloon was a failure. In that case, vaginal packing stopped the hemorrhage. No patient needed any complementary surgical treatment.This technique is a non-invasive, inexpensive, easy and efficient treatment. Most of the time, its use can stop hemorrhage and preserve fertility of young women wishing further pregnancies.
