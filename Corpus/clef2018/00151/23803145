Impact of obesity on endometrial blood flow in women without polycystic ovarian syndrome during intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Obesity may exert a negative effect on in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. However, the effect of obesity on the endometrium remains unknown. This study was designed to assess the effect of isolated body mass index (BMI) on endometrial blood supply in non-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women during ICSI by power Doppler Ultrasound.An observational prospective study was carried out. A total of 206 patients without PCOS were divided into 4 groups based on Chinese BMI classification (kg/m(2): underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (18.5 less than or equal to BMI < 24), overweight (24 less than or equal to BMI < 28), and obese (BMI greater than or equal to 28). Endometrial thickness, endometrial pattern, endometrial spiral arterial resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) values and systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) were assessed on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration.Obese patients required more doses of gonadotrophin and longer stimulation duration than the normal weight patients (P < 0.05). Endometrial thickness and pattern were not statistically different between the 4 BMI subgroups (P > 0.05). Subendometrial blood flow was detected in 165 (80.1%) patients and spiral arterial PI was significantly higher in the obese group than in the normal weight and underweight groups (P < 0.05). All parameters of ICSI outcome were comparable, including pregnancy and miscarriage rates.Obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 28 kg/m(2)) appears to exert a negative effect on endometrial and subendometrial blood flow based on the Chinese standard of obesity however, it seems to have no significant effect on ICSI outcomes in non-PCOS women.
