Intrauterine fetal therapy of NIHF with massive pleural effusion - a case study. Hydrops fetalis (fetal hydrops) is a serious fetal condition defined as abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more extravascular compartments, including ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and skin edema. Edema is classified as immune or non-immune. Today more than 90% of fetal edema has non-immune cause. This paper presents a case of a pregnant woman who was admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department because of fetal hydrops with massive pleural effusion and polyhydramnios at 34 weeks gestation. The intrauterine therapy consisted of two treatments. During the first surgery amnioreduction, evacuation of fluid from the pleural cavity of the fetus, and shunts to both pleural cavities were performed. During the second surgery amnioreduction, cordocentesis with albumin administration and pleural shunt were performed. Intrauterine therapy led to a reduction of swelling of the fetus from 7mm up to 1-2 mm and the total evacuation of fluid from the pleural cavity and the fetal lung expansion. We also present the condition of the neonate after birth and after 12 months of life.
