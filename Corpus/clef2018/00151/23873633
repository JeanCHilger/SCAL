Ultrasound for monitoring controlled ovarian stimulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of monitoring controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) using ultrasonography.We performed a search in April 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies that compared different methods for monitoring COS, including ultrasound assessment of follicles (alone or combined with hormonal assessment), in at least one group were considered eligible.The search retrieved 1515 records, six of which were eligible. Five studies were included that compared ultrasonography alone with ultrasonography and hormonal assessment (estradiol and/or progesterone) and one study compared 2D and 3D ultrasound monitoring. None of the included studies reported on live birth. Four of the five studies reported on clinical pregnancy (RR, 0.95 95% CI, 0.78â€“1.16Current evidence suggests that monitoring COS only with ultrasonography is unlikely to substantially alter the chances of achieving a clinical pregnancy and the number of oocytes retrieved is similar to that when monitoring with ultrasonography and hormonal assessment. For the other outcomes and comparisons, the available data are inconclusive. We believe that more studies evaluating the optimal procedure for monitoring COS are needed.
