Ovarian cyst mimicking ascites on abdominal ultrasonography in a prepubertal female. Ultrasonography has been commonly used in the diagnosis of intraabdominal cysts like ovarian cysts. Massive ovarian cysts can mimic ascites clinically (a condition termed pseudoascites) and ultrasonographically and can cause delay in the diagnosis and management. Clinicians should therefore consider other differential diagnoses in cases of large intraabdominal fluid collection. We report such a case in a prepubertal female which was diagnosed as ascites by ultrasonography initially but later turned out to be an ovarian cyst.
