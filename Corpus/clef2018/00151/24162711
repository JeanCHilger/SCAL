Endoscopic submucosal dissection of a leiomyoma originating from the muscularis propria of upper esophagus. The technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection is occasionally used for resection of myogenic tumors originating from muscularis mucosa or muscularis propria of stomach and esophagus. However, endoscopic treatments for esophageal myogenic tumors >2 cm have rarely been reported. Herein, we report a case of large leiomyoma originating from muscularis propria in the upper esophagus. A 59-year-old woman presented with dysphagia. Esophagoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography revealed an esophageal subepithelial tumor which measured 25 Ã— 20 mm in size, originated from muscularis propria, and was located at 20 cm from the central incisors. The tumor was successfully removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection and there were no complications after en bloc resection. Pathologic examination was compatible with leiomyoma.
