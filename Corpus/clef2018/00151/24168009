Intramural leoimyoma without endometrial cavity distortion may negatively affect the ICSI - ET outcome. To assess the impact of intramural fibroids on the intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer (ICSI-ET) cycle outcome, when there is no compression of the endometrial cavity.In this retrospective, matched control study, the ICSI-ET outcome of sixty-two patients (Group I) with intramural fibroid (mean diameter <7 cm) and normal endometrial cavity demonstrated by office hysteroscopy was compared with matched-control group of patients (n = 301) with no fibroid (Group II). The diagnosis of fibroids was done by transvaginal ultrasonography.The mean age in fibroid group was 32.66 +/- 5.30 while this figure was 32.95 +/- 3.98 in control group. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the fibroid group although fibroids not distorting the uterine cavity (25.8% vs. 39.9%, p = 0.04). In fibroid group the implantation rate was significantly lower than control group (20.97 +/- 37.93 vs.32.89 +/- 43.18%, p = 0.04). However, spontaneous abortion rate was higher in fibroid group but it did not reach the significant level (12.5% vs. 9.2%, p > 0.05).Women having intramural leiomyomas not encroaching on the uterine cavity have unfavorable ICSI/ET outcomes comparable to those of women without such leiomyomas. Therefore, myomectomy may be a good option for such patients with intramural fibroids even they do not have any endometrial distortion.
