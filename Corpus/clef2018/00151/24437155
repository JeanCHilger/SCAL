Peculiarities of diagnostics of hyperplastic processes in endometrium during long postmenopause. Comparative characteristics of hyperplastic processes are presented based on the results of ultrasound and postoperative histological studies. The informative value of ultrasound diagnostics of hyperplastic processes in endometrium during long postmenopause was estimated at 60%. Up to 40% of such diagnoses were not confirmed by histological studies of the material obtained by differential curettage of cervical canal and uterine walls. No evidence of the influence of human factor (diagnostic error) was obtained.
