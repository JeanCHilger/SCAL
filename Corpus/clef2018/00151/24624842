Endometrial pathology in elderly and senile age (a screening study). The results of an annual prophylactic medical examination were studied in 288 women aged 60-87 years. Primary and repeated visits revealed that 92.9% of the patients had endometrial pathology presented with glandular-fibrous polyps that both recurred and occurred de novo. Adenocarcinomas developing 4-14 years after polypectomy were diagnosed in 7.1% of the women. Focal impairments in the differentiation of an epithelial component of endometrial polyps in their recurrences and repeated development were noted in 97.3% of cases. In 88% of the patients, complaints were absent and recurrent endometrial pathology, including one of three adenocarcinomas, were diagnosed by prophylactic medical examination. The false-positive diagnoses of endometrial pathology by ultrasound study were 5.2%. Hysteroscopy in combination with morphology study should be recognized to be the gold standard for diagnosing pathologic endometrial lesions.
