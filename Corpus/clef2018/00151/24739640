Application value of three-dimensional female pelvic visualization modeling on transvaginal gynecological ultrasound imaging. To explore the application value of three-dimensional (3D) female pelvic visualization model on transvaginal gynecological ultrasound imaging.The second digital Chinese woman visible human datasets was selected, and a female pelvicvoxel-based model was constructed in Amira software for analog simulation combined with transvaginal gynecological ultrasound. The main structures and the space position variation of female pelvic cavity were observed, and the comparison study with conventional section of ultrasound was carried out.A high accuracy 3D visualization model of female pelvic was successfully constructed, and the anatomy structures can be dynamically and clearly displayed in any section orientation. An analog simulation research was carried out according to the scan mode of gynecological ultrasound, and a series of high resolution images consistent with scan sections of dynamic ultrasound were obtained, which had provided the optimal scan pathway for the fast inspection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries.The 3D female pelvic visualization model based on digital Chinese woman human datasets has provided detailed and accurate anatomy information for transvaginal gynecological ultrasound imaging, which could be the benefit for doctors to understand the ultrasound images of female pelvic, as well as the accurate positioning ability to the lesions of female pelvic cavity.
