The prevalence of polycystic ovary morphology among women attending a new teaching hospital in southern Nigeria. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of polycystic ovary morphology (PCO) among Nigerian women attending for pelvic ultrasound. This was a retrospective study of the ultrasound scan findings of all women who attended for pelvic ultrasound scan at a new teaching hospital in southern Nigeria from the commencement of ultrasound services on 1 March to 31 July 2010. The main indication for the scans was infertility (52.7%), and the commonest finding was fibroid (44.6%). Polycystic ovary morphology was present in 12.2% of the women. On average women with PCO were younger (30.3 v 35.0 years) and more likely to present with amenorrhea (33.3 v 7.6%) than women without PCO, but there was no other statistically significant differences between the two groups. This study suggests that Nigerian women have a low incidence of PCO morphology.
