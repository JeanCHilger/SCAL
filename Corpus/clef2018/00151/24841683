Ultrasound examination showed a normal uterus. The right ovary presented two complex masses of 7 and 3 cm in diameter, respectivelyThe case reported shows that exceptionally multiple and bilateral dermoid cysts may be detected underlining the importance of an accurate preoperative diagnostic imaging. Some recurrence of ovarian dermoid cysts may be due to undiagnosed small dermoid cists during preoperative imaging and/or surgical exploration.
