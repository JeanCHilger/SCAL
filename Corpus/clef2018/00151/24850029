A comparative study of the efficacy of sonosalpingography and hysterosalpingogram to test the tubal patency in all women with primary and secondary infertility. This study was done to compare sonohysterography and correlate by hysterosalpingogram (HSG) for evaluation of utero tubal factor in female infertility.Thirty women with primary or secondary infertility attending the outpatient department of the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Kalamboli, from May 2010 to May 2011 underwent a sonosalpingography (SSG) on day 7 of the menstrual cycle and an HSG on day 9 of the same or next menstrual cycle. Sonosalpingography was used as the reference standard for HSG. All patients with any positive findings underwent hysterolaparoscopy.For evaluation of tubal patency, SSG had sensitivity of 95.83% and specificity of 100% for evaluation of tubal patency. In contrast, in HSG for evaluation of tubal patency, the sensitivity is 91.67% and specificity is 100%.Sonohysterosalpingography appears to be inexpensive, minimally invasive, quick, of no risk of ionizing radiation, and well-tolerable first-line diagnostic method for determining the tubal status and uterine cavity and can be performed at the time of conventional ultrasound scan in place of HSG and laparoscopy.
