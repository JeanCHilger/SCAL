Imaging techniques for the evaluation of cervical cancer. Improvements in the treatment of cervical carcinoma have made it possible to offer optimal and personalised treatment. Cervical cancer staging is based on clinical examination and histological findings. Many diagnostic methods are used in clinical practice. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the optimal method for staging cervical carcinoma because of its high accuracy in assessing local extension of disease and distant metastases. Ultrasound has gained increased attention in recent years it is faster, cheaper, and more widely available than other imaging techniques, and is highly accurate in detecting tumour presence and evaluating local extension of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound are often used together with computed tomography or positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography to assess the whole body, a more accurate detection of pathological lymph nodes and metabolic information of the disease.
