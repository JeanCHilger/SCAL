Maldescended ovary associated with Müllerian and kidney dysgenesis: a case report. Maldescended ovary is a rare entity which has been associated with Müllerian and kidney dysgenesis. It can be discovered incidentally during a workup for pelvic or abdominal pain or an infertility workup. While MRI is the best diagnostic tool for the discovery of this entity, it can also be discovered using pelvic or abdominal ultrasound or hysterosalpingogram or by diagnostic laparoscopy.We present a case of maldescended ovary associated with a unicornuate uterus, normal left ovary and fallopian tube, elongated right fallopian tube and utero-ovarian ligament, and right pelvic kidney, discovered incidentally during a workup for chronic pelvic and abdominal pain.It is important to consider looking for a maldescended ovary whenever a patient has a Müllerian and/or kidney anomaly with absence of one or both ovaries on pelvic imaging.
