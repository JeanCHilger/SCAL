Ovary hyperstimulation syndrome accompanying molar pregnancy: case report and review of the literature. To describe a naturally conceived woman with ovary hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) accompanying molar pregnancy and review the literature on this condition.We report a 31-year-old 2 parous naturally conceived woman with OHSS accompanying partial molar pregnancy. Dilatation and evacuation (D&E) were performed at 10Â weeks of gestation. The signs and symptoms of OHSS were the severest on day 8 after D&E, when hCG had already decreased. This case is reported in detail. We also review the literature.A literature search yielded seven cases of this condition. Any type of molar pregnancy, i.e., complete, partial, or invasive, can accompany OHSS. The initial manifestation of OHSS occurred at a median of the 12th week of gestation (range 7-16), which may be later compared with OHSS caused by ovulation induction. In all cases, OHSS aggravated after D&E.We must be aware that OHSS can occur during molar pregnancy, and can be exacerbated after D&E.
