Comparison of metabolic profile and abdominal fat distribution between karyotypically normal women with premature ovarian insufficiency and age matched controls. We designed a prospective case-control study in order to investigate the lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the abdominal fat distribution in karyotypically normal women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).Anthropometric measurements, FSH, estradiol, total testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), free androgen index (FAI), fasting glucose and insulin, homeostatic model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, the prevalence of MetS and ultrasonographic abdominal fat measurements were assessed in 56 women with POI and 59 healthy controls at the same age range.Serum levels of T, SHBG and FAI were not significantly different between both groups. Total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were higher in women with POI. There were no differences in glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride levels between the two groups. A significant positive correlation was identified between T and TG and also between FAI and LDL-C SHBG levels were correlated inversely with FSH, and positively with HDL-C in women with POI. The presence of MetS was significantly higher in women with POI. The subcutaneous, preperitoneal and visceral fat thicknesses were not significantly different between the groups.Early cessation of ovulatory function may associated with higher levels of serum TC and HDL-C, but does not seem to cause differences in abdominal fat distribution in women with POI. POI is associated with higher risk of MetS.
