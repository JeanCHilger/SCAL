Role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in the detection of endometrial hyperplasia. Transvaginal sonography is superior to transabdominal sonography in most cases of pelvic pathology. A cross sectional study was done with forty patients to evaluate the clinical usefulness of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) in pre, peri and post menopausal women suspected to have endometrial hyperplasia.. The study was carried out January 2007 to November 2008 for a period of two years. The patients having endometrial hyperplasia diagnosed by TVS were correlated with histopathological diagnosis. Of total 40 cases, 18(45.0%) cases were endometrial hyperplasia and 22(55.0%) were negative for endometrial hyperplasia respectively in TVS findings. Only 2 cases were found as negative for endometrial hyperplasia in histopathology among the all suspected endometrial hyperplasia, which were diagnosed by TVS. On the other hand 17(42.5%) cases were endometrial hyperplasia and 23(57.5%) cases were negative for endometrial hyperplasia in histopathological findings. Among 22 negative for endometrial hyperplasia cases which were diagnosed by TVS, 1 case was endometrial hyperplasia and the rest 21 cases were negative for endometrial hyperplasia in histopathological findings. The validity of TVS in diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia were studied by calculating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, which were 94%, 92%, 93%, 89% and 96% respectively. As the TVS findings of the present study correlated well with the histopathology findings and the validity test values were higher than observed by others, it can be concluded that TVS is sensitive and accurate modality in the evaluation of endometrial hyperplasia.
