Detection of congenital uterine malformation by using transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasound. This study assessed the clinical application of transvaginal three-dimensional ultrasound (3D TVUS) in the diagnosis of congenital uterine malformation. A retrospective study was performed on 62 patients with congenital uterine malformation confirmed hysteroscopically and/or laparoscopically. The patients were subjected to transvaginal two-dimensional ultrasound (2D TVUS) and 3D TVUS. The accuracy rate was compared between the two methods. The accuracy rate of 3D TVUS was (98.38%, 61/62), higher than that of 2D TVUS (80.65%, 50/62). 3D TVUS coronal plane imaging could demonstrate the internal shape of the endometrial cavity and the external contour of the uterine fundus. It allowed accurate measurement on the coronary plane, and could three-dimensionally show the image of cervical tube, thereby providing information for the diagnosis of some complex uterine malformation. 3D TVUS imaging can obtain comprehensive information of the uterus malformation, and it is superior to 2D TVUS for the diagnosis of congenital uterine malformations, especially complex uterine anomaly.
