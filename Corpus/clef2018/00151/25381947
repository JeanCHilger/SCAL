Is ultrasound useful in the diagnosis of adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome? Diagnosis of adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains a challenge despite several existing criteria, and may be difficult to distinguish from pubertal changes. Different parameters to study ovarian function using ultrasonography have been proposed, but there is still no consensus about their diagnostic value.To evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of adolescent PCOS by reviewing available studies that assessed the ovarian volume (OV) and other ovarian morphological features such as location and number of follicles, stromal area, and volume.MEDLINE/PubMed database were searched to identify studies that assessed ovarian characteristics of adolescent PCOS patients by ultrasound. Studies on adults were also reviewed if study population included adolescents and stromal characteristics were assessed by three-dimensional (3D) sonogram.Five studies, including 262 PCOS adolescents (10-19 years of age) and two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound analysis, were identified. Mean OV was 9.29 cm³ for PCOS patients and 4.77 cm³ for controls. The morphology of ovarian follicles, when reported, showed multiple (>10) peripheral follicles in 83% of cases. Two studies, including 157 PCOS adolescents and young women (15-35 years of age) and 2D and 3D ultrasound analysis, were identified. Patients with PCOS patients had a MOV 13.1 cm³, multiple follicles (>15), and a statistically significant greater S/A ratio compared to controls. Stromal volume indices were positively correlated with hyperandrogenemia in PCOS patients.Pelvic ultrasound is an increasingly important aid in the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents. Besides ovarian volume, ovarian morphology must be assessed with 2D ultrasound to look for peripherally located multiple follicles. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the utility of 3D ultrasonographic assessment in adolescents with PCOS.
