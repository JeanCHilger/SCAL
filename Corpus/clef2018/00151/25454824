Modeling and optimization of ultrasound-assisted extraction of polyphenolic compounds from Aronia melanocarpa by-products from filter-tea factory. Aronia melanocarpa by-product from filter-tea factory was used for the preparation of extracts with high content of bioactive compounds. Extraction process was accelerated using sonication. Three level, three variable face-centered cubic experimental design (FCD) with response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimization of extraction in terms of maximized yields for total phenolics (TP), flavonoids (TF), anthocyanins (MA) and proanthocyanidins (TPA) contents. Ultrasonic power (X₁: 72-216 W), temperature (X₂: 30-70 °C) and extraction time (X₃: 30-90 min) were investigated as independent variables. Experimental results were fitted to a second-order polynomial model where multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to determine fitness of the model and optimal conditions for investigated responses. Three-dimensional surface plots were generated from the mathematical models. The optimal conditions for ultrasound-assisted extraction of TP, TF, MA and TPA were: X₁=206.64 W, X₂=70 °C, X₃=80.1 min X₁=210.24 W, X₂=70 °C, X₃=75 min
