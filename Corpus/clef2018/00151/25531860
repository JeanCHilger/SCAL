Magnetic resonance-visible polypropylene mesh for pelvic organ prolapse repair. To develop a magnetic resonance (MR)-visible mesh using iron oxides and prove visibility.In a phantom study, a suitable iron oxide, Fe3O4 [iron(II,III) oxide] and FeOOH [iron(III) oxide-hydroxide], concentration was determined using relaxometric MR measurements of the transverse relaxation rates R2 and R2*. Next, a nonabsorbable mesh was designed from the MR-visible threads woven into a polypropylene mesh. The mesh was implanted into a fresh female cadaver via the transobturator route, and MR visibility was assessed with various MR pulse sequences in a clinical 3-tesla system.Optimal contrast was achieved with Fe3O4 at 0.2 weight-% in all imaging sequences, and the optimal contrast was achieved in a 3D spoiled gradient-echo (fast low-angle shot) acquisition. In this concentration range the apparent transverse relaxation rate R2* is below 10 ms. The mesh was visible in the cadaver on T1-weighted 3D spoiled gradient-echo images and T1-weighted fast spin-echo images.Mesh materials can be manufactured to be visible on MR with a negative contrast. Fe3O4 meshes could simplify follow-up examinations and help diagnose origins of postsurgical lesions after urogynecological procedures with mesh material.
