Preliminary study of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in the evaluation of angiogenesis in ovarian tumors. To investigate the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with pulsed inversion harmonic imaging in the evaluation of angiogenesis in ovarian tumors.Forty-two patients of ovarian tumor received CEUS examination, in which the rise time (RT), peak intensity (PI), area under the curve (AUC), time from peak to one half (TTH) and time to peak (TTP) of ovarian tumors were measured. The post- surgical specimens of ovarian tumors were analysed by the stain with polyclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34. Correlations between the index of VEGF, microvessel density (MVD) and ultrasonic perfusion parameters were studied.MVD and VEGF index of ovarian tumors were significantly correlated with CEUS perfusion parameters including PI, AUC and TTH. The correlation coefficients of MVD with PI, AUC and TTH were 0. 569, 0. 623 and 0. 585 respectively and the correlation coefficients of VEGF with PI, AUG and TTH were 0. 516,0. 640 and 0. 591 respectively. There were significant differences of the perfusion parameters between high and low MVD group.The perfusion parameters PI, AUC and TTH in CEUS were correlated with MVD and VEGF in ovarian tumors, which may be useful in the evaluation of tumors angiogenesis.
