Intraprocedure contrast enhanced ultrasound: the value in assessing the effect of ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound ablation for uterine fibroids. To investigate the value of microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in evaluating the treatment response of uterine fibroids to HIFU ablation.Sixty-eight patients with a solitary uterine fibroid from the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were included and analyzed. All patients underwent pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a standardized protocol, as well as pre-evaluation, intraprocedure, and immediate post-treatment CEUS. CEUS and MRI were compared by different radiologists.In comparison with MRI, CEUS showed that the size of fibroids, volume of fibroids, size of non-perfused regions, non-perfused volume (NPV) or fractional ablation (NPV ratio) was similar to that of MRI. In terms of CEUS examination results, the median volume of fibroids was 75.2 (interquartile range, 34.2-127.3) cm(3), the median non-perfused volume was 54.9 (interquartile range, 28.0-98.1) cm(3), the mean fractional ablation was 83.7±13.6 (range, 30.0-100.0)%. In terms of MRI examination results, the median volume of fibroids was 74.1 (interquartile range, 33.4-116.2) cm(3). On the basis of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images immediately after HIFU treatment, the median non-perfused volume was 58.5 (interquartile range, 27.7-100.0) cm(3), the average fractional ablation was 84.2±14.2 (range, 40.0-100.0)%.CEUS clearly showed the size of fibroids and the non-perfused areas of the fibroid. Results from CEUS correlated well with results obtained from MRI.
