Results of uterine artery embolization in the treatment of symptomatic uterine myoma. To evaluate the uterus and myomatous nodules by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in different periods after uterine artery embolization (UAE).UAE was performed in 632 patients with different forms of uterine myoma. With this aim in mind, 120 cases with different forms of uterine myoma were analyzed.Following 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, the reduction in myomatous nodules was estimated to be 18.4 and 17.3, 40.7 and 42.9, 60.4 and 61.8 and 72.5 and 74.7%, respectively (p < 0.05). Necrotic exposure of a nodule, expulsion of myomatous nodules, and removal of a partially nascent submucous nodule were observed in 18 (15%) patients. Laparoscopic myomectomy of subserous myomatous nodules was carried out in 12 (10%) cases after UAE. In doing this, interoperative blood loss was 50-80 ml.UAE is an organ-sparing, highly effective uterine myoma treatment performed alone or in combination with surgery in relation to its different forms.
