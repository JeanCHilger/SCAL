Specificities of sex-cord stromal tumors in children and adolescents. Sex-cord stromal tumors (SCT) are rare pediatric tumors accounting for less than 5% of gonadal tumors in children and adolescents. They differ from those diagnosed in adults by their presentation, histology, evolution and treatment modalities. Testicular SCT occur mostly in infants less than 6 months. Testicular swelling is often the only symptom, but signs of hormonal secretion with gynecomastia may be present. Juvenile granulosa SCT is the main histologic subtype. Sertoli SCTs are much less frequent while Leydig tumors occurred in older children and adolescents. Prognosis is excellent after inguinal orchiectomy. Testis sparing surgery could be performed but indications and modalities have to be strongly defined. Ovarian SCT are diagnosed in older children and adolescents and present with abdominal symptoms and/or signs of hormonal secretion: estrogenic manifestations (isosexual pseudoprecocity, menometrorrhagia) or virilization (hirsutism, amenorrhea). Main histologic subtype is juvenile granulosa (rarely Sertoli-Leydig). If oophorectomy (or salpingo-oophorectomy) may be curative for localized disease, adjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy is mandatory in case of tumor rupture or peritoneal dissemination to prevent recurrences. Because of the rarity of these pediatric tumors, concerted multidisciplinary cares are required to best adapt therapeutic strategy before any surgical intervention.
