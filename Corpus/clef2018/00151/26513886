DVP parametric imaging for characterizing ovarian masses in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. To evaluate whether parametric imaging with contrast-enhanced ultrasound is an approach capable of for the differential diagnosis of ovarian masses.The authors analysed 50 cases of ovarian masses by routine ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a new dedicated parametric image processing software-Sonoliver. The angiogenesis and blood perfusion mode on a digital video recorder were recorded and the morphological characteristics of time-intensity curve (TIC) and dynamic vascular pattern (DVP) curve were subsequently described. The quantity factor, including time to peak (TTP), maximum intensity (IMAX), rise time, (RT), mean transit time (mTT), generated by Sonoliver software were compared in both histological gradings.There were 24 cases (86%) displaying mainly hypo-enhanced with blue imaging in those with benign masses and 15 cases (68%) displaying mainly hyper-enhanced imaging with red in those with malignant masses. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). DVP curves were unipolar below the baseline in 23 cases (82%) of benign masses and unipolar above the baseline in 15 cases (68%) of malignant masses. IMAX, TTP, and mTT were all significantly higher in those with malignant masses than those with benign ones (all p < 0.05), but, no statistical difference in the RT between the two groups was found (p > 0.05).According to the results, DVP parametric imaging is a new approach capable of differential diagnoses of overian masses with contrast-enhanced ultrasound.
