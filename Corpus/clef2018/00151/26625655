A Paediatric Hernia with a Twist: The Presentation, Imaging Findings and Management of a Strangulated Ovarian Hernia. Indirect inguinal hernias are the most commonly encountered congenital abnormality in infants. They may be complicated by herniation of abdominal or pelvic viscus. In girls, a herniated ovary is a relatively common finding, however torsion of the ovary is infrequent. A tender irreducible inguinal hernia in an infant girl should raise the possibility of a strangulated herniated ovary as it requires urgent surgical attention. When in doubt, ultrasound with colour Doppler easily confirms the diagnosis. Here we present the case of an ovarian inguinal hernia which had undergone torsion and review the presentation, imaging findings and management.
