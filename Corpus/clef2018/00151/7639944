Transient ascites associated with a fetal ovarian cyst. Case report. A case of fetal ovarian cyst associated with transient ascites is presented. The cyst showed serial changes from a fluid-debris interface to an anechoic structure. The changing ultrasonographic appearance of the cyst, disappearance of ascites and postnatal spontaneous resolution, suggests in utero torsion of the cyst.
