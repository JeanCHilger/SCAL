Postoperative lymphoceles and lymphatic fistula in gynecologic and breast neoplasms. The author reports some review articles about post-operative lymphocele in gynecological and breast cancer surgery. Post-operative sonography often shows an increased incidence of this complication which is unsuspected with only physical examination. Curative treatment of the postoperative lymphocele is performed by puncture, drainage or excision if lymphocysts become fibrous. Preventive treatment after lymphadenectomy is performed by padding of the axilla after breast cancer surgery or visceral non-peritonization after extended lymphadeno-colpohysterectomies. There is no real solution to prevent lymphocele after inguinal lymphadenectomy.
