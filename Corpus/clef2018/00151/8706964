Ovarian cysts. The Author intends to compare the data available in literature on the topic of 'laparoscopic surgery of ovarian cysts' to his case material. From 1985 to 1994, the author carried out 920 laparoscopic operations for the removal of ovarian cysts. Of these, 13 were converted to laparotomies, mostly because of peri-adnexal adhesions. There were 22 recurrences (endometriosic and mucinous multilocular cysts), and five severe complications (two purulent inflammations, one intra-operative haemorrhage and one post-operative one, one post-operative acute abdomen sine causa). In one case, an unrecognised endometrioid carcinoma was inadequately treated with laparoscopy. The author considers laparoscopy as the elective choice for surgical treatment of ovarian cysts. Suspect malignancy is not a contra-indication to laparoscopic surgery, since the removal of the operative specimen and its subsequent histological examination can be effected-in the large majority of cases-with the same results both laparoscopically and laparotomically. There is a problem with undiagnosed carcinomas in fertile females, but it is equally present in laparotomy.
