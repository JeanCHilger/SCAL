Preoperative investigations for suspected pelvic masses. Ultrasound examination was performed on 307 patients admitted to Herlev Hospital, Copenhagen, for suspicion of a pelvic tumor. Of these, 194 were operated on, 38 (19.6%) having a malignant tumor and 156 with benign conditions. A solid tumor was suspected in 72 patients on whom intravenous pyelography, barium enema, cystoscopy and rectoscopy were performed, although 11 did not undergo an intravenous pyelography and 12 did not undergo a barium enema. Intravenous pyelography, barium enema, rectoscopy and cystoscopy very seldom gave unsuspected information and never changed the indications for operation. Ultrasound examination of the kidneys, urinary tract, bowel system, liver and retroperitoneum as a complementary investigation to the gynecologic examination of the pelvic tumor gave the same information as did the barium enema, intravenous pyelography, rectoscopy and cystoscopy. Therefore, we conclude that these investigations should be carried out only in patients with symptoms from the urinary tract or the bowel system. Instead, we suggest that ultrasound examination of a pelvic mass also include an examination of the kidneys, urinary tract, bowel system, liver and retroperitoneum.
