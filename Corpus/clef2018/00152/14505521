Analysis of 20 cases of pelvic tuberculosis initially suspected of ovarian carcinoma. To analyze the clinical characteristics of female pelvic tuberculosis for the differentiation from ovary carcinoma.Twenty patients who were confirmed having pelvic tuberculosis from March 1994 to May 2002 were retrospectively studied.Poor economic condition, history of tuberculosis or contact with tuberculosis, and fever were among the most important factors in differentiating pelvic tuberculosis from advanced ovarian cancer. Pelvic mass and ascites were present in all of the 20 patients, abdominal distension in 16, abdominal pain in 12, fever in 16, lost of weight in 13, and diarrhea in 6. The level of serum CA125 ranged from 65 U/L to 1,069 U/L. Peritoneal effusion cytology was studied in 16 cases before operation.The clinical differentiation of female pelvic tuberculosis from ovary carcinoma was difficult. Pelvic tuberculosis should be considered in young women presented with pelvic mass, ascites, fever, an elevated CA125 level and negative cytology, and with a history of tuberculosis or contact with tuberculosis.
