Successful pregnancy after myomectomy using preoperative adjuvant uterine artery embolization. A 30-year-old-woman presented with uterine leiomyoma and primary sterility. Abdominal myomectomy was performed however, one cervical leiomyoma was not resected because of a risk of excessive blood loss. Two years after the procedure, a secondary myomectomy using preoperative adjuvant uterine artery embolization (UAE) was performed because of pronounced menorrhagia and her hope for bearing children. The patient's dysmenorrhea disappeared postoperatively and she conceived spontaneously 3 years after the secondary myomectomy. This case suggests that myomectomy using preadjuvant UAE may be an another approach for the treatment of leiomyoma in patients who wish bear children in the future.
