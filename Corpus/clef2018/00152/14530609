The uterine length in women with Turner syndrome reflects the postmenarcheal daily estrogen dose. To evaluate the effects of estrogen substitution on the uterine development in patients with Turner syndrome.57 women, aged 18.1-41.5 years, were treated with estrogen from puberty induction.In 21 women (37%), the uterus developed to >65 mm in length. The daily estrogen dose correlated with both uterine length (r = 0.29 p < 0.05) and Tanner breast stage (r = 0.44The uterine development was suboptimal in most patients. Further investigation is needed to optimize estrogen therapy for uterine development in patients with Turner syndrome.
