Successful medical treatment with danazol after failed embolization of uterine arteriovenous malformation. Transcatheter arterial embolization has been the therapy of choice for uterine arteriovenous malformations, whereas medical therapy has not been popular because of patient propensity to bleed.A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 0, was diagnosed with uterine arteriovenous malformation. Because initial treatment with uterine artery embolization was unsuccessful, she was ultimately treated with danazol. Resolution of the lesion after 2 weeks of danazol therapy was observed. As of follow-up at 16 months, she has remained free from further abnormal bleeding episodes and recurrence of the lesion.Danazol has the potential for medical management of uterine arteriovenous malformations in hemodynamically stable patients who do not respond to embolization.
