Metastatic breast cancer in the uterine cervix: two cases of a rare occurrence. Authors report on the recurrence of breast cancer to the uterine cervix in two patients. In the first patient the tumor recurrence was suspected by cytology 43 months after she was cured for breast cancer. An ultrasound examination revealed the recurrence in the second patient who have been cured for the breast cancer for 53 months. The final diagnoses was proved by cervical conisation in the first patient and by hysterectomy in the second one. Authors call attention for the possibility of the rare site of symptom free recurrence.
