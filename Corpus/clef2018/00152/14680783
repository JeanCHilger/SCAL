Preoperative endovaginal ultrasound in the assessment of myometrial invasion of endometrial adenocarcinoma. To determine, according to histological tumor grade, the reliability of preoperative endovaginal ultrasound in the detection of myometrial invasion in patients with stage I endometrial cancer.Sixty-one patients with stage I endometrial carcinoma were evaluated with preoperative endovaginal ultrasound compared to postoperative results of pathologic examination, in a six-year retrospective study.Twenty-nine patients had a deep myometrial invasion (stage IC). The mean endometrial thickness was 9.5 mm in stage IA, 17.0 mm in stage IB and 20.0 mm in stage IC disease (P = 0.01). The sensitivity and the specificity of the ultrasound in the assessment of myometrial invasion in grade 1 tumors were 100% and 93.7%, respectively. They fell to 69.2% and 88.9% for high-grade tumors. The global accuracy of ultrasound was 82%.The performance of preoperative ultrasound varies according to the literature. The association of morphological and morphometric criteria enables an increase in the sensitivity of the exam. In grade 1 tumors, the preoperative endovaginal ultrasound could help in identifying a group of patients at low risk of lymph node metastasis for which a pelvic lymphadenectomy would be avoidable.
