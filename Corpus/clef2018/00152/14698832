Resectoscopic treatment of complete longitudinal vaginal septum. Every gynecologist can easily recognize vaginal abnormalities and the subsequent disturbances of sexual function, such as dyspareunia and apareunia, arising from them. In the case of congenital vaginal septum, it is extremely important to completely assess the abnormality before planning for surgical treatment. Because normal vaginal development is subsequent to the canalization and fusion of the two MÃ¼llerian ducts once vacuolization has occurred, but not their union, a duplication of different degree will be the consequence. If the defect is complete, a didelphys uterus with a double vagina will result. The aim of our report is to describe the endoscopic technique used to treat three cases of complete longitudinal vaginal septum and to highlight the main differences between our technique and the standard surgical procedure.
