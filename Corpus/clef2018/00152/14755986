Minimal invasive treatment of the adnexal surgical pathology. Laparoscopic approach has become the "golden standard" in managing a wide range of adnexial sufferings. Most laparoscopic cases allow patients to recover quickly. Conventional ultrasonography appears to be useful in the preoperative selection for this surgery. Conventional pulsed Doppler and colour Doppler sonography proved their importance in the diagnosis of malignancy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the advantages and the limits of the minimal invasive approach in managing surgical adnexial sufferings. A retrospective study was carried on 75 operative laparoscopy cases performed between 1998-2002. Surgical procedures were performed mainly for ovarian cysts (69 cases, 92%), but there were also treated other types of adnexial pathology such as: hydrosalpinx (2), piosalpinx (1), tubal cysts (2), ectopic pregnancy (7), pelvic adherences (7) and one case of hydatid tubal cyst. Types of surgery performed were cystectomy (36), ooforectomy (11), salpingo-ooforectomy (10), fenestration (10), salpingectomy (6), lysis of adhesions (7). The mean operation time ranged between 50 and 80 minutes and the mean postoperative stay was of 3.65 days.
