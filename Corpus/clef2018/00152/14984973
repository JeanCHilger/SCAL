Extragonadal yolk sac tumor in pelvic localization. A case report and literature review. Yolk sac tumor (YST) is a rare neoplasm that usually arises in the testis or ovary. We report a case of extragonadal yolk sac tumor located in the pelvic area.A 33-year-old woman was admitted with a history of abdominal pain and distension. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a 63 x 63-mm hyperechoic mass and pelvic computerized scanning reported a pelvic mass mimicking a subserous myoma. Exploration findings revealed an extragonadal mass and she was treated with left pelvic mass extirpation, bilateral ovarian wedge resection, and reconstruction. Pelvic, paraaortic lymph node dissection and total omentectomy were also added to the operation. Histological evaluation of the specimen exhibited typical patterns of endodermal sinus tumor and stained for a-fetoprotein and cytokeratin. Four courses of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin combination chemotherapy repeated every 3 weeks were added to therapy and she has remained free of disease for 6 months after completion of the therapy.
