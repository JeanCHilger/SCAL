Perinatal outcome prediction by maternal homocysteine and uterine artery Doppler velocimetry. (a) To evaluate the predictive value of uterine Doppler velocimetry for pregnancy complications, (b) to study the relationship between abnormal uterine Doppler velocimetry and plasma homocysteine, and (c) to determine whether homocysteine measurement improves the predictive value of uterine Doppler screening.Prospective study including 94 pregnant women without previous risk factors. Total homocysteine, folate and Vitamin B(12) were analysed. Uterine Doppler velocimetry at weeks 24-25 was performed.The presence of any uterine Doppler alteration had a sensitivity of 66.7%, and a specificity of 81.2%, in predicting obstetric complications. The likelihood ratio was 3.6. The positive and negative predictive values were 27.3 and 95.8%, respectively. The global efficiency was 83.0%. The addition of hyperhomocysteinemia to Doppler alterations increased the sensitivity from 66.7 to 77.8%.The addition of homocysteine determination to uterine Doppler evaluation in the second trimester does not usefully improve its predictive value.
