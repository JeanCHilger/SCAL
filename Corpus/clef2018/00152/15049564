Factors related to the uptake of breast cancer screening (mammography and breast ultrasound): a retrospective survey on a sample of resident women, 50-70 years aged, from Abruzzo region. Within the context of a large breast cancer screening program we conducted a retrospective survey to identify the personal, socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics associated with previous use of mammograms (Ma) and breast ultrasound examination (US). Contact was made with a sample of more than 10,000 resident women who were asked to complete three questionnaires. Achieving an answer rate of 86%, we collected data from 9,087 women, 50-70 years aged, coming from Abruzzo, a central Italian region. 61% of the participants performed Ma, while US was performed by 34%, and 67% of women attended at least one of those examinations. Multiple logistic regression results indicated that older age, low level of education, not performing diets and breast self examination were significant predictors of a lower use of both examinations. Women that were married, mothers, on menopause, with a family history of cancer, uterine fibroma, past users of oral contraceptives were more likely to having performed Ma, but not US. Age at menarche, BMI and smoking were found not to be significant in predicting attendance for both screening examinations, with the exception of ex-smokers for US. Our findings represent an important contribution to the development of the needed tailored interventions to increase breast screening participation.
