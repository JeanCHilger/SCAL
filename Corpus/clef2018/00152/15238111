Cervical varix accompanied by placenta previa in twin pregnancy. Uterine cervical varix is a rare complication in pregnant women and can be the cause of obstetric hemorrhage in the vagina resulting in adverse events for both the mother and fetus.A 34-year-old Japanese woman was hospitalized at 18 weeks gestation because of cervical varix and placenta previa. Prophylactic tocolysis successfully controlled the obstetric hemorrhage. At 27 weeks gestation, emergent cesarean section was performed because of intractable hemorrhage from the marginal placenta previa. Intraabdominal findings revealed no vascular malformation of the uterus, and the operation was performed uneventfully. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix at 1 month postpartum were unremarkable.It is important to recognize the clinical features and available treatments for cervical varix.
