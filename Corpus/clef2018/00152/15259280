Endometrial safety and tolerability of triphasic sequential hormone replacement estradiol valerate/medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy regimen. Two randomized comparative multicenter studies were conducted to establish the endometrial safety and tolerability of a triphasic sequential hormone replacement estradiol valerate/medroxyprogesterone acetate (E2V/MPA) therapy regimen.Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, clinical phase III study in 399 postmenopausal women, following parallel-group design with two groups. The duration of study treatment was 12 or 13 cycles of 28 days. A double-dummy technique was used to ensure blinding in the study. The investigational drugs were E2V/MPA triphasic and E2V/MPA biphasic (Diviseq and Divina, respectively Orion Pharma). In study 2, a total of 341 subjects were randomly allocated by computer into two parallel groups receiving either E2V/MPA or estradiol/norethisterone acetate triphasic (E2/NETA, TrisequensE2V/MPA triphasic was found to have similar endometrial effects and bleeding patterns to those with E2V/MPA biphasic and E2/NETA triphasic. Climacteric symptoms were relieved as quickly and effectively as with the two comparator treatments. No adverse drug reactions specific to E2V/MPA triphasic were observed. At the end of the study, the proportions of secretory samples were 67.1% for the combined E2V/MPA triphasic groups, 65.6% for the E2V/MPA biphasic group and 71.6% for the E2/NETA triphasic group. One case of hyperplasia occurred in the E2V/MPA triphasic group. Thus the incidence of hyperplasia for the combined groups was 0.33%.The triphasic E2V/MPA regimen was well tolerated and produced endometrial effects similar to those of the two comparators. Extending estrogen during the so-called treatment-free week with a lower dose of estradiol was effective in controlling vasomotor symptoms.
