Outcome of follicular aspiration of selection phase in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. To assess the effectiveness of follicular aspiration in selection phase of follicle growth of the patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET).Thirteen infertile patients with PCOS who previously failed IVF-ET associated with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), served as control group, were asked to undergo new IVF cycles (follicular aspiration group) with ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicular aspirations in the selection phase (diameter 9 - 10 mm) of follicle growth, with a total of 13 cycles both. No more than 10 follicles were selected. Clinical and endocrinological parameters were monitored.In follicular aspiration group, the average number of follicle >or= 12 mm in diameter and serum estradiol level were 16 +/- 4 and (9899 +/- 1431) pmol/L respectively, which were significantly lower than 29 +/- 8 (P < 0.001) and (15,544 +/- 1767) pmol/L (P < 0.001) in control group. No moderate-severe OHSS occurred in follicular aspiration group, while 9 out of 13 (69%) occurred in control group. Oocyte retrieval rate, maturation rate, fertilization rate and cleavage rate in follicular aspiration group were greatly higher than those in control group.Follicular aspiration in selection phase of follicle growth associates with reduced dominant follicle numbers and estradiol level on the day of hCG injection and moderate-severe OHSS incidence in patients with PCOS undergoing IVF-ET.
