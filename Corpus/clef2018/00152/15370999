Three-dimensional reconstruction of human femur using consecutive computer tomography images and simulated implantation system. This study is concerned with the construction of a simulated implantation system (SIS) for a human femur using various algorithms of image processing and computer graphics. The SIS is the software which performs 3D visualization as well as various numeric analyses between the patient's femur and the artificial hip joint through certain stages of processing on consecutive CT images and projected images. We present the concrete methods that were to be implemented into the suggested prototype of SIS and the corresponding experimental results will also be shown.
