Fine needle aspiration cytology of the ovary: is it reliable? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cytologic findings from the fluid of ovarian cysts in comparison with the histologic diagnosis.Over a four-year period all women with single ovarian cysts and no evidence of malignancy from ultrasound examination and tumour marker levels were included in the study. Prior to removal of the cyst, fluid was aspirated from the cyst and prepared for cytologic examination. Subsequently the ovarian cyst wall and biopsy from the ovary were sent for histologic examination. The cytologic findings were compared to the histologic diagnosis.The material of the study was 120 ovarian specimens from 107 women. Twenty-four (20%) of the specimens submitted for cytology were non diagnostic and a comparison between cytologic and histologic findings was possible in 96 cases. The sensitivity and the specificity of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of the ovary was 25% and 97%, respectively.FNA cytology of the ovary is an accurate method for predicting benign ovarian histologic findings in carefully selected populations.
