Management of endosalpingiosis of urinary bladder. We report on a 48-year-old woman who presented with abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to uterine fibroids and who was found to have incidental endosalpingiosis of the urinary bladder. Follow-up is necessary for bladder endosalpingiosis because of its tendency to recur. Follow-up should include cystoscopy and renal, and possibly pelvic, ultrasonography.
