Incarceration of the retroverted gravid uterus: the key to successful treatment. Incarceration of the retroverted gravid uterus is rare, and it is difficult to make a diagnosis, and, therefore, difficult to treat. We present two cases of incarceration of the retroverted gravid uterus.Two pregnant women presented with urinary retention at 14 weeks' gestation. We tried to push the gravid uterus upward, but in the end the two women underwent cesarean section. In one of the women it was possible to relieve incarceration of the retroverted gravid uterus.There was no sign of endometriosis in these pregnancies, which is important to evaluate when pregnant women have a complication.
