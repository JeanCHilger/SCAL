Preoperative evaluation of submucosal myoma by virtual hysteroscopy. To assess the utility of a new technique called virtual hysteroscopy in the evaluation of the size and location of submucosal myomas before hysteroscopic myomectomy.Retrospective analysis (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).Department of gynecology at a general hospital.Thirteen consecutive women.Sixteen-slice computed tomography (CT) scanner.Thirteen women with submucosal myomas were examined by virtual hysteroscopy. The lesions were filmed by multislice CT scanner, immediately after CO2 injection into the uterine cavity with an intravenous dosage of iodide contrast media. The filmed image was subsequently reconstituted and analyzed by endoscopy mode and volume mode using three-dimensional computer graphics software. The size and depth of invasion of the submucosal myoma were clearly identified by the procedure.Accurate preoperative evaluation of the size and location of submucosal myomas before hysteroscopic myomectomy is important for a safe surgical procedure. Virtual hysteroscopy can provide such information with good reproducibility and is superior to previously described diagnostic procedures.
