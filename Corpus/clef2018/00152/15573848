Laparoscopic management of ovarian dermoid cysts: a review of 47 cases. Mature cystic teratomas, often referred to as dermoid cysts, are the most common germ cell tumors of the ovary. In the recent years, transvaginal sonographic diagnosis of ovarian dermoid cysts together with laparoscopic approach have greatly improved the treatment of this benign lesion. We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of laparoscopic surgery for suspected ovarian dermoid cysts.The preoperative findings, operative techniques and postoperative complications were retrospectively reviewed in women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for dermoid cysts, between January 2000 and May 2003.In 47 women aged 21 to 53 years (median, 38.8 years), 93.6% had a unilateral cyst with a diameter of 17 to 108 mm (median, 51 mm). Clinical presentations were pain (62%), abnormal vaginal bleeding (21%) and ovarian torsion (2%), whilst 17% were diagnosed incidentally during routine examination. Surgery included cystectomy (57%), total (36%) or partial oophorectomy (6.4%) and laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (2%). During the cyst extraction, minimal spillage occurred in 42.5% of the cases and none developed chemical peritonitis. In 2 patients, conversion to laparotomy (4.3%) was required, one for sigmoid colon injury and one for malignant ovarian tumor detected via frozen section. The median operating time was 80 minutes (range, 35-180 minutes).Using strict adherence to guidelines for preoperative clinical assessment and intra-operative management, laparoscopic treatment of dermoid cysts appears to be a safe procedure.
