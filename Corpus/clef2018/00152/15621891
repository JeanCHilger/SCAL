National survey of current practice in assessing tubal patency in the UK. We conducted a postal survey to find out the current practice in the UK regarding the methods employed to assess tubal patency. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the methods used to assess tubal patency in women presenting with infertility with or without risk factors suggesting pelvic disease. A total of 496 questionnaires were sent and 174 responded (35%). The survey represented an overall view as both gynaecologists and radiologists from secondary and tertiary centres responded. In the responses from radiologists, a hysterosalpingogram was the investigation of choice for both low risk (61%) and high risk women (50%). However in the responses from gynaecologists, in patients with no past gynaecological history, the majority performed a hysterosalpingogram (58%) or hystero contrast sonography (HyCoSy) (14%) whereas in patients in whom pelvic pathology was suspected, most (84%) performed a laparoscopy and dye test. The survey also showed that HyCoSy was performed in only a few centres in the UK. The responses from the majority of gynaecologists were in accordance with the RCOG guidelines. However, still some centres (28%) offered laparoscopy and dye test in low risk women as the primary test for assessing tubal patency. Given the risks associated with laparoscopy, this should be reserved for cases where pathology is suspected and scheduled to be combined with laparoscopic surgery.
