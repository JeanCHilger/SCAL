Serum CA 125 combined with transvaginal ultrasonography for ovarian cancer screening. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combination of serum CA125 and Transvaginal Ultra Sonography (TVUS) score, as a screening procedure for ovarian cancer in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.A retrospective case-control pilot study was conducted. The files of 120 women with ovarian neoplasia detected by TVUS and increased CA125 level, within the framework of a prevention program, were reviewed. The relationship between the above tests and epithelial malignancy was investigated using the SPSS-12 program for Windows.The combination of CA125 value exceeding 30U/ml and a TVUS score > or = 35 had a sensitivity of 81.7% and specificity of 100% in predicting ovarian cancer. Mathematical analysis of the logistic model of our variables revealed a mathematical model that can calculate the likelihood of ovarian cancer detection, by using a combination of CA125 > or = 30U/ml and TVUS score > or = 35.By combining TVUS and CA125, an accurate prediction for the presence of ovarian cancer may be achieved. Further investigation in a larger population is warranted.
