A short cervix in women with preterm labor and intact membranes: a risk factor for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a relationship between sonographic cervical length and the presence of culture-proven microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with preterm labor and intact membranes.Ultrasonography and amniocentesis were performed in 401 patients admitted with preterm labor (22-35 weeks) and cervical dilatation of < or = 3 cm, as assessed by digital examination. Cervical length was determined by transvaginal ultrasound at admission. Outcome variables were the presence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (defined as a positive amniotic fluid culture) and the occurrence of preterm delivery before 35 weeks. Contingency tables, chi2 test, receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves, and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis.The prevalence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was 7% (28/401). Spontaneous preterm delivery (< or = 35 weeks) occurred in 21.4% (82/384) of patients. ROC curve analysis showed a significant relationship between the frequency of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and the length of the uterine cervix (area under the curve: 0.77 P < .005). Patients with a cervical length < 15 mm had a higher rate of a positive amniotic fluid culture than patients with a cervical length > or = 15 mm (26.3% [15/57] vs. 3.8% [13/344], respectivelyEndovaginal ultrasonographic examination of the uterine cervix in women with preterm labor identifies patients at increased risk for intrauterine infection.
