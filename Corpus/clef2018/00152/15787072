Treatment by embolization of small uterine myomata. We examined the effectiveness of uterine artery embolization (UAE) as a primary treatment for small symptomatic myomatas (<50 mm diameter). One hundred patients aged from 29 to 68 years underwent UAE between 01/01/99 and 12/31/2002. Efficacy was judged by physical examination and imaging studies at 6 to 12 months. All the patients were evaluated. Treatment failed in five cases, while symptoms resolved in all the other patients. Five patients became pregnant. The main complication was amenorrhea. No serious adverse effects were observed. The efficacy and safety of this method make it a possible preventive treatment for pre-symptomatic myomata. If these findings are confirmed, they will open a new era in the treatment of fibroids.
