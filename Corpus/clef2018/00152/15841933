Does the diameter of an endometrioma predict the extent of pelvic adhesions associated with endometriosis? To correlate ovarian endometrioma diameter with the extent of pelvic adhesions.Forty women with unilateral ovarian cysts thought to be endometriomas were prospectively recruited. The interventions were transvaginal ultrasound to measure the size of the ovarian endometrioma and a laparoscopic surgical procedure, including detailed pelvic assessment. Main outcome measures were pelvic adhesion scores using the American Fertility Society revised classification of endometriosis.Thirty-two women met the inclusion criteria. Twelve had an endometrioma < 3 cm in diameter 12, 3-5 cmThe size of an endometrioma measured by transvaginal ultrasound does not correlate with the extent of adhesive disease. Small (< 3 cm) endometriomas may be associated with a considerable degree of pelvic adhesions.
