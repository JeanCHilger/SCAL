Mesenteric Castleman's disease. We report here a rare case of mesenteric Castleman's disease presenting as a mesenteric mass. A 13-year-old female child was admitted to our hospital complaining of intermittent vague abdominal pain. She had hypochromic anemia, thrombocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Ultrasonography and computed tomography indicated an intra- abdominal mass might represent a lymphoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor or leiomyoma, but the definitive preoperative diagnosis couldn't be confirmed. The surgical resection of the mass revealed the mesenteric hyaline vascular-type Castleman's disease.
