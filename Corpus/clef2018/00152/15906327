Digital subtraction dark-lumen MR colonography: initial experience. To evaluate image subtraction for the detection of colonic pathologies in a dark-lumen MR colonography exam.A total of 20 patients (12 males 8 femalesWithout subtracted images, MR-colonography detected a total of five polyps, two inflammatory lesions, and one carcinoma in eight patients, which were all verified by endoscopy. Using subtraction, an additional polyp was found, and readout time was significantly shorter (6:41 vs. 7:39 minutes P<0.05). In two patients, endoscopy detected a flat adenoma and a polyp (0.4 cm) that were missed in the MR exam. Sensitivity and specificity without subtraction were 0.67/1.0, and 0.76/1.0 with the subtracted images, respectively. Subtraction was assessed as helpful in all exams (mean value 1.8+/-0.5We consider subtraction of native from contrast-enhanced dark-lumen MR colonography data sets as a beneficial supplement to the exam.
