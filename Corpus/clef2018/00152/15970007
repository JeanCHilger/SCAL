Does hysteroscopic polypectomy without cycle cancellation affect IVF? Endometrial polyp (measuring <2 cm) was diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasonography performed on days 7 and 9 of the cycle in six patients who underwent IVF. These six patients were treated by hysteroscopic polypectomy preceding oocyte retrieval under general anaesthesia after informed consent was obtained. The cause of infertility was male factor in three patients, tubal factor in one, and two cases were unexplained. All patients had undergone ovulation induction and luteal support according to the long luteal protocol. As a result, in three cases pregnancy was achieved (one multiple and two singleton) and three cases were unsuccessful. One of the pregnant women gave birth at term, while the other two pregnancies are still ongoing. There is still no consensus regarding the management of patients diagnosed with endometrial polyp in IVF cycles. Cryopreservation, cycle cancellation and embryo transfer preceding polypectomy is the current management choice. The treatment modalities will be clarified only if embryo transfer preceding polypectomy in the same cycle is proven to be safe. This approach has been used in only six patients so far, and further studies with more patients are needed to confirm these findings.
