Seminal profile of subjects with testicular microlithiasis and testicular calcifications. Two hundred eighty-one male partners of infertile couples were studied to determine the prevalence of subjects with testicular microlithiasis (TM) or testicular calcifications (TC) to define the seminal profile of this population and to initiate a longitudinal study to evaluate the significance of TM and TC as predictive markers of cancer. The prevalence found was 4.6% and 3.9%, respectively, which is sufficiently high to merit careful research attention, although TM and TC do not appear to be pathogenic factors of dyspermia.
