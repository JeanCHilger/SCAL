Multilocular adenomatoid tumor of the ovary: ultrasonographic findings. We report the sonographic findings of a rare benign ovarian tumor in a 69-year-old woman. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a cystic multilocular lesion with a vascularized central solid portion of the left ovary. Surgery revealed an adenomatoid tumor. Adenomatoid tumors are benign lesions of mesothelial origin, usually solid in nature and rarely located in the ovaries. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound 33:233-236, 2005.
