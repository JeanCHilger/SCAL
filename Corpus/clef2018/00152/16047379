Combined segmental and focal adenomyomatosis involving the body of the gallbladder. Adenomyomatosis (adenomyomatous hyperplasia) of the gallbladder is a benign process of unknown origin that has been classified into three morphologic types: diffuse, segmental, and focal (fundal). Cases of combined (segmental and focal) forms involving the gallbladder body are very rare. We present the sonographic findings of a case having adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder body with focal as well as segmental forms of the disease.
