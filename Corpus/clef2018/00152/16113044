Dynamic assays of inhibin B, anti-Mullerian hormone and estradiol following FSH stimulation and ovarian ultrasonography as predictors of IVF outcome. We evaluated basal and dynamic hormonal markers [(FSH, inhibin B, estradiol and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)] during the follicular phase and luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and ultrasonic ovarian morphology as predictors of IVF outcome.Fifty-six women, aged <38 years, with normal day 3 FSH levels were included prospectively. Serum estradiol, inhibin B and AMH were measured before and 24 h after administration of 300 IU of recombinant FSH on cycle day 3-4 and during the luteal phase. Ovarian volume and antral follicle count (AFC) were evaluated on cycle day 3-4. The predictive value of oocyte number and pregnancy were assessed using uni- and multivariate analysis.Poor responders (<6 oocytes) had significantly lower luteal AMH levels, while high responders (>20 oocytes) had significantly higher AFC, AMH and luteal stimulated inhibin B and estradiol than normal responders. Multivariate regression analyses showed that the best models for predicting oocyte number included AFC, follicular phase AMH and stimulated inhibin B. Only AMH showed a significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women at both cycle phases.In young women (<38 years), AFC or basal AMH and stimulated inhibin B predict ovarian response for IVF. The only predictor for pregnancy is follicular or luteal phase AMH.
