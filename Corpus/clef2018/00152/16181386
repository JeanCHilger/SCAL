The role of CT colonography in colorectal cancer screening. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is a relatively noninvasive technique for large bowel imaging that has the ability to detect colorectal neoplasia. Already well established as a reliable diagnostic tool in symptomatic patients who are unable to undergo complete colonoscopy, it is now being considered as a viable method for population screening. Advances in technique over the past 10 yr make this an attractive alternative, including reduced bowel preparation and stool tagging, three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction, computer-aided detection software, and low-radiation dose protocols. CTC may be favored by patients compared to other available screening tests due to the ease of performance and comfort. Although published studies vary in relation to the sensitivity of this test for the detection of polyps, in the best hands a sensitivity of greater than 90% for detection of polyps at least 10 mm in diameter may be obtained. Although not yet endorsed for widespread use by major gastroenterological societies, CTC shows promise as a screening tool.
