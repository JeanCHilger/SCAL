Saline contrast sonohysterography and directed extraction, resection and biopsy of intrauterine pathology using a Uterine Explora Curette. To assess the utility of an endometrial sampling device, the Uterine Explora Curette, with concomitant saline contrast sonohysterography (SCSH) for ultrasound-directed extraction, resection and biopsy of endometrial pathology.Use of the Uterine Explora Curette was prospectively evaluated in 20 women with either infertility (n = 14), recurrent miscarriage (n = 2) or peri-/postmenopausal bleeding (n = 4). Findings on SCSH were compared with those on pathological analysis.In all 20 cases the Uterine Explora Curette was used successfully during SCSH to treat endometrial filling defects. The procedure was well tolerated, with an average time from start to finish of 10 (range, 2-23) min. It was without complications, and appeared to remove or biopsy adequately endometrial filling defects in most patients, obviating the need for hysteroscopy.In properly selected patients, directed extraction, resection and biopsy using the Uterine Explora Curette during SCSH appears to be an effective and easy method for treating intrauterine pathology and provides a cost-effective alternative to operative hysteroscopy.
