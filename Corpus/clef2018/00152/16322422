A molar pregnancy detected by following beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels after a first trimester loss. This case report summarizes the sequence of events that led to the detection of a molar pregnancy missed by ultrasound and initial pathology examinations. This patient illustrates that following serial quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) levels after spontaneous, therapeutic, and elective abortions will help detect potentially life-threatening molar and ectopic pregnancies. Further research is needed to determine the optimal frequency of B-hCG testing. For now, maternity care providers can follow the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommendation that abnormal bleeding for more than 6 weeks after any pregnancy should be evaluated with B-hCG testing. Earlier testing may be considered.
