Management of adnexal cystic masses with unexpected intracystic vegetations detected during laparoscopy. To evaluate a prospective series of consecutive patients with unexpected intracystic vegetations detected during operative laparoscopy for adnexal masses.Prospective series of consecutive patients (Canadian Task Force classification: II-2).Tertiary care university hospitals.Consecutive patients found during surgery to have unexpected intracystic vegetations and treated by operative laparoscopy, out of a total series of 667 patients under 40 years of age with ultrasonographic evidence of an adnexal cystic mass without thick septa, internal wall papillarities, or solid components.Operative laparoscopy and follow-up.Thirty-five (5.2%) of 667 patients were found at surgery to have unexpected intracystic vegetations. A frozen section was sent for pathologic analysis in all 35 patients. Frozen section diagnosis was benign in 32 patients and borderline in 3 patients. Final pathology diagnosis was borderline ovarian tumor in five of the 35 patients (14.3%), and benign in 30 patients (85.7%). No case of invasive carcinoma was diagnosed either at frozen section or at final pathology examination. The patients with borderline tumors are alive with no evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 60 months.In the present series, with accurate preoperative selection, the rate of adnexal cysts with unexpected intracystic vegetations was 5%, of which 14% were borderline tumors. The laparoscopic management of these adnexal masses did not adversely affect the prognosis.
