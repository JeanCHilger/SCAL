MR findings of prostatic urethral polyp in an adult. We report MR imaging characteristics of a prostatic urethral polyp in a 35-year-old man. Traditionally, the methods of diagnosis include computed tomography, transrectal sonography, voiding cysto-urethrography, intravenous pyelography, urethroscopy, and cystoscopy. To our knowledge, MR findings have not been previously described. In this case, MR imaging clearly demonstrated a polypoid tumor located in the prostatic urethra with a stalk connected to the bladder neck. A pathological study revealed the polyp consisted of a fibrovascular core covered with a double layered, prostatic-type epithelium.
