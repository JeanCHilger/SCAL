MR colonography in inflammatory bowel disease. Colonography based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appears to be a promising technique for polyp assessment in the colon. Several studies have evaluated this method for colonic assessment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We briefly review different methodologies such as dark lumen and bright lumen techniques for abdominal MRI. In addition, recently published studies concerning the sensitivity and accuracy in detecting inflammatory bowel changes in inflammatory bowel disease using MRI are discussed.
