The evaluation of 318 intrauterine pregnancy cases with an intrauterine device. To determine the factors affecting the pregnancies with intrauterine devices.The intrauterine device (IUD) locations in pregnancies with IUDs referring to SSK Aegean Maternity Hospital were determined by ultrasonography (USG) in a 6 year period. Three hundred and eighteen pregnancy cases (pregnancy group) were observed together with intrauterine devices. All intervally applied IUDs were CeT380A. All demographic characteristics of the cases together with determination of IUD localizations were recorded, and these cases were compared with 300 cases (control group) using CuT380A and under routine follow-up in our clinic.Ultrasonographic examination revealed IUD dislocation in 64% of 318 cases, whereas only 11% of the control group had dislocated IUDs. The difference between two groups was statistically significant. Especially in cases where the pregnancy group was less than 20 years old, IUD dislocations were recorded in 87.5%. The statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation in the distribution of IUD pregnancies according to years. When the demographic characteristics of two groups were compared, no statistically significant correlation was observed between the demographic characteristics and pregnancies with IUDs. There were 89 cases (27.9%) who decided on the continuation of IUD pregnancies. Unfortunately, 40% of these cases resulted in abortion. Only in 27% of 56 cases after IUD extraction because of IUD dislocation was miscarriage recorded. Meanwhile, 77% of the 26 cases with IUD left in the uterine cavity presented with miscarriage. Of the total of 36 miscarriages, 33% were =6 weeks pregnancy, and 27% were over 10 weeks.IUD dislocation is a significant factor affecting IUD pregnancies. The fact that dislocation is most common in the first year reveals the necessity for more frequent controls in this period.
