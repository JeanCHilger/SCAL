In situ methotrexate injection for treatment of recurrent endometriotic cysts. Ovarian endometrioma recurrence is frequent. Conventional treatment of ovarian endometrioma is by surgical cystectomy. We proposed an alternative medical treatment for recurrent ovarian endometrioma: cyst aspiration followed by in situ methotrexate injection.From January 2002 to May 2003, 14 patients with recurrent homolateral ovarian endometrioma underwent transvaginal ultrasound guided cyst puncture and aspiration followed by methotrexate injection, whilst under general anasthesia. Recurrence rate during follow up was evaluated.No complication was reported. After a mean follow up of 20+/-5 month (min: 13, max: 29), four recurrences were diagnosed (28.6%). Two asymptomatic recurrences were not treated and two painful recurrences underwent a second cyst drainage with methotrexate injection.In situ methotrexate injection is a simple, effective and an interesting alternative to surgical treatment in women with recurrent homolateral ovarian endometrioma.
