Endometrial receptivity: clinical assessment in relation to fertility, infertility, and antifertility. Fertility in humans and other mammalian species depends absolutely on synchronous events that render the developing blastocyst and the receiving uterus competent for implantation. Endometrial receptivity is defined as the period during which the endometrial epithelium acquires functional, but transient, ovarian steroid-dependent status supportive to blastocyst acceptance and implantation. Once inside the uterus, the blastocyst is surrounded by an intact luminal epithelium, which is considered to act as barrier to its attachment, except for this short period of high endometrial receptivity to blastocyst signal(s). Its transport and permeability properties, in conjunction with cellular action of the endometrium and the embryo, have been suggested to influence creation and maintenance of informational and nutritional status of uterine luminal milieu. This period, also termed as the 'window of implantation,' is limited to days 20-24 of menstrual cycle in humans. However, establishment of endometrial receptivity is still a biological mystery that remains unsolved despite marked advances in our understanding of endometrial physiology following extensive research associated with its development and function. This review deals with various structural, biochemical, and molecular events in the endometrium coordinated within the implantation window that constitute essential elements in the repertoire that signifies endometrial receptivity and is aimed to achieve a better understanding of its relationship to fertility, infertility, and for the development of targeted antifertility agents for human use and welfare.
