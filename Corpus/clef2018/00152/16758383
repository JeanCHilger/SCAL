Massive adenomyosis in a patient with uterus septus completus. Septate uterus is a malformation caused by the defective resorption of the MÃ¼llerian ducts. It may be incomplete, or -- less frequently -- complete. We present a case of a uterus septus completus with special emphasis on the endometrial changes. We describe a 46-year-old female patient (nullipara) with a known uterus septus suffering from hypermenorrhea. Sonography demonstrated a massively enlarged uterus with several nodes. Hysterectomy was performed and tissue specimens were routinely processed. Macroscopical examination revealed a 1 230 g-weight uterus septus completus. In particular, the myometrium was enlarged and exhibited a cystic cut surface with several nodes measuring up to 4.5 cm. Histologically, we found prominent adenomyosis with several leiomyomas. Patients with uterine malformations are known to suffer from endometrial dysfunction, most commonly due to endometriosis. However, massive adenomyosis in combination with leiomyomas, as presented in this case report, has not been described so far. These endometrial changes are important, since they significantly contribute to infertility.
