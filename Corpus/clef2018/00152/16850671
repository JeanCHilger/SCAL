Comparison of low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive pills and expectant management in treatment of functional ovarian cysts. To compare the effectiveness of low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of spontaneously occurring functional ovarian cyst detected by ultrasonography compared with expectant management.A total of 70 women in their reproductive period with functional ovarian cysts detected by means of ultrasonography were randomized to low-dose monophasic Oral Contraceptive pills (OC) or to expectant management and followed up at one month with a second ultrasonography. If the ovarian cysts were still present, the women were followed for another month while on the same treatment.At the first month, the remission rates of ovarian cyst were 63.6% in low-dose monophasic OC and 52.9% in expectant groups. At the second month, the cumulative remission rates increased up to 72.7% in low-dose monophasic OC and 67.6% in expectant groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups at both the first and second month of treatment. The most common side effect in women using OC was acne (18%).Low-dose monophasic OC were no more effective than expectant management in the treatment of spontaneously occurring functional ovarian cysts.
