Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system vs. transcervical endometrial resection for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. To compare the acceptability, efficacy, adverse effects, and user satisfaction of a levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.Of 50 women with a pictoral blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score of 100 or greater, 25 had a LNG-IUS inserted (Mirena Schering, Berlin, Germany) and 25 underwent TCRE. Procedure-related complications, PBAC score, hemoglobin levels, adverse effects, and rates of acceptability and satisfaction were recorded at 3-month intervals for a period of 12 months.At the end of 1 year there were a 97% and a 94% reduction in menstrual blood loss in the LNG-IUS and TCRE groups, respectively, and hemoglobin concentration had increased by 5.5% in the LNG-IUS group and 5.2% in the TCRE group. Adverse effects were similar in both groups except for systemic effects, which were seen only in the LNG-IUS group. Satisfaction rates were about 80% in the 2 groups.Both treatments were found to be equally effective but LNG-IUS placement requires less operator skill and entails no operative hazards, and the device provides effective contraception.
