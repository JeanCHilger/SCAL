Chronic abdominal pregnancy following rupture from a bicornuate uterus. The authors report a rare occurrence of a chronic abdominal pregnancy secondary to a ruptured bicornuate uterus. It is unusual in that rupture of the uterine horn probably occurred 2 weeks prior to diagnosis. Management was laparotomy to remove the fetus with resection and repair of the uterus. Uterine anomalies, their imaging and diagnosis, as well as the patient's subsequent reproductive prognosis are discussed.
