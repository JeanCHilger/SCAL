Virtual CT colonoscopy and virtual CT barium enema using multidetector-row CT. CT colonography is a promising technique that provides both multiplanar and endoluminal perspective of the air-filled, distended, cleaned colon. "Virtual colonoscopy" refers to computer-simulated 3D endoscopic visualization of the colonic mucosal surface. Unlike barium enema and conventional colonoscopy, CT colonography can give cross- sectional and endoluminal images of the colon and enables to image extracolic abnormality. CT colonography offers potential advantages over colonoscopy in that it causes little discomfort to the patient, and does not need sedation. It is more accurate in spatial location of lesions and creates no complication. To date, most studies assessing CT colonography have focused in technical development, less aggressive bowel preparation, and computer-aided diagnosis of polyp detection. In the future, CT colonography would be a diagnostic and screening tool for the colorectal polyp and cancer.
