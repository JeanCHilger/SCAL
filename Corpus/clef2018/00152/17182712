Sonographic features of female pelvic tuberculous peritonitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sonographic features of tuberculous peritonitis in an attempt to facilitate the recognition of this disorder preoperatively.The sonographic findings of 16 patients who had tuberculous peritonitis were reviewed.The sonographic findings showed that 14 of the 16 patients had ascites 10 of these had fine, complete and incomplete mobile septations. Of these 10 patients, 4 had ascites with a latticelike appearance, and 2 had ascites with a parallel violin string appearance, which to our knowledge has not been described previouslyTuberculous peritonitis seems to have characteristic sonographic features, especially the findings of peritoneal and omental thickening and ascites with fine, mobile septations. These sonographic findings may provide valuable information to help with further investigations and may prevent unnecessary laparotomies.
