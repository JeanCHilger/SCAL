Chance finding of foetal and neonatal ovarian cysts on echography. Cystic abnormalities of the adnex were found by chance in 2 baby girls, one aged 2.5 months and the other aged 2 months. Both had been born dysmaturely and the abnormalities were found on echographic investigation carried out for suspected urinary-tract infection. On monitoring investigation one month later, the abnormalities had become smaller and some time later had disappeared altogether. With the increasing use of ultrasound, ovarian cysts are being detected more often in the foetus and neonate. The majority of these cysts are benign functional follicular cysts and resolve spontaneously. The decision to perform surgery depends on the clinical symptoms and appearance on ultrasound. Large uncomplicated cysts can be managed by antenatal or postnatal aspiration in order to prevent torsion and the subsequent loss of the adnex.
