Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery for uterine fibroids: relationship between the therapeutic effects and signal intensity of preexisting T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. This study was undertaken to clarify the relationship between the signal intensity of T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and the therapeutic effect of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) on uterine fibroids.Ninety-five fibroids in 63 patients were classified into 3 types based on the signal intensity of T2-weighted magnetic resonance images as follows: type 1, low intensity type 2, intermediate intensityThe treated area ratio of type 3 fibroids was the lowest among the 3 types (P < .01). The volume reduction ratio correlated with the treated area ratio (r = 0.64 P < .01).The efficacy of MRgFUS correlates with the signal intensity of T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Type 1 and type 2 fibroids are suitable candidates for MRgFUS, whereas type 3 fibroids are not.
