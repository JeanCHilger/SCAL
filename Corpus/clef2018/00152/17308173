Greek experience in the use of Thermachoice for treating heavy menstrual bleeding: prospective study. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) occurs in a considerable percentage of the general population and is one of the main causes due to which a patient is referred to health services. Despite the efforts for pharmaceutical interventions, the symptom usually persists, therefore operative techniques are needed to control the bleeding. Today, apart from the choice of hysterectomy, other less aggressive techniques have been invented. The first results of the Greek Study Group on Gynecological Endoscopy regarding the use of the Thermachoice device are hereby presented. One hundred patients suffering HMB were treated with the Thermachoice device following a standard protocol designed by the Study Group. The follow-up meetings with the patients were held at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. It seems that the overall effectiveness rate (96%) is satisfactory and it is similar to the overall effectiveness rate reported in other relevant studies upon the Thermachoice device.
