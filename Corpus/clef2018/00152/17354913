Virtual fly-over: a new visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy (VC). The proposed method is called Virtual Fly-Over, which splits the entire colon anatomy into exactly two halves. Then, it assigns a virtual camera to each half to perform fly-over navigation, which has several advantages over both traditional fly-through and related methods. First, by controlling the elevation of the camera, there is no restriction on its field of view (FOV) angle (e.g., >90 degrees) to maximize visualized surface areas, and hence no perspective distortion. Second, the camera viewing volume is perpendicular to each colon half, so potential polyps that are hidden behind haustral folds are easily found. Finally, because the orientation of the splitting surface is controllable, the navigation can be repeated at a different split orientation to overcome the problem of having a polyp that is divided between the two halves of the colon. Quantitative experimental results on 15 clinical datasets have shown that the average surface visibility coverage is 99.59 +/- 0.2%.
