Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas developing during hormone replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) containing estrogens is generally used to relieve climacteric symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis and coronary heart disease [1], however, there has been increasing evidence of the HRT as the risk of hormone-dependent neoplasms including breast cancer [2], uterine endometrial cancer [3], ovarian cancer [4], and even lung cancer [5]. Noteworthy is mucinous cyst neoplasms (MCNs) of the pancreas, characterized by mucin-producing columnar epithelium supported by "ovarian-like" mesenchymal stroma, occur mostly in females expressing estrogen receptors [6, 7]. Although several reports regarding the closed relationship between MCNs and pregnancy [8, 9] might imply potential sex hormone-dependency of the MCNs [10], no correlation has been reported. This is the first case report of malignant MCN developing during continuous HRT after hysterectomy.
