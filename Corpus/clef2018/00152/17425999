Relation between embryo transfer distance from the fundus and the pregnancy rate. To investigate the association of embryo transfer distance from the fundus (TDF) with the clinical pregnancy rate (PR).Between January 2005 and September 2006, ultrasound (US)-guided embryo transfer was conducted in 610 women. TDF was measured by transabdominal US according to which the subjects were divided into 4 groups. The association between TDF and PR or between TDF and abnormal pregnancy was analyzed.No significant differences in PR were observed among those 4 groups, but PR was the highest in the group with TDF >or=2 cm, and the lowest in the group 1 cm. The rate of early spontaneous abortion was higher in the group with TDF >or=2 cm.TDF variation does not produce significant difference in PR, but the distance of 1.0-2.0 cm is recommended.
