Giant fibrothecoma--an interesting case. A 45-year-old woman came for specialized medical attention due to intraabdominal pathology that began in 2003. Studies indicated the presence of a cyst in the right ovary, for which she was referred for surgery. She did not undergo the surgery and for a period of two years she suffered from an excessively enlarged abdomin. Posterior ultrasound studies indicated the presence of fibromatosis and she was again referred for surgery. Laparatomy was carried out and a giant cyst was found in the right ovary attached to the omentum, intestine, appendix, posterior side of the abdominal wall and to the uterus. We proceeded to remove the cyst and successively total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. Post surgery, the patient progressed well taking pertinent prophylatic measures. The histopathology report diagnosed a giant fibrothecoma weighing 30 pounds, together with endometrial hyperplasia and leiomyomas. The international literature reports that the incidence of these tumors is low, 5% of ovarian tumors, and even lower for functioning tumors as in this case.
