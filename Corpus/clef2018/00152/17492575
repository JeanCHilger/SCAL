Metastases to the Spleen in 59 cancer patients: a 14-year clinicosonographic study. To describe B-mode sonographic patterns of splenic metastases and to evaluate clinical data regarding tumour staging, kind of tumour and survival of patients with splenic metastases.From 1988 till October 2002, about 168 000 abdominal examinations were performed in an internal ultrasound laboratory. During this time, n = 59 patients with splenic metastases were detected who qualified for the retrospective study design. The following data were evaluated: echomorphology of splenic metastases, tumour staging, kind of underlying tumour, and survival rates of patients with splenic metastases.The median age of patients was 61.8 years (SD +/- 10.9). Lesions were hypoechoic n = 19 (32%), isoechoic n = 15 (25.5%), hyperechoic n = 10 (17%) und complex n = 15 (25.5%). A hypoechoic rim was found in n = 18 patients (31 %). An additional spread into other organs was seen in 56 cases (95%). Underlying cancers were carcinoma of unknown primary tumours (CUP) n = 12 (20.3%), lung cancer n = 11 (18.6 %), ovarian cancer n = 7 (11.9%), colorectal cancer n = 6 (10.2%), breast cancer n = 6 (10.2%), malignant melanoma n = 5 (8.4 %), and others n = 12 (20.3%). The median survival time for all patients was 8.7 months. The worst prognosis within the subgroup analysis was found for patients with CUP-syndrome who had a median survival time of 2.7 months.The sonographic pattern of splenic metastases is variable. Metastases to the spleen indicate a terminal stage cancer disease and is associated with an extremely short survival time. 20 % of underlying cancers were CUP-syndromes with the worst prognosis of all subgroups.
