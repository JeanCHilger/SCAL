Tumors in the gallbladder: a possible differentiation between malignant and benign tumours. In a 59-year-old woman with pain in the right upper abdomen, echography and CT-scan revealed adenomatosis of the gallbladder. Her symptoms did not disappear after cholecystectomy, even though echography showed no further abnormality. In a 46-year-old man with fever and weight loss, echography revealed two polyps in the gallbladder. Following cholecystectomy, histopathology revealed cholesterol polyps and an infection with Entamoeba coli. In a 63-year-old man with systemic symptoms, a biopsy of the echographically diagnosed tumour of the gallbladder revealed that he had actually had cholecystitis. The management was wait-and-see and the patient recovered completely. In a 68-year-old woman with jaundice and attacks of abdominal pain, a CT-scan revealed gallstones. The symptoms recurred following an ERCP. Following cholecystectomy, an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder was found. One year later, a contact metastasis developed forwhich she received radiotherapy. After 4 years she was in good condition. Patients with a tumour in the gallbladder are often diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, which has a poor prognosis. Other diseases should also be considered, since the treatment and prognosis differ greatly. It is important to differentiate at an early stage. Ultrasound, CT and MRI have improved the possibility of differentiating and choosing the correct treatment.
