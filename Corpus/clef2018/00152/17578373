Virilization in pregnancy due to a borderline mucinous ovarian tumor. Virilization in pregnancy due to borderline mucinous ovarian tumors is very rare. A case of a 28-year-old patient who was noted at 28 weeks' gestation to have marked virilization with raised serum androgens, ascites and a large complex right adnexal mass is presented. Delivery was carried out by cesarean section and at surgery a large tumor was noted in the right ovary. Histology revealed a borderline mucinous ovarian tumor with stromal luteinization, but there was no evidence of stromal invasion. Serum androgens returned to normal levels following surgery and the maternal virilization had resolved at the 6-week postnatal visit. Stromal changes in borderline mucinous ovarian tumors may result in virilization due to androgen production surgical removal is associated with an excellent clinical outcome.
