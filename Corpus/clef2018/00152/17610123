Characterization of Vibrio cholerae O1 ElTor typing phage S5. S5 (ATCC No. 51352-B2), a Vibrio cholerae O1 ElTor typing phage was characterized. The growth characteristics and inactivation kinetics (thermal, UV and pH) of this lytic phage were investigated. Phage morphology was examined by electron microscopy and was classified as belonging to the family Podoviridae. The S5 phage genome is shown to be a linear double-stranded 39-kb-long DNA as determined by electron microscopy and restriction digestion. Partial denaturation maps were constructed and were used to show that the DNA is non-permuted and terminally redundant. The replication origin of this T7-like phage was visualized by electron microscopy. The polarity of packaging of S5 DNA in the phage head was determined. SDS-PAGE of phage S5 shows two major structural polypeptides of 50 and 42 kDa. A 3D structure of the phage head was reconstructed at a resolution of 37 A using Cryo-EM and a single-particle reconstruction technique.
