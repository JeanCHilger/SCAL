Endometrial carcinoma presenting as hematometra: clinicopathological study of a rare case and literature review. A case of a postmenopausal woman who was investigated for a large cystic peritoneal tumor which turned out to be hematometra is presented. From her clinical history, a wide excision of the uterine cervix was reported due to a high-grade intraepithelial squamous neoplasia. Laparotomy showed a greatly enlarged uterus and the histological exam revealed a hematometra with a superficial endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine cavity. The remaining cervix had extensive fibrosis and complete obliteration of the cervical canal. A review of the literature revealed that hematometra in postmenopausal women should be investigated because it may harbor a cancer.
