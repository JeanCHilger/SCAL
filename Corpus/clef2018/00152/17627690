A standardised ultrasonic diagnosis and an accurate prevalence for the retroverted uterus in general gynaecology patients. Transvaginal ultrasound with an empty bladder is recommended as a standardised ultrasonic technique for the accurate diagnosis of the retroverted uterus. Using this method, the prevalence of the retroverted uterus in 480 general gynaecological patients attending for subspecialist gynaecological ultrasound was 18%. The anteverting effect of the full bladder required for transabdominal ultrasound reduces the prevalence of the retroverted uterus to 13% (P < 0.001).
