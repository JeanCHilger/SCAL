Cul-de-sac pregnancy following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. We report a case of cul-de-sac pregnancy following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in a patient with primary infertility.A 33-year-old primigravida woman underwent IVF-ET 4 weeks before her presentation. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) on day 20 after embryo transfer was 901 mIU/mL. Ultrasound examination on day 30 after embryo transfer revealed an ectopic gestational sac with fetal heart beat in the left adnexa, without any evidence of intrauterine pregnancy. Laparoscopy was performed and revealed an ectopic mass in the congenital blind pouch that was connected to the posterior cul-de-sac. The gestational tissue was removed by forceps, and electrocauterization was used for hemostasis under laparotomy. Serum beta-hCG fell to 7 mIU/mL after surgery.Serum beta-hCG combined with ultrasound scanning enables early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
