Computer-aided detection for CT colonography: update 2007. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is an emerging technique for polyp detection in the colon. However, lesion detection can be challenging due to insufficient patient preparation, chosen CT technique or reader imperfection. The primary goal of computer-aided detection (CAD) for CTC is locating possible polyps, and presenting the reader with these polyp candidates. Other goals are sensitivity improvement and reduction of reading time and inter-observer variability. The multistep CAD procedure typically consists of segmentation of the colonic wall (e.g. region growing) selection of intermediate polyp candidates (curvature analysis, sphere fitting, normal analysis, slope density function ...)
