Unsuspected endometrial pathology in the subfertile woman. Routine sampling of the endometrium is not considered necessary in the investigation of female infertility in the presence of normal menstruation. We present the cases of five women diagnosed with endometrial pathology during the course of fertility investigations. Three women had atypical polypoid adenomyoma, one had complex endometrial hyperplasia and one had stage 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma. Only the latter described any abnormality in menstruation. No woman had polycystic ovarian syndrome nor any other reason in her history to suspect endometrial pathology. Two women had abnormal transvaginal ultrasound findings. Atypical polypoid adenomyoma is frequently associated with subfertility. Although usually biologically benign, malignant transformation has been reported. With current trends of increasing obesity and later age at attempted conception, the possibility of discovering endometrial pathology during fertility investigation is likely to increase. We believe that a thorough menstrual history and careful assessment of the endometrium is warranted in all women with fertility problems. A transvaginal pelvic ultrasound should be performed in the follicular (early) phase of the cycle. If this ultrasound examination and the woman's menstrual history are both normal, no further evaluation of the endometrial cavity is routinely required. Sonohysterography is superior to pelvic ultrasound in detecting intracavitary pathology and is thus recommended prior to IVF treatment. Hysteroscopy is the gold standard in the detection of intrauterine pathology and is well tolerated in the office setting. Where abnormality is suspected or detected at screening, futher investigation and concomitant treatment is essential. This is ideally performed via hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling or excision of focally abnormal areas.
