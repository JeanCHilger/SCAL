Anterior sacral meningocele: management in gynecological practice. We describe the case of a young woman with anterior sacral meningocele (ASM), initially identified during a routine ultrasound examination and subsequently diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ASM is a rare disorder characterized by uni- or multilocular extensions of the meninges from the sacral spinal canal to the retroperitoneal presacral space. Common symptoms include lower back and pelvic pain, constipation, difficulties in defecation, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, and urinary incontinence, retention or urgency. Perineal and lower-extremity paresthesias may present when nerve roots are affected. Despite its more posterior location, ASM can mimic an ovarian cyst or other adnexal cystic mass, and in the obstetric patient can present a mechanical obstacle to delivery with a risk of rupture and infection during labor and delivery. Although it is a rare condition, we feel that awareness of the etiology, presentation and imaging characteristics of ASM is of importance and have therefore carried out a review of the literature, taking into account case findings and the obstetric and gynecological management of this disorder.
