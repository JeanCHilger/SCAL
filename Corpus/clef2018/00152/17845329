Clinical, endocrine and ultrasonographic features of polycystic ovary syndrome in Thai women. To study the prevalence, reproductive hormone profiles and ovarian sonographic appearance of Thai women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).One thousand and ninety-five women were screened for oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, and the clinical symptoms of hyperandrogenism. Ovarian morphology and volume were assessed by ultrasonography in diagnosed cases. Blood was taken for the measurement of the follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone.The prevalence of PCOS was 5.7%. The mean age of women with PCOS was less than that of non-PCOS cases (27.4 +/- 6.5 and 31.1 +/- 6.4 years, respectively P < 0.0001). Abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility were the leading presenting symptoms. The mean ovarian volume in women with PCO appearance was 9.22 +/- 4.36 mL compared to 6.53 +/- 3.31 mL in those without this appearance (P = 0.04). Hyperandrogenemia was confirmed in 23 of the 62 cases (37.1%).The prevalence and clinical presentations of Thai women with PCOS were similar to those in other reports. However, hirsutism, elevated testosterone level and acanthosis nigricans were uncommon in our population. Serum androstenedione was a more sensitive indicator of hyperandrogenemia than total testosterone. Further research is needed to clarify whether there is an ethnic difference in endocrine profiles and risks of metabolic syndrome.
