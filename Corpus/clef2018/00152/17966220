Use of lysophosphatidic acid in the management of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. To establish whether LPA determination improves the differentiation of benign from malignant ovarian tumors.Total LPA and LPA species in the serum were determined using a novel method in 142 patients with ultrasound (US) suspecious ovarian tumors and in 78 healthy women. All women underwent determination of CA125 in the serum, a vaginal US examination and morphology scoring of the tumor.The levels of total LPA and its species in women with ovarian tumors were significantly higher from those in healthy women (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found in the levels of total LPA or any of its species between the women with benign and those with malignant ovarian tumors.Determination of serum LPA would be an appropriate test for ovarian tumor presence, especially in women of reproductive age. The method however does not differentiate benign from malignant ovarian tumors.
