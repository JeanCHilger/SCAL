Recurrent intracardiac leiomyomatosis. An intravenous leiomyoma, a histologically benign smooth muscle tumour, arises from either a uterine myoma or the walls of a uterine vessel, with extension into veins. The present report describes echocardiographic features of an intravenous leiomyoma that spread into the right-sided cardiac chambers in a middle-aged woman who had undergone a hysterectomy two years earlier. Echocardiographic features included an elongated mobile mass extending from the inferior vena cava and multiple masses in the right atrium and right ventricle. Intracardiac leiomyomatosis should be considered in women who present with a cardiac mass in the right-sided chambers.
