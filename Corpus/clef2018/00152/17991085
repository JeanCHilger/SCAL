Meat balls: a pathognomonic ultrasound and computed tomography finding in mature cystic teratoma. One of the commonest germ cell tumours are mature cystic ovarian teratomas. Although the imaging features of teratomas are highly variable, the sonographic and CT identification of fatty and calcific components are fairly suggestive. The case presented, however, is of an unusual, yet pathognomonic CT and ultrasound imaging appearance of an ovarian teratoma that was due to floating balls.
