MRgFUS for pain relief as palliative treatment in recurrent cervical carcinoma: a case report. Focused ultrasound under real-time MR guidance and control (MRgFUS) can be used for the thermal ablation of tissue. Currently this technique is used clinically for the noninvasive treatment of uterine leiomyomas and is in clinical evaluation for breast cancer, adenomyosis and other indications. MRgFUS is being tested for pain relief in patients suffering from bone metastases. This is the first case to report on MRgFUS for pain relief in patients suffering from recurrent cervical carcinoma.A 29-year-old patient with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of cervix following radical hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiation was treated by MRgFUS due to pelvic mass unresponsive to conventional treatment that caused intractable pain. Following two treatments the patient experienced a marked reduction in pain and increase in Karnovsky Performance Status (KPS) from 50% to 80%.Palliative treatment of pain with noninvasive MRgFUS in cases of recurrent cervical carcinoma may be a safe and efficient alternative to other invasive techniques.
