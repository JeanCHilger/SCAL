Uterine abnormalities in non menopausal women who received tamoxifen for breast cancer adjuvant therapy. To elaborate a strategy of endometrial follow-up for premenopausal women treated with Tamoxifen as adjuvant hormonal treatment of breast cancer.Retrospective study of 152 premenopausal patients treated with Tamoxifen in Nantes Comprehensive Cancer Center for a breast cancer from January 2003 to December 2005. Vaginal sonography was used in the follow-up of 70 of them.Endometrial hypertrophy was found in 26 patients. Sonohysterography and hysteroscopy allowed to find 11 polyps and three hyperplasias in the 19 women who were investigated. In our study, endometrial pathology was found in 20% of premenopausal women treated with Tamoxifen (polyps or hyperplasia). Uterine bleeding was found in half patient of this group.Vaginal sonography monitoring could be proposed to premenopausal women treated with Tamoxifen among whom endometrial pathology is usual.
