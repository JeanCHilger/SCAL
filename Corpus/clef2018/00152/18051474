Antenatal diagnosis of neonatal surgical diseases. With advances in noninvasive fetal diagnostic tools, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, the percentage of neonatal surgical patients detected antenatally has increased. Recently, color Doppler as well as 3D imaging has contributed to more accurate diagnoses with ultrasonography. The significance of antenatal diagnosis for neonatal surgical disease and the current progress in fetal surgery are described and discussed. At present, congenital diaphragmatic hernia with extremely severe hypoplastic lung, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation with hydrops, obstructive uropathy with oligohydramnios, and simple ovarian cyst greater than 5cm in diameter are considered to be appropriate indications for fetal surgery.
