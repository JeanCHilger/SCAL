Polycystic ovary syndrome: clinical and imaging features. Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder occurring in reproductive-age women. The syndrome is complex, multifactorial, and not always easily defined. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of clinical and biochemical criteria and ovarian morphology. The following review describes the clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and the role of imaging. Diagnostic imaging techniques are discussed, with emphasis on ultrasound as the main modality used worldwide. Contributions of 3-dimensional and Doppler ultrasound are addressed in addition to potential indications for magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of patients with suspected polycystic ovary syndrome.
