Association of left ventricular function with bone mineral density in older women: a population-based study. Due to the increasing mortality and disability rates associated with hip and vertebral fractures in older age, research is currently focusing on "new" determinants of osteoporosis in elderly subjects. Most recently, low bone mineral density (BMD) has been repeatedly reported in patients with end-stage heart failure. We assessed the association, if any, of BMD with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in a general older population. We assessed the association of LVEF with T score, Z score, and stiffness index in all 312 subjects aged 75 and over living in Tuscania, Italy. Among women, LVEF was associated with T score (beta = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.05 P = 0.033), Z score (beta = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.04
