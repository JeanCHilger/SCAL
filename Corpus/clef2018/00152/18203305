Bile tract adenomyoma: a case report. This paper described a rare case of adenomyoma of common bile duct. The case is a 51-year-old man who was hospitalized for yellow color skin and sclera and itching for 2 mo without abdominal pain. Nothing special was found in physical examination except yellowish skin and sclera. The clinical presentation and Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and ultrasonography suspected a tumor of the distal bile duct. The patient was treated successfully by pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histologically, the lesion consisted of adenoid and myofibrous tissue and moderate atypia. The immunophenotype of the epithelial component was cytokeratin 7+/cytokeratin 20-. The patient has been well without any evidence of recurrence for 12 mo since his operation.
