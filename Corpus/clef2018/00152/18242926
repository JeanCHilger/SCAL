A case of intrauterine molar pregnancy with coexistent ectopic pregnancy. We describe a woman who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. She was initially diagnosed by the emergency physician with a molar pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasound, which was confirmed and treated by the consulting obstetrical service with a dilatation and curettage the following day. The patient was discharged home later that same day and subsequently returned to the ED after several hours complaining of an acute worsening of her abdominal pain with associated fatigue and lightheadedness. Transabdominal ultrasound performed by the emergency physician demonstrated intra-abdominal free fluid, and the obstetrical service was immediately contacted. Subsequent operative management identified a separate ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube that was confirmed by pathologic analysis after laparoscopic removal.
