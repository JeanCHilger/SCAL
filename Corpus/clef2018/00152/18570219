Myometrial involvement of tumor-like cystic endosalpingiosis: a rare entity. Endosalpingiosis is characterized by the presence of benign glands lined by tubal-type epithelium involving the pelvic and lower abdominal peritoneum and pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes in women. Rarely, cystification can occur, resulting in a neoplasm-like mass associated with clinical manifestations, an intraoperative abnormality, or a striking finding on gross examination. Here we report the transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological appearance of an unusual case of cystic endosalpingiosis involving the right ovary and full thickness of the wall of the uterine fundus in a patient who presented with a 6-month history of menorrhagia and pelvic pain. Clinicians should be aware of this type of uterine benign manifestation so as to refrain from overtreatment.
