Primary ovarian pregnancy after the empty follicle syndrome: a case report. A 32-year-old nulligravida woman underwent in vitro fertilization treatment because of 6 years of unexplained infertility. On the day of ovum pick-up, no eggs were retrieved and the patient was diagnosed to have empty follicle syndrome. Six weeks later, she presented with left lower abdominal pain and mild vaginal bleeding. Laboratory tests and diagnostic laparoscopy revealed left ovarian pregnancy. Left oophorectomy was performed and the histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis.
