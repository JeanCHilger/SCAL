A rare case of low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus. Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is a rare disease. Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS) is characterized by proliferations composed of cells with endometrial stromal cell differentiation and typically show extensive worm-like vessel invasion. We present a case of a 38-year-old woman with complaints of abdominal pains and ultrasound findings of a tumour formation in the pelvis. The biopsy examination showed a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS), with a primary location in the uterine corpus and a tumour infiltration in the myometrium and cervix of the uterus, with tumour emboli in the lymph vessels and tumour methastases in the peritoneum--FIGO III Stage. The patient underwent postoperative polychemotherapy and radiotherapy. The gynecological and ultrasound examination found no pathological changes in the pelvic region five years after the operation.
