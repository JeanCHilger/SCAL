Early results of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery of adenomyosis: analysis of 20 cases. To evaluate the thermal ablative effects of magnetic resonance-(MR) guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) on adenomyosis and to assess improvement in clinical parameters.Twenty patients with adenomyosis were treated with MRgFUS. Extensive adenomyosis (6 cases) was treated with 2 applications. Uterine volume was evaluated by MR imaging before and immediately after MRgFUS. Ablation of adenomyosis and the architecture of nonperfused areas were evaluated immediately after MRgFUS. Improvement in patient symptoms was assessed through the symptom severity score questionnaire (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).Department of gynecology at a Japanese general hospital.Premenopausal women at least 18 years of age with symptomatic adenomyosis.Thermal ablation by MRgFUS.We classified the nonperfused lesions on contrast-enhanced MR images immediately after MRgFUS into 3 types: lesions with round margins (type R), serrated margins (type S), and honeycomb architecture (type H). Type R was the most common (16/20 patients). Most adenomyosis lesions could be sufficiently ablated close to the serosal surface or to the endometrium by MRgFUS. The mean uterine volume 6 months after therapy was decreased by 12.7%. Symptom severity score improved significantly during 6 months of follow-up. No serious complications were observed.These early results indicate the safe and effective ablation of adenomyosis tissue by MRgFUS. The procedure also resulted in the improvement in clinical symptoms during the 6 months of follow-up.
