Hysteroscopic management of cervical pregnancy with intrauterine irrigation with H2O2. The objective of our study was to introduce a safe and effective method for the treatment of cervical pregnancy. This was a case series and took place at the minimal invasive surgery clinic at Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, Korea. From April 2005 through October 2007, a total of 10 patients with cervical pregnancy underwent hysteroscopic surgery. An 18 F foley catheter was inserted through the cervical canal after dilation, and the uterine cavity was irrigated with 3.5% H2O2 300 mL for prevention of unrelenting bleeding. Hysteroscopic removal of cervical gestation under ultrasonographic guidance was performed uneventfully. All patients had an unremarkable postoperative course. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were monitored after surgery and exhibited optimal decrease. All cases had histologic confirmation of products of conception removed from the cervix. The estimated blood loss was less than 50 mL. All patients were discharged after the first or second postoperative day. Hysteroscopic removal of cervical pregnancy with H2O2 is very useful and safe and preserves fertility.
