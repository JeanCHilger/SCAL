Triorchidism: a case report and review of similar conditions. Polyorchidism is a rare anomaly, defined as the presence of more than two testicles with about 100 cases reported in the literature. The majority of cases were triorchidism with occasional bilateral duplication. We report the case of a 32-year-old man with polyorchidism, presenting with primary infertility with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia semen profile. Scrotal examination revealed two discrete ovoid nontender, firm, mobile lumps with testicular sensation in the right side of the scrotum. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of double testes with double separate epididymides sharing a common vas deferens in the right side of the scrotum. It demonstrated similar echo texture and vascular flow in both right-sided testicles although smaller in size than the left testis. The case was managed conservatively without surgical intervention with follow-up. Tracing of similar conditions in the literature was discussed.
