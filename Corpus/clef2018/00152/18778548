Ejaculatory duct obstruction. Prostatic cysts are rare lesions with a reported incidence from 1 to 7.9%. They have been associated with primary infertility. The main characteristic is the benign course and positive prognosis after correct surgical management.We present three clinical cases, two with primary infertility and another with a history of primary infertility who presented with recurrent hemospermia and refractory medical treatment. All patients had hypospermia and alteration of the seminal parameters represented by moderate oligospermia (MOS), asteno- and teratozoospermia, in addition to hemospermia in two patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by transrectal ultrasound. Transurethral resection (TUR) of the cyst was performed in two cases and resection of the veru montanum in one, obtaining improvement in the seminal parameters after 1 month of follow-up and acceptable parameters for spontaneous conception at 6 months.Infertility associated with partially obstructed ejaculatory ducts may be suspected clinically by hypospermia. Transrectal ultrasound is essential to confirm the diagnosis. TUR of this lesion reestablishes the free passage of semen in almost all patients, with potential recovery of fertility 6 months after treatment.
