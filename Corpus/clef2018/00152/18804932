Mature and immature ovarian teratomas: CT, US and MR imaging characteristics. Ovarian teratomas (OTs) are the most common germ cell neoplasm. They include mature cystic teratomas, monodermal teratomas (neural tumors, struma ovarii, carcinoid tumors) and immature teratomas. Teratomas are the most common benign ovarian neoplasms in women less than 45 years old. OTs are usually characterized by ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) whereas they are usually an incidental finding on CT. The purpose of this paper is to review the most common types of teratomas and to describe CT, US and MR imaging features of the various types of mature and immature OTs.
