Assessment of the value of pelvic ultrasonography in pre-menopausal women with right iliac fossa pain. The aim of this study was to determine whether ultrasound examination performed in the acute setting can avoid the need for diagnostic laparoscopy in pre-menopausal women presenting with right iliac fossa pain in whom the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. All female patients aged fifty or under, who presented to the Emergency Department with right iliac fossa pain over an eighteen-month period, and who went on to have a diagnostic laparoscopy performed, were included in the study. Ultrasound and operative findings were recorded. 147 patients fulfilling the study criteria were identified. 38 (26%) had pre-operative ultrasound performed. 15 of these had normal findings, 10 had gynaecological pathology identified, 8 had non-specific findings. Of the 38 patients who had pelvic ultrasound pre-operatively, 26 (68%) had acute appendicitis at laparoscopy, only 5 of whom had a sonographic diagnosis of acute appendicitis made pre-operatively. We conclude that while positive ultrasound findings in cases of acute appendicitis are helpful, negative studies do not exclude the diagnosis. Patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis should proceed directly to laparoscopy while patients in whom the diagnosis is less certain, should be admitted for a period of observation facilitating repeated clinical evaluation. In this subgroup of patients, further imaging studies such as computed tomography may be indicated.
