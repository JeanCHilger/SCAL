Uterine prolapse in pregnancy: a rare condition an obstetrician should be familiar with. Uterine prolapse complicating pregnancy is a rare event. Early recognition is essential in order to avoid possible maternal and fetal risks. We report the case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman who presented to the antenatal outpatient clinic with uterine prolapse at 31(+1) weeks of gestation. Sonographic examination revealed an enlarged fibromatous uterus. She was conservatively treated on an inpatient basis. Two weeks later she underwent an emergency cesarean section because of preterm uterine contractions. A live male neonate weighing 1,900 g was delivered. We believe that conservative management with bed rest, followed by an elective cesarean section, may ensure an uncomplicated gestation and an uneventful delivery.
