Value of multi-slice spiral CT with three-dimensional reconstruction in the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions in the jawbones. To assess the value of multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) with three dimensional (3D) reconstruction in the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions in the jawbones.Thirty-three patients with neoplastic lesions of the jawbones underwent MSCT scanning with 3D reconstruction. Of these patients, 14 had ameloblastoma, 8 had hemangioma, 3 had osteosarcoma, 3 had ossifying fibroma, 2 had chondrosarcoma, 2 had fibrosarcoma, and 1 had odontogenic myxoma. Preoperative MSCT scanning was performed with the slice thickness of 2 mm, and 3D reconstruction of the images was conducted by means of multi-planar reconstruction (MPR), curved-planar reformation (CRP), and 3D volume rendering technique (VRT). The results were compared with those observed during the operations.In the 33 cases, the neoplastic lesions of the jawbones were displayed by 2D or 3D imaging and confirmed by intraoperative findings. Two-dimensional imaging allowed better observation than 3D imaging of the deep structures, whereas 3D imaging was superior in visualizing the morphological changes of the compromised bones and the spatial relationship between the tumors and surrounding structures. Two-dimensional imaging and MPR were excellent in revealing the internal structures and pathological changes of tumors, having also better performance in showing the tumors involving the soft tissues. Benign tumors were most visualized as bone expansion changes with well defined ovoid or lobulated borderlines, and malignant ones often resulted in adjacent bony destruction and soft tissue masses.MSCT examination is useful in defining the scope of tumor involvement and bony changes to help in the definite diagnosis, differential diagnosis and choice of clinical treatment. Two-dimensional imaging, MPR, VRT and CRP have their respective advantages and limitations in showing jawbone tumor, and their combination can be of great clinical value.
