Cervical pregnancy: a case series and a review of current clinical practice. Five consecutive cases of cervical pregnancy (CP) are presented. In four cases, the diagnosis was made at routine check-ups and these were all treated conservatively. In the fifth case, an erroneous diagnosis of inevitable abortion was made, in a patient presenting with profuse vaginal bleeding. Persistent bleeding following curettage required an emergency hysterectomy, after failure of compressive methods. From the four cases treated conservatively, three received standard methotrexate i.m. (MTX) in combination with bilateral uterine artery embolization (UAE). In one case MTX was followed by intraamniotic puncture and instillation of KCl due to persistent embryonic heartbeat. A spontaneous evacuation of the cervical pregnancy occurred in all patients treated conservatively. We postulate that the preventive use of uterine artery embolization in combination with standard MTX treatment could contribute to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding and facilitate spontaneous expulsion. Possible detrimental effects of the treatment on subsequent reproductive capacities and obstetrical outcome are also pointed out. The diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches are discussed and the literature is reviewed. With referral to the first case of our series, which required an emergency hysterectomy, we want to stress the importance of an early diagnosis for a correct management of this condition.
