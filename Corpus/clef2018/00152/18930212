The impact of electrocoagulation on ovarian reserve after laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts: a prospective clinical study of 191 patients. To investigate the impact of electrocoagulation on ovarian reserve after laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts and the possible mechanisms.A prospective study.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of a university hospital.191 patients with benign ovarian cysts undergoing ovarian cystectomy.Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy using bipolar or ultrasonic scalpel electrocoagulation and laparotomic ovarian cystectomy using sutures after the excision of ovarian cysts.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) assay and transvaginal ultrasound evaluating basal antral follicle number, mean ovarian diameter, and ovarian stromal blood flow velocity at day 3 of menstrual cycles 1, 3, 6, and 12 after surgery.When comparing the bipolar group and ultrasonic scalpel group with the suture group, a statistically significant increase of the mean FSH value was found in bilateral-cyst patients at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up evaluations and in unilateral-cyst patients at the 1-month follow-up evaluation. Statistically significant decreases of basal antral follicle number and mean ovarian diameter were found during the 3-, 6-, 12-month follow-up evaluations as well as statistically significant decreases of peak systolic velocity at all of the follow-up evaluations.Electrocoagulation after laparoscopic excision of ovarian cysts is associated with a statistically significant reduction in ovarian reserve, which is partly a consequence of the damage to the ovarian vascular system.
