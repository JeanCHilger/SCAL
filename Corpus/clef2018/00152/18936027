US and CT evaluation of acute pelvic pain of gynecologic origin in nonpregnant premenopausal patients. The interpretation of imaging findings in the premenopausal patient with acute pelvic pain is influenced by knowledge of the physiologic changes that occur in the pelvis as well as by the patient's clinical history. Although ultrasonography (US) is the modality of choice for initial imaging, gynecologic disease is detected or suspected with increasing frequency at computed tomography (CT) because of the increasing availability and use of this modality. As a result, the recognition of common features of gynecologic entities on both US and CT images is essential for prompt diagnosis and expeditious management. Categorizing lesions according to their anatomic location, physiologic or pathologic origin, and internal characteristics (cystic, solid, or mixed) allows efficient and accurate diagnosis.
