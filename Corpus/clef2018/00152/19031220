Assessment of ovarian vascularization in the polycystic ovary by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography. To assess whether there are differences in ovarian echogenicity and vascularization as assessed by three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) between women with polycystic ovaries (PCO) and women with normal ovaries (NO).Eighty-three women were classified into two groups according to the 2003 Rotterdam consensus criteria. The NO group comprised women (n = 45) with regular menstrual cycles and proven fertility, whereas the PCO group comprised women (n = 38) with oligo-anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical features of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology at two-dimensional ultrasound. All women were evaluated by means of 3D-PDA. The parameters studied in both groups were follicle number per ovary (FNPO), ovarian volume (OV), mean gray value (MG) and three vascular indices: vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI).The PCO group showed a higher mean OV as well as FNPO. No differences in MG, VI, FI and VFI were found between the groups.3D-PDA indices are not useful for discriminating between normal and polycystic ovaries.
