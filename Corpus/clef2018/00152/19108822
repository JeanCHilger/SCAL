True ovarian volume is underestimated by two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound measurement. To investigate a possible difference between true ovarian volume and ovarian volume estimated with two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal ultrasound.Prospective clinical and laboratory study.University hospital research laboratory.Premenopausal girls and women from three Danish national fertility centers (A: n = 42 B: n = 6Transvaginal 2D ultrasound measurement of ovarian volume before oophorectomy. True ovarian volume was obtained by weighing the ovary.Ovarian volume estimated by weight and ultrasound.Ovarian tissue density was 1.00 g/mL. Mean ovarian volume by ultrasound vs. weight in the three groups was as follows: A: 6.3 mL vs. 7.8 mL B: 5.4 mL vs. 6.8 mLOvarian volume was severely underestimated by transvaginal 2D ultrasound measurement.
