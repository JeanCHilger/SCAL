Novel clomiphene "stair-step" protocol reduces time to ovulation in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of a novel "stair-step" clomiphene protocol in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who do not respond to 50 mg clomiphene.This was a retrospective analysis at an academic fertility center. The stair-step protocol is performed as follows: 50 mg clomiphene for 5 days, ultrasonography on days 11-14. If unresponsive, immediately begin 100 mg clomiphene for 5 days and repeat ultrasound in 1 week. If still unresponsive, begin 150 mg clomiphene for 5 days and repeat the ultrasound in 1 week. Stair-step cycles were compared with published historical clomiphene outcomes for women who were nonresponsive.The time to ovulation was 32-53 days less with the stair-step protocol compared with a traditional regimen. The dose-dependent ovulation rate was 64% at 100 mg with the stair-step protocol compared with 22% with a traditional regimen.It is not necessary to induce menses before increasing clomiphene doses in nonresponsive PCOS patients.
