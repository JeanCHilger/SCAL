Endometrial effects of a single early luteal dose of the selective progesterone receptor modulator CDB-2914. To test potential contraceptive mechanisms of the selective P receptor modulator CDB-2914 in the early luteal phase.Prospective randomized clinical trial.Clinical research center.Fifty-six women with regular cycles.Women received a single dose of CDB-2914 (10, 50, or 100 mg) or placebo given after ovulation and within 2 days of the LH surge. Four to 6 days later, a transvaginal ultrasound scan measured endometrial thickness, and an endometrial biopsy specimen was obtained.The endometrium was evaluated by thickness and by immunohistochemical analysis for P-dependent markers safety laboratory tests were performed, and E(2) and P levels were obtained.CDB-2914 caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in endometrial thickness, an increase in glandular P receptors, and a decrease in peripheral node addressins. Estradiol and P levels and menstrual cycle timing were not altered. No adverse effects were observed.The alteration in endometrial thickness and P-dependent markers of implantation in the absence of changes in hormone levels and cycle length suggests that CDB-2914 may have contraceptive properties.
