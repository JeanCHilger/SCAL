Reproducibility and reliability of automated volumetric measurement of single preovulatory follicles using SonoAVC. To evaluate the reproducibility and the reliability of an innovative, computer-assisted approach for automatically measuring ovarian follicles.Prospective, comparative study.Hospital Béclère, Clamart, France.Fifteen infertile women undergoing IVF-ET in monodominant follicle cycles.Just before oocyte retrieval, follicles were three-dimensionally reconstructed from transvaginal ultrasonographic images. Volumes were determined both manually by visual outlining of inner follicle borders (VOCAL) and automatically using SonoAVC. Each procedure was repeated three times. Follicular fluid volume indicated the actual follicle volume.Reproducibility and concordance of results were assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the limits of agreement method, respectively.At any time, VOCAL (3.68, 2.41-8.29 mL 3.73, 2.70-7.16 mLAutomatic measurement of ovarian follicle volumes from three-dimensionally reconstructed ultrasound images (SonoAVC) is a rapid and simple technique, which reproducibility and reliability are comparable to the semimanual technique (VOCAL). It opens new perspectives for the accurate and objective assessment of ovarian function by ultrasound.
