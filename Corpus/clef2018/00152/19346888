Ovarian juvenile granulosa cell tumors in infants. Juvenile ovarian granulosa cell tumors (JGCTs) are described infrequently in pediatrics, and their finding in prepubertal patients is exceptional. Most of the tumors are benign, but recurrences up to 4 years of follow-up have been described. We present 2 cases of JGCT in infants: 1 with late recurrence of bilateral ovarian JGCT and 1 in a newborn with Ollier disease. Clinical diagnosis and treatment of JGCT are revised.
