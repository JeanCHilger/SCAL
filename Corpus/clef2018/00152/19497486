Ovarian cyst torsion in a toddler. Acute abdominal pain in children is encountered frequently, and the differential diagnosis is extensive. Acute ovarian torsion in children is rare, especially at a very young age, and a difficult diagnosis to make. Infarction caused by ovarian torsion will result if the twist is not unwound spontaneously or surgically in a timely fashion. We presented a case of acute ovarian cyst torsion in a 2-year-old girl who originally presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultimately, she was found to have a 2-cm cyst of the right ovary with concomitant torsion. Because acute ovarian torsion in a very young child is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimize morbidity. It is important to keep ovarian torsion in the differential of any female children with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware that the potential of acute ovarian torsion in a very young child has a high index of suspicion and seek early operative intervention.
