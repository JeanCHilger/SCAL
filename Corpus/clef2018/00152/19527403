Advanced pregnancy loss in the rudimentary horn of an undiagnosed unicornuate uterus. A case of advanced pregnancy loss in the rudimentary horn of a unicornuate uterus is presented herein. The unknown uterine malformation and advanced pregnancy resulted in the condition being incorrectly diagnosed on ultrasound. After a failed attempt at dilatation and curettage, a correct diagnosis was made and proper treatment was given during salvage laparotomy performed for arising complications (coagulopathy).
