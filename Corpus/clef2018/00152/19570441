Investigate of three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound used in placental perfusion assessment in pre-eclampsia pregnancies. To investigate the placenta perfusion in pre-eclampsia by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound and analysing the clinical outcome.80 cases of normal and pre-eclampsia pregnant women from July 2007 to May 2008 in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital were studied. The control group of 36 cases, pre-eclampsia were divided into three groups: a total of 44 cases, mild pre-eclampsia group (9 cases), severe pre-eclampsia group (26 cases) and chronic hypertension with pre-eclampsia group (9 cases). The placental vascular index (VI), flow index (FI), blood vessels and blood flow index (VFI) by three-dimensional Doppler histogram and the umbilical blood flow systolic to diastolic (S/D) by color Doppler flow imaging were calculated and the gestational age after delivery, birth weight, placental weight after birth were recorded respectively.(1) VI, FI, VFI and umbilical blood flow S/D value: 6.3+/-2.9, 38.6+/-4.4, 2.7+/-1.3, 2.5+/-0.6 in normal group 5.7+/-3.8, 36.3+/-7.2, 2.4+/-2.0, 2.4+/-0.3 in mild pre-eclampsia group(1) Placental blood flow perfusion of the severe pre-eclampsia and pre-eclampsia with chronic hypertension of pregnancy decreased resulting in clinically lower placental weight, birth weight and gestational age at delivery, but there were no obvious differences in umbilical blood flow S/D values. (2) The investigation was helpful to clinical diagnosis in the placenta perfusion of pre-eclampsia by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound.
