Ultrasound detection of the "sliding viscera" sign promotes safer laparoscopy. To estimate the feasibility of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of the umbilical region in patients undergoing laparoscopy with a previous history of abdominal surgery.Prospective study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1).Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Fatebenefratelli Isola Tiberina Hospital.Twenty-five women with a previous history of open abdominal surgery (group A) and a group of 22 women with no previous history of surgery (group B) underwent dynamic ultrasound evaluation of the umbilical field.Ultrasound Slide-By test.Patients were asked to take a deep inspiratory breath, which accentuated respiratory excursion. The movement of the intraabdominal contents in a vertical fashion in relation to the abdominal wall, referred to as the "viscera slide," between the bowel and peritoneum was evaluated. Abdominal wall tissue thickness, Uracus to peritoneum thickness (UTP, mm) were also evaluated. Non parametric Mann-Whitney testing was used. No major demographic differences between the 2 study groups was noted. The abdominal wall tissue thickness was not significantly different between the 2 groups. The UTP was shorter in A group than in B group (1.5 +/- 0.3 mm vs 3.5 +/- 0.9 mm, p = .002). Absence of the "sliding viscera" sign was observed in 16 patients in group A and in 1 patient in group B. Patients with an absence of the sliding viscera sign were found to have subumbilical fibrous adhesions during laparoscopy.Evaluation of trocar insertion sites may be difficult and remains a challenge for peritoneal endosurgical access. We have shown that absence of the "sliding viscera" sign is more likely to be linked to subumbilical adhesions and represents a quick method for preoperative assessment. The UTP may also be a useful measurement, which requires further validation.
