The role of transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy in the evaluation of the menopausal endometrium. All postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding need endometrial assessment. Disposable suction piston biopsy devices have virtually replaced dilatation and curettage despite little scientific validation. In patients with known carcinoma, false-negative rates with such devices range from 2.5-32.4%. Large prospective studies have shown that an endometrial thickness <or= 4 mm on transvaginal ultrasound in postmenopausal women with bleeding has a risk of malignancy of 1 in 917. Thus, in postmenopausal patients with bleeding, biopsy is not indicted when endometrial thickness is <or= 4 mm. The significance of a thick endometrial echo in nonbleeding postmenopausal women has not been validated and need not require automatic tissue sampling.
