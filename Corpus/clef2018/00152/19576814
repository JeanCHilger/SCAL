Massive ovarian edema and contralateral mature cystic teratoma: asymptomatic presentation in a premenarchal female. Massive ovarian edema is a rare entity, which in most cases occurs in adult females presenting with abdominal pain. We present an unusual case associated with contralateral teratoma in a premenarchal female.A 13-year-old asymptomatic female presenting with an abdominopelvic mass was referred to the gynecological oncology unit with complex bilateral pelvic masses seen on ultrasound. A combination of computed tomography and repeat ultrasound demonstrated a solid mass containing numerous subcentimeter cysts inseparable from a mature teratoma. Exploratory surgery resulted in unilateral oophorectomy and contralateral cystectomy. Pathology confirmed massive ovarian edema and contralateral mature teratoma.Recognition of this rare condition is important to avoid overtreatment of massive ovarian edema. Intraoperative biopsy is recommended as an alternative to oophorectomy in this patient group.
