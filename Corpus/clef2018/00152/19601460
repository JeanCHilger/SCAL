Could serologic and ultrasonographic indexes be useful for therapeutic decisions in patients with ovarian cancer? The objective of this study is to assess and quantify a relationship between different categories of prognostic factors in ovarian cancer, to establish patterns that explain the aggressiveness of some tumors, as well as to consider the above mentioned issues with regard to therapy decisions.This prospective observational and analytical research comprised 124 cases. The following were calculated: descriptive statistics, statistical comparisons, linear and multiple regressions, survival calculations, for clinical, serological, ultrasonographic, biological and temporal variables. In addition, new prognostic indexes were introduced.A significant difference was found between well known predictors for evolution of ovarian cancer in the malignant and benign groups: Platelet Derived Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (PDECGF) p=0.0001 CA125 p=0.0027. Potential ultrasonographic and serologic predictors for malignity of ovarian masses were identified. Only two ultrasonographic predictors: Multilocular Solid Masses insight the tumor and Diastolic Notch fulfilled the required values in order to be considered independent predictors for disease free interval. High level correlation between serologic and ultrasonographic predictors was calculatedThe results suggest the possibility of therapy in ovarian cancer patients adjusted also to the angiogenic component of the disease.
