Adiponectin and resistin concentrations after glucose load in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome. Our aims were to evaluate the serum adiponectin and resistin levels at fasting and after glucose load and their interaction with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Twenty-two adolescents with PCOS and 16 healthy controls were included in the study. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in all adolescents. Fasting lipids was measured. Insulin, glucose, adiponectin, and resistin levels were measured at 0 and 120 min of OGTT. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI), fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (FGIR), and the whole -body insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were calculated. Fasting adiponectin was correlated with ISI (r = 0.729, p < 0.0001), FGIR (r = 0.696, p < 0.0001), QUICKI (r = 0.592, p = 0.004) and HDL-C (r = 0.516, p = 0.028), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.732, p < 0.0001), body mass index (r = -0.738, p < 0.0001), waist circumference (r = -0.706, p < 0.0001), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.595, p = 0.003). No correlation was found between resistin and insulin resistance indexes. Obese adolescents with PCOS have increased CVD risk such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance than normo-weight PCOS. Hypoadiponectinaemia could be increase risks levels in obese girls with PCOS.
