Ileocolocolic intussusception secondary to a submucosal lipoma: an unusual cause of intermittent abdominal pain in a 62-year-old woman. We present a case of subacute nonobstructing ileocolocolic intussusception secondary to a submucosal lipoma and a mobile cecum diagnosed sonographically in a 62-year-old woman. The patient was seen following a 2-month history of nonspecific intermittent pain in the right and middle abdomen and weight loss. Sonography revealed ongoing intussusception involving distal ascending and transverse colon. Analysis of the distal intussusception end demonstrated a 3.0 x 2.5 cm echogenic polypoid lesion consistent with a lipoma serving as a lead point. The sonographic diagnosis was confirmed at surgery.
