Ultrasound assessment of the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer. The study involved 64 patients with verified cervical carcinoma, aged 23-79, who had received combined chemo-radiotherapy. Results were evaluated by ultrasound monitoring. Most modem methods were used via transabdominal and transrectal access. Tumor structure changed and size diminished following vascularization decrease step in step with combined chemoradiotherapy. Ultrasound in combination with 3D ultrasound - angiography provided objective data on tumor state at each stage of therapy.
