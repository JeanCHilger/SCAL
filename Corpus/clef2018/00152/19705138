Laparoscopic management of a 16-week ruptured rudimentary horn pregnancy: a case and literature review. Pregnancy in a rudimentary horn is although rare, but is associated with the risk of rupture and life threatening hemorrhage. With the use of ultrasound the diagnosis can be made before symptoms occur. Management usually consists of excision of the rudimentary horn along with the pregnancy and the ipsilateral tube, traditionally by laparotomy.We present a case of a 16-week ruptured rudimentary horn pregnancy diagnosed intraoperatively and managed laparoscopically in the presence of massive haemoperitoneum, which is first of its kind along with literature review.This case demonstrates that laparoscopy is a feasible approach and can provide rapid diagnosis and control of bleeding in such cases provided there is availability of efficient multi-disciplinary teamwork, optimal anesthesia, advanced cardiovascular monitoring, laparoscopic expertise and ability to convert rapidly to laparotomy if required.
