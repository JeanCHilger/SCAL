Is antral follicle count a genetic trait? The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between maternal age of menopause and antral follicle count.This was a cross-sectional study of 124 women aged 25 to 48 years presenting with infertility. Women reported their mother's age of menopause and underwent transvaginal ultrasound to assess antral follicle count. Participant age, age greater than 37 years, and maternal age of menopause, as well as interactions among these, were incorporated into a multiple linear regression model to predict antral follicle count. Three different ages of maternal menopause were inputted into this model to illustrate the relationship between maternal age of menopause and rate of decline in antral follicle count.Women with a lower maternal age of menopause have lower antral follicle counts but also a slower decline until the age of 37 years.Maternal age of menopause predicts antral follicle count and its decline, indicating a genetic component to this trait.
