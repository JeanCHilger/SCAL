Evaluation of image quality and lesion perception by human readers on 3D CT colonography: comparison of standard and low radiation dose. We compared the prevalence of noise-related artefacts and lesion perception on three-dimensional (3D) CT colonography (CTC) at standard and low radiation doses.Forty-eight patients underwent CTC (64 x 0.625 mm collimation tube rotation time 0.5 sThe mean effective dose was 3.9 +/- 1.3 mSv at standard dose and 1.03 +/- 0.4 mSv at low dose. The number of images showing cobblestone artefacts and irregularly delineated folds at original and modified low doses was significantly higher than at standard dose (P < 0.0001). Most of the artefacts on modified low-dose images were mild. No significant difference in sensitivity between the dose levels was found for polyps > or =6 mm.Reduction of the effective dose to 1 mSv significantly affects image quality on 3D CTC, but the perception of > or =6 mm lesions is not significantly impaired.
