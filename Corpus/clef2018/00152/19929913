3-D ultrasonographic appearance of two intermittent paraurethral cysts: a case report. In the adult female, a cyst of the Skene's duct is a rare event that may be either the late consequence of a congenital abnormality or the result of a chronic acquired inflammation.To report a case of bilateral paraurethral Skene's duct cysts.A young (32 years old), eumenorrheic (menstrual cycle of >25 and <35 days) woman complained of a 6-month intermittent scarce lubrication during intercourse and a sensation of a small intravaginal "extraneous" body. The patient was repeatedly assessed with a detailed history, with a bimanual pelvic examination and with bi- and tridimensional ultrasonographic and color Doppler analyses of the urethrovaginal space.Transvaginal two-dimensional ultrasonographic evaluation of internal genitalia, bladder, and urethra and three-dimensional analysis of the paraurethral structures.The evaluation of the structures comprised in the urethrovaginal space evidenced two small (1.7 and 1.1 cm in the maximum diameter) anechoic cysts with some debris in the most declivous part, laterally displaced to the middle/distal urethra. The cysts disappeared after a medical therapy.A sudden reduction of the vaginal lubrication requires a prompt gynecological and ultrasonographic evaluation of the urethrovaginal space.
