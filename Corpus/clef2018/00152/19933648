Comparison of polyp size and volume at CT colonography: implications for follow-up CT colonography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of polyp measurements at CT colonography and the factors that affect the measurements.Fifty colonoscopically proven cases of polyps 6 mm in diameter or larger were analyzed by two observers who measured each polyp in supine and prone views. Manual measurements of 2D volume by summation of areas, 2D maximum diameter, and 3D maximum diameter and automated measurements of 3D maximum diameter and volume were recorded for each observer and were repeated for one of the observers. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was calculated. Analysis was performed to determine the measurement parameter that correlated most with summation-of-areas volume. Supine and prone measurements as a surrogate for tracking change in polyp size over time were analyzed to determine the measurement parameter with the least variation.Maximum diameter measured manually on 3D images had the highest correlation with summation-of-areas volume. Manual summation-of-areas volume was found to have the least variation between supine and prone measurements.Linear polyp measurement in the 3D endoluminal view appears to be the most reliable parameter for use in the decision to excise a polyp according to current guidelines. In our study, manual calculation of volume with summation of areas was found to be the most reliable measurement parameter for observing polyp growth over serial examinations. High reliability of polyp measurements is essential for adequate assessment of change in polyp size over serial examinations because many patients with intermediate-size polyps are expected to choose surveillance.
