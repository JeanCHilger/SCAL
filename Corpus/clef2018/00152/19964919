Registration of prone and supine CT colonography scans based on correlation optimized warping and canonical correlation analysis. In this paper, we propose an automated method for colon registration from supine and prone scans. Four anatomical salient points on the colon are distinguished first. Then correlation optimized warping (COW) method is applied to the segments defined by the anatomical landmarks to find better global registration based on local correlation of segments. To utilize more features along the colon centerline, we extended the COW method by embedding canonical correlation analysis into it for correlation calculation of colon segments. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we tested the algorithm on a CTC dataset of 19 patients with 23 polyps. Experimental results show that by using our method, the estimation error of polyp location could be reduced 68.5% (from 41.6mm to 13.1mm on average) compared to a traditional dynamic warping algorithm.
