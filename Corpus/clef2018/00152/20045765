Appendiceal mucocele mimicking a cystic right adnexal mass. Appendiceal mucocele is formed by cystic dilatation, abnormal mucinous secretion and epithelial proliferation of the appendiceal lumen. Mucocele may be a finding in cases of benign or malignant neoplasms, and can lead to the development of pseudomyxoma peritonei.A 71-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of right lower abdominal pain radiating to her right thigh. A simple 5 x 7 cm cyst with smooth borders and a thick capsule was detected in the right adnexal area by transvaginal ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging identified a 4 x 8 cm cystic lesion in the area of the right ovary. The patient was admitted to our clinic with an initial diagnosis of adnexal cyst, later found to be appendiceal mucocele.The signs and symptoms of appendiceal mucocele are not specific. Because of its anatomic position, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses.
