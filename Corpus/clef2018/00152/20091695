Diagnostic accuracy of real-time 3D sonography in the diagnosis of congenital Mullerian anomalies in high-risk patients with respect to the phase of the menstrual cycle. To compare the diagnostic accuracy of 2-dimensional sonography (2DUS) and real-time 3-dimensional sonography (3DUS) in the diagnosis of congenital mullerian defects (CMD) with respect to the phase of the menstrual endometrium.The accuracy of sonography was examined on 108 women by 2 gynecologists during the 1st 5 days after cessation of menstrual flow and then re-examined at the cycle days 20-24. Entrance criteria for the patients enrolled in the study were as follows: women who were referred to our center with a suspected Mullerian anomaly at hysterosalpingography, and women who were suspected to have a uterine anomaly at our hospital during infertility, dysmenorrhea, and recurrent abortion workup. First, 1 of the gynecologists performed the 2DUS, and afterwards the 2nd gynecologist performed the real-time 3DUS. Results from both examiners were compared and correlated with the definitive diagnosis obtained by MRI, laparoscopy, or hysteroscopy. The sensitivity and specificity values of 2DUS and real-time 3DUS for the diagnosis of CMD were calculated at follicular and luteal phases.Among the 108 cases suspected to have CMD, the sensitivity and specificity values of real-time 3DUS were significantly higher in the follicular sensitivity, 94.7%, specificity, 75.0%, and luteal phases (sensitivity, 100%, specificity, 93.7%) when compared with 2DUS values (sensitivity of 30.2% and specificity of 78.1% in the follicular phase and sensitivity of 42.1% and specificity of 81.2% in the luteal phase).Real-time 3DUS is an accurate method that can be used for the diagnosis of congenital mullerian defects.
