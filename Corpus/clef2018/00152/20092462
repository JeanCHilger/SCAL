Who's afraid of the G-spot? No controversy can be more controversial than that regarding the existence of the G-spot, an anatomical and physiological entity for women and many scientists, yet a gynecological UFO for others.The pros and cons data have been carefully reviewed by six scientists with different opinions on the G-spot. This controversy roughly follows the Journal of Sexual Medicine Debate held during the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Congress in Florence in the February of 2009.To give to The Journal of Sexual Medicine's reader enough data to form her/his own opinion on an important topic of female sexuality.Expert #1, who is JSM's Controversy section editor, reviewed histological data from the literature demonstrating the existence of discrete anatomical structures within the vaginal wall composing the G-spot. He also found that this region is not a constant, but can be highly variable from woman to woman. These data are supported by the findings discussed by Expert #2, dealing with the history of the G-spot and by the fascinating experimental evidences presented by Experts #4 and #5, showing the dynamic changes in the G-spot during digital and penile stimulation. Experts #3 and #6 argue critically against the G-spot discussing the contrasting findings so far produced on the topic.Although a huge amount of data (not always of good quality) have been accumulated in the last 60 years, we still need more research on one of the most challenging aspects of female sexuality.
