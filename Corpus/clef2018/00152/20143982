Adnexal masses: relative accuracy of sonography and frozen section in predicting final pathology. In this retrospective study, we compared the accuracy of frozen section and sonographic diagnosis in predicting the final paraffin section diagnosis of ovarian lesions. We hoped thereby to determine if sonographic findings could obviate the need for frozen section in certain circumstances. The frozen section and sonographic diagnosis were compared with the final paraffin section diagnosis to determine whether the lesion was felt to be a benign or malignant tumour. Frozen section diagnosis agreed with final paraffin section diagnosis in 137 (77.4%) cases of primary malignant tumours, 201 (90.1%) cases of metastatic disease and 328 (82%) benign cases. Sonographic results matched final pathology of 133 cases of primary malignancy (75.1%) and 192 cases of metastatic disease (86.1%) and 304 benign cases (76%). Our study indicates that preoperative sonography is accurate enough in differentiating adnexal masses to make the routine use of frozen sections unnecessary.
