Cesarean scar pregnancy: a case report of conservative management. A caesarean scar pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy which engages the vital prognosis either by hemorrhage or by early uterine rupture. We report the case of a 38-years-old patient who presented an ectopic pregnancy developed inside a previous caesarean section scar. The diagnosis was made at eight weeks of gestation by ultra-sound and allowed a fast management. We chose a conservative medical treatment by methotrexate both systemic and in situ. A hemorrhagic complication occured in two months of the initial treatment, requiring an endovascular therapy as well.
