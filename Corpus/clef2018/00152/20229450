Very high frequency of the polymorphism for the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) at codon 972 (glycine972arginine) in Southern Italian women with polycystic ovary syndrome. A major component of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the insulin resistance. Only a few studies have evaluated the IRS-1 polymorphism at codon 972, sometimes in the absence of a control group, and with great variability in frequency (0-23% in PCOS vs. 0-17% in controls), and with no unequivocal relationships between the polymorphism and clinical or biochemical indexes. The aim of the work was to evaluate the frequency of the IRS-1 polymorphism at codon 972 in PCOS, and correlate it to clinical and biochemical indexes. We assessed the rs 1801278 polymorphic variant in the IRS-1 gene (Gly972Gly=wild-type Gly972Arg=heterozygosity
