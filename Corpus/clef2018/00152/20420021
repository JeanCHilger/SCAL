Implementation of 3D- CT based brachytherapy in the postoperative radiotherapy of cervical cancer: treatment technique and dose-volume parameters. Intracavitary brachytherapy has an important roll in developing complications in postoperative radiotherapy of cervical cancer. 3D- CT based brachytherapy gives precisely estimating doses to organ at risk. In this study, we show our preliminary results in implementation of 3D-imaging based postoperative brachytherapy of cervical cancer: treatment technique and dose-volume parameters. During 2009 year, in 6 patients with early stage I-II of cervical cancer, brachytherapy treatment planning was based on the radiographs and CT imaging brachytherapy technique. Mean values of ICRU reference points of rectum was R max 4,2 Gy and bladder B max 4,5 Gy, while estimated volume-dose parameters D0.1 cm3 D1.0 cm D2.0 cm3 were presented with higher dose.Volume of organ at risk reflected the need for better bladder preparation. Our initial experience in performing CT-based brachytherapy, enabled us to introduce the characteristics of the parameters, assessment of their significance from the aspect of mutual relations applicators and organs at risk. Further analysis are needed, for monitoring the effects of 3D planning on complications.
