Three-dimensional vascular indices calculated using conventional power Doppler and high-definition flow imaging: are there differences? The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are differences in 3-dimensional (3D) vascular indices when calculated using high-definition flow imaging (HDF) and power Doppler imaging (PD).Twenty-five consecutive asymptomatic premenopausal women (mean age, 31 years range, 28-33 years) without a history of gynecologic disease who attended routine gynecologic checkups were included in the study. All women had regular menstrual cycles, and none had uterine or myometrial disease detected on basal transvaginal sonography. All women underwent 3D transvaginal sonography. In each patient, a first volume using conventional PD was obtained, immediately followed by a second volume using HDF. Volumes were stored and subsequently analyzed for calculating 3D vascular indices (vascularization index [VI], flow index [FI], and vascularization-flow index [VFI]) from the endometrium.The median VI, FI, and VFI were significantly higher when calculated using HDF compared with conventional PD (P < .05).Three-dimensional vascular indices calculated using HDF are higher than those calculated using conventional PD.
