Chemical peritonitis caused by an iatrogenic rupture of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary during labor: a report of a case didactic to all the maternity health care workers. A 37-year-old postpartum woman was presented with abdominal pain supposed to be caused by uterine involution or puerperal endometritis after vaginal delivery. During the pregnancy, she was suspected to have a subserosal myoma by ultrasound examination. The pain was finally revealed to be originated from the chemical peritonitis caused by the rupture of the mature cystic teratoma of the ovary by Kristeller's maneuver performed during vaginal delivery. When a pregnant or puerperal woman complains about abdominal pain, we need to consider the possibility of chemical peritonitis resulting from the rupture of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary.
