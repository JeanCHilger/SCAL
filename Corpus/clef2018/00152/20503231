Value of transvaginal ultrasound in assessing severity of pelvic endometriosis. The objective of this study was to examine the ability of preoperative transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) scanning to assess the severity of pelvic endometriosis.Consecutive women with clinically suspected or proven pelvic endometriosis, who were booked for laparoscopy, were invited to join the study. The severity of endometriosis was assessed preoperatively using TVS and the findings were compared with the results obtained by laparoscopy using the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) classification.In total, 201 women had preoperative TVS and laparoscopies. Of these, no endometriosis was found at laparoscopy for 62/201 (30.8% 95% CI, 24.8-37.5), whereas 33/201 (16.4%TVS is a good test for assessing the severity of pelvic endometriosis. TVS is particularly accurate in detecting severe disease, which could facilitate more effective triaging of women for appropriate surgical care.
