Ultrasound-guided transvaginal aspiration as initial treatment for adnexal torsion following ovarian hyperstimulation. To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and pregnancy outcomes of adnexal detorsion using simple aspiration following ovarian hyperstimulation in pregnancy.Retrospective review of eight pregnant women who underwent ultrasound (US)-guided transvaginal aspiration to induce natural reduction of ovarian torsion following ovarian hyperstimulation.Six of the eight patients were successfully treated with simple aspiration only, without any complications. Symptoms recurred in two patients, necessitating further laparoscopic detorsion. The outcome of the pregnancy was normal in seven women, with the eighth experiencing loss of one fetus from a twin pregnancy 2 days after laparoscopy. Normal ovarian blood flow was confirmed within one month after the treatment.US-guided transvaginal aspiration for adnexal detorsion in pregnant women following ovarian stimulation might serve as a simpler, less morbid and equally effective alternative to conventional treatment.
