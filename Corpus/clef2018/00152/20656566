Culdocentesis followed by saline solution-enhanced ultrasonography: technique for evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy. To evaluate the use of a technique consisting of culdocentesis followed by saline solution-enhanced pelvic ultrasonography in cases suspect for ectopic pregnancy in which an accurate diagnosis could not be made using routine transvaginal ultrasound.Retrospective clinical study (Canadian Task Force classification III).Academic medical center.Twenty patients with an initial diagnosis of pregnancy of unknown location.In 20 patients with symptoms of early pregnancy and serum quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin concentration, ectopic pregnancy could not be confirmed or ruled out. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided culdocentesis was performed, and 300 to 400 mL of normal saline solution was injected into the posterior cul-de-sac and pelvis. Transvaginal ultrasound was repeated with particular attention to the floating fallopian tubesUsing this technique, a tubal pregnancy was visualized in 15 of 20 patients, and ectopic pregnancy was ruled out in 5 patients. In all patients, appropriate management was provided according to the final diagnosis, and consisted of either methotrexate, laparoscopic salpingostomy or salpingectomy, or expectant management in patients with abnormal intrauterine pregnancies.Ultrasound-guided culdocentesis followed by saline solution-enhanced pelvic ultrasound can be considered as a diagnostic tool in patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy in whom other methods fail to demonstrate this diagnosis.
