The role of endoscopic ultrasound in evaluation of gastric subepithelial lesions. A subepithelial mass is a common finding during endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an important diagnostic modality in the evaluation of subepithelial lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. EUS is the diagnostic test of choice to assess the size, margins, the layer of origin, echotexture, and to differentiate between an intramural and extramural lesion. However, the EUS imaging lacks the specificity. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or core biopsy can help establish a tissue diagnosis and potentially characterize malignant risk. The aim of this article is to review the diagnosis and management of the most common subepithelial gastric lesions with an emphasis on the role of endoscopic ultrasound.
