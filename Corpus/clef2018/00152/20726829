Isolated fallopian tube torsion: a series of six cases. Isolated Fallopian tube torsion is a rare gynecological cause of acute lower abdominal pain. Currently, there are no pathognomonic symptoms, clinical findings, imaging or laboratory characteristics for this condition, and the diagnosis can rarely be made before operation. We have identified six cases of isolated Fallopian tube torsion treated over a period of 3 years. It was observed that acute onset of abdominal pain with gastrointestinal symptoms can be the initial presenting features. Clinical and laboratory findings included positive peritoneal signs, fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis. Most of the women had preoperative ultrasound showing tubular adnexal masses of heterogeneous echogenicity with cystic component and the presence of free fluid. In contrast to the belief that isolated Fallopian tube torsion is more common in the right side, in five of our cases it occurred in the left side.
