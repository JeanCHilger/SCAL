Multiple ovarian fibromas in a patient with Gorlin syndrome: US and MR imaging features with pathological correlation. We report a case of multiple ovarian fibromas in a 23 year old woman with Gorlin syndrome. We describe the US and MR imaging features with pathological correlation. The fibrous component of the tumors were hypoechoic and attenuating on US with corresponding T2W hypointensity whereas myxoid components were hypoechoic with increased through transmission on US with corresponding T2W hyperintensity.
