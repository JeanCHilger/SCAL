Transvaginal US after bowel preparation for deeply infiltrating endometriosis: protocol, imaging appearances, and laparoscopic correlation. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a common gynecologic disease that is characterized by a difficult and delayed diagnosis. Radiologic mapping of the DIE lesion sites is crucial for case management, patient counseling, and surgical planning. Transvaginal ultrasonography (US) is the initial imaging modality for investigating DIE and has been the focus of several recent studies. DIE typically manifests at imaging as hypoechogenic nodules throughout the affected sites and thickening of the intestinal wall, with some lesions showing a mixed pattern due to cystic areas. Transvaginal US performed after bowel preparation improves the ability to diagnose intestinal lesions and provides invaluable details, including which layers of the intestine are affected and the distance between the lesion and the anal border. It is vital that radiologists be familiar with the technical aspects of this modality and with the US manifestations of DIE lesions. Transvaginal US performed after bowel preparation should be the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of women with suspected endometriosis.
