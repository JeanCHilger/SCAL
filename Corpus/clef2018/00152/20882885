Ultrasound urodynamic study of urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy in women with cervical carcinoma. To investigate the functional changes of the lower urinary tract after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy node dissection using ultrasound urodynamics.Fifty-one women with cervical carcinoma underwent pre- and postoperative B-mode ultrasound imaging urodynamics.Twenty-six women needed abdominal straining to void after radical surgery, and the urinary stream was intermittent. The maximum flow rate, average flow rate, and voiding volume significantly decreased, but the post-void residual volume significantly increased. Bladder sensory function deteriorated and maximum detrusor pressure decreased. The functional length decreased, but the maximum urethral pressure and urethral closure pressure did not change. Ultrasound measurement showed no significant changes regarding the depth of the bladder wall or the position of the bladder neck.Lower urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy is characteristic. Measurement of ultrasound urodynamics may be used as a preliminary screening method to detect voiding dysfunction following surgery.
