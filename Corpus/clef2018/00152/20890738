Diagnosis and management of pouchitis and ileoanal pouch dysfunction. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC with dysplasia and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. However, UC patients with IPAA are susceptible to inflammatory and noninflammatory sequelae, such as pouchitis, Crohn's disease of the pouch, cuffitis, and irritable pouch syndrome, in addition to common surgery-associated complications, which adversely affect the surgical outcome and compromise health-related quality of life. Pouchitis is the most frequent long-term complication of IPAA in patients with UC, with a cumulative prevalence of up to 50%. Pouchitis may be classified based on the etiology into idiopathic and secondary types, and the management is often different. Pouchoscopy is the most important tool for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in patients with pouch dysfunction. Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for active pouchitis. Some patients may develop dependency on antibiotics, requiring long-term maintenance therapy. Although management of antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis has been challenging, secondary etiology for pouchitis should be evaluated and modified, if possible.
