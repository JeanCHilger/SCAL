Measurement of bone mineral density by heel ultrasound and forearm DXA in clinical practice. The comparation of two possibilities of bone mineral density measurement--ultrasound and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.Open nonrandomized observation study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1st Faculty of Medicine Charles University and General Faculty Hospital Prague.We examined 190 women with mean age 56 years by both methods--Lunar PIXI (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) on forearm and CUBA Clinical (broadband ultrasound attenuation) on heel. We took personal history for menopause status, hormone replacement therapy, smoking, sport activity and age.The incidence of T-scores was the same for both methods, there were differences in Z-scores. In both methods we have seen the same tendencies of interaction with risk factors. Bone mineral density (BMD) respective T-score significantly decreased with age. There were no significant connections between BMD and body mass index (lineary regression test), hormone replacement therapy (paired t-test), smoking and physical exercise (Mann-Whitney U test). T-score was significantly (p < 0.003) lower in women with history of fracture (Mann-Whitney U test).In spite of totally different principles of measurement both methods are able to screen BMD.
