ACR appropriateness criteriaÂ© ovarian cancer screening. The majority of women with ovarian cancer have advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis and a poor 5 year survival rate. Hence, screening has been investigated in the hopes of improving survival by diagnosing ovarian cancer at an earlier stage. Most screening methods thus far have included ultrasound and/or serum tumor markers. However, low prevalence of the disease, high false positive rate of current screening methods, and the probable rapid growth of most ovarian carcinomas from no defined precursor lesion, all contribute to difficulty in screening for ovarian cancer. While screening may be able to detect ovarian cancer at an earlier stage, adequate data is presently lacking on whether screening improves survival. The results of ongoing large clinical trials will be available in a few years and should provide critical information regarding the usefulness of screening. Pending results of those large clinical trials, screening is not currently recommended for women at average risk for ovarian cancer. Screening is most likely to be performed in women with an increased familial risk of ovarian cancer, but patients should be aware that even with this risk factor, there is currently insufficient evidence to know if screening is effective. New screening methods, including new or multiple serum markers and proteomics, are also being investigated.
