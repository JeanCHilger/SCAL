Utility of MRI before and after uterine fibroid embolization: why to do it and what to look for. The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the selection, procedure planning, and follow-up of patients undergoing arterial embolization for uterine fibroids is reviewed. Advantages of MRI over ultrasound include multiplanar imaging capability, a larger field of view, increased spatial resolution, improved anatomic detail, and the ability to detect other pelvic disorders. MRI can assess fibroid viability by detecting contrast agent enhancement. Magnetic resonance angiography has a useful role in evaluation of pelvic vasculature. Magnetic resonance parameters such as T1 and T2 relaxation times and diffusion-weighted characteristics have an emerging role in predicting outcome before and after embolization. MRI may be used to evaluate technical success and to image potential complications after embolization.
