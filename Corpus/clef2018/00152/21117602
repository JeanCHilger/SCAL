Direct scanning of pathology specimens using spectral domain optical coherence tomography: a pilot study. Digital pathology has thus far focused on producing digital images of glass microscope slides. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) can be used to directly scan tissue blocks to produce three-dimensional histology images, potentially bypassing glass slide workflow.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were scanned using SD-OCT and resulting images were compared with corresponding areas on microscope slides.Low-magnification features were recognizable, including tissue outlines, fat, vessels, and outlines of colonic mucosal crypts. Subtle textures that were suggestive of benign breast lobules and ovarian tumor features were also visible. Initial SD-OCT images lacked resolution and contrast relative to traditional microscopy, but the image content suggests that additional features of interest are present and may be revealed with improved SD-OCT resolution and more post-processing experience. Elucidation of three-dimensional histology and pathology are also future tasks.Eventual availability of diagnostic-quality three-dimensional histology would have a profound impact on anatomic pathology.
