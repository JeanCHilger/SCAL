Bilateral catheter for continuous TAP block and postoperative pain relief after gynecologic surgery. We describe the case of two patients who had undergone gynecologic surgery and in whom a continuous ropivacaine infusion was administered through a catheter placed on each abdominal side, using the technique of ultrasound-guided TAP block. Postoperative analgesia was of excellent quality with almost no morphine requirement. No side effects were encountered.
