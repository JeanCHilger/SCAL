The technique of laparoscopic pelvic ultrasonography for metastatic lymph node. Many reports have provided evidence to support the effective use of diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) to determine if patients with upper abdominal malignant diseases are operable so that unnecessary laparotomy can be avoided. LUS is less frequently applied to patients with pelvic malignancies and this is probably related to the technical difficulties. We have developed the LUS technique in examining the pelvic nodes for metastasis systematically and have applied it to 241 cervical cancer patients. The procedure is safe and not associated with any major morbidity. The mean duration of pelvic node assessment by LUS is 14 minutes and the procedure can be satisfactorily completed in 98% of patients. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of LUS in detecting pelvic nodal metastasis were 81.2%, 55.6%, 88.4%, 57.7%, and 87.5%, respectively, in patients scheduled for radical hysterectomy. In this report, we describe the LUS technique in detail and demonstrate important landmarks that provide useful orientation during an LUS examination. The technical limitations and pitfalls are also discussed.
