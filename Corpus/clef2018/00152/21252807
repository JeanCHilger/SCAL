Surgical removal of a gigantic abdominal mass: a multidisciplinary approach. Ovarian cystadenomas are common benign ovarian neoplasms that rarely present as gigantic abdominal masses. A variety of intraoperative and postoperative challenges may be encountered in the removal of these masses.We review the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with massive abdominal swelling that was later identified as two distinct bilateral serous cystadenomas with a combined weight of approximately 107 kg. A multidisciplinary team including gynecology, plastic surgery, anesthesiology, and the operating room staff convened before surgery to discuss surgical technique, physiologic considerations, and logistical issues.A multidisciplinary approach had an integral role in intraoperative safety and successful recovery of our patient from this surgery.
