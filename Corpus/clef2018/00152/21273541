Three-dimensional visualization of ocular vascular pathology by optical coherence angiography in vivo. To demonstrate the clinical application of a noninvasive, three-dimensional, vascular imaging technique called Doppler optical coherence angiography (OCA). To evaluate the vascular architecture of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) using Doppler OCA.The authors prospectively examined the eyes of four healthy subjects and 15 PCV patients. Three-dimensional vascular flow imaging was performed using high-speed, high-resolution, and high-penetration spectral-domain Doppler optical coherence tomography. Two-dimensional images of the retina, choroid, and vascular lesions were obtained simultaneously.Distribution of blood flow detected by Doppler OCA imaging corresponded well with that by indocyanine angiographic imaging. PCV lesions were localized in the space between the retinal pigment epithelium and the Bruch's membrane.The authors found using Doppler OCA that PCV lesions are similar in architecture to choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. Doppler OCA facilitates rapid and noninvasive examination of exudative macular diseases.
