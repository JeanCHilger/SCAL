Symptomatic secondary vesical calculus formed on an intrauterine contraceptive device inserted 25 years previously. A 57-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with vague lower abdominal symptoms, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infection of a year's duration. She had an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) inserted 25 years previously and denied having any significant gynecological or urinary tract symptoms since the device was inserted. CT scan of her pelvis confirmed the presence of an IUCD that had migrated into the urinary bladder and on which a calculus had formed. An attempt at removal of the calculus and IUCD during cystoscopy failed. At cystolithotomy, the IUCD and the calculus were removed intact. IUCDs may produce complications several years after insertion.
