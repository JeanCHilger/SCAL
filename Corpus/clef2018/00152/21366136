Term delivery following transvaginal drainage of bilateral ovarian abscesses after oocyte retrieval: a case report. Severe postovum retrieval complications such as tuboovarian abscess are rare. We present an early pelvic infection case following egg retrieval.A 31-year-old woman with unexplained infertility developed early pelvic infection subsequent to transvaginal oocyte retrieval (TVOR). Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. Upon persistence of fever and ultrasonographic appearance of probable abscess, transvaginal ultrasound-guided drainage was performed on post-TVOR day 9 as well as posterior colpotomy and T-drain replacement into the cul de sac. Signs and symptoms of pelvic infection improved following drain replacement. Her beta-hCG was found to be positive in the following days. Drain was removed after 3 weeks. Her pregnancy follow-up was uncomplicated. She delivered a healthy baby vaginally at 38 gestational weeks.Early diagnosis with prompt administration of antibiotics and drainage may prevent poor pregnancy outcome in ovarian abscess patients subsequent to transvaginal oocyte retrieval.
