Sexual function after modified laparoscopic Vecchietti's vaginoplasty. To report on minor modification of laparoscopic Vecchietti vaginoplasty and to examine the quality of sexual life after the operation.A retrospective study to examine the role of minor modification during laparoscopic Vecchietti operation to prevent injuries and to evaluate the sexual function of patients with neovagina.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Pécs, Faculty of Medicine, a tertiary supply center in Hungary. PATICIPANTS: Twenty-three adolescents or young adults, ages 16 to 26 with vaginal agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) were operated. Twenty-five sexually active patients with matched age served as controls.Laparoscopic Vecchietti operation was modified with the use of endovaginal ultrasound transducer to visualize the narrow vesico-rectal space. The quality of sexual life 2-11 years after the operation was measured by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).Complications occurring during operations desire, arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, lubrication, and pain during sexual intercourse.The technical modification of the operation, with endovaginal transducer, improved the method. Serious injuries of the bladder or rectum could be avoided. Anatomic and functional results shown by the total FSFI scores did not differ from that of the control group. Desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction of the operated patients were similar to controls however, patients with neovagina tended to have less lubrication and more pain during sexual intercourse.Laparoscopic Vecchietti operation modified by the use of endovaginal transducer is a safe procedure to create a neovagina, which guarantees good quality of sexual life with high satisfaction for patients.
