Two cases of angular pregnancy complicated by preterm labor and placental abruption at mid-pregnancy. Angular pregnancy is the rare condition in which the gestational sac is implanted in the lateral angle of the uterine cavity. There have been several reports on angular pregnancies however, due to a lack of clinical understanding, angular pregnancy does not appear to be recognized as a clinical entity and many cases are likely to go undiagnosed. This report involves two women with angular pregnancies: one had placenta abruption and the other had preterm delivery at mid-trimester and postpartum endometritis. The former was diagnosed early with Three-dimensional sonography, but the other was not diagnosed until the time of cesarean section. This is the first report on the sonographic diagnosis of angular pregnancy. Through these cases, we emphasize the benefit of an accurate early diagnosis of angular pregnancy and careful prenatal care because of the possible risk of adverse perinatal outcome.
