Intra- and interobserver variability of 2D and 3D transvaginal sonography in the diagnosis of benign versus malignant adnexal masses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the intraobserver and interobserver agreements in the diagnosis of malignant versus benign adnexal masses using two-dimensional ultrasonography (2D US) and three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D US).Two experienced sonographers performed a retrospective review of digitally stored 2D images and 3D data from a sample of 41 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of adnexal mass. Each observer independently, and blinded to each other, evaluated the 2D static images of each adnexal mass and then the 3D volumes 1 week later. The observers were required to classify the adnexal lesion as benign or malignant according to pattern recognition analysis. Intraobserver and interobserver agreement were assessed by calculating the kappa index (Îº).Intraobserver agreement between 2D US and 3D US for the observer A was 1.00 and for the observer B was 0.69. Interobserver agreement was 0.69 for 2D US and 1.00 for 3D US (p > 0.05)Although 3D US in the diagnosis of adnexal masses appeared more reproducible than 2D US, the difference was not statistically significant.
