Tamoxifen and endometrial pathology. Tamoxifen is a non-steroid antiestrogen, used as adjuvant therapy for breast carcinoma in women with positive estrogen receptor (ER+). In this report we evaluated endometrial histological changes in women treated with Tamoxifen for ER+ breast carcinoma.We performed transvaginal ultrasonography for the endometrial thickness and biopsy of endometrium on a group of 125 symptomatic women with Tamoxifen therapy for ER+ breast carcinoma. The endometrial specimens were histologically processed for histological diagnosis.Of all patients, 49.6% had endometrial pathology (women with functional hemorrhage), and 32% had atrophic endometrium. Endometrial pathology was represented by endometrial simple hyperplasia 17.6%, and endometrial complex hyperplasia 8.8%. Endometrial complex hyperplasia with atypia was found in 5.6%, endometrial polyps in 11.2%, endometrial carcinoma in 4.8% and m√ºllerian mixt tumor in 1.6%.Endometrial pathology was more likely to be diagnosed in gynecological symptomatic postmenopausal and premenopausal women with breast carcinoma treated with Tamoxifen. Therefore, it is necessary that these patients to be supervise, first, with transvaginal ultrasonography for endometrium, and after, with biopsy of endometrium. All patients on long-term Tamoxifen therapy should be annually screened by endometrial biopsy for endometrial pathology.
