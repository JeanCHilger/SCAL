Asymptomatic fatty changes in the myocardium of a patient with tuberous sclerosis. Rhabdomyomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors in childhood. They usually occur on ventricular and septal walls. In approximately half of the cases, rhabdomyoma is associated with tuberous sclerosis. Most rhabdomyomas regress during the first years of life. We present MRI findings of fatty replacement of the myocardium which was probably after spontaneous regression of solid mass (rhabdomyoma) in a 16-year-old boy with tuberous sclerosis.
