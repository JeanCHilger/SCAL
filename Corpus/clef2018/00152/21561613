Decreasing bleeding due to uterine fibroid with electroacupuncture. To report the usefulness of electroacupuncture (EA) for the management of menorrhagia due to submucous uterine fibroid.Case report.University hospital.A 48-year-old woman with a symptomatic submucous uterine fibroid, who presented with severe menorrhagia.Electroacupuncture.Doppler ultrasonographic assessment of uterine blood flow and number of pads used during menorrhagia.Doppler ultrasound revealed decreased blood flow of the uterine artery with EA stimulation. With repetitive sessions of EA fewer pads were used during menorrhagia.We present the first human case in which decreasing uterine artery blood flow with EA improved menorrhagia due to uterine fibroma. Electroacupuncture could be a useful, alternative, and relatively noninvasive tool for the management of fibroids with menorrhagia as a severe complaint.
