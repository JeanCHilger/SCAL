Unusual presentation of a Mullerian remnant in an infant with recurrent epididymo-orchitis. Mullerian duct remnants result from incomplete regression, a defect that occurs during sexual differentiation. Ninety percent of patients with mullerian remnants also have an associated disorder of sexual differentiation such as hypospadias. Presenting signs and symptoms are recurrent bladder infection, perineal pain, dysuria, or infertility. The purpose of this case report is to recount an unusual presentation of a mullerian duct remnant with recurrent epididymo-orchitis and to discuss the embryology, diagnosis, and management of this condition.
