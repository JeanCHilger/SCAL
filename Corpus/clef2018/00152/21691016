Incidence of bladder cancer in a one-stop clinic. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the importance of transvaginal scan (TVS) in the detection of bladder tumors in patients presenting with postmenopausal bleeding.We examined the case records of all patients that attended a one-stop clinic between September 2001 and May 2004. Those presenting with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) underwent transvaginal scan and endometrial pipelle sampling. Where bladder pathology was detected, urine cytology was done before referral to the urologist.In all, 753 women were referred. There were 17 cases of endometrial cancer detected. Three cases of bladder tumor (malignant transitional cell cancer) were found.We recommend careful assessment of all pelvic organs in women presenting with PMB.
