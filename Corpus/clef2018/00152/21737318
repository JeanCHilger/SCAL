Paratubal borderline tumor diagnosed in the adolescent period: a case report and review of the literature. Borderline paratubal cysts are rare entities. These tumors are identified as epithelial proliferation without stromal invasion.A 19-year-old virgin patient was admitted to our clinic with abdominal pain and nausea. The sonographic evaluation showed a left adnexal mass 89 Ã— 80 mm in diameter with solid tissue projections. Doppler examination revealed no significant blood supply. At surgery, a torsed left paratubal cyst 10 cm in diameter and normal bilateral ovaries were encountered. Cystectomy was performed and of frozen section revealed a borderline Fallopian tube neoplasm. Final pathology review was reported as a serous borderline paratubal tumor.The evaluation of the structure of cyst by ultrasound and the performance of intraoperative frozen section analysis are two important issues to diagnose the nature of a cyst. Fertility-sparing surgery is the main point of management.
