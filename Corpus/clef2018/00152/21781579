Effect of oxytocin on uterine fibroids treated by ultrasound ablation. To explore the effect of oxytocin on uterine fibroids treated by ultrasound ablation.Eighty-two single points in 29 uterine fibroids from 26 patients were sonicated with magnetic resonance imaging guided by high intensity focused ultrasound before and after using oxytocin. The required total energy, sonication time required to reach 60°C and the acoustic energy for increasing 1°C of temperature at the single point before and after using oxytocin were compared.Before intravenous infusion of oxytocin, the average total sonication energy required to reach 60°C was (5320 ± 910) J and it took (21 ± 20) seconds for sonicating a single point, the energy required for increasing 1°C was (255 ± 302) J. In contrast, after intravenous infusion of oxytocin, the average total sonication energy required to reach 60°C was (2890 ± 325) J, and it took (12 ± 7) seconds for sonicating a single point, the energy required for increasing 1°C was (126 ± 94) J. Those three index all reached statistical difference (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively).It seemed that Oxytocin could significantly decrease the energy required for ablating uterine fibroids, shorten treatment time and improve the treatment efficiency.
