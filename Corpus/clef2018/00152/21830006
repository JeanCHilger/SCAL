Intraoperative ultrasound for benign cystic teratoma. Report of two cases. Teratoma is one of the most common ovarian neoplasms and frequently leads to laparoscopic surgical procedure. When this tumor is small and the ovarian surface seems regular during the surgery, it is difficult to localize the tumor.We used a standard transvaginal ultrasound probe during the procedure and filled the pelvic cavity with saline solution of 0.9% in order to create an interface between the saline solution and the surgical instruments.We could localize the teratoma with confidence and precision, allowing to perform a sparing surgery.This is a simple, secure and efficient technique that can be performed in most of the institutions.
