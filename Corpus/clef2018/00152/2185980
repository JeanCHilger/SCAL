In vitro fertilization in Kock's ileostomy patients. Prior evaluation by pelvic ultrasonography. The study describes Kock's continent ileostomy in 2 females, both of whom were suffering from tubal infertility. Appropriate placement of the abdominal pouch, permitting in vitro fertilization embryo transfer treatment, was present in 1 patient. In the other patient, an ultrasonographic examination demonstrated the pouch covering the entire surface area of both ovaries. Oocyte aspiration was thus precluded for fear of penetrating the pouch. Ovum pickup in the presence of a Kock continent ileostomy can be conducted safely and without risk, if the pouch is correctly positioned above the small pelvis. Ultrasonography facilitated the ability to locate the patients' ovaries and precise position of the pouch.
