Intracellular metabolism, subcellular localization and phototoxicity of HMME/HB in ovarian cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered a promising new strategy for ovarian cancer treatment. As the key component in PDT, photosensitizer metabolism and localization in cancer cells is particularly important.The localization of the photosensitizers hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and hypocrellin B (HB) were determined in the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and NuTu-19 by fluorescence microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy(LSCM). A JD801 image analysis system was used to analyze the fluorescence intensity of the photosensitizers in the cells. The phototoxicity of both drugs to the cancer cells was determined by MTT assay.Both photosensitizers were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. Drug uptake reached a peak after 4 h incubation with HB and after 3 h incubation with HMME. Within a certain range, the higher the concentration, the stronger the fluorescence became and at 40 μg/ml, the intracellular photosensitizer had reached saturation. Based on these results PDT was applied to SKOV3 cells. All the cells were killed when the photosensizer dose reached 40 μg/ml.PDT is an effective therapy for ovarian cancer cells.
