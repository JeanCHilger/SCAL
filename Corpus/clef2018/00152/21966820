Diagnosis of premature menopause measuring circulating anti-M端llerian hormone. The production of anti-m端llerian hormone for the ovarian follicles begins near the puberty and the circulating levels begin to descend progressively in the stage of the pre-menopause coinciding with the depletion follicular and in consequence the menstrual cycles become irregular, frequently anovulatories. Therefore, concentration of anti-m端llerian hormone shows a close correlation with follicular reserve and reproductive capacity, more than FSH and estradiol measurements. We described two patients that developed premature ovarian failure without previous diagnosis and therefore just were treated pharmacologically with estrogen-progestagen to induce menstrual bleeding. In blood of both patients was found low levels (< or = 4 ng/mL) of anti-m端llerian hormone, and by means of sonography the absence of follicles was demonstrated in the ovaries. Has intended that premature ovarian failure could be of a chromosomal dysfunction, similar to other gonadal dysgenesias, another explanation of the mechanism is that it could be for development of some autoimmunity dysfunction. Therefore, the combined hormonal substitution of estrogen with progestagen should stay during several years to avoid the complications for the lack of estrogens in some cases, could be informed on offering the pregnancy possibility by means of the attended fertilization using ovules donor.
