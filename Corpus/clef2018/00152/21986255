Radiographic features of a patient with both cemento-ossifying fibroma and keratocystic odontogenic tumor in the mandible: a case report and review of literature. We herein describe a rare case of a 48-year-old woman with both ossifying fibroma (OF) and keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) in the mandible. CT images showed a 15 × 15 × 20-mm radiolucent-radiopaque lesion with bucco-lingual bony expansion in the left first premolar equivalent area of the mandible, and a 15 × 40 × 35-mm well-defined unilocular radiolucent lesion in the left side of the mandible, extending from the distal side of the distal root of the left second molar to the left mandibular ramus. A biopsy of the radiolucent-radiopaque lesion and fenestration surgery of the radiolucent lesion were performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a fibro-osseous lesion (FOL) and a KCOT, respectively. CT was useful in diagnosing the radiolucent-radiopaque lesion as OF and for detecting the 3-dimensional bone expansion and the contents in the lumen of the KCOT.
