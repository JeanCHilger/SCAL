saline-infused sonohysterography: tips for achieving greater success. Saline-infused sonohysterography (SIS) may help improve visualization of the endometrium and endometrial cavity and assess tubal patency. Although most SIS procedures are straightforward, a variety of pitfalls may lead to an unsuccessful procedure or incomplete evaluation. SIS should be scheduled between days 4 and 10 of the patient's menstrual cycle, when the endometrium is at its thinnest, and physiologic changes during the secretory phase are not present. Performing preprocedure imaging serves many purposes, such as depicting hydrosalpinx, causes of uterine and adnexal tenderness, and pelvic inflammatory disease, as well as assessing the size and position of the uterus and the orientation of the cervix. It is important not to presume that fibroids are the cause of bleeding when the endometrium is obscured at preprocedure imaging. Obstacles to a successful procedure include issues related to patient anxiety and discomfort, which may be prevented or minimized at almost every step of the procedure. Inability to obtain access to the cervix is the most common cause of unsuccessful SIS proper patient positioning in a semi-upright lithotomy position is important. Injection of air during any US-guided procedure may lead to shadowing that obscures the region of interest. Adequate distention of the endometrial cavity is crucial for successful SIS, and optimal positioning of the distended balloon may improve the degree of distention. However, poor distention may be indicative of an underlying pathologic condition. Knowledge of these pitfalls and the strategies to overcome them may prevent premature or unnecessary termination of an otherwise successful study.
