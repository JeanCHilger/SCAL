Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy using a 6F vesiculoscope for ejaculatory duct obstruction: initial experience. Ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO) is a surgically correctable condition  that occurs in some infertile men. The standard therapy is transurethral  resection of ejaculatory ducts (TURED). However, TURED has been associated  with a high risk of complications, including the impairment of semen  parameters and retrograde ejaculation. In our clinical practice, vesiculoscopy  has demonstrated potential as a minimally invasive alternative technique for  the diagnosis and treatment of EDO. Very few studies have examined  transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TRU-SVS) in recent years, and no study  has examined 6F vesiculoscopes. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study  of TRU-SVS using a 6F vesiculoscope and its effect on the diagnosis and  treatment of EDO. A total of 21 patients who underwent this procedure were  included in the study. The mean patient age was 28.8 years (range, 23-36  years). The procedure was completed successfully in all patients within a mean  time of 31.5 minutes and a mean hospital stay of 1.17 days. All patients had  EDO. Calculi were found in the ejaculatory ducts or in the seminal vesicles of  5 patients. Sperm was detected in 11 patients 1-3 months postsurgery and  in another 8 patients 3-12 months postsurgery. No sperm was detected in  the remaining 2 patients by 12 months postsurgery. Epididymitis, retrograde  ejaculation, urinary incontinence, and rectal injury were not observed. These  data indicate that TRU-SVS using a 6F vesiculoscope affords direct access to  the seminal vesicle and offers the advantages of fewer complications and more  optimal sperm recovery as well as direct, dynamic video imaging.
