Diagnosis and treatment of pelvic splenosis during exploration of infertility. Splenosis is the heterotopic autotransplantation of splenic tissue that usually follows traumatic splenectomy. Rare pelvic localizations are reported. We report here a case of a 36-year-old woman, followed for secondary infertility. On transvaginal ultrasound pelvic scanning hypervascular paracervical nodules were demonstrated. Pelvic splenosis was suspected regarding the patient's medical past (post-traumatic splenectomy). Surgical exploration and resection were decided considering the nodule localization, the risk during ovarian punction for IVF, and the hypothetical risk of bleeding at delivery. Generally, it is recommended to leave in place the splenic tissue, which may be immunologically functional.
