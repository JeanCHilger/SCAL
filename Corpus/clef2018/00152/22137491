Impact of cancer therapies on ovarian reserve. To determine whether measures of ovarian reserve differ between females exposed to cancer therapies in a dose-dependent manner as compared with healthy controls of similar age and late reproductive age.Cross-sectional analysis of data from a prospective cohort study.University medical center.Seventy-one cancer survivors aged 15-39 years 67 healthy, similarly aged unexposed subjectsNone.Early follicular-phase hormones (FSH, E(2), inhibin B, antim√ºllerian hormone [AMH]) and ovarian ultrasound measurements (ovarian volume and antral follicle counts [AFC]) were compared using multivariable linear regression.In adjusted models, FSH, AMH, and AFC differed between exposed vs. unexposed subjects (FSH 11.12 mIU/mL vs. 7.25 mIU/mL AMH 0.81 ng/mL vs. 2.85 ng/mLMeasures of ovarian reserve are impaired in a dose-dependent manner among cancer survivors compared with unexposed females of similar age. Reproductive hormone levels in menstruating survivors exposed to high-dose therapy are similar to those in late-reproductive-age women. The predictive value of measures for pregnancy and menopause must be studied. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01143844.
