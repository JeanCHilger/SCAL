Screening for ovarian cancer in the general population. Advances in screening and early detection of ovarian cancer over the past decade have included novel interpretation of serum CA125, discovery of human epididymis protein 4, which has the potential to add to CA125, and the growing understanding of the flaws of previous biomarker studies. No mortality effect was found in the ovarian screening arm of the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.(87) Concerns, however, have been raised about trial design, and the results from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening in the general population(38) and other ongoing studies in the high-risk population are awaited for a definitive conclusion. Future work needs to take into account the new insights into ovarian cancer subtypes and the growing evidence that a significant proportion of ovarian cancers might originate in premalignant lesions in the distal fallopian tube.
