Uterine perforation by a cystoperitoneal shunt, an unusual cause of recurrent vaginal discharge. We describe the first reported case of uterine perforation by a cystoperitoneal shunt. The mechanism of this unusual complication is unclear.A 17-year-old patient had a cystoperitoneal shunt for a porencephalic cyst. She presented with recurrent watery vaginal discharge. A pelvic ultrasound examination showed that the uterus had been perforated by the distal tip of the shunt. The cystoperitoneal shunt was converted to a ventriculo-atrial shunt, and the vaginal discharge subsequently resolved.The appearance of light and clear vaginal discharge in a patient with a cystoperitoneal shunt raises the possibility of uterine perforation. This can be confirmed by ultrasound and analysis of the discharge. Removal of the shunt leads to spontaneous closure of the uterine defect.
