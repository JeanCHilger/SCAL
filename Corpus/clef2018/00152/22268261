Evaluation of the importance of late follicular phase endometrial echo patterns and pregnancy outcome following embryo transfer by evaluating infertile donor/recipient pairs. To investigate if the late follicular phase echo pattern is associated with pregnancy outcome in donors vs recipients.Infertile donors sharing eggs with recipients were retrospectively evaluated. The endometrial echo pattern was evaluated on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin injection in donors and on the day before progesterone was given to recipients.Almost twice as many donors conceived when the triple-line pattern was found compared to isoechogenic (IE) (51.5% or 52/101 vs 27.3% or 6/22) but there were inadequate numbers in the IE group to show a significant difference. There was not even a trend for a difference in recipients (55.2%, 37/67 vs 53.8%, 14/26).The trend in this study for higher pregnancy rates in COH cycles with triple-line isoechogenic pattern in the late follicular phase will prompt a study of a larger group of patients undergoing IVF-ET in the modern era. If confirmed one treatment option would be to freeze and defer transfer to an estrogen/progesterone cycle.
