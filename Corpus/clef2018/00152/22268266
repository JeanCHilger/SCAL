Successful twin pregnancy in a donor oocyte recipient despite a maximum endometrial thickness in the late proliferative phase of 4 mm. To show that even a twin pregnancy is possible following embryo transfer despite a very thin endometrium.Two embryos derived from donor oocytes were transferred into a 47-year-old woman despite a peak endometrial thickness of 4 mm.She delivered viable dichorionic twins at 30 weeks in a pregnancy complicated by HELLP syndrome.Anecdotal case reports are important to establish precedents to allow patients to make decisions when presented with treatment options. A third precedent of a successful pregnancy with endometrial thickness of only 4 mm is presented. Without precedent she would have chosen embryo freezing and subsequent transfer into a very expensive gestational carrier if thin endometrium persisted.
