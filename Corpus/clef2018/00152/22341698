Imaging manifestation of conventional and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in percutaneous microwave ablation for the treatment of uterine fibroids. To evaluate the image changes and the relationship between conventional ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the perioperative period of microwave (MW) ablation for uterine fibroids to guide clinical ablation therapy and evaluate the efficacy of MW.Twenty-nine patients with 31 uterine fibroids were recruited in this study. All patients received conventional ultrasound as well as CEUS examination before, immediately after and 12-24 h after MW, in order to detect variations of echo and characteristics of blood supply. t-Tests were used to compare the hyperecho area on gray-scale ultrasound to immediately after ablation non-enhanced CEUS measurements, as well as to compare the immediately after ablation non-enhanced CEUS measurements to the 12-24 h after ablation measurements.Immediately after ablation, the average hyperecho area in gray-scale was 82.20±72.32 cm3 the average non-enhancement area was 76.34±70.63 cm3 by CEUS, showing a strong correlation (r=0.997, P<0.01) to the hyperecho area in gray-scale. The average non-enhancement area measured by CEUS immediately after ablation was 90.55±74.41 cm3 and average 12-24h after ablation was 98.29±78.25 cm3Measurements made by hyperechoic range on gray-scale ultrasonography is strongly correlated to the no enhancement area by CEUS. The hyperechoic range on gray-scale image can represent the ablated area immediately after MW.
