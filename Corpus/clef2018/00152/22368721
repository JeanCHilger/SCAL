Functional bowel disorders in adults. Chronic abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and stool irregularity are common symptoms in primary care and gastroenterology. A routine diagnostic evaluation fails to reveal any underlying somatic condition in about half of the affected patients, who are therefore said to have a functional bowel disorder. Physicians are often unsure how extensive the work-up must be to exclude a somatic cause.This review is based on a selective review of the literature, including published guidelines from Germany and abroad.Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed on the basis of a typical constellation of symptoms and the absence of pathological findings that would adequately explain them (exclusive criteria). The basic diagnostic assessment, consisting of a physical examination, basic laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasonography, and (in women) a gynecological examination, is supplemented by further testing that depends on the patient's symptoms. Colonoscopy is obligatory to rule out underlying pathological abnormalities. By communicating the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome to the patient, the physician shows that the patient's symptoms and concerns have been taken seriously. The mainstays of treatment are patient education on the benign course of the disease and the encouragement of a salubrious lifestyle. Further treatment options include dietary measures, time-limited symptomatic treatment with drugs, and psychotherapy.The diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder is based on a thorough history (positive criteria) and a small battery of diagnostic tests to exclude somatic disease. Both the diagnostic assessment and the treatment should be carried out in accordance with published guidelines.
