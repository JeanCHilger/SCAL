Enhanced compression rate of integral images by using motion-compensated residual images in three-dimensional integral-imaging. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to notably enhance the compression rate of integral images by using the motion-compensated residual images (MCRIs). In the proposed method, sub-images (SIs) transformed from the picked-up elemental images of a three-dimensional (3-D) object, are sequentially rearranged with a spiral scanning topology. The moving vectors among the SIs, then, are estimated and compensated with the block-matching algorithm. Furthermore, spatial redundancy among the SIs is also removed by computing the differences between the local SIs and their motion-compensated versions, from which a sequence of MCRIs are finally generated and compressed with the MPEG-4 algorithm. Experimental results show that the compression efficiency of the proposed method has been improved up to 861.1% on average from that of the JPEG-based elemental images (EIs) method, and up to 1,497.0% and 118.8% on average from those of the MPEG-based MCSIs and the MPEG-based RIs method, respectively.
