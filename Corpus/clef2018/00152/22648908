Polycystic ovaries at ultrasound: normal variant or silent polycystic ovary syndrome? It is not known whether polycystic ovaries (PCO) are an ovarian appearance without pathological meaning or whether they share with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) the same ovarian follicle abnormality. There are few studies including strictly selected women with PCO but without other criteria of PCOS. In order to address these issues, we compared hormonal, metabolic and ultrasound parameters obtained from patients with PCO only, patients with PCOS and controls.This was a comparative analysis including three age-matched groups of 95 patients, who were included consecutively in a database: controls, patients with sonographic PCO but no symptoms (PCO group) and patients with PCOS. A clinical examination, fasting serum sampling and pelvic ultrasound examination were performed between cycle days 2 and 5 and results were compared between groups.The median serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level in the PCO group was intermediate between that in controls and that in the PCOS group (33.6 pmol/L, 19.8 pmol/L and 63.3 pmol/L, respectively), the differences being significant after adjustment for follicle number (P < 0.05), while the mean androgen serum level in the PCO group was similar to that in the control group and significantly lower than that in the PCOS group (P < 0.05) (median serum testosterone levels: 0.90 nmol/L, 0.79 nmol/L and 1.39 nmol/L median androstenedione levels: 5.25 nmol/L, 4.37 nmol/L and 6.09 nmol/L, respectively). Body mass index, waist circumference and insulin levels had no effect on these differences.PCO is an abnormal condition, affected women showing no evidence of hyperandrogenism but having higher AMH serum levels compared with controls, suggesting a granulosa cell abnormality in PCO similar to that observed in PCOS. The absence of hyperandrogenism in PCO does not seem linked to the metabolic status.
