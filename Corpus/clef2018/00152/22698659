Adrenal tumors - diagnostics and the factual situation. The study presented three cases of patients diagnosed with adrenal tumors subject to surgical intervention during the past 6 months in our Department. The patients presented with radiological diagnostic difficulties, as to the character and location of the primary tumor. The aim of the study was to demonstrate differences between radiological examination results and the factual situation observed during the adrenalectomy. In all the presented cases patients' were subject to laparoscopic intervention. In two cases conversion to open surgery was necessary. The histopathological results of the surgically removed samples were as follows: leiomyoma, myoperycytoma and pheochromocytoma. In selected cases imaging examinations might be of limited value, especially when determining the character and location of the primary lesion of the adrenal gland.
