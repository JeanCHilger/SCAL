Laparoscopic temporary clipping of uterine artery during laparoscopic myomectomy. Our aim is to study the feasibility and effect of bilateral laparoscopic temporary occlusion of uterine arteries by special vascular clamps on blood loss during laparoscopic myomectomy.Of 166 women with symptomatic uterine myomas necessitating surgical intervention who wished to retain their uteri, 80 underwent laparoscopic uterine artery clipping and myomectomy (experimental group) and 86 received laparoscopic myomectomy only (control group). Main outcome measures were operating time, number and weight of leiomyomas, blood loss, Doppler examination of the uterine arteries and complications of procedure.In the experimental group the median hemoglobin drop measured on day 3 postoperatively was 1.2 g/dl. In the control group the mean hemoglobin drop measured on day 3 postoperatively was 1.45 g/dl. The time needed to put the clips in place (the time from the opening of the retroperitoneum and the positioning of the clips) varied between 6 and 40 min. No patient required blood transfusion. There were no conspicuous complications.The use of the clips has proved to be statistically effective in reducing hemoglobin loss during laparoscopic myomectomy.
