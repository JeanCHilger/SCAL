Two- and three-dimensional sonographic and color Doppler techniques for diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. The stromal/ovarian volume ratio as a new diagnostic criterion. The purpose of this work was to study the role of 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) sonographic and Doppler techniques in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.A total of 112 young adult lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome and 52 healthy volunteers with regular ovulatory cycles, matched for age and body mass index, underwent a detailed history, medical examination, hormonal assay, and 2D and 3D sonographic and Doppler flow ovarian evaluation during the early follicular phase.The Ferriman-Gallwey score, circulating androgen levels, ovarian volume, and mean number of small subcapsular follicles on 2D and 3D sonography were significantly higher in the patients with polycystic ovary syndrome than the controls (P < .001). A stromal score of 1 or 2 was found in all of the patients but none of the controls. The ovarian stromal/total area ratio was 0.32 or higher in 104 of 112 of the patients (93%), which was significantly higher than in the controls (P < .001). On Doppler analysis, the lowest ovarian stromal resistance levels were found in the patients. On 3D sonography, the total ovarian stromal volume, ovarian stroma/total ovarian volume ratio, and stromal mean grayness were significantly higher in the patients than the controls. With 3D power Doppler imaging, ovarian vascularization measurements were significantly lower in the controls than the patients. The ovarian stroma/total ovarian volume ratio was the most accurate predictor of both hyperandrogenemia (area under the curve, 0.915 P < .0001) and hirsutism (area under the curve, 0.891Our data strongly support the use of 3D sonography with analysis of stromal volume and vascularization in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.
