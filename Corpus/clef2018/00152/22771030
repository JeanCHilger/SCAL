Does the level of serum antimüllerian hormone predict ovulatory function in women with polycystic ovary syndrome with aging? To determine possible prediction of regular menses with aging in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Cohort.Academic practice.A total of 54 anovulatory women with PCOS and 28 age- and weight-matched control subjects.Blood and ovarian ultrasound at baseline and after 5 years. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH), gonadotropins, androgens, insulin sensitivity, and ovarian ultrasound.After 5 years, there was a significant decrease in AMH in women with PCOS and control subjects (10 of 54 anovulatory women became ovulatory after 5 years). There was a significant negative correlation between baseline serum AMH and ovulatory function after 5 years. However, baseline serum AMH ≤ 4 ng/mL was associated with ovulatory function.Serum AMH may help predict ovulatory function with aging in anovulatory women with PCOS.
