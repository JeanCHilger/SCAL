Uterine development in patients with Turner syndrome: relation to hormone replacement therapy and karyotype. Our study aimed to assess uterine development in Turner syndrome patients and its relation to dose and type of estrogen therapy and karyotype. Pelvic ultrasound was used to assess uterine size and shape, and ovarian volume in 40 Turner syndrome patients. Information on hormone replacement therapy was collected from patients' notes. Among the 40 patients studied, 57.5% started estrogen therapy and 30% were taking progestins. Sixty-five per cent had immature uterus, 17.5% had fully mature uterus and 17.5% had transitional uterus. Uterine volume was associated with age (p < 0.001), height (p = 0.002), weight (p = 0.001), years of estrogen use (p < 0.001), estrogen dose (p = 0.016), current estrogen use ( p =0.001) and Tanner breast stage ( p <0.001). Uterine volume was not affected by the type of estrogen used ( p =0.40) and karyotype ( p =0.40). Patients with Turner syndrome treated with estrogen (of adequate dose and duration) may attain a normal, mature uterine size and configuration, even at a late start of hormone replacement therapy and regardless of karyotype.
