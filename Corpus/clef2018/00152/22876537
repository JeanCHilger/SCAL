Ovarian and uterine ultrasonography and relation to puberty in healthy girls between 6 and 16 years in the Turkish population: a cross-sectional study. To investigate uterine and ovarian ultrasonography in healthy girls and establish reliable cut-off limits in the Turkish population.The study was performed on 90 girls between 6 and 16 years of age with bone age, hormonal evaluation and pelvic ultrasounds. Total uterine length (TUL), anteroposterior diameters of corpus (COAP), anteroposterior diameters of cervix (CEAP), fundus/cervix ratio (F/C), uterine volume (UV), ovarian volume (OV) and morphology were obtained. The data were stratified according to various pubertal stages and ages.Age-related increases of pelvic organs were noted after 10-10.9 years. Significant correlation was detectable between age and OV, TUL and UV in pubertal girls, but age only correlated with OV in prepubertal girls. A cut-off value of 4 cm for TUL, 2.57 cm(3) for UV and 1.58 cm(3) for OV were the best discrimination values for entering puberty.The data herein may be useful in screening cases around puberty when continuous changes take place.
