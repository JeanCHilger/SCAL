Screening for ovarian cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement. Reaffirmation of the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for ovarian cancer.A 2008 review of the literature commissioned by the USPSTF revealed no new evidence about the benefits of screening for ovarian cancer but provided some new data about observed harms of screening. A bridge search to 2011 focused on evidence from randomized, controlled trials.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women. It does not apply to women with known genetic mutations that increase their risk for ovarian cancer (for example, BRCA mutations).The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in women (D recommendation).
