A review of recent developments in image-guided radiation therapy in cervix cancer. Brachytherapy is an essential part of radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer. Over the decades, it has evolved from manual loading of radium and caesium to remote after-loaders and from low-dose and medium-dose rates to high-dose rates. Over the past 10 years, 3D image-based Brachytherapy has evolved and established itself as the gold standard, improving local control and overall survival, and significantly reducing toxicity. In this article, we review some of the available literature on gynaecologic brachytherapy, more specifically on topics such as dose rates, high-dose-rate/pulsed-dose-rate (HDR/PDR) brachytherapy and image-based brachytherapy (IBBT), and present some of the evidence that establishes IBBT.
