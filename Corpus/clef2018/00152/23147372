Testicular fusion in a patient with crossed testicular ectopia: a rare entity. Crossed testicular ectopia (CTE) is a well-described, rare congenital abnormality of testicular descent, in which both testes migrate through one inguinal canal. The objective of this work is to present a case of fused two testicles in a hemiscrotum as a rare entity of CTE. We describe a rare case of CTE in a 19-year-old boy presenting to the Department with left testis placed in the right hemiscrotum with right inguinal hernia. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed fused testes with their own vasa deferentia in the left hemiscrotum. Azoospermia was detected in semen analysis. The patient was referred to microTESE and ICSI procedure for his infertility problem. CTE should be kept in mind in patients with an inguinal hernia and contralateral nonpalpable testis.
