An unusual cause of massive pleural effusion. Pleural effusions in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, whether transudative or exudative, can occur in up to 30% of cases. This disorder is always reversible but may have various clinical presentations and degrees of severity. Although assessing for risk factors to predict clinical severity is helpful, it is rare for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to present as a massive pleural effusion requiring emergent intervention. In this study, such a case is reported.
