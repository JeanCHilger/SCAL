Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome. A report of two cases. The Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by lack of vaginal and uterine development variable and normal ovaries. It results from agenesis or hypoplasia Müller duct system. Cervicovaginal agenesis as part of the complex syndrome, is even rarer. We report two cases: adolescent patient with primary amenorrhea, cervicovaginal agenesis and chronic pelvic pain, and a 28-year-old patient with primary amenorrhea, congenital absence of uterus and vagina.
