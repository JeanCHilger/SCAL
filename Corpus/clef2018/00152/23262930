Association of abnormal ovarian reserve parameters with a higher incidence of aneuploid blastocysts. To estimate the relationship between hormonal parameters of diminished ovarian reserve and the incidence of aneuploid blastocysts.This prospective cohort trial was performed in a private in vitro fertilization clinic. Three hundred seventy-two patients underwent in vitro fertilization with blastocyst biopsy and aneuploidy screening of all 23 chromosome pairs. Patients were divided into groups based on baseline hormonal ovarian reserve. Group 1 included normal ovarian reserve (n=279) and group 2 included diminished ovarian reserve with day 2 or 3 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) more than 10 milli-international units/mL, antim端llerian hormone 1 ng/mL or less (n=93), or both. Patients with diminished ovarian reserves were further subdivided into three groups. Group A included FSH more than 10 milli-international units and antim端llerian hormone 1 ng/mL or less (n=25) group B included FSH more than 10 milli-international units/mL and antim端llerian hormone more than 1 ng/mL (n=34)Group 2 (diminished ovarian reserve) had a higher percentage of aneuploid blastocysts (66% compared with 51.7% P<.05) and all aneuploid blastocyst cycles (35.1% compared with 14.3%Infertility patients with hormonal evidence of diminished ovarian reserve have a significantly higher percentage of aneuploid blastocysts. The combination of abnormal serum FSH and antim端llerian hormone correlated with the greatest rate of embryonic aneuploidy. Regardless of ovarian reserve parameters, transfer of euploid blastocysts resulted in equivalent implantation potential.II.
