Simultaneous bilateral torsion of the adnexae in an adult female without any history of ovarian stimulation. Simultaneous bilateral adnexal torsion is very rare especially in adults. There have been few cases reported in children with only one previous case reported in adults since 1984, which was complicated by entanglement of both adnexae. In adults, the use of ovarian stimulation for treatment of infertility can increase the risk of ovarian torsion. We report the second case of simultaneous bilateral adnexal torsion in an adult female without follicular stimulation.
