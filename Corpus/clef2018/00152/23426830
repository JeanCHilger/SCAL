Elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome: relationship to ultrasound features. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is linked to the ovarian follicle pool. Little is known about the relationship between serum AMH and ovarian ultrasound (US) features in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).To confirm that serum AMH is elevated in adolescents with PCOS and to correlate serum AMH with ovarian US features in this population are the objectives of this study.A retrospective chart review of clinical, biochemical, and ultrasonographic data in adolescents with PCOS and normal controls is the design of the study. Serum AMH was measured and compared between groups and correlated with ovarian US findings.The study was done in two urban tertiary academic medical centers.Study groups included 23 adolescent females with PCOS and 12 age and BMI-matched female controls.We hypothesized that serum AMH would be elevated in the PCOS group compared with the controls and would positively correlate with the follicle number, distribution, and ovarian volume.Serum AMH was 6.78±3.55 ng/mL in the PCOS group vs. 3.38±1.48 ng/mL in the controls (p=0.0004). AMH positively correlated with ovarian volume (left ovary r=0.65, p=0.0007, right ovary r=0.55, p=0.0065) and peripheral follicle distribution (p=0.0027). Ten or more follicles were observed in 83% of USs.There is a positive relationship between serum AMH and ovarian volume as well as peripheral follicular distribution in adolescents with PCOS. Our findings support the use of serum AMH as a useful marker to reflect ovarian US features typical of PCOS in cases where accurate USs are not available and for follow-up.
