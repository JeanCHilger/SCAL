Cervical cerclage in twin pregnancies. To evaluate the outcomes of cervical cerclage (CC) in twin pregnancies.Retrospective analysis of twin pregnancies undergoing CC between January 2001 and December 2009 at our Institution. CC was offered in case of a cervical length measurement â‰¤ 20 mm (ultrasound-indicated CC) or in case of cervical dilatation with membranes at or beyond the external cervical os (physical examination-indicated CC). Cervicovaginal and rectal swabs were obtained preoperatively. Perioperative antibiotics and tocolysis were administered.There were 28 cases of ultrasound-indicated and 14 of physical examination-indicated CC. Positive swab cultures were observed in 21 % of cases. The incidence of preterm delivery <34 weeks was 32 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 16-52 %] and 50 % (95 % CI 23-77 %) in the ultrasound-indicated and physical examination-indicated CC group, respectively. The incidence of premature rupture of membranes <34 weeks was 21 % (95 % CI 8-41 %) and 29 % (95 % CI 8-58 %) in the ultrasound-indicated and physical examination-indicated CC group, respectively. Perinatal survival was 96 % (95 % CI 88-100 %) in the ultrasound-indicated CC group, and 86 % (95 % CI 67-96 %) in the physical examination-indicated CC group.We showed a high-risk of preterm delivery in both groups, but with a high overall perinatal survival. Our data stress the importance of re-evaluating the efficacy of CC in twin pregnancies by properly designed clinical trials, particularly if it is physical examination indicated.
