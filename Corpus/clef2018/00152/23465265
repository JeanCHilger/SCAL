Large uterine neurofibroma. Herein we report a rare case of a large uterine neurofibroma. The patient reported infertility and nonspecific pelvic symptoms. Physical examination and ultrasonography revealed a mass of uterine origin with echo texture similar to that of a myoma. With a provisional diagnosis of a myomatous uterus, laparoscopic myomectomy was attempted. The mass, which measured 13 × 9 × 8 cm, was noted to be arising from the uterine fundus and extending into the left broad ligament. Histopathologic examination revealed a neurofibroma, which was confirmed at immunohistochemical analysis of the specimen. Most neurofibromas arise as subcutaneous swellings, and large neurofibromas arising from the myometrium are rare. Deep-tissue neurofibromas are known to recur and are associated with a higher probability of becoming malignant.
