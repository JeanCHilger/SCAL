Racial differences in fibroid prevalence and ultrasound findings in asymptomatic young women (18-30 years old): a pilot study. 1) To determine the prevalence of fibroids in asymptomatic young black and white women (ages 18-30 y) 2) to determine other differences in uterine and adnexal anatomyPilot cross-sectional study.Academic medical center.One hundred one nonparous black and white women, ages 18-30 years, with no known diagnosis of fibroids or clinically suggestive symptoms.A transvaginal ultrasound was performed in the follicular phase in all subjects.1) Presence of fibroids 2) endometrial thicknessOf the 101 participants (mean age 24.5 ± 3.5 y), 43% self-identified as black and 57% as white. The prevalence of ultrasound-diagnosed fibroids was 15% overall (26% in black women and 7% in white women). The mean fibroid size was 2.3 ± 2.1 cm. There was a significant difference in endometrial thickness between races, even after adjusting for contraception use and fibroid presence.Racial differences in fibroid prevalence exist even before women become symptomatic. Findings of thicker endometrium in black women could have clinical implications and warrants further investigation.
