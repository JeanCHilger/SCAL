Influence of anatomical location on CT numbers in cone beam computed tomography. To assess the influence of anatomical location on computed tomography (CT) numbers in mid- and full field of view (FOV) cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans.Polypropylene tubes with varying concentrations of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K₂HPO₄) solutions (50-1200 mg/mL) were imaged within the incisor, premolar, and molar dental sockets of a human skull phantom. CBCT scans were acquired using the NewTom 3G and NewTom 5G units. The CT numbers of the K₂HPO₄ phantoms were measured, and the relationship between CT numbers and K₂HPO₄ concentration was examined. The measured CT numbers of the K₂HPO₄ phantoms were compared between anatomical sites.At all six anatomical locations, there was a strong linear relationship between CT numbers and K₂HPO₄ concentration (R(2)>0.93). However, the absolute CT numbers varied considerably with the anatomical location.The relationship between CT numbers and object density is not uniform through the dental arch on CBCT scans.
