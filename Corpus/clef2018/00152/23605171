Comparative study on the role of diagnostic hysteroscopy in evaluation of the uterine cavity prior to in vitro fertilization in a developing country. Diagnostic hysteroscopy is a vital tool and a gold standard to evaluate the uterine cavity. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of unsuspected intrauterine abnormalities.This cross-sectional study was done involving 870 asymptomatic, infertile women enrolled for IVF, who underwent a transvaginal ultrasound followed by office hysteroscopy. The presence of uterine cavity abnormalities was recorded.Transvaginal sonography revealed abnormal findings in 113 patients (12.9 %). Hysteroscopy confirmed the ultrasound findings in 76 (67.3 %) women with no obvious findings seen on hysteroscopy in 37 (32.7 %). Among the 757 women, who had a normal pelvic scan, abnormal findings were observed in 108 (14.2 %) on hysteroscopy, while the remaining 649 (85.7 %) patients had normal findings on hysteroscopy. Thus, a total of 184 (21.1 %) patients had confirmed abnormalities that required to be treated before performing IVF/ICSI.The present study highlights the relatively higher prevalence of intrauterine abnormalities in our patient population. Diagnosing and treating these abnormalities are imperative to improve the success of IVF treatment. Therefore, a routine diagnostic hysteroscopy in these patients becomes mandatory before proceeding with expensive procedures such as assisted reproduction.
