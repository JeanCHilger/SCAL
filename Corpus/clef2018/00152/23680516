A rare cause for a neonatal cystic abdominal mass. Intrauterine ovarian torsion is a rare event, but it is a possible cause for unilateral ovarian aplasia. Most commonly the ovary undergoes autolysis after torsion so that no tissue or remnants can be discovered on the involved side. We report a rare case of unilateral intrauterine torsion followed by autoamputation and abdominal reimplantation resulting in an intra-abdominal complex cystic mass with a review of the literature.
