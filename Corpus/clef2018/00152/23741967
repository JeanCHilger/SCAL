Adenomyosis within a uterine septum in a patient with secondary infertility. Adenomyosis is a benign infiltration of endometrial stroma and glands into the myometrium. Until the advent and advancement of imaging techniques such as transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the diagnosis of adenomyosis could only be made with confidence using histology following hysterectomy.The patient is a 37-year-old woman, with a long history of secondary infertility. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) and a pelvic MRI showed two separate uterine cavities. The patient underwent laparoscopy and hysteroscopy revealing a bicornuate appearance of the uterus and a uterine septum. Resection of the septum showed adenomyosis on histologic examination.Adenomyosis of uterine septum should be considered if MRI shows features of adenomyosis elsewhere in the uterus with thickened junctional zone. Further research is needed to investigate this association with the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.
