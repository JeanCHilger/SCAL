Increased epicardial fat thickness is related with body mass index in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. We aimed to investigate the relationship between PCOS and epicardial fat thickness with transthoracic echocardiography.PCOS patients were divided into two groups according to the lean or obesity status: PCOS patients with lean 34 subjects (BMI: 23.3±2.8 mean age: 25.5±4), PCOS patients with obese16 subjects (BMI: 32.3±7.6There was increased epicardial thickness in obese PCOS subjects compared to lean PCOS subjects (6.3±0.9 mm, 4.7±0.5, respectively, p < 0.001). However, epicardial fat thickness between lean PCOS subjects and lean healthy control groups were not significantly varied (4.7±0.5 mm, 4.5±0.5, respectively, p = 0.6). There was increased epicardial thickness in obese PCOS subjects compared to lean healthy control subjects (6.3±0.9 mm, 4.5±0.5, respectively, p < 0.001). This sudy showed for the first time that increased epicardial fat thickness measured using transthoracic echocardiography is associated with increased BMI in PCOS subjects.Epicardial fat thickness between lean PCOS subjects and lean healty control group were similar which indicate the importance of obesity in PCOS subjects.
