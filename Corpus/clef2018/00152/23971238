Experience improves performance of hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy): a comprehensive and well-tolerated screening modality for the subfertile patient. To investigate the clinical observations, provider experience, safety, and tolerance of the hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) procedure.A retrospective study design in which data was collected from ninety-six subfertile women who underwent the HyCoSy procedure at the University of Louisville over a 16-month interval.Ninety-six HyCoSy procedures were performed by a single investigator and contained complete records for review. The authors observed significant decreases in the quantities of saline and air utilized per procedure over time (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0001). Results from the HyCoSy studies were more often non-diagnostic or non-patent in women with a body mass index (BMI) > 30. Reported pain scores did not statistically differ over the course of the study interval. There were no procedure-related complications noted.The HyCoSy procedure is a timely and minimally invasive study that can be implemented in an office setting with minimal prior operator experience that improves over time.
