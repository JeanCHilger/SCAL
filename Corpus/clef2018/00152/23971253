The prevalence of phenotypic subgroups in Greek women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Since 2003, when the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) sponsored consensus established criteria for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis, the phenotypic spectrum of the syndrome has been significantly broadened.This survey makes an effort to distinguish PCOS according to phenotypic expression and to estimate its prevalence in a Greek population.Greek women from 18 to 35 years of age, who visited the outpatient department, claiming either irregular menstruation (oligo- or anovulation, OA) or clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenemia (HA) were recruited. They gave full disease history and underwent clinical examination, including transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) scan to identify PCO morphology. Blood samples were collected to perform hormonal and metabolic analyses. Acute or chronic disorders were excluded. Finally, 266 PCOS women constituted the study population.The full-blown phenotype (HA+OA+PCO) is the predominant phenotype in this Greek population.
