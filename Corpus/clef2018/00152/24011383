A comparison between ultrasonography and hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of uterine pathology. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal sonography (TVS) compared to hysteroscopy in diagnosing uterine abnormalities. In addition, to determine whether the number of diagnostic hysteroscopies can be reduced and replaced by TVS examinations.In this retrospective study, we summarized data from 128 patients who underwent TVS examination and hysteroscopy in our ultrasound unit during the last two years. Specimens were obtained and sent for histopathological examination. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for diagnosing uterine pathology were calculated for each method.Hysteroscopy had a significantly higher sensitivity in diagnosing intra-uterine fibroids while TVS had a significantly higher sensitivity in diagnosing retained products of conception. Although hysteroscopy had better predictive values for diagnosing uterine polyps the difference was not statistically significant. The combination of both TVS and hysteroscopy did not seem to improve the sensitivity and specificity. There were three additional important findings: two cases of uterine hyperplasia and one case of endometrial carcinoma in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding were all diagnosed by hysteroscopy after being suspected on the TVS examination.TVS is an excellent tool in evaluating retained products of conception. In other cases of uterine pathology, diagnostic hysteroscopy is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy.
