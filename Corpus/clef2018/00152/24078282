Ovarian and tubal torsion: imaging findings on US,  CT, and MRI. Accurate diagnosis of adnexal torsion is often challenging, as clinical presentation is nonspecific and the differential for pelvic pain is broad. However, prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to good clinical outcomes and preservation of the ovary and/or fallopian tube. Ultrasound (US) imaging is most frequently used to assess torsion. However, as computed tomography (CT) utilization in the emergency setting has increased, there are times when CT is the initial imaging test. Additionally, the nonspecific clinical presentation may initially be interpreted as gastrointestinal in etiology, where CT is the preferred exam. For these reasons, it is imperative to know the findings of adnexal torsion on CT as well as US. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful in cases where the diagnosis remains unclear and is particularly helpful in the young or pregnant patient with equivocal sonographic findings, as it provides excellent soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation. This article will illustrate the findings of surgically confirmed ovarian and fallopian tube torsion on US, CT, and MRI, including those in the pregnant patient. Ovarian enlargement, adnexal mass, twisting of the vascular pedicle, edematous and heterogeneous appearance of the ovary, peripheral ovarian follicles, free fluid, uterine deviation towards the side of torsion, adnexal fat stranding, tubal dilatation, and decreased adnexal enhancement will be reviewed. Familiarity with the range of imaging findings across multiple modalities is key to improving the likelihood of timely diagnosis and therefore improved clinical outcomes.
