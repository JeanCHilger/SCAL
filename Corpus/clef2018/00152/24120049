Engineering of perfluorooctylbromide polypyrrole nano-/microcapsules for simultaneous contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging and photothermal treatment of cancer. A versatile oil-in-water emulsion method has been explored for constructing water-dispersible polypyrrole (PPy) nano-/microcapsules with a soluble PPy complex as multifunctional photothermal agents for tumor ablation. In this work, both PPy nanocapsules (280.4 ± 79.0 nm) and microcapsules (1.31 ± 0.45 μm) with liquid perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB) core could be obtained by simply tuning the process energy for emulsion formation from ultrasonication to homogenization. Owing to the encapsulated liquid PFOB and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption of PPy shell, the resulted PPy capsules showed great promise in ultrasound imaging guided photothermal ablation of tumor cells without inducing any significant side effect. Thus, it is anticipated that fine-tuning of the other encapsulated drugs or functional materials in PPy capsules would foster avenues for the development of multifunctional platforms for cancer treatments.
