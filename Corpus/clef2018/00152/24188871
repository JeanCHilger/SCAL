Follicle number, not assessments of the ovarian stroma, represents the best ultrasonographic marker of polycystic ovary syndrome. To compare the diagnostic potential of ultrasonographic markers of ovarian morphology, used alone or in combination, to predict polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A diagnostic test study using cross-sectional data collected from 2006-2011.Academic hospital and clinical research unit.Eighty-two women with PCOS and 60 healthy female volunteers.None.Follicle number per ovary (FNPO), ovarian volume (OV), follicle number per single cross-section (FNPS), follicle distribution pattern, stromal area, ovarian area, stromal-to-ovarian area ratio (S:A), and stromal index (SI).Follicle number per ovary best predicted PCOS (R(2) = 67%) with 85% sensitivity and 98% specificity, followed by OV (R(2) = 44%), and FNPS (R(2) = 36%). Neither S:A nor SI had predictive power for PCOS. In combination, FNPO+S:A and FNPO+SI most significantly predicted PCOS (R(2) = 74% vs. 73%, respectively). The diagnostic potentials of OV and FNPS were substantially improved when used in combination (OV+FNPO, R(2) = 55%).As a single metric, FNPO best predicted PCOS. Although the addition of S:A or SI improved the predictive power of FNPO, gains were marginal, suggesting limited use in clinical practice. When image quality precludes a reliable estimation of FNPO, measurements of OV+FNPS provide the next closest level of diagnostic potential.
