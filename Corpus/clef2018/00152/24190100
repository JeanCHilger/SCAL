Cribriform morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in a patient with an incidental neck lump: a case report and review of the literature. The cribriform morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (CMV-PTC) is a rare morphologic entity that is associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We report a case of a young lady with an incidentally discovered right-sided neck nodule on ultrasonography with a diagnosis of CMV-PTC confirmed on thyroidectomy and review the literature associated with the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, pathological findings and the association with FAP.
