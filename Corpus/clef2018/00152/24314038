Role of 3D sonohysterography in the investigation of uterine synechiae/asherman's syndrome: pictorial assay. Several imaging methods have been applied for evaluation of suspected uterine synechiae however, sonohysterography is yet recognised as a valid and accurate modality. Performing three-dimensional (3D) imaging along with sonohysterography enables evaluation of the uterus in the coronal plane to detect and grade the adhesions that characterise this condition. Thus, 3D sonohysterography is a minimally invasive and cost-effective tool for investigating suspected synechiae and is particularly useful when the transvaginal sonography findings are normal.
