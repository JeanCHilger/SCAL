Primary ovarian leiomyoma in a premenarchal adolescent: first reported case. Primary ovarian leiomyoma is a rare benign ovarian tumor with only several reported cases in adolescents. Little is known about the origin or natural history of these rare tumors as they have occurred in a variety of presentations and were removed upon presentation without observation.A 14-year-old, premenarchal female was found to have a 4 cm mass which grew to 6.5 cm over two years. It appeared sonographically most consistent with a teratoma however, during surgical resection it was found to be solid, and on pathologic evaluation was identified as an ovarian leiomyoma.The growth of this patient's tumor with the onset of puberty supports hormonal responsivity, but its presence prior to menarche suggests an alternate origin, independent of gonadal hormones.
