The impact of ultrasonographic lesion size and initial human chorionic gonadotropin values on treatment success in cases with complete hydatidiform mole. Our aim to assess the impact of sonographically measured lesion size and initial human chorionic gonadotropin levels on treatment success in cases of complete hydatidiform mole (CHM).Patients with CHM diagnosed between January 2007 and January 2012 were included in the study. Clinical parameters such as patient age, fertility history, smoking, alcohol consumption, presenting symptom, pregnancy duration, ultrasonographic mean lesion size, beta-hCG level on admission, primary treatment method, beta-hCG normalization time (NT) and adjuvant treatments were recorded and analyzed.One hundred-twelve cases of CHM were identified in the study period. Mean patient age was 27.3 Â± 8.2 years. Suction curettage was employed as the primary treatment in all of the study cases. No perioperative complications were encountered. None of the patients were treated with prophylactic adjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve patients (10.7%) required adjuvant chemotherapy. Beta-hCG NT did not have an association with patient age and initial beta-hCG levels (p > 0.05). Also, patient age, gravidity, parity, smoking, initial beta-hCG and ultrasonographic mean lesion size did not predict adjuvant chemotherapy requirement (p > 0.05).Early detection and treatment of CHM is associated with a favorable clinical outcome.
