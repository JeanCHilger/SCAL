Assessment of endometrial and subendometrial blood flow in women undergoing frozen embryo transfer cycles. This study evaluated whether 3D power Doppler (3DPD) indices from endometrium and subendometrium can identify increases in endometrial volume/vascularity induced by exogenous oestradiol and subsequent introduction of progestogens in women undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). Oral oestradiol was administered at increasing doses after down-regulation to prepare the endometrium and progestogens were used for luteal support. 3DPD data sets were acquired at down-regulation, on days 5, 10 and 15 of oestradiol administration and at the time of FET. Endometrial thickness was measured using the multiplanar method and endometrial volume and blood flow from the endometrium and subendometrium were estimated using virtual organ computer-aided analysis and shell-imaging. This study evaluated 45 women at least once: 19 achieved clinical pregnancy (CP) 21 were evaluated at down-regulation (eight CP), 26 at day 5 (10 CP), 31 at day 10 (12 CP), 31 at day 15 (13 CP) and 16 at FET (seven CP). Changes were observed in all parameters between the examinations
