Misoprostol treatment for early pregnancy failure does not impair future fertility. To examine whether misoprostol treatment for first trimester missed abortion affects future fertility.In a historical prospective approach, we analyzed our database for patients treated with misoprostol. All eligible patients underwent an interview according to a questionnaire, which includes their demographic characteristics, obstetric, gynecologic and infertility history. They were asked about the side effects, intention and subsequent ability to conceive. Their future pregnancy rates were calculated and compared to the acceptable figures in the literature.The infertility rates among our patients were similar to those reported in the general population. Pregnancy rates 2 years after treatment were similar to the previously published reports, except for lower rates during the first three months post-treatment. Although no between-group differences were observed in the subsequent pregnancy rates, 2 years following misoprostol treatment in ≤35 versus >35 years old patients, primi- versus multigravida and nulli- versus parous women, higher pregnancy rates were observed in patients ≤35 versus >35 years old, primi- versus multigravida and nulli- versus, parous, during the first 3 months following misoprostol treatment.Misoprostol treatment, for women with first trimester missed abortion and favorable reproductive history, is an acceptable treatment with no detrimental effect on future fertility.
