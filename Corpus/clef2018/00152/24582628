Large uterine cervical adenomyoma excised by vaginal approach: case report, images, and literature review. Uterine adenomyoma is often overlooked, and cervical adenomyoma is extremely rare. Previous reports suggest that a uterine adenomyoma usually occurs in the uterine corpus but rarely in the uterine cervix. Approximately 20 reports of cervical adenomyoma have been published to date. However, cervical adenomyoma has been rarely investigated using magnetic resonance imaging. We encountered a large multicystic tumor in the uterine cervix of a 26-year-old woman that was difficult to diagnose preoperatively. On the basis of cytology, biopsy, and imaging findings, the cervical multicystic tumor measured approximately 13.0 cm. The patient underwent vaginal adenomyomectomy, and the tumor was completely resected. A histologic diagnosis of cervical adenomyoma was made because of proliferation of endocervical glands and the presence of rounded smooth muscle stroma. Awareness of this tumor in the uterine cervix is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Herein we present a rare case of a large cervical adenomyoma, with imaging studies, an image of the operation, histologic findings, and a literature review.
