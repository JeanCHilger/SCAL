Endometrioid borderline tumor of the testis. A rare cause of cystic neoplasia. Ovarian type surface epithelial carcinomas of the testis are rare and therefore mostly represent a surprising finding in diagnostic procedures. The most frequent is the serous subtype, while only a few cases of the endometrioid subtype have been reported in the literature. The case of a 73-year-old patient with an endometrioid type papillary cystic tumor of borderline malignancy is presented. The histopathological and immunohistochemical details of this rare tumor are discussed.
