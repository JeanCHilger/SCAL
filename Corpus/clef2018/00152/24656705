The recurrence rate of ovarian dermoid cysts in pediatric and adolescent girls. To assess the rate of recurrence of ovarian dermoid cysts in pediatric and adolescent girls at the Hospital for Sick Children.A retrospective chart review of all dermoid cysts surgically managed at the hospital for Sick Children from January 2003 to JuneÂ 2012.The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.66 adolescent and pediatric patients <18 years old treated with ovarian cystectomy of their dermoid cysts by either laparoscopy (n = 40) or laparotomy (n = 26).Total dermoid cyst recurrence, recurrence after laparoscopy versus laparotomy, follow-up imaging completed and ultrasonographic identification of other ovarian cysts in follow-up. Data was assessed with Fisher exact test where appropriate (P < .05).The mean age of patients at time of surgery was 12.9 years (range 2.5-18.1). 25/66 (38%) of patients received no follow-up, 6/66 (9%) were followed by a single ultrasonography and 35/66 (53%) were followed with annual ultrasonography for up to 5 years. 35 patients completed their initial ultrasonography where 19/35 (54%) patients had new ovarian cysts diagnosed including: 6 functional/hemorrhagic, 3 dermoid, and 10 unspecified cysts. All new dermoids were suspected at first follow-up ultrasonography (6/35), but 3 required a second follow-up ultrasonography for confirmation. Overall, 7/66 (11%) patients had recurrent or persistent dermoid cysts of which 2 (3%) required repeat surgery. There was no significant impact on the type of surgery and dermoid recurrence.The incidence of recurrent dermoid cysts in a pediatric and adolescent population following ovarian cystectomy is 10.6% where only 3% will recur and require further surgical management.
