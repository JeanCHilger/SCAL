Learning curves in 3-dimensional sonographic follicle monitoring during controlled ovarian stimulation. Three-dimensional (3D) sonographically based automated volume calculation (SonoAVC GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) is being introduced in folliculometry during ovarian stimulationAnalyses were performed on 98 oocyte donors by capturing the ovarian image in 3D and applying the 3D SonoAVC software during ovarian stimulation cycles. Each patient was scanned by an expert operator and by a trainee. Independent LC-CUSUM tests for 4 follicular diameters tracked the competency of 3 trainees in 3D SonoAVC.We found that the numbers of sonographic examinations required by the 3 trainees to identify the correct number of follicles of 10 mm or larger were 38, 32, and 28, respectively for follicles of 14 mm or larger, they were 29, 28, and 28A variable number of procedures are needed to reach proficiency in 3D SonoAVC, even for trained 2-dimensional sonographers. Assessment of learning curves should be implemented when incorporating 3D SonoAVC in reproduction units.
