Diagnostic accuracy of endometrial thickness for the detection of intra-uterine pathologies and appropriateness of performed hysteroscopies among asymptomatic postmenopausal women. To measure the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial thickness for the detection of intra-uterine pathologies among asymptomatic postmenopausal women, and to test the diagnostic accuracy and appropriateness of performed hysteroscopies.Prospective study of 268 asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial thickness ≥4 mm referred to diagnostic hysteroscopy. The diagnostic accuracy of various endometrial thickness cut-off values was tested. Histological and hysteroscopic results were compared to measure the diagnostic accuracy of outpatient hysteroscopies.No endometrial thickness cut-off values had optimal diagnostic accuracy [positive likelihood ratio (LR+) >10 and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) <0.1]. The best endometrial thickness cut-off value for the detection of all intra-uterine pathologies was ≥8 mm (LR+ 10.05 and LR- 0.22). An endometrial thickness cut-off value ≥10 mm did not miss any cases of endometrial cancer. The success rate of diagnostic hysteroscopy was 89%, but 97% of these revealed a benign intra-uterine pathology. The diagnostic accuracy of hysteroscopy was optimal for all intra-uterine pathologies, except endometrial hyperplasia (LR- 0.52).Using an endometrial thickness cut-off value ≥4 mm, only 3% of performed hysteroscopies were useful for the detection of pre-malignant or malignant lesions. Despite the finding that endometrial thickness did not show optimal diagnostic accuracy, using the best cut-off value (≥8 mm) may be helpful to decrease the number of false-positive results. No cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with endometrial thickness <10mm.
