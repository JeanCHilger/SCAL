Diagnostic challenges in cornual epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. We present a case of primary cornual epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) because of its rarity and diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, who missed menstruation for 3 months, had an elevated β-human chorionic gonadotropin serum level of 2764 mIU/mL, an absence of intrauterine pregnancy, and the presence of an adnexal mass detected by transvaginal ultrasound. As an ectopic pregnancy was suspected, laparoscopic surgery was performed and showed a right corneal mass. Complete excision of the tumor was done through exploratory laparotomy. Frozen pathology favored the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Since there was no apparent tumor at other sites, no additional surgery was done. The final pathology showed ETT. Primary ETT is often misdiagnosed as an ectopic pregnancy, leading to delayed treatment, and poses a diagnostic challenge in distinguishing it from squamous cell carcinoma during pathological examination.Careful evaluation and avoidance of overtreatment are emphasized.
