Pain during Fallopian-tube patency testing by hysterosalpingo-foam sonography. To evaluate perception of pain during Fallopian-tube patency testing by hysterosalpingo-foam sonography (HyFoSy).In this cross-sectional study, 216 consecutive women presenting at a university fertility clinic for HyFoSy examination were included. Patients were instructed to take ibuprofen 1â€‰hour before the procedure. Immediately after the procedure, patients filled in a questionnaire concerning discomfort or pain experienced during the process, including a visual analog scale (VAS) score for perception of pain.The median VAS score for perception of pain during transvaginal ultrasound examination and during HyFoSy examination was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.0-4.0), respectively. One-third of women reported that the level of discomfort or pain during HyFoSy examination was similar to that during the preceding transvaginal ultrasound examination and 48% of women considered HyFoSy examination to be neutral/unpleasant, but not painful. There was an inverse association between both patients' age and parity and the pain experienced.HyFoSy examination is tolerated well and allows for reliable tubal patency testing without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation in an outpatient setting with a low technical failure rate.
