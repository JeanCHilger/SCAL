Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound in evaluation of fetal brain anatomy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound identifying the fetal brain structures during second trimester and the time of offline analysis of brain volumes to perform a basic and a detailed fetal neurosonogram.140 pregnant women were included in this study presented for a second trimester routine ultrasound scan in Medical Centre "Markovs", Sofia and the University Hospital in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maichin dom, Sofia, Bulgaria. All pregnancies were singleton with no diagnosed fetal anomalies. 3D fetal brain volumes were obtained by transabdominal aquisition in the most suitable plane and analyzed later offline by two trained ultrasonologists with special software.A standart systematic volume orientation was used to identify a list of brain structures and to complete basic evaluation, intracranial biometry and elected structures for detailed fetal neurosonogram. Diagnostic visualization was possible with excellent visualization rate in 91-100% in all brain structures for basic evaluation and in 76-100% for detailed targeted neurosonogram. An average number of 7 volumes was used to complete the examination by the two specialists. In this study a few limitation of the method are presented.3D volume ultrasound is useful method for identification of fetal brain structures in second trimester. There are advantages in storage the digital information and for education.
