Clinical value of miniprobe sonography for detection of esophageal submucosal lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of catheter-based miniprobe sonography for diagnosis of esophageal submucosal lesions.A total of 199 patients with esophageal submucosal lesions underwent miniprobe sonography via gastroscopy. The sonograms were reviewed, and the sonographic findings were compared with pathologic findings from specimens obtained by endoscopic or surgical dissection.The diagnoses for the 199 patients were as follows: 54 cysts, 58 leiomyomas, 25 stromal tumors, 26 venous aneurysms, 15 lipomas, and 21 extramural compressions. A total of 145 lesions were verified by surgery and pathologic examinations. The results for 139 lesions were confirmed by miniprobe sonography 6 lesions were misdiagnosed. The diagnostic accuracy rate for miniprobe sonography was 95.9%.Miniprobe sonography can provide precise information about the size, location, border, and echogenicity of esophageal submucosal lesions. It has high diagnostic accuracy. Preoperative miniprobe sonography via gastroscopy may play an important role in the choice of therapy for esophageal submucosal lesions.
