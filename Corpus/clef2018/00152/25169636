Method and significance of ultrasonographic assessment of the uterine weight before pelvic floor reconstruction. To investigate the accuracy of ultrasonographic assessment of the total uterine weight and the feasibility of using this method in the pelvic floor reconstruction.Firstly, 81 cases with hysterectomy due to benign uterine diseases or uterine prolapse were studied. The preoperative dimensions and gravities of corpus uteri and cervix were calculated by formulas, and were then compared with the postoperative measurements. Subsequently, 46 cases with pelvic floor reconstruction and preserved the uterus were subjected to retrospectively analysis of uterine measurement parameters.There were no statistically differences between the preoperative and postoperative diameters of corpus uteri and cervix (P > 0.05), and no statistically differences between the weight of corpus uteri and cervix estimated by the formulas [(87 ± 55), (32 ± 6) g] and the true weight [(88 ± 57), (33 ± 6) g P > 0.05]. In 46 cases that underwent the pelvic floor reconstruction by transvaginal mesh repair and preserved the uterus, 42 cases were successful treated and the average weight of total uterus was (49 ± 13) g (95%CI: 39.90-49.88 g)The uterine weight might be a significant factor for uterus preservation in pelvic floor reconstruction, while ultrasonographic assessment can accurately estimate the uterine weight preoperatively. All these raised the feasibility of assessing uterine weight preoperatively in pelvic floor reconstruction.
