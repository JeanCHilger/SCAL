Improved survival of patients with cervical cancer treated with image-guided brachytherapy compared with conventional brachytherapy. Since the Group Européen de Curiethérapie and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) published recommendations for 3D MRI-based image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGBT) in the treatment of cervical cancer, many institutions have implemented this technique and favourable results were documented. We investigated if introduction of IGBT in our centre indeed improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity compared to conventional brachytherapy (CBT).A retrospective analysis was done of outcomes of patients with stage IB-IVA cervical cancer treated with primary radiation therapy with curative intent between 2000 and 2012. Outcome measures were overall and disease-free survival, pelvic control, distant metastasis and treatment related adverse events (AE).126 patients were analysed 43 had been treated with CBT between 2000-2007, and 83 with IGBT between 2007-2012. External beam radiation (meanIntroduction of IGBT for cervical cancer has led to significantly increased 3-year locoregional control and survival rates, whilst reducing late morbidity.
