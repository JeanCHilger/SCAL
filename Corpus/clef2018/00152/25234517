Hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy): let's make the point! The accurate evaluation of tubal patency as well of the morphologic characteristics of the uterine cavity is a fundamental step in the diagnostic work-up for infertility. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy and dye have long been regarded as the reference methods to assess uterine morphology and tubal patency, respectively. However, their technical and clinical limitations have supported the introduction of an emerging technique: hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy), which has recently been improved with the use of modern contrast agents and three-dimensional resolution.A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus). Key search terms included Hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy), Tubal patency, Infertility, Uterine cavity, Ultrasounds.HyCoSy has proved to be as reliable as laparoscopic techniques in the assessment of tubal patency and uterine morphology, and also it overcomes such major drawbacks as hospitalization, radiation exposure, anesthesia and use of iodinated contrast media. All in all, HyCoSy is considered as a safe and well tolerated outpatient procedure, which apparently favors the onset of spontaneous pregnancies.This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the literature dealing with HyCoSy to support its use as a first-line technique in standard infertility work-up.
