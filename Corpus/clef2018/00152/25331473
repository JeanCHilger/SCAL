Safety and efficacies of ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of uterine fibroids with lauromacrogol. To evaluate the safety and efficacies of ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of uterine fibroids with lauromacrogol.A total of 102 consecutive premenopausal women with 113 uterine fibroids were enrolled. The treatment of lauromacrogol was performed under the guidance of ultrasound. Both conventional and color Doppler ultrasound were performed before treatment and at Month 1, 3, 6 and 12 after treatment. The changes of tumor volume reductions and vascular flow were analyzed and compared. And the alteration of symptoms was evaluated by the symptom severity score (SSS) questionnaire. And adverse events were also assessed during and after treatment.At Month 1, 3, 6 and 12 after treatment, the mean volume of fibroids decreased by 40%, 47%, 58% and 70% respectively. And the differences had statistical significance before and after treatment (P < 0.05). The clinical symptoms alleviated greatly or even disappeared. And the differences in SSS before and after treatment were also statistically significant (P = 0.000). There was no onset of severe adverse events.Both safe and efficacious, ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of uterine fibroids with lauromacrogolis offers an alternative option for patients with fertility requirements.
