Management of presumed benign ovarian tumors: updated French guidelines. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound is the first-line imaging examination for presumed benign ovarian tumors (PBOT) in adult women (Grade A). Ultrasound is sufficient for characterizing a unilocular anechoic cyst smaller than 7cm (Grade A). Magnetic resonance imaging is the recommended second-line investigation for indeterminate masses or masses larger than 7cm (Grade B). Serum CA-125 assay is not recommended for first-line diagnosis in adult women (Grade C). In women with a unilocular anechoic cyst, hormone therapy is ineffective and not recommended (Grade A). Ultrasound-guided aspiration is not recommended (Grade B). Abstention is an option in adult women with a unilocular asymptomatic anechoic cyst smaller than 10cm and no history of cancer (Grade B). If symptoms develop, laparoscopy is the gold standard for surgical treatment of PBOT (Grade A). Conservative surgical treatment (cystectomy) should be preferred to oophorectomy in pre-menopausal women without a previous history of cancer (Grade C). In cases of suspected adnexal torsion, laparoscopic surgical exploration is recommended (Grade B). Conservative treatment or detorsion without oophorectomy is recommended for pre-menopausal women regardless of the estimated torsion duration and macroscopic appearance of the ovary (Grade B). During pregnancy, expectant management is recommended for unilocular asymptomatic anechoic cysts smaller than 6cm (Grade C).
