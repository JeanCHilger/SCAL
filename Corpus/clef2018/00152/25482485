Impact of ultrasound probe pressure on uterine positional displacement in gynecologic cancer patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the uterine positional displacement induced by ultrasound probe pressure on a phantom and address the daily uterine motion in a healthy volunteer.The phantom mimics the female pelvic region. The incorporated organs were subjected to displacement. A total of 42 phantom scans and 16 volunteer scans were acquired. The uterine shifts were measured in three directions.The difference of uterine positional displacements, using pressure versus without pressure on the phantom, was not statistically significant. The daily uterine positional variations of the volunteer were larger than the probe pressure induced displacements.The larger daily uterine shifts of the volunteer outweighed the submillimeter impact of the probe pressure in all directions.
