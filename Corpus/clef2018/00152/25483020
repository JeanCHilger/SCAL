Two-year results of transabdominal ultrasound-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer. To report the preliminary results of transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS)-guided brachytherapy (BT) in cervical cancer.Twenty-nine patients with cervical cancer Stage IB-IVA according to The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging were treated by radical radiotherapy from February 2012 to December 2012. Treatment was composed of WPRT to 50 Gy in 25 fractions and central shielding after 44 Gy in combination with TAUS-guided BT to optimize the total dose (equivalent dose of 2 Gy [EQD2]) to the minimal dose at cervical points (in EQD2 concepts) defined by TAUS â‰¥80 Gy while maintaining low doses to the ICRU report no. 38 bladder and rectal points. The treatment results and toxicity profiles were reported.At median followup time of 19 months (range, 17-27), the local control and disease-free survival rates were 93.1% and 86.2%, respectively. One episode of Grade 3 vaginal toxicity was observed in this followup period. The mean applied doses to cervix, bladder, and rectal points were 82.6, 72.5, and 75 Gy, respectively. TAUS-guided planning reduced bladder (defined as >80 Gy in EQD2) and rectal overdose (defined as >75 Gy in EQD2) in 44.9% and 34.5% of patients, respectively.The 2-year results demonstrate that TAUS-guided BT is feasible and associated with excellent tumor control/toxicity rates in cervical cancer.
