Comprasion of ovarian stromal blood flow measured by color Doppler ultrasonography in polycystic ovary syndrome patients and healthy women with ultrasonographic evidence of polycystic. To compare ovarian stromal artery blood flows measured by Doppler ultrasonography of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients and healthy women with polycystic ovarian image in ultrasonography.Forty-two patients diagnosed with PCOS according to the criteria of 2003 Rotterdam Concencus Conferance on PCOS and 38 healthy volunteers with polycystic ovarian image in ultrasonography were included in the study. Ovarian volumes and ovarian stromal artery blood flows were measured by 3-dimensional (3-D) ultrasonography and Doppler ultrasonography in all patients.In patients with PCOS, ovarian stromal artery pulsatility index (PI) and resistivity index (RI) were found significantly different from healthy women with polycystic ovarian image in ultrasonography (p < 0.05). 3-D ovarian volumes were found significantly higher in patients with PCOS (p < 0.05), and a negative correlation was also obtained between ovarian volumes and ovarian stromal artery resistivity indices.Ovarian stromal artery Doppler examination could have an importance to explain the pathophysiology of PCOS, but there are few publications in the literature about PCOS and the details of ovarian stromal artery Doppler parameters in patients with polycystic ovarian image only. We conclude that Doppler ultrasonography findings of PCOS patients might be helpful in understanding the clinical follow-up and etiology of the disease.
