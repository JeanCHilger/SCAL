Second surgery for recurrent endometriomas is more harmful to healthy ovarian tissue and ovarian reserve than first surgery. To evaluate the excised specimen with histologic analysis and to assess the antral follicle count (AFC) at follow-up. This is to determine whether excisional surgery for recurrent endometriomas is more harmful to ovarian tissue and to the ovarian reserve than first surgery.Prospective controlled study.University hospital.Consecutive patients with pelvic pain and/or infertility undergoing laparoscopic excision of a monolateral ovarian endometrioma for the first time (17 patients) or for recurrence after previous surgery (11 patients).Laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma and ultrasonographic evaluation 3 months after surgery.Cyst wall histologic evaluation (specimen thickness, presence and morphology of ovarian tissue) and evaluation of ovarian reserve with AFC and ovarian volumes of both the operated and contralateral, nonoperated ovary at follow-up.The cyst wall specimen was significantly thicker in the recurrent endometrioma group than in the first surgery group (1.7 ± 0.3 mm vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 mm). Both main components of the cyst specimen (i.e., endometriosis tissue and ovarian tissue) were more represented in the recurrent endometrioma group than in the first surgery group. At sonographic follow-up, the operated ovary had a significantly lower AFC and volume than the contralateral nonoperated ovary in the recurrent endometrioma group, but not in the primary surgery group.Surgery for recurrent endometriomas is associated with evidence of a higher loss of ovarian tissue and is more harmful to the ovarian reserve evaluated by AFC and ovarian volume, if compared with endometriomas operated for the first time. Indications to surgery for recurrent endometriomas should be reconsidered with caution.
