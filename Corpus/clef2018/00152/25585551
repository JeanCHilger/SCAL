The optimal imaging in gynecological oncology. In this review we discuss in detail the advantages and the limitations of the modern imaging techniques to assess the tumour spread in pelvis, abdomen and extraabdominally in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecological cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging yield similar levels of accuracy when utilised for the diagnosis of gynecological cancer and the detection of pelvic spread. Ultrasound is, however, a commonly available, non-invasive, and inexpensive imaging method that can be carried out without any risk or discomfort to the patient. Although increasing evidence shows that transabdominal ultrasound is an accurate technique for the detection of intra- and retroperitoneal tumour spread, it requires experience, adequate equipment and suitable acoustic conditions. Contrast-enhanced computed abdominopelvic tomography remains the most commonly used preoperative imaging modality to assess abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum for extrapelvic tumour spread. Alternatively magnetic resonance imaging can be used in cases of contra-indication of computed tomography. If there is suspicion of extraabdominal tumour spread, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of thorax or positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography is used. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography detects more distant metastases than computed tomography alone. Positron emission tomography with computed tomography is, therefore, the optimal imaging technique for suspected recurrence, particularly if there is suspicion of recurrence but conventional imaging methods have yilded negative results or if salvage surgery is planned.
