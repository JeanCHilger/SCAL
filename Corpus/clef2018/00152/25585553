Ultrasonic staging cervical cancer -a proposal for the standard procedure. To develop guidelines for the ultrasound examination of cervical cancer, including a unified ultrasound terminology.Original paper.Gynecological Oncology Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Masaryk University and General Faculty Hospital Brno, and Gynecological Oncology Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Charles University in Prague - First Faculty of Medicine and General Faculty Hospital Prague.The standard diagnostic algo-rithm for examination of cervical cancer in oncogynecology centers in the Czech Republic is based on published studies, own experience (Oncogynecological Center, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics,1st Medical Faculty, Charles University) and the experiences of a group of ultrasonographers involved in the grant project IGA MZ ÄŒR NT13070 focused on the implementation of an oncogynecological ultrasound into clinical practice. Standard ultrasound examination includes two-dimensional real-time ultrasound examination (sagittal and transverse views). Transrectal or transvaginal ultrasound examination is combined with transabdominal ultrasound. Prerequisites are quality ultrasound equipment, a high frequency microconvex linear probe and abdominal convex and linear probe. The examination is performed by an experienced sonographer (level 2 or 3 according to the recommendations of the Ultrasound division of the Czech Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Czech Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology). Intravenous administration of contrast material or three-dimensional ultrasound examination do not influence accuracy of the examination and is not a prerequisite.Based on the consensus of experienced sonographers and a review of the literature, guidelines were created for ultrasound staging of cervical cancer.
