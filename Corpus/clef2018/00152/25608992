Clinical value of MRI in cesarean scar pregnancy. To explore the clinical value of MRI in diagnosing and treating cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP).A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical manifestations of 54 patients diagnosed with CSP between January 2009 to January 2013 in Peking University Third Hospital. Based on the patients' MRI image and other clinical datas, we did transvaginal operation on patients with CSP1, and transvaginal combined with abdominal operations on patients with CSP2. The intraoperative blood loss, operation time, postoperative hospital stay, and the length of time required for of serum hCG dropping to normal of the patients were analyzed.The average age of the 54 patients was (34±5) years and the average duration of gestation was (56±16) days, all patients' vital sign were stable, the hCG level was 23-142 962 U/L before treatment. Twelve patients were diagnosed with CSP1 by MRI, and 5 of them had focus of 1-2 cm in diameter, the 5 patients' serum hCG level was 436-1 159 U/L and 23-32 days after drug administration, their hCG level returned to normal the other 7 patients had focus of 2.0-4.4 cm in diameter, and their hCG level was 2 218-63 446 U/L, lesion resection was done on the 7 patients by hysteroscope or under B-ultrasound monitor. Forty-two patients were diagnosed with CSP2, and their focus were 1.0-7.1 cm in diameter, and serum hCG level were 23-142 962 U/L. We did bilateral uterine artery occlusion by laparoscope or laparotomy during operation for 22 patients or bilateral uterine artery embolization (UAE) before operation for 20 patients, then we did lesion resections. The blood loss during operation of CSP1 or CSP 2 was 50.1, 267.2 mlMRI is an effective method to conduct clinical treatment in CSP.
