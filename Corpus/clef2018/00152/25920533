Ultrasound findings of incidental adnexal and ovarian lesions on emergency CT scans. A search through 6076 nontraumatic emergency computed tomography (CT) scans of female patients yielded 266 (4.4%) CT scans with an incidentally detected adnexal lesion and ultrasound follow-up within 7days. The population was 87% premenopausal and 13% postmenopausal. Follow-up ultrasound yielded an ultrasound diagnosis 32% of the time. Potentially serious diagnoses included pelvic infection (3%) and suspected malignancy (2%). Benign diagnoses included normal ovaries (16%), hemorrhagic cyst (6%), and benign cyst (5%). The remaining 68% of cases were equivocal, requiring further evaluation.
