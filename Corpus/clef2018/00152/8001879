Preoperative ultrasound assessment of omental spread in ovarian cancer. The accuracy of high-resolution ultrasound in the detection of macroscopic omental metastases was evaluated in 50 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. Ultrasound provided an overall diagnostic accuracy of 83.7%, with a sensitivity of 76.6% and a specificity of 100%. The sensitivity in the diagnosis of diffuse omental involvement was 93.3%. Moreover, the overall diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and positive predictive value of the method increased as the study progressed. In the last 25 cases examined, in fact, these values were 94.7, 90, and 90%, respectively.
