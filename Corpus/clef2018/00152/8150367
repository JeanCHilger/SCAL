Histopathological aspects of pelviscopic hysterectomy. Investigation of histological giant sections and morphometry to confirm a new application of minimally invasive surgery. The present study attempts to confirm the effectiveness of a new method of pelviscopic hysterectomy which maintains the pelvic floor integrity comparable to that in a supracervical uterus amputation. A major advantage of this procedure is that the central portion of the cervix and transformation zone is punched out using a special resection tool for the purpose of removing any potential source of cancer. Thirty-four specimens resected by pelviscopic hysterectomy were investigated using histological giant and serial sections. Morphometrical analysis was performed using MOP-AMO2 (Kontron Instruments). The transitional zone and cervical glands were excised completely with an average security distance of 1.5 cm to the resection margins. No mesonephric remnants were found which might serve as a possible source of adenocarcinoma. Our study confirms that the application of this new technique of pelviscopic hysterectomy is not limited by the development of stump carcinoma while also possessing the additional advantage of maintaining pelvic floor integrity.
