Endometrial thermal coagulation--degree of uterine fibrosis predicts treatment outcome. To study the uterine cavity after thermal endometrial destruction for the treatment of menorrhagia by means of a balloon catheter, the Cavaterm system. To relate the appearance of the uterine cavity to the outcome of the treatment.Fifty-one of the first 60 women treated with balloon endometrial destruction were examined with hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonography 11-28 months after treatment.Patients with minimal or no bleeding after thermal endometrial destruction had more uterine fibrosis than patients bleeding more.The greater the degree of fibrosis of the uterine cavity after balloon endometrial destruction by thermal coagulation, the better the effect on menorrhagia.
