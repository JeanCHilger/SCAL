Bilateral oophorectomy in asymptomatic women over 50 years old selected by ovarian cancer screening. The purpose of this study was to evaluate bilateral oophorectomy in women over 50 years old found to have an adnexal mass using transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) as a mass screening. With TVS a total of 23,451 women without symptoms were examined for ovarian cancer at annual screening for uterine cervical cancer. Two hundred fifty-eight women over 50 years old persistently had abnormal TVS results and 95 women gave informed consent for surgical tumor removal. In the 95 women operated, 7 malignant ovarian cancers were found. Especially adnexal masses which were thought to be benign were treated by laparoscopic surgery.
