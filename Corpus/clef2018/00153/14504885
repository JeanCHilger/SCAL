Placenta previa percreta with urinary bladder and ureter invasion. A 26-year-old woman, with one previous cesarean delivery and two uterine curettage due to incomplete abortion, was admitted to the labor ward with the diagnosis of partial placenta previa at 35 weeks of gestation. Repeat cesarean section was performed due to profuse vaginal bleeding. Placenta previa percreta invading the bladder trigone was confirmed with cystotomy. As bilateral hypogastric artery ligation and supracervical hysterectomy performed were not successful in stopping the profuse bleeding, the abdomen was packed with laparotomy pads. Dilatation of the left ureter was noticed on the second postoperative day. Relaparotomy was performed to remove the pads, and placental invasion of the distal left ureter was noticed. Ureteroneocystostomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the double-J-catheter was removed two months later.
