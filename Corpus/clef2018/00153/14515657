Comparison between hysterosonography and hysterosalpinography in the study of endometrial abnormalities in infertility patients. We compare effectiveness between HSS and HSG for detection of endometrial abnormalities among patient with infertility.Prospective, cross section, comparative.33 patients were studied. HSS and HSG were carried out. The images of both studies were compared, settled down a presumptive diagnosis of normality or abnormality. The analysis included percentage of agreement, coefficient of agreement Kappa, square Ji, reason of verisimilitude.Of 33 studied patients was diagnostics correlation in 17 (52%). The pathologies with more correlation were congenital malformations and submucous miomas, with less correlation were adherences. Other opposing pathologies were polyps and corioplacentary remains. In 9 patients (27%) we find normality in both studies. When comparing the positive studies in each group we don't find differs statistically significant (P > 0.05). The association among both techniques was high (K = 0.70). The reason of verisimilitude of the tests was 98% for HSS and 90% for HSG.Both studies are useful to evaluate the uterine cavity. However histerosonography has bigger sensibility and specificity, besides is a quick, easy, and economic study, with less discomfort and complications than histerosalpingography.
