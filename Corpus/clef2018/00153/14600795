Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with uterine and renal enlargement in a young girl. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the fourth most common childhood malignancy. Uterine involvement with NHL is well described in adults, rare in children and has not been described in the first 2 years of life. While renal involvement in NHL is well recognised, diffuse renal enlargement is an uncommon finding. We report a unique case of B-cell lymphoma of primitive phenotype in a 15-month-old girl with uterine and renal involvement at presentation. We describe the US and MRI features at presentation that helped in the prospective diagnosis of this condition.
