Three-dimensional ultrasonography in gynecology: technical aspects and clinical applications. The aim of this work was to review the technical aspects and clinical applications of three-dimensional ultrasonography in gynecologic imaging.With the use of a computerized database (MEDLINE), articles on three-dimensional ultrasonography were reviewed. Other pertinent references were obtained from the references cited in these articles. In addition, we reviewed our own clinical experience over the past 7 years.Numerous applications of three-dimensional ultrasonography have been reported, including imaging of the uterus, the endometrial cavity, adnexa, and the pelvic floor and color and power Doppler applications. The accuracy of volume calculations and the networking opportunities with three-dimensional ultrasonography have also been reported. Technical problems and limitations of this technique are summarized.Three-dimensional ultrasonography has proved to be a useful imaging tool for clinical problem solving in gynecology, especially in imaging the uterus and uterine cavity.
