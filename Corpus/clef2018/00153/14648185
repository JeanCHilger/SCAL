Asymptomatic pelvic Castleman disease in an infertile woman: case report. Castleman disease is defined as angiofollicular benign lymph node hyperplasia usually found in the mediastinum. Pelvic lymph node involvement is very rare. We now report a case of asymptomatic intrapelvic Castleman disease found by chance in an infertile woman. Transvaginal ultrasonography is very useful in diagnosing the disease. After 7 years of follow-up, the patient is free from recurrence.
