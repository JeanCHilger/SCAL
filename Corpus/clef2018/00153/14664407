Three-dimensional sonography and hysterosalpingosonography in the diagnosis of uterine anomalies. Uterine anomalies implicated in female subfertility, implantation failure and miscarriages can often be detected often by two-dimensional transvaginal (2D TV) ultrasound scanning. When used as a screening test TV ultrasound has provided sensitivity rates of up to 100% about uterine anomalies. Improved depiction has been achieved with the development of hysterosalpingosonography (HSSG). The anechoic interface provided by the saline solution allows the examiner to determine whether an abnormality is intracavitary, endometrial, or submucosal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of 2D TV contrast sonography and 3D TV ultrasound in the diagnosis of congenital uterine anomalies in comparison with their appearance of hysterosalpingosonography findings.
