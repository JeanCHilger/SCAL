Analysis of risk factors associated with uterine perforation by intrauterine devices. To determine the risk factors for intrauterine devices (IUDs) being displaced into the abdominal cavity.This prospective follow-up study was conducted between 1996 and 2002, at the family planning clinic of a referral hospital. All 8343 women who had a copper T-380A IUD inserted underwent ultrasound examination after 1 year. Relative risk estimates and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the risk factors associated with uterine perforation by intrauterine devices.Eighteen uterine perforations occurred during the study, giving an incidence of 2.2 per 1000 insertions. When the time elapsed after the last delivery until IUD insertion is considered, postplacental insertion and insertion after 6 months postpartum were found not to increase the risk of uterine perforation. However, IUD insertion 0-3 months postpartum increased the risk of uterine perforation (odds ratio (OR) 11.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-49.2) as did insertions at 3-6 months postpartum (OR 13.2, CI 2.8-62). Increasing parity decreased the risk (OR 0.04, CI 0.01-0.1) and increasing number of abortions increased the risk (OR 2.1, CI 1.2-3.6).It is safer to postpone IUD insertion until 6 months after delivery.
