Three-dimensional sonographic features of placental abnormalities. To describe three-dimensional (3D) sonographic features of placental abnormalities in utero.A total of 6 cases with placental abnormalities (1 chorioangioma, 1 subchorionic hematoma, 2 placental cysts, and 2 subplacental fibromas) from 22 to 34 weeks of gestation were studied with transabdominal 3D sonography.Placental abnormalities could be easily imaged with both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D sonography however, visualization of the continuity and curvature of structures was more easily accomplished with 3D sonography. In the case with chorioangioma, the thick and rough surface of the tumor was clearly depicted. With the use of color Doppler ultrasound, only a case of chorioangioma was shown to have abundant blood flow within the tumor. In cases with placental cyst and subchorionic hematoma, the wall of the cyst becomes a transparent-like structure, so internal textures can be clearly identified. In the case with subplacental fibroma, the location in relation to the placenta was clearly recognized.These results suggest that 3D sonography has the potential to be a supplement to 2D sonography and color Doppler ultrasound in identifying placental masses and provides a novel means of visualizing placental abnormalities in utero.
