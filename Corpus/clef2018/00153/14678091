Management of postmenopausal bleeding in Sweden: a need for increased use of hydrosonography and hysteroscopy. The objective was to determine how postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is managed in Sweden today, and to relate the findings to a new evidence-based algorithm for the management of PMB.A questionnaire regarding the role of ultrasound and the use of different endometrial biopsy methods in the management of PMB was sent to all 61 gynecologic departments in Sweden.Fifty-nine of the 61 departments (97%) satisfactorily answered the questionnaire. Ultrasound was either always (n = 54, 92%) or most commonly (n = 5, 8%) used in the diagnostic work-up of PMB. In women with endometrial thickness < or =4 mm, 18 of the departments (31%) routinely sampled the endometrium 12 (15%) followed the women with ultrasoundMore than one-third of the gynecologic departments in Sweden never perform hydrosonography to rule out focal lesions or operative hysteroscopy for the removal of such lesions. Hydrosonography and hysteroscopy have a central role in the new guidelines for the management of PMB. Therefore, a need exists to broaden the use of hydrosonography and hysteroscopy.
