Endometrial ossification and infertility: the diagnostic value of different imaging techniques. We present a case of longstanding secondary subfertility caused by endometrial ossification. Of all diagnostic techniques performed, magnetic resonance imaging and hysterosalpingography did not detect the abnormality. Transvaginal ultrasound and computed tomography clearly showed the endometrial pathology. After successful operative hysteroscopy with removal of the osseous tissue, the patient became pregnant spontaneously within 2 months.
