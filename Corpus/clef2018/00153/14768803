Adenomyoma of the small intestine in children: a rare cause of intussusception: a case report. Adenomyomas are hamartomas of the alimentary tract with exceptionally rare localization at the ileum. The case presented here concerns an infant aged 18 months suffering from adenomyoma of the ileum, which was responsible for the development of ileoileac intussusception. Our paper aims at underlining the particularities of this extremely rare entity, while adding the 13th case reported to the international bibliographic references.
