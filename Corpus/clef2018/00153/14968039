Three-dimensional ultrasonographic uterine vascularization and embryo implantation. During the last decade transvaginal color Doppler has played an important role in increasing the understanding of early human development. Although our knowledge of early pregnancy development has recently improved, little is known about the most critical period of human development: implantation. Recent advances in three-dimensional ultrasound have made studies of follicular development, ovulation and uterine receptivity more accurate. Three-dimensional ultrasound facilitates determination of the antral follicle number, ovarian volume calculation and analysis of the intensity of ovarian stromal blood flow in a short time without increasing the patient's discomfort. It is also possible to determine predictors of IVF outcome by three-dimensional ultrasound. Favorable ovarian stromal vascularity is associated with higher number of retrieved oocytes and increased pregnancy rates. The high degree of endometrial perfusion shown by color Doppler ultrasonography and on three-dimensional power Doppler histograms on the day of embryo transfer can indicate a more favorable endometrial milieu for successful in vitro fertilization. Uterine septum is the most common uterine abnormality occurring in infertile women. Three-dimensional ultrasound can be used as a screening method for detection of uterine abnormalities in patients suffering from infertility.
