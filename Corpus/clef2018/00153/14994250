Contribution of sonographic measurement of ovarian volume to diagnosing ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women. The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the current method of sonographic measurement of ovarian volume as a means of diagnosing ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women, in whom an ovarian volume greater than 10 ml is generally considered abnormal. After reviewing the general medical literature, we propose a nomogram of ovarian volume that may be used to determine whether an ovary is abnormal. Furthermore, on the basis of our previous results, we recommend that a cutoff point for ovarian volume that is adjusted to patient age be used to determine whether an ovary is abnormal. We recommend the use of such nomograms in routine clinical practice to assist physicians in identifying abnormality of the ovaries during sonographic examination.
