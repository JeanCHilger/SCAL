Tolerability of transvaginal ultrasonography as an ovarian cancer screening test. To evaluate the acceptability of transvaginal ultrasonography as a screening tool.Prospective survey of women attending for screening within a randomised controlled trial.University Hospital in Teesside.54 women completed a questionnaire immediately after their first transvaginal ultrasound scan.52 of 54 (96%) questionnaires were suitable for full analysis. The women were unlikely to find the scan was painful, 47 vs three (p<0.001), or embarrassing 45 vs five (p<0.001). Women were more likely to find both a smear, 42 vs eight (p<0.001) and a mammogram, 47 vs two (p<0.001) was more uncomfortable than transvaginal ultrasonography.Transvaginal ultrasonography is an acceptable tool for screening for ovarian cancer. It is better tolerated than other screening tools such as cervical smear and mammography.
