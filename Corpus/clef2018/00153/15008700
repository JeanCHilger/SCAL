Repair of the aortico-left ventricular tunnel originating from the right aortic sinus with severe aortic valve regurgitation. A 31-year-old adult with an aortico-left ventricular tunnel (ALVT) arising from the right aortic sinus is reported. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a ruptured sinus of Valsalva with severe aortic valve regurgitation which originated from the right coronary sinus entering the outlet portion of the left ventricular outflow tract. Operation revealed the aortic entrance of the tunnel was above the right coronary sinus. Direct closure of the orifice of the tunnel using three stitches of 4-0 polypropylene with felt and aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed. At 10-month follow-up the patient is asymptomatic and receiving no oral medications except anticoagulants. We believe this to be the oldest case of ALVT managed with AVR.
