A functional connection between inferior frontal gyrus and orofacial motor cortex in human. The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) of humans is known to play a critical role in speech production. The IFG is a highly convoluted and cytoarchitectonically diverse structure, classically forming 3 subgyri. It is reasonable to speculate that during speaking the IFG, or some portion of it, influences by corticocortical connections the orofacial representational area of primary motor cortex. To test the hypothesis that such corticocortical connections exist, electrical-stimulation tract tracing experiments were performed intraoperatively on 14 human subjects undergoing surgical treatment of medically intractable epilepsy. Bipolar electrical stimulation was applied to sites on the IFG, while the resulting evoked potentials were recorded from orofacial motor cortex, using a multichannel recording array. Stimulation of the IFG evoked polyphasic waveforms on motor cortex of both language-dominant and -nondominant hemispheres. The evoked waveforms had consistent features across subjects. The responses were seen in discrete regions on precentral cortex. Stimulation of motor cortex also evoked responses on portions of IFG. The data provide evidence for a functional connection between the human IFG and orofacial motor cortex.
