Clinical application of hysteroscopic electroresection in 775 cases. To review our experience with hysteroscopic electroresection in the treatment of uterine benign lesions.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 775 cases of hysteroscopic surgery in view of the operation time, blood loss, complications and prognosis.The average operation time was 26.5+/-12.3 min and average blood loss 40.1+/-10.5 ml. The outpatients (n=539) were discharged 2 h after operation while the inpatients stayed for 2 or 3 d. Hyponatremia occurred in 1 case, and no death, uterine perforation or electric injury was recorded. During the follow-up for 3 months to 6 years, bleeding relapsed in 17 cases after transcervical resection of the endometrium, and the amenorrhea rate was 88.9%. The recurrence rate of endometrial polyp was 5.5% after electroresection of polyps. Menstruation as normal in all the cases after transcervical resection of the myoma. The uterine cavity became morphologically normal after transcervical resection of the septum without adhesions in the cavities. Improvement of menstruation was achieved in 55 cases (96.5%) after transcervical resection of the adhesion. A patient undergoing transcervical resection of the cervical lesion developed uterine and cervical adhesion 4 months later.For the patients with intrauterine benign diseases, hysteroscopic electroresection provides effective therapeutic options for lessening the invasive injury and decreasing the complications and blood loss.
