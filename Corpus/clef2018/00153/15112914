McCune-Albright syndrome associated with pituitary microadenoma: patient report. McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a rare disorder characterized by the classic triad of precocious puberty, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and caf√©-au-lait spots. Additional endocrine abnormalities may also be present, including hyperthyroidism, growth hormone excess and hyperprolactinemia. The most commonly encountered endocrine dysfunction is gonadal hyperfunction. Gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty is typically the initial manifestation of MAS in girls. Ovarian cysts may be detected on pelvic ultrasound. Our patient was also found to have pituitary microadenoma, evidenced by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging.
