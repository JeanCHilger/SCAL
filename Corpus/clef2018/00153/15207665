Endometrial thickness after misoprostol use for early pregnancy failure. To assess if there was any potential relationship between endometrial thickness and final treatment outcome in women successfully treated with misoprostol for a first trimester anembryonic gestation, embryonic demise or fetal demise.Eighty women were treated with up to two doses of misoprostol 800 microg vaginally for early pregnancy failure. Subjects were scheduled to return 2 (range 1-4), 7 (range 5-9) and 14 (range 12-17) days after treatment. Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed at each follow-up visit.The median endometrial thickness at each of the follow-up visits for women who had expelled the gestational sac was 14 mm, 10 mm, and 7 mm, respectively. The endometrial thickness at the first follow-up visit exceeded 15 mm in 20 subjects (36%) and 30 mm in four subjects (7%). Only three women had a suction aspiration for bleeding after documented expulsion. The endometrial thickness for these women was 11, 13, and 14 mm at the first follow-up visit.There is no obvious relationship between increasing endometrial thickness and the need for surgical intervention in women treated with misoprostol for early pregnancy failure.
