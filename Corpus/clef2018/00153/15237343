Three-dimensional digital rotation angiography for embolization therapy of uterine leiomyomas: first results. To evaluate three-dimensional rotational digital subtraction angiography (3D-RDSA) in the embolization of the uterine artery in the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas (fibroids).Eight women with complex pelvic vessel anatomy caused by large fibroids were embolized using 3D-RDSA. The raw data were sent to an external workstation, and video files with a resolution of one image/3 degrees and a scan range of 180 degrees in a surface-shaded display mode were produced. The primary goal was to assess an image intensifier angulation for the optimal visualization of the origin of the uterine artery. In addition, the intervention parameters were compared with those of 48 patients with standard angiography.The analysis revealed no single angulation that can be recommended for standard angiography. No statistical differences were found between both groups concerning fluoroscopy time, dosage area product and amount of administered contrast medium (p > 0.05).It can be stated that 3D-RDSA is a feasible method that facilitates the catheterization of the uterine artery even in patients with complex pelvic vessel anatomy, with the potential to reduce the radiation exposure and the amount of administered contrast medium in future embolization therapy of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
