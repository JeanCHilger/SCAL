The TramEC "double cross" mesh: a new experience for repairing groin hernia. Our experience with 280 patients. The purpose of this work is to provide a detailed account of a new technique for open prosthesis hernioplasty, a technique that makes use of a pre-shaped TramEC mesh made of polypropylene monofilament and created by the author. Specific descriptions are offered in regard to the shape of the mesh, the hernioplasty technique and the physiopathologic characteristics.From 2000 to 2001, a total of 280 hernioplasties were performed with the TramEC technique. A follow-up of these patients was done after 1 week, after 3 months and after 1 year. An ecography of the groin was executed on all patients after 1 week in order to verify the presence of seromas.No recurrence was observed in 55.7% of patients examined after 1 year. Two patients (1.2%) experienced chronic but not debilitating pain.The author believes that with the TramEC mesh a precise overlap is formed between the mesh itself and the floor of the groin canal, thus creating the conditions required for avoiding empty spaces in order to favour the fibroplasias and amalgamation of tissues: basic parameters in avoiding recurrences. In addition, the mesh not only repairs the hernial defect but also strengthens the internal inguinal ring by virtue of its "double cross" structure. Because of the device's anatomical shape and the simplicity of the technique, we optimise the operation in terms of time and reproducibility.
