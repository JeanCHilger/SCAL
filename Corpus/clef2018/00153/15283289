Clinical analysis of 58 cases intraoperative image-guidance in nasal endoscopic surgery. To evaluate the availability and our experience of intraoperative image-guidance in endoscopic nasal surgery.Fifty-eight cases of endoscopic nasal surgery with intraoperative image-guidance were retrospectively reviewed, including 39 cases of chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyp 3 cases of necrotizing maxillary sinusitisThe preoperative preparatory time would take 10-20 minutes, including coordination, head holder localization, conventional instrument registration. In our cases, the localization accuracy between 3-D image landmarks of navigation system and actual anatomical landmarks was less than 1.5 mm. The optic nerve and other anatomical points could be orientated accurately in intraoperative procedures. No complication occurred.Nasal endoscope combined with image-guidance systems provides accurate anatomical localization of nasal cavity, sinuses and anterior skull base with enlarged operation field. It is possible for surgeons to observe the surrounding important anatomical structures during endoscopic nasal surgery. It could increase the effectiveness and decrease surgical complications, especially in complicated cases.
