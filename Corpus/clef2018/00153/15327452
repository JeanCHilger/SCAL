Angular pregnancy. Angular pregnancy, a type of cornual pregnancy, is a rare obstetric complication that can be life-threatening. In this situation, the embryo is implanted in the lateral angle of the uterine cavity, medial to the uterotubal junction and round ligament. Angular pregnancy must be distinguished from interstitial pregnancy, in which the embryo is implanted lateral to the round ligament. The report presented here describes a case of angular pregnancy that was diagnosed by endovaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Laparoscopy can be useful for guiding dilatation and curettage in angular pregnancies, and may circumvent the need for invasive surgery or hysterectomy.
