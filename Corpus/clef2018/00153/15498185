Ultrasound criterion for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome: ovarian stroma/total area ratio. To evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasound parameters of ovarian stroma area (S), total ovarian area (A) and S/A ratio for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).The A, S and S/A ratio were determined by use of transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, and serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) were assayed in 58 PCOS patients and 60 controls. Of 58 PCOS patients, 32 underwent hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique (HGCT).Patients with PCOS showed significantly higher ovarian S and S/A ratio when compared to the control groups (P = 0.045, P = 0.001, respectively). S/A ratio and S were significantly related to HGCT results and T.The S/A ratio and S are of value in diagnosis of PCOS.
