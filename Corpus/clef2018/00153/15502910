Ultrasound in urogynecology. Radiologic procedures such as lateral cystography have been substituted by ultrasound in urogynecology. The techniques are standardized and reproducible. Ultrasound is also useful for evaluating the bladder neck (funneling), the urethra (diverticula) and the paraurethral tissues (vaginal cysts, vaginal fibroids). The technique is limited in patients with genital prolapse beyond the hymenal ring. Advantages include the avoidance of x-rays and catherization.
