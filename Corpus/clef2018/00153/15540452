Improved structures of maximally decimated directional filter banks for spatial image analysis. This paper introduces an improved structure for directional filter banks (DFBs) that preserves the visual information in the subband domain. The new structure achieves this outcome while preserving both the efficient polyphase implementation and the exact reconstruction property. The paper outlines a step-by-step framework in which to examine the DFB, and within this framework discusses how, through the insertion of post-sampling matrices, visual distortions can be removed. In addition to the efficient tree structure, attention is given to the form and design of efficient linear phase filters. Most notably, linear phase IIR prototype filters are presented, together with the design details. These filters can enable the DFB to have more than a three-fold improvement in complexity reduction over quadrature mirror filters (QMFs).
