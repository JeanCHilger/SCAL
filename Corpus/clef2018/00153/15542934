Effects of combined estriol/pravastatin therapy on intima-media thickness of common carotid artery in hyperlipidemic postmenopausal women. Several studies show that 17beta-estradiol (E2) has protective effects on atherosclerosis in the arterial wall in postmenopausal women. Little information is, however, available regarding the effect of estriol (E3) on atherosclerosis. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of E3 alone and combined E3/pravastatin therapy on intima-media thickness (IMT) of common carotid artery in postmenopausal women.Thirty-three postmenopausal women were allocated to four groups: daily treatment with E3 (2 mg) alone (E3 group, n = 10), pravastatin (10 mg) alone (pravastatin group, n = 6), combined treatment with E3 (2 mg) and pravastatin (10 mg E3/pravastatin group, n = 7) and untreated control group (n = 10). All women attended the Kobe University Hospital once a year for routine gynecological and ultrasonographic examinations for the evaluation of atherosclerosis.A significant decrease in IMT was noted in the E3/pravastatin group compared with that in the untreated control group (p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in the reduction rate of IMT in the pravastatin group, E3 group and untreated control group.The combined E3/pravastatin therapy appeared to retard the progression of atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women.
