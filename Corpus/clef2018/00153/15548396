Metformin therapy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. To determine the clinical, biochemical, hormonal, and ultrasonographic effects of 6 months of metformin therapy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and compare with pretherapy parameters.50 Indian women with PCOS, 25 unmarried and 25 married, infertile women, were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. After a baseline workup, including body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR), Ferriman Gallwey hirsutism scoring, menstrual pattern, levels of fasting insulin, lipids, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), serum gonadotropins, estradiol (E2), testosterone, androstenedione, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), patients were given 1000 gm of metformin for 6 months and then reevaluated.In 41 of 50 women who completed treatment, significant improvement in BMI, WHR, menstrual cyclicity (80.5%), ovulation rate (66%), and pregnancy rate (28%) was noted. Statistically significant decrease in lutenising hormone (LH) and LH/FSH ratio with an increase in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were seen. Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Chol) increased along with a decrease in total cholesterol. Improvement was noted in ovarian volume, stromal thickness, and number of follicles. There was no change in hirsutism, acne, levels of other sex steroid hormones, and lipids.A 6-month course of metformin therapy may improve menstrual cyclicity and fertility in women with PCOS.
