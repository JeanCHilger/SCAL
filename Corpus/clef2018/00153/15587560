Hemangiopericytoma of the ovary. We report on a case of hemangiopericytoma in the pelvis occurring in the left ovary. The tumor was found in a 33-year-old woman with left iliac fossa pain. The lesion was well demarcated and had a diameter of approximately 10 cm. It was surgically resected. Computed tomography and ultrasound revealed an aspecific lesion with round lesion with a smooth contour and intratumoral necrosis. To our knowledge, radiological features of hemangiopericytoma of the ovary have not been reported yet.
