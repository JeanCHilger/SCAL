Gestrinone in the treatment of uterine leiomyomata: effects on uterine blood supply. Gestrinone has been shown to reduce uterine volume and stop bleeding in women with uterine leiomyomata. In the present study, we demonstrated a reduction in the volume of uterine myomas and in the uterine artery blood perfusion over a 6-month period of gestrinone administration in premenopausal women.
