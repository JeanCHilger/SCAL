Electron capture dissociation of polypeptides in a three-dimensional quadrupole ion trap: Implementation and first results. The adverse influence of the radio frequency (RF) voltage on electrons has been the main obstacle for the implementation of electron capture dissociation (ECD) in three-dimensional quadrupole ion traps (3D QITs). Here we demonstrate that the use of axial magnetic field, together with the injection of low-energy (<5 eV) electrons, in the beginning of the positive RF semi-period achieves trapping of electrons for a period of time comparable with the semi-period duration. Importantly, the energy of the electrons remains low during most of the trapping period. With this technique, which we call "magnetized electrons, in-phase injection" (MEPhI), ECD and other ion-electron reactions have become possible in a 3D QIT. Initial ECD results, including single-scan data, were obtained with dications of Substance P. The observed secondary fragmentation of ECD fragments indicates that the trapped electrons are still somewhat hotter than desired.
