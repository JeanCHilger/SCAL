Hepatic hydatid cyst ruptured in the peritoneum. Romania is an endemic region for hydatid cyst and has a high incidence of hepatic hydatid cysts. If the intrabiliary rupture is the most frequent complication encountered, rupture in the peritoneum is rare, with exact data not available. Between 1993-2002 160 patients with hepatic hydatid cysts were operated. Six of them had an intraperitoneal ruptured cyst. Ultrasound raised the suspicion of hepatic hydatid cyst ruptured in the peritoneum in 4 cases, in one case the intact cyst migrated in the lower abdomen were it was mistaken for an ovarian cyst. After a thorough lavage with hypertonic serum, the parasite was evacuated, the pericyst partially removed and the cavity collapsed with non-absorbable sutures. The postoperative course was uneventful. Prophylaxis with benzimidazolic drugs started days 2-3 PO. At a follow-up between 1-4 years no peritoneal hydatidosis was detected. In the intraperitoneal ruptured hydatid cyst the hypertonic serum and benzimidazolic drugs can be useful in preventing peritoneal seedings.
