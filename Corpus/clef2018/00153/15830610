Asymptomatic bladder cancer evaluated by gynecological sonography. In the past few years, ultrasonography has become the most widespread and easily available diagnostic procedure in gynecological practice. the high-frequency transvaginal probe provides a detailed visualization of the reproductive organs and the urinary bladder. however, in spite of this generally applied examination procedure it's rare when the transvaginal ultrasonography is used to identify bladder tumor. the urologist rather use transabdominal ultrasound for the detection of bladder tumors. the authors report a case in which gynecological sonography contributed to the screening and evaluation of an asymptomatic bladder cancer.
