CT colonography using different reconstruction modi. Performing computed tomography (CT) colonography, we compared different reconstruction modi for the detection of colorectal polyps.The CT data of 48 patients using 16-slice helical CT were analysed in axial slices, virtual-endoscopy and colon-dissection modus.The sensitivity (specificity) for the detection of colonic polyps was 94% (80%) if using "colonic-dissection" tool and 89% (80%) if using "virtual-endoscopy" tool. The difference between the virtual endoscopy and colon dissection, considering polyps up to 4.9 mm, was significant.Reconstruction software colon dissection improves the sensitivity of CT colonography.
