Updated recommendations on ultrasonography in urogynecology. Ultrasound is a supplementary, indispensable diagnostic procedure in urogynecology perineal, introital, and endoanal ultrasound are the most recommended techniques. The position and mobility of the bladder neck can be demonstrated. In patients undergoing diagnostic work-up for urge symptoms, ultrasound occasionally demonstrates urethral diverticula, leiomyomas, and cysts in the vaginal wall. These findings will lead to further diagnostic assessment. The same applies to the demonstration of bladder diverticula, foreign bodies in the bladder, and bullous edema. With endoanal ultrasound, different parts of the sphincter ani muscle can be evaluated. Recommendations for the standardized use of urogenital ultrasound are given.
