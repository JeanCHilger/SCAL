Ovarian endometrioma and infertility: when not to treat?. Ovarian endometrioma is not infrequently encountered in infertile patients. Its etiopathogeny, its relations with attributed symptoms and the recommanded treatment to apply, are still debated. Various therapeutic tools are available, such as abstention, ultrasonographically guided aspiration and drainage, and surgery. Each option carries specific advantages and disadvantages. Ultrasonographically guided aspiration bears infectious risks. Among various proposed surgical procedures, cystectomy appears to offer the best performances. Results of IVF are slightly or not altered, neither by an ovarian endometrioma, nor by previous surgery, except in case of iterative surgery or if operated lesions were very severe. Laparoscopic surgery is still the first line treatment in many cases. Abstention can be applied in particular circumstances. Ultrasonographically guided aspiration needs to be further evaluated.
