Ultrasonographic assessment of urethral condyloma acuminatum in men. To evaluate the value of ultrasonography in diagnosing urethral condyloma acuminatum (CA) in men.Twenty-two male patients, aged 36 +/- 19, diagnosed as with urethral CA based on history and clinical symptoms underwent ultrasonography and urethroscopy. The patients were asked to micturate to distend the urethra. The posterior urethra was detected by transrectum approach. Transperineal scans were performed to image the bulbar urethra, scrotal urethra and penile urethra. The sonographically positive results were compared with the pathological results.Eighty-three vegetations were found in the anterior urethra of seventeen patients, and eighty-one vegetations were diagnosed as CA by pathology, of which 1.2% were polyp shape, 38.3% papillary shape, and 60.5% cauliflower mass. Sonourethrography was an accurate predictor of papillary shape and cauliflower mass however, it was difficult to differentiate between polyp shape vegetation and crystal.Sonourethrography is a sensitive and accurate tool not only for primary diagnosis of but also for follow-up of urethral CA in men.
