Harmonizing indications for emergency radiological examinations for adults. The "Collégiale des radiologistes" of the Paris public hospital system (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, AP-HP) has participated since 1998 in a collaborative quality improvement program for the 49 radiology departments. They work together with the AP-HP college of emergency physicians on one part of this program, which focuses on emergency radiologic work-ups. Analysis of the dysfunctions in this sector underlined the lack of agreement between clinicians and radiologists on the examinations required.The aim of this project was to establish operational and consensual guidelines for physicians, radiologists and emergency teams for the use of diagnostic radiology in emergency situations in adults.The working group of radiologists and emergency physicians drafted this document, largely from documentary sources. A large panel of physicians validated the draft during successive review sessions, and the two colleges then approved them.The guidelines are presented in 3 columns: clinical situations, quality aims (type of imaging, time within which the examination should be performed) and comments. The clinical situations were regrouped by anatomical area or system: head, neck, thorax, heart, gynecology, abdomen, urinary, non-traumatic bone and spine disorders, multiple trauma, and isolated trauma of the spine and limbs and of the head, trunk, abdomen, and pelvis.These guidelines based on consensus within the institution make it possible to harmonize the requests for and practices of radiologic examinations in emergency situations. Their implementation is an integral part of the ongoing development of operating agreements between the radiology and emergency departments.
