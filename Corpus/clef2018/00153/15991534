The significance of Doppler flow and anamnesis in the diagnosis of fallopian tube cancer. By following Doppler flow of the small pelvis with laboratory parameters and anamnesis data, we obtained more precise diagnostic possibilities for timely discovering of malignant processes in adnexal region and fallopian tube. By following patients who had come for routine check ups, prompted by a positive family history for malignant processes, resistant indexes of blood vessels in the adnexal region and vascularisation pattern were determined. Out of 78 women observed in the postmenopausal period with diagnosed adnexal masses, we found two cases of fallopian tube cancer. Resistance indexes ranged between 0.20 and 0.30 during a one-month period. Hystopathological analysis pointed to fallopian tube cancer. Besides Doppler flow, only patient history of amber extract use was significant. By CA 125 marker analysis, we found an increased value but not signifiant enough. Both patients had a positive family history according to the female hereditary line.
