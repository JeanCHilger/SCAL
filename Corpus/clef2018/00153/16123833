Recurrent ectopic pregnancy following ipsilateral partial salpingectomy. An unusual case of a second ipsilateral ectopic pregnancy following a partial (proximal) salpingectomy for ectopic gestation is presented in a 32-year-old woman with a history of secondary infertility. This occurred in the distal remnant of the left fallopian tube. It is postulated that the pregnancy was conceived following migration of spermatozoa or the fertilised egg from the endometrial cavity to the distal remnant of the left fallopian tube or by passage of spermatozoa through the intact right fallopian tube and the pouch of Douglas. Consequent to the maintenance of a high index of suspicion of ectopic pregnancy, there was early diagnosis and expedient surgical intervention on both occasions.
