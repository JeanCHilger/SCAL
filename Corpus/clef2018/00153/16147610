The gynaecological management of women on tamoxifen: a national questionnaire survey. Tamoxifen is the standard adjuvant treatment for women with breast carcinoma, decreasing the incidence of contralateral disease. However, the risk of endometrial cancer is increased. To establish current gynaecological management of women receiving tamoxifen in the United Kingdom we conducted a postal questionnaire of consultant gynaecologists, enquiring about frequency of, and methods used to investigate women on tamoxifen. Ninety-five per cent investigate women on tamoxifen only if they are symptomatic. Pelvic ultrasound and endometrial sampling are used for first-line investigation by 68.7%. Interpreting ultrasound findings, endometrial thickness is the parameter regarded as most important. An endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm is regarded abnormal by 47.8% of respondents and of 4 mm by 23.6%. As there is no consensus of opinion regarding normal values for endometrial thickness, further data are required to ensure consistency when interpreting ultrasound reports of women on tamoxifen.
