Diagnosis and treatment of esophageal leiomyoma. To summarize the experience of diagnosis and treatment of esophageal leiomyoma.Clinical data of 52 patients with esophageal leiomyoma were analyzed from 1993 to 2002.About 54% patients in this group had difficulty of food intake. The diagnostic accuracy of gastrointestinal barium meal series, computed tomography, gastric endoscope and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for esophageal leiomyoma was 64% 44% 27% and 90% respectively. All patients received operation, resection of esophageal leiomyoma by videothoracoscopy (VAS) and endoscope were performed in 6, 9 patients respectively. The remaining 37 patients received regular open operation,in whom 32 cases received enucleation of esophageal leiomyoma, 5 cases received partial esophageal resection and esophageal-gastric anastomosis. No serious complications occurred except only one case needed operation again because of bleeding.EUS is an effective method for diagnosing esophageal leiomyoma. VAS and endoscopic treatment should be considered for suitable cases in order to reduce the trauma.
