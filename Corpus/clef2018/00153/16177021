Two cases of uterine septum with intrauterine device. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been used worldwide for contraception for decades. They are easily deployed, inexpensive and one of the most reliable contraceptive methods. Though ease of placement is such that they are frequently placed by midwives in the outpatient setting in developing countries, some complications due to its misplacement occasionally can occur. We present two cases with unknown uterine septum in which IUDs were placed without prior ultrasound examination of the pelvis. We conclude evaluation of the pelvis by ultrasound prior to placement of IUDs in women with a history of breech presentation, preterm labour, or recurrent miscarriage may be helpful in identifying uterine anomalies that make IUD placement unsuitable.
