Early prophylactic cervical cerclage for hypoplastic cervix following exposure to DES in utero. Presentation of a prophylactic cerclage technique, placed in the beginning of second trimester of the pregnancy, derived from McDonald cerclage and adapted to hypoplastic cervix following exposure to DES in utero.Prospective study including 20 pregnant patients exposed to DES in utero and presenting a hypoplastic cervix. Study of the location of the cerclage tape in the cervix and of changes in cervical length (before and after cerclage) assessed by physical examination of the cervix and by transvaginal ultrasonography.The cervix was longer after cerclage as shown by physical examination and by ultrasound. The tape was localized near the internal cervical os, its posterior portion nearer the internal cervical os than its anterior portion.This easy-to-perform technique of cerclage of hypoplastic cervix allows the tape to be localized near the internal cervical os without colpotomy and without use of the transabdominal approach, while allowing vaginal delivery.
