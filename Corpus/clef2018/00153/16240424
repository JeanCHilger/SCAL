Ultrasonographic evaluation of a uterine malignant melanoma presenting as a large pelvic mass. The uterus is an extremely rare location for a primary or metastatic melanoma. We describe the ultrasonographic appearance of a malignant melanoma of the uterus presenting clinically as a large mass in a 78-year-old woman. Transabdominal sonography revealed a solid uterine mass measuring 13 x 11.5 x 8.5 cm with inhomogeneous echotexture and bright internal echoes. The tumor showed a diffuse spread inside the uterine corpus, and the endometrium was not demonstrated ultrasonographically.
