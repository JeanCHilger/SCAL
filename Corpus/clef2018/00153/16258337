The short and funneling cervix: when to use cerclage? The diagnosis of cervical incompetence remains extremely difficult because there is no diagnostic test available prior to, during or after pregnancy. This review will summarize the latest publications on the use of transvaginal ultrasonography to identify women at high risk of preterm delivery and the use of cervical cerclage in these women.Cervical length is not only inversely related to the risk of preterm delivery but also inversely related to the risk of intrauterine infection in women with preterm labor. Furthermore, previous history of preterm delivery is related to the risk of preterm delivery. Cerclage trials on women with short cervical length present conflicting results both in low and high-risk populations. Assessment of risk factors and obstetric history remain important in the diagnosis of cervical incompetence. Women at high risk of preterm delivery due to cervical incompetence should be followed-up with transvaginal measurements of cervical length. Only a minority of these women will develop a short cervical length and will consequently be at high risk of preterm delivery.A combination of assessment of risk factors, obstetric history and follow-up of cervical length enables us to identify women who benefit from a cervical cerclage.
