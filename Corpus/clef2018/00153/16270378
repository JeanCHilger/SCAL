Evaluation of endometrial receptivity during in-vitro fertilization using three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound. To compare sonographic endometrial characteristics in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles between women who conceive and those who do not.Thirty-five women undergoing IVF treatment participated in the study. Using three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasound, we assessed endometrial patterns, volume and vascularization, after follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation but before human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (referred to hereafter as 'after FSH stimulation') and again on the day of oocyte retrieval.The pregnancy rate was 37% (13/35). After FSH stimulation, 29 of the 35 women had a triple-line endometrial pattern, compared with five out of 35 on the day of oocyte retrieval. In those who had a triple-line pattern after FSH stimulation the pregnancy rate was 44.8% (13/29) and it was 0% (0/6) in those with a homogeneous pattern (chi-square test, P = 0.039). If a triple-line pattern was present on the day of oocyte retrieval the pregnancy rate was 80.0% (4/5), whereas if the pattern was homogeneous the pregnancy rate was 30.0% (9/30) (P = 0.032). There were no differences between those who conceived and those who did not in endometrial thickness, volume or vascularization on either day examined. Endometrial volume decreased significantly after hCG injection in women who conceived, but not in those who did not conceive. In both groups endometrial and subendometrial vascularization decreased after hCG injection, while the endometrial thickness remained unchanged.The existence of a homogeneous endometrial pattern after FSH stimulation seems to be a prognostic sign of an adverse outcome in IVF, while a triple-line pattern after FSH stimulation and a decrease in endometrial volume appear to be associated with conception.
