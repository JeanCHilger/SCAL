Lobular carcinoma of the breast metastatic to the uterus in a patient under adjuvant anastrozole therapy. This is the first report of breast carcinoma metastatic to the endometrium in a patient on adjuvant anastrozole therapy. We report a case of metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast in a 63-year-old patient on adjuvant anastrozole therapy for 8 months. She was asymptomatic and metastatic endometrium was diagnosed after transvaginal ultrasound revealed suspicious findings along with elevated Ca 15-3 levels. As further work up showed no other metastatic sites her uterus was taken out along with her ovaries and pelvic lymph nodes. Uterine metastases should be kept in mind in asymptomatic patients on anastrozole therapy.
