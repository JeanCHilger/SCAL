Screening of patients after colectomy: virtual colonography. Virtual colonography is a powerful new method of imaging the entire colon and is useful to assess polyps and diagnose colon cancer. We evaluated virtual colonography in the postoperative screening of patients who had colon cancer.Fifty-three patients were examined with virtual colonography 12 to 48 months postoperatively. Forty-four patients had received segmental colectomy with restoration of the gastrointestinal tract, and nine patients underwent abdominoperineal resection and permanent colostomy. After proper cleaning of the colon and distention with air, spiral computed tomographic examination of the abdomen with a slice thickness of 5 mm (table speed [TS] 10 mm, reconstruction interval [RI] 2.5 mm) was performed in the supine and prone positions (including intravenous contrast medium infusion). Images were transferred to a separate workstation (Philips Easy Vision) for postprocessing, three-dimensional rendering, and endoluminal viewing.Eleven recurrences (16.41%) were identified in 10 patients by virtual colonography, but one recurrence was missed. Conventional colonoscopy was incomplete in six cases, and two patients with colostomy refused colonoscopy. In these eight cases (15%), virtual colonoscopy was completed without problems. A second tumor in one patient who had received abdominoperineal resection was demonstrated by virtual colonography, but conventional colonoscopy failed to demonstrate the lesion. Liver metastases were identified in only one patient.Virtual colonography seems to provide a good alternative in the follow-up of patients after colectomy. The technique is effective in the diagnosis of locoregional recurrences and distant metastases and is well accepted by patients, and results are equal to those of the conventional colonoscopy.
