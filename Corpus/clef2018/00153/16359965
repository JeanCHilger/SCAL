Müllerian-inhibiting substance reflects ovarian findings in women with polycystic ovary syndrome better than does inhibin B. To investigate Müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as relationships to ovarian morphology, levels of inhibin B, and other reproductive hormones.Prospective clinical study.Academic endocrinology centers in Palermo, Italy and New York.Forty-six women with PCOS, recruited on the basis of the classic criteria of chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism, and 25 age-matched ovulatory controls.Fasting blood was obtained in all subjects in the early follicular phase (days 5-6) after spontaneous or induced menses (in PCOS), and transvaginal ultrasounds were performed.Assessment of values for luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), estradiol (E2), inhibin B, MIS, fasting insulin, and the calculated quantitative sensitivity check index (QUICKI), as well as assessments of ovarian volume and blood flow.Women with PCOS had higher LH, T, and A higher insulin and lower QUICKIMeasurements of MIS reflect ovarian findings in PCOS better than levels of inhibin B and are more frequently elevated. However, MIS lacks sensitivity for use as a diagnostic tool in PCOS.
