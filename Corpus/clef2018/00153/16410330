Assessment of the ovarian volume, number and volume of follicles and ovarian vascularity by three-dimensional ultrasonography and power Doppler angiography on the HCG day to predict the outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether ovarian blood flow is related to embryological parameters and whether it could be a predictor of outcomes of IVF/ICSI.Eighty infertile women underwent ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins after a long protocol with GnRH agonists. The ovarian volume (OV), number of follicles (NF) and follicular volume (FV) of all follicles >10 mm and vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization-flow index (VFI) were obtained by three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography and power Doppler angiography (PDA) on the day of HCG administration. These parameters were tested for their relation with IVF laboratory parameters.The OV, FV, VI, FI and VFI were significantly greater in the pregnant group. The NF and FV were the only independent predictors of the number of oocytes retrieved, mature and fertilized, and the number of embryos developed and their cumulative embryo score. Nevertheless, the number of grade 1 embryos depends on the NF and the VI. The ovarian FI and the number of transferred grade 1 embryos can predict gestation in 76% of IVF patients. A low FI and non-grade 1 embryo transferred are also associated with an increased pregnancy loss.3D ultrasonography and PDA allow for an easier ovarian assessment in IVF cycles. The predictive value of IVF outcome suggests a high clinical usefulness of this new technique.
