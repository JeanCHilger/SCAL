Diagnostic difficulties of pelvic splenosis: case report. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman who presented with chronic lower abdominal pain. Her past medical history included a splenectomy due to abdominal trauma. Ultrasound examination revealed four pelvic tumors which, upon laparotomy, were found to be the result of splenosis. Approximately 100 cases of splenosis have been reported but only a minority of them have been published in the gynecological literature. Our case indicates that those involved in pelvic scanning (even of asymptomatic women) and/or treating those complaining of lower abdominal pain or presenting with pelvic tumors should be aware of splenosis as a possible diagnosis.
