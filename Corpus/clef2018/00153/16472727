Rapidly growing bilateral ovarian cystadenoma in a 6-year-old girl: case report and literature review. Benign ovarian neoplasms originating from epithelial tissue are common tumors in adult women. However, they are rarely seen in the pediatric population, especially in the first decade of life.We report a case of a 6-year-old, premenarchal girl, previously healthy, with frequent micturition lasting 3 days prior to the first examination, without discomfort or pain. Laboratory analyses of blood and urine showed no abnormalities. Repeated ultrasonographic examinations revealed bilateral, cystic, rapidly growing ovarian masses. Cysts were surgically removed, with preservation of normal ovarian tissue, and histopathologic findings showed a serous cystadenoma of both ovaries.
