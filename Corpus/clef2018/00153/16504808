Diagnostic imaging of myomas. As treatment options become less invasive and more sophisticated it is imperative that benign myomas be distinguished from potential malignant conditions without falter. The radiologic-pathologic correlations have been integral to our ability to characterize and to localize uterine leiomyomas with accuracy. TVUS remains the standard assessment tool. Its usefulness may be enhanced by SHG or transabdominal ultrasound in certain circumstances however, it falls short in its ability to map multiple myomas or those in large volume uteri. MRI has become ultrasound's complement and far exceeds ultrasound's technical limitations in precise fibroid mapping and characterization.
