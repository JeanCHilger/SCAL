Tibolone treatment of diabetic postmenopausal women: clinical and laboratory safety parameters. To determine the clinical-laboratory safety profile of tibolone treatment in postmenopausal women with NIDDM.a prospective, longitudinal, open and uncontrolled study involving 24 postmenopausal women with NIDDM sequentially treated with placebo (6 months) and 2.5 mg/day tibolone (6 months). Clinical evaluation, anthropometric parameters, biochemical and hormonal measurements, and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed at baseline and after 6 (time 1) and 12 months of follow-up (time 2). Statistical analysis was performed by repeated measures analysis of variance, with the level of significance set at 5%.Side effects were present only during tibolone use (headache and mastalgia in 8.3% and genital bleeding in 16.6%). There was a significant reduction in the climacteric symptoms evaluated by Blatt-Kupperman index [22.2 +/- 7.1 (baseline) vs. 13.6 +/- 6.7 (time 1) vs. 3.1 +/- 3.3 (time 2) p< 0.0001]. After the tibolone use, we observed significant reductions in % body fat, diastolic arterial pressure, aminotransferases, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. There were no significant variations in systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, or in the glycemic, glycosylated hemoglobin, urea, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. Ultrasonographic evaluation showed no significant changes in uterine volume or endometrial thickness.Short-term treatment with tibolone showed a good clinical-laboratory safety profile in postmenopausal women with NIDDM.
