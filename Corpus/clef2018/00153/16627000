Primary ovarian abscess. Diagnosis and therapeutic approach. Primary ovarian abscess is a rare infection. A new case has led us to carry out a literature review in order to optimize the treatment. Exceptionally isolated, primary ovarian abscess usually belongs to the postoperative complications. Nevertheless, its etiopathogenies are numerous. The symptoms are often poor therefore the diagnosis is difficult to establish. The curative treatment must associate surgery and antibiotherapy. Even if laparoscopic surgery is the first line treatment in many cases, laparotomy remains the choice procedure. Ultrasonographically-guided evacuation has to be further evaluated. Preventive treatment is of major importance.
