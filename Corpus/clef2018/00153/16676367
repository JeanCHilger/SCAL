Assessment of changes in endometrial and subendometrial volume and vascularity during the normal menstrual cycle using three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound. To describe changes in endometrial and subendometrial volume and vascularity during the normal menstrual cycle using three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasonography.Fourteen healthy volunteers, 24-44 years old with regular menstrual cycles, underwent serial transvaginal 3D power Doppler ultrasound examinations of the uterus on cycle day 2, 3 or 4, then daily from cycle day 9 until follicular rupture and 1, 2, 5, 7 and 12 days after follicular rupture. Endometrial and subendometrial volume (cm3), vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated using the VOCAL (Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis) software.Endometrial and subendometrial vascularity indices increased throughout the follicular phase, decreased to a nadir 2 days after follicular rupture and then increased again during the luteal phase. Endometrial and subendometrial volume increased rapidly during the follicular phase and then remained almost unchanged during the luteal phase.Substantial changes occur in endometrial volume and vascularization during the normal menstrual cycle. There is the potential for 3D power Doppler ultrasonography to become a useful tool for assessing pathological changes associated with female subfertility and abnormal uterine bleeding.
