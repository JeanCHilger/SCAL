The combination of increased ovarian volume and follicle number is associated with more severe hyperandrogenism in German women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The prevalence and relevance of polycystic ovaries (PCO) in German women with polycystic ovary syndrome has not been evaluated. This retrospective study included 212 PCOS patients (mean age 28 years) diagnosed by the NIH-criteria and consecutively recruited since 2003. Clinical features including anthropometric variables and the degree of hirsutism, family history, menstrual cyclicity as well as endocrine biochemical parameters were recorded. In addition, 3-h oral glucose tolerance testing for indices of insulin resistance and glucose metabolism was performed in each patient. Transvaginal ultrasound was used to detect polcystic ovaries, defined as the presence of at least one ovary > 10 ml or with at least 12 follicles of 2-9 mm diameter. In this German PCOS cohort, PCO were identified in 166 women (78%). Women with PCO (PXO+) had significantly higher LH/FSH ratios (median 2.1 vs. 1.7) and IGF-1 levels (median 182.5 vs. 160.5 ng/ml) compared to patients without PCO (PCO-). In addition, a significantly higher prevalence of acne (50% vs. 33%) and higher hirsutism scores (median 9 vs. 7) were found in PCO+ patients. Testosterone levels and the free androgen index (FAI) correlated significantly with ovarian volume and the number of ovarian follicles. Also, a subgroup of PCO+ women with a combination of increased ovarian volume and follicle number had higher testosterone levels (median 3.1 vs. 2.1 nmol/l) and FAI (median 7.6 vs. 4.5) compared to women with increased follicle count but normal volume. No differences were found in metabolic parameters or insulin resistance indices. PCO are common finding in German PCOS women. PCO appear to be associated with a more pronounced hyperandrogenemia, especially when both ovarian volume and follicle number are increased.
