Scrotal trauma: management strategy. Scrotal traumas are rare. Most are blunt traumas caused by a direct blow on the scrotum. The testicle is projected against the pubic arch. Early surgical investigation has considerably improved the prognosis of testicular trauma, and reduced orchidectomy rate. ULtrasonography has also improved the management of scrotal trauma. But there is a controversy about accuracy of ultrasonography in predicting presence or absence of testicular disruption. ULtrasonography should not challenge the dogma regarding systematic surgical investigation of hematocele and enlarged scrotum. Long term outcomes (testicular atrophy, infertility) may be more frequent as previously thought and should be detected.
