Basal ovarian cysts and clomiphene citrate ovulation induction cycles. To evaluate the effect of simple basal ovarian cysts in patients undergoing infertility treatment with clomiphene citrate. To evaluate the effect of clomiphene citrate on pretreatment simple ovarian cysts.Prospective cohort trial of 84 infertility patients undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate. Patients with basal ovarian cysts of 10 mm or greater (n = 42) were compared with patients without ovarian cysts (n = 42). The main outcome measure was ovulation determined by menstrual cycle day 21 progesterone level. Each patients with an ovarian cyst was also evaluated for persistence or resolution of the cyst in association with ovulation and cyst size. Pretreatment and posttreatment transvaginal ultrasound examinations were performed on all patients.Demographic data were similar among the groups. The mean ovarian cyst size was 17.4 +/- 5.8 mm. Patients in the ovarian cyst group were significantly less likely to ovulate (80.9% versus 97.6%, P < .05), but did not differ in pregnancy rate compared with patients without baseline ovarian cysts (4.8% versus 11.9%, P = .43). Persistent ovarian cysts occurred in 36.7% of the patients. The initial size of the cyst did not predict cyst persistence.According to these data, basal ovarian cysts significantly reduce ovulatory events in patients treated with clomiphene citrate.II-2.
