Diploid partial mole with neonatal survival--a case report. Partial mole is a gestational neoplastic disorder with a reported incidence of 0.005 - 0.01% of all pregnancies. The karyotype in such cases is usually triploid, baring a few exceptions. The diploid partial mole is an extremely rare entity with only few cases being documented in literature. The fetal outcome in such cases is usually poor. We describe a case of partial mole, which terminated at 28 weeks with a live diploid male fetus with good neonatal outcome. Follow-up showed no progression to malignant gestational trophoblastic disease.
