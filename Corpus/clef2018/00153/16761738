Image-directed percutaneous FNAC of ovarian neoplasms. Fine needle aspiration of ovarian neoplasms is a relatively less frequented area of diagnostic aspiration cytology. Hence, an attempt has been made in the present study to evaluate the current status of Image-directed percutaneous needle aspiration in ovarian neoplasms and to assess its value and limitations in the diagnosis and management of ovarian neoplasms. The present study involves 105 cases of ovarian neoplasms, which were assessed by ultrasound-guided FNAC. Only those cases with adequate material on aspiration and availability of cellblock or biopsy material following FNAC for correlative histopathological study were included in the study. The diagnostic accuracy of ovarian neoplasms in the present study was 89.85%, with a false negative rate of 4.76%. Considering the rapidity and reliability of the procedure with its added advantages like cost-effectiveness and increased patient acceptability, it can be concluded that image-guided FNAC holds a key position in the diagnosis and management of ovarian neoplasms.
