Transvaginal ultrasonography, sonohysterography and hysteroscopy for intrauterine pathology in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. To test the diagnostic accuracy of sonohysterography and hysteroscopy in detection of endometrial polyps and submucous myomas.Retrospective review of the fifty six records of the patients with abnormal uterine bleeding who had positive sonohysterography and underwent operative hysteroscopy performed between June 2001 and December 2004. Exclusion of six patients with incomplete records, giving a total of fifty records included in the present study, using pathological reports as a gold standard.The two most common pathologies were 58% of endometrial polyps and 42% of submucous myomas. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values and accuracy for diagnosis of endometrial polyps by sonohysterography were 92.59%,72.73%, 80.65%, 88.89% and 83.67% and by hysteroscopy were 93.10%, 84.0%, 87.10%, 91.30% and 88.89% for submucous myomas by sonohysterography were 88.89%, 93.55%, 88.89%, 93.55% and 91.84% by hysteroscope were 90.91%, 87.50%, 83.33%, 93.33% and 88.89% respectively.The diagnostic accuracy for endometrial polyps and submucous myomas by sonohysterography are equal to hysteroscopy.
