Not all ovarian cysts in young woman are benign: a case series and review of the management of complex adnexal masses in young women. While ovarian cancer is a disease that predominately affects postmenopausal women, up to 13% of affected patients are indeed less than 45 years of age. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the non-specific nature of symptoms and a lack of specific and accurate diagnostic tests, that is, CA125 and ultrasound. In premenopausal women these issues are compounded, further reducing the likelihood of an accurate and early diagnosis. It is important for gynaecologists to have a high index of suspicion and appropriately investigate symptomatic patients and interpret test results critically. Not all ovarian cysts in young women are benign, and a low threshold for surgical evaluation is warranted.
