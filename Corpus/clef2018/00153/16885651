Screening for ovarian cancer. The efficacy of ovarian cancer screening remains to be proven. Advances in ultrasound and tumor marker technology, combined with complex statistical analysis have facilitated 2 large ongoing randomized controlled trials of screening which are powered to determine the impact on mortality. Serum proteomics seems to be a promising area for biomarker discovery, but requires more rigorous validation before it can be used in clinical trials. Current screening tests, clinical trials in the general and high-risk populations, screening acceptability and costs are reviewed in this article.
