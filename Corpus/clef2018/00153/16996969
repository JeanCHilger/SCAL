Giant cardiac fibroma. A 29-year-old woman who presented with persistent ventricular premature beat during her delivery was referred to us. Her cardiac echocardiography showed a giant tumor located in the posterior wall of the left ventricle. She had no symptoms of heart failure. Partial resection of the mass was safely conducted using cardiopulmonary bypass. The histopathologic finding was fibroma. She has been doing well 6 years after operation. Periodic echocardiography has showed no growth in this tumor.
