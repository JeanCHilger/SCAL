Novel technique for testicular salvage after combat-related genitourinary injury. We report a case of traumatic testicular injury resulting in significant loss of both tunica albuginea and seminiferous tubules. Secondary to the substantial tissue loss, our approach to surgical reconstruction required a certain degree of creativity. The injury was managed by creating a single midline testis with two distinct blood supplies. The use of this novel technique was necessary to achieve closure of the tunica albuginea. This case demonstrates the importance of the use of nontraditional reconstructive maneuvers to avoid orchiectomy, given the potential long-term health issues regarding infertility and androgen production.
