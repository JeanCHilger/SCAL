Functional state of kidneys and upper urogenital tract in patients with intraligamentary ovarian cysts in pre and postoperative periods during the treatment with spasmolytics. 25 patients with different types of intraligamentary ovarian cysts were observed. The main diagnostic method of the patients with intraligamentary cysts was ultrasound Dopplerometry of arteries iliaca interna, uterine and renalis using the following indicators: pulsatory index, resistance index, maximal blood speed. Determination of these indicators was conducted before operation, on 10 and 30 days after operation. In post-operation period we found that in the side free from the tumor's development, all doppleromethric indices were substantially normalised.
