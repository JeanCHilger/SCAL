Saline infusion sonography in women with abnormal uterine bleeding: an update of recent findings. To inform about new developments concerning saline infusion sonography, especially in women suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding.The diagnostic accuracy of saline infusion sonography has been established before the period of this review however, recent papers support the high diagnostic accuracy and conclude saline infusion sonography is able to replace diagnostic hysteroscopy in the evaluation of the uterine cavity. The use of gel instead of saline as distension medium and the introduction of new three-dimensional inversion rendering techniques enhances the visualization of the endometrium which may improve the diagnostic accuracy of saline infusion sonography. A simple, feasible and seemingly cost-effective method of saline infusion sonography-based guided endometrial biopsy has been developed. The technique may allow saline infusion sonography based polypectomy. A classification of submucous fibroids has been proposed in order to allow more accurate, saline infusion sonography-based, preoperative selection of fibroids suitable for hysteroscopic resection.The development of saline infusion sonography-based guided biopsies allows saline infusion sonography to compete with vaginoscopic operative hysteroscopy. Additional comparative trials are needed in order to finalize the decision about the proper method of the assessment of the uterine cavity.
