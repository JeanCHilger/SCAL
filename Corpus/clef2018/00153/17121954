Variable echogenicity as a sonographic sign in the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian mucinous tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the "variable echogenicity" sign in the preoperative sonographic diagnosis of ovarian mucinous tumors.Variable echogenicity was detected sonographically in different compartments of 8 adnexal multilocular masses. This finding was correlated with the final histologic results.All 8 tumors were mucinous cyst adenomas. In 3 of them, borderline malignancy was present.The sonographic detection of variable echogenicity in the contents of an adnexal multilocular cyst strongly suggests a mucinous tumor.
