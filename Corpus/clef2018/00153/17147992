Abnormal uterine bleeding: the role of ultrasound. Abnormal uterine bleeding is an important clinical concern and accounts for much medical intervention. This article presents an ultrasound-based approach to help exclude endometrial carcinoma and identify the source of bleeding for better clinical management. Saline infusion sonohysterography can help to triage patients to (1) no anatomic pathology, (2) globally thickened anatomic pathology that may be evaluated with blind endometrial sampling, or (3) focal abnormalities that must be evaluated under direct vision.
