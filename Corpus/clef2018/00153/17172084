Pre-operative differentiation of pediatric ovarian tumors: morphological scoring system and tumor markers. To investigate the importance of morphological scoring systems in differentiation of ovarian tumors in childhood.Morphological assessment using DePriest's index was performed for all patients with histopathological confirmation of ovarian tumor, with evaluation of tumor markers, from January 1997.Fifty-three girls (age range 13 months to 19 years) were surgically treated for 59 ovarian tumors, including six bilateral. All lesions with cystic appearance on ultrasonography were benign, 23 of 35 semisolid, and four of ten solid tumors were also benign. Stage of malignant disease was as follows: stage I, ten stage II, twoUltrasonographic assessment with morphological analysis recommended by DePriest and Ueland is a very useful procedure for differentiating benign from malignant ovarian tumors in children. Tumor markers and endocrinological investigation are also useful for preoperative evaluation.
