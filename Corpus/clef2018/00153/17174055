CT colonography: results and limitations. Meta-analysis of data from studies of CT colonography suggests that it has excellent per-patient average sensitivity and average specificity for detection of adenomatous polyps and cancer. However, while its potential as a screening test is undoubted, there are several current limitations that will need to be overcome before it can be considered seriously by health policy makers. These revolve around issues of generalisability, which is inhibited most by a lack of trained observers and access to CT scanners, and a paucity of data relating to cost-effectiveness. Whether offering CT colonography as an alternative to competing strategies will genuinely enhance compliance also needs further and more detailed attention.
