Isolated torsion of the fallopian tube in a 14-year-old adolescent. Torsion of adnexa is relatively common, but isolated torsion of the fallopian tube is rare. It should be considered in all adolescents who present with acute pelvic pain. Laparoscopy or laparotomy is often necessary to establish the diagnosis. This report focuses on a 14-year-old girl with isolated tubal torsion who presented with acute pelvic pain.A 14-year-old adolescent was admitted to our hospital because of acute right-sided abdominal pain without vomiting and diarrhea. Pelvic ultrasound showed an adnexal mass. Conservative treatment was given but did not improve her condition. Emergent laparoscopy was performed due to persistent symptoms, which later confirmed the diagnosis of isolated torsion of the fallopian tube. Pathology showed hemosalpinx with necrosis.Isolated torsion of the fallopian tube is an uncommon event, especially in adolescents. It must be kept in mind whenever a young girl presents with low abdominal pain and pelvic mass on ultrasound. Prompt laparoscopic intervention may allow for early diagnosis, treatment and preservation of the tube if possible.
