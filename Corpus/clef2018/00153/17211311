Value of 3D-4D sonography in fetal and gynecological ultrasound examination: principles and indications. Three-dimensional ultrasound has become an essential tool for visualization of fetal structures in the past few years. The recent improvements in transducers and signal processing provide new information, particularly in obstetrics and gynecology sonography. The present paper will present the most recent advances in volume acquisition and presentation modes followed by results of fetal organ visualization in normal and abnormal cases as well as applications in gynecology.
