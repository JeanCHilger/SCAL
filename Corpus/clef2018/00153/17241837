Surgical management of intra-abdominal mislocated intrauterine devices. We report on our experience in surgical treatment of patients with intra-abdominal intrauterine devices (IUDs).A total of 10 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis was based on gynecologic examination, transvaginal sonography, and abdominal X-ray.All of the IUDs were inserted by trained midwives, either in the puerperal period (n=3) or within 1 year after puerperium (n=7). Five women were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, three were pregnant and two complained of pelvic pain. Eight patients were managed by laparoscopy, whereas laparotomy was required in two. Abscess formation was present in two cases. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients.A missing string during gynecologic examination is the first sign of an intra-abdominal IUD in all cases. Transvaginal sonography should be combined with abdominal X-ray to reach a definitive diagnosis. Laparoscopic treatment may be appropriate in most of the cases.
