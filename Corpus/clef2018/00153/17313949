Three-dimensional hysterosonography versus hysteroscopy for the detection of intracavitary uterine abnormalities. To compare 3-dimentional hysterosonography (3-DHS) and diagnostic hysteroscopy for the evaluation of intrauterine lesions.In this prospective study 124 women with suspected intrauterine abnormality on 2-D ultrasonography or on hysterosalpingography were scheduled to undergo hysteroscopy, 3-DHS, and 3-D power Doppler (3-DPD) examination. However, 3-DHS could not be performed in 3 of the women because of cervical stenosis. The sensitivity and specificity of 3-DHS and 3-DPD were compared with those of hysteroscopy.Of the 121 women found to have an intracavitary abnormality, 20 had polyps, 11 had myomas, 2 had Müllerian duct anomalies, and 6 had synechiae on hysteroscopy. There was agreement between hysteroscopy and 3-DHS in 19 of the polyp cases, 11 of the myoma cases, 2 of the Müllerian anomaly cases, and 4 of the synechiae cases. Examination with 3-DHS and 3-DPD reached a sensitivity of 91.9% and specificity of 98.8%, with a positive predictive value of 97.1% and a negative predictive value of 96.5%, respectively.Examination with 3-DHS and 3-DPD both allows for accurate assessment of intrauterine abnormalities.
