Sonographic diagnosis of a round ligament cyst in the inguinal area. We report a case of a 37-year-old female with a mesothelial cyst of the round ligament presenting as a palpable mass. The mass appeared sonographically as a fusiform structure with several cystic anechoic areas and was misdiagnosed preoperatively as herniation of the right ovary.
