Rare case of benign urachus tumor during pregnancy. We described rare case of urachus fibromyoma at the 11th week of pregnancy. Urachus tumor was occasionally revealed during ultrasonographic examination. It was shown in previous studies that 90% of urachus tumors are malignant, so was decided on artificial abortion, by the method of manual vacuum aspiration. After the abortion patient was sent to the urologic clinic, and after biopsy was revealed diagnosis of fibromyoma of urachus. It was performed operation of partial cystectomy with excision of urachus tissue up to umbilicus. The decision of artificial abortion performance in these cases is disputable.
