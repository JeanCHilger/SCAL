Simple tools for assessment of ovarian reserve (OR): individual ovarian dimensions are reliable predictors of OR. To determine the association between individual ovarian dimensions, advancing age, and declining ovarian reserve (OR) in an infertile population.An ongoing prospective observational study.Academic infertility practice.Sixty-nine premenopausal women presenting for the evaluation and management of infertility.Transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the ovarian dimensions (length, width, and overall diameter in cm) and evaluation of the OR status by measuring serum levels of FSH and E(2) in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.Relationship of the individual ovarian dimensions to age (years) and OR (reflected by historical maximal FSH levels).A statistically significant decrease in three ovarian size parameters accompanied advancing age (ovarian width, r = -0.30 ovarian length, r = -0.24Single ovarian dimensions are reliable predictors of advancing age and declining OR status in premenopausal infertile women. The magnitude of this association is most robust for the ovarian width.
