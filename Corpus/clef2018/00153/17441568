Ancillary diagnostic imaging is useful if there is atypical evidence of appendicitis. Patients with an atypical presentation of acute appendicitis may benefit from ancillary diagnostic imaging, especially CT. The literature shows a decrease of the number of negative appendectomies with this approach, and other causes are diagnosed in about one third of the patients. In addition, costs were reduced. Ultrasonography is a good alternative in pregnant women and in women with suspected gynaecological pathology.
