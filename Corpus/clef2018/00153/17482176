Diagnosis of Mullerian anomalies in adults: evaluation of practice. To evaluate the circumstances associated with the diagnosis of Mullerian anomalies in adults.Retrospective observational study.University hospital.All patients with Mullerian anomalies referred for evaluation.All patients underwent radiologic and operative diagnostic workup using ultrasonography, or ultrasonography and hysteroscopy, and in some cases laparoscopy.Clinical symptoms and radiologic investigations leading to the diagnosis. Mode and number of investigations before the diagnosis, and the time since the initial symptoms to the final diagnosis.One hundred ten patients were diagnosed with Mullerian anomalies: 73 septate uteri, 20 bicornuate uteri, 10 uterine hypoplasia, 4 unicornuate uteri, and 3 with Mayer- Mayer-Rokitansy-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome. The circumstances leading to the diagnosis were infertility (33.6%), repeat miscarriage (18.2%), ultrasonography during pregnancy (12.7%), pregnancy complications during last trimester (11%), abnormal examination (8.2%), and miscellaneous causes (16.3%). Up 50% of patients complained of gynecologic signs before the appropriate diagnosis. Radiologic diagnosis required two complementary imaging techniques in 62% of patients and more than two in 28%. The correct diagnosis was established in only 40% of cases before hospitalization. Most of the anomalies were initially diagnosed at hysterosalpingography and ultrasonography. The mean time between the first imaging examination and the diagnosis in a specialized department was 6.7 (+/-7.1) months.The diagnosis of Mullerian anomalies in adults is often made at the time of conception and obstetric complications. There is a tendency toward the use of multiple imaging techniques and this delayed the diagnosis.
