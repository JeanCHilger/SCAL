Does 3D ultrasound offer any advantage in the pretreatment assessment of ovarian reserve and prediction of outcome after assisted reproduction treatment? This study compared the predictive value of the antral follicle count (AFC) measured from stored 3D data by three methods including a '2D equivalent technique' and two 3D techniques, the 'multiplanar view' and 'rendered inversion mode', as a test of ovarian reserve and treatment outcome.One hundred consecutive subjects aged<40 years with basal FSH levels<12 IU/l underwent transvaginal ultrasound in the early follicular phase prior to their first cycle of assisted reproduction treatment. The relationship between the AFC made with each method and outcome was evaluated.The AFC as measured by the 'inversion mode' method (r=0.777) showed a higher, but statistically insignificant, correlation with the number of retrieved oocytes than did comparable measurements made with the '2D equivalent' (r=0.665) and '3D multiplanar' (r=0.687) techniques. Multiple regression analysis showed the AFC measured using any of the three methods was a significantly better predictor of the number of oocytes retrieved (P<0.001) than age, FSH or ovarian volume. AFC was not predictive of non-conception regardless of the measurement technique.For predicting ovarian respone and outcome, the AFC measured using techniques based on 3D ultrasound offers no statistically significant advantage over a measurement which is limited to information available with conventional 2D imaging.
