Compensating for bone interfaces and respiratory motion in high-intensity focused ultrasound. Bursts of focused ultrasound energy a thousand times more intense than diagnostic ultrasound have become a non-invasive option for treating cancer, from breast to prostate or uterine fibroid, during the last decade. Despite this progress, many issues still need to be addressed. First, the distortions caused by defocusing obstacles, such as the skull or ribs, on the ultrasonic therapeutic beam are still being investigated. Multi-element transducer technology must be used in order to achieve such transcranial or transcostal adaptive focusing. Second, the problem of motion artifacts, a key component in the treatment of abdominal lesions, has been shown significantly to influence the efficacy and treatment time. Though many methods have been proposed for the detection of organ motion, little work has been done to develop a comprehensive solution including motion tracking and feedback correction in real time. This paper is a review of the work achieved by authors in transcranial high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), transcostal HIFU and motion compensated HIFU. For these three issues, the optimal solution can be reached using the same technology of multi-element transducers devices able to work both in transmit and receive modes.
