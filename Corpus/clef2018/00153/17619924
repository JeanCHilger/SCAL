Virtual hysteroscopy by multidetector computed tomography. Currently accepted techniques that evaluate the uterus and female reproductive system in the infertility workup algorithm include hysterosonography, hysteroscopy and hysterosalpingography. Based on high speed multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) which can acquire high-quality volumetric data of the pelvic region in a single brief scan, MDCT virtual hysteroscopy is proposed as a developing, non-invasive alternative diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of uterine pathology and other gynecologic disorders. Findings of the technique are illustrated.
