Broad ligament lipoma presenting as a pelvic mass: a case report. Pelvic masses can arise from gynecologic, nongynecologic, intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal structures. A retroperitoneal lipoma presenting as an adnexal mass is exceedingly rare.A 27-year-old, healthy woman had pelvic discomfort and was found to have pelvic organ displacement to the left side and a right adnexal mass. Ultrasonography revealed an echogenic adnexal mass, and computed tomography suggested a lipoma. At laparotomy a large, right, retroperitoneal broad ligament lipoma was found and excised completely without difficulty.Gynecologists should be aware of the possibility of retroperitoneal broad ligament lipomatous tumors presenting as adnexal masses.
