Ultrasound of ovarian sex-cord tumor with annular tubules. Sex-cord tumors with annular tubules (SCTAT) have been extensively reported in the literature with great emphasis on the cytologic and histologic appearance. The association of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) with bilateral benign, typically multifocal, small, and sometimes calcified SCTAT has also been reported. We present and describe the sonographic findings of bilateral SCTAT in a patient with PJS.
