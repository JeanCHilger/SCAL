Clear ovarian cyst aspiration guided by vaginal ultrasonography. Thirty patients with clear ovarian cysts underwent aspiration guided by vaginal ultrasound. In 23 cases a complete aspiration was accomplished. In 4 only partial aspiration was possible, and in the remaining 3 failed aspiration led to surgery. Histological findings correspond to retroperitoneal lipoma and mucinous cystadenoma (2 cases). Malignant cells were not detected in the fluid of any of the 27 aspirates. Eight of the ten patients presenting with abdominal pain experienced a relief following aspiration. Recurrence of the cyst occurred in 12 cases (40%) with significantly smaller dimensions (P less than 0.01). Vaginal ultrasound aspiration of clear cyst is easy and safe and can be considered as an outpatient procedure.
