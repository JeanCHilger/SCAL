Endoscopic surgery in patients with borderline tumor of the ovary: a follow-up study of thirty-five patients. To study the long-term outcome of 35 patients after endoscopic surgery of ovarian borderline tumor.Descriptive study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Outpatient clinic.Thirty-five women with histologically proven ovarian borderline tumors underwent adnexal surgery by laparoscopy in an outpatient clinic.We report a series of 41 patients treated by endoscopic surgery for borderline tumors of the ovary, 35 of whom were followed up for 2 to 12 years after surgery.Of a total of 3138 patients referred for endoscopic surgery to treat ovarian tumors, 7 were found to have cancer, and 41 were found to have borderline tumors. The borderline tumor was diagnosed before surgery by vaginal ultrasonography in 45.7% of patients, during surgery in an additional 22.9%, but only by postoperative histologic study in 31.4% of patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications in the patients with borderline tumor, and all have remained healthy for the period of their follow-up.Provided a strict management protocol is followed, endoscopic surgery is safe and effective for the treatment of borderline tumors of the ovary.
