Ovarian reserve in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who underwent laparoscopic ovarian drilling. To evaluate ovarian reserve assessed by hormones and sonography in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD).This was a cross-sectional study. Twenty-one PCOS women undergoing LOD were enrolled in the study (the LOD group). Their day-3 anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, antral follicles count (AFC) and summed ovarian volume representing ovarian reserve were compared with those of PCOS women who did not undergo LOD (the PCOS group) and those of normal ovulatory women (the control group).There were no differences in age and body mass index between groups. AMH levels seemed to be lower in the LOD (4.60 +/- 3.16 ng/ml) than in the PCOS (5.99 +/- 3.36 ng/ml) groups, but did not reach statistical significance. Day-3 FSH levels were significantly higher and AFC was significantly lower in the LOD than in the PCOS group. AMH levels, AFC and summed ovarian volume were significantly greater, but FSH was significantly lower, in the PCOS group compared with the control group. There were no differences in inhibin B levels between groups.This study showed that ovarian reserve assessed by hormonal levels and sonography seems to be lower in the LOD than in the PCOS group. The PCOS women both with and without LOD had significantly greater ovarian reserve than the age-matched controls having normal ovulatory menstruation.
