Inadequate office endometrial sample requires further evaluation in women with postmenopausal bleeding and abnormal ultrasound results. To determine whether further histologic assessment can be omitted after office sampling produced a nondiagnostic specimen.Data were retrieved from a prospective cohort study of 913 women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. This study was limited to women with an endometrial thickness either 5 mm or greater or that could not be measured, and in whom an endometrial biopsy performed in the office yielded nondiagnostic results.Endometrial thickness was nonreassuring or unknown in 516 women, of whom 403 (78.1%) underwent office endometrial sampling. In 66 women the amount of tissue obtained was not sufficient for pathologic characterization. Further investigation revealed an endometrial malignancy in 3 of these 66 women and atypical hyperplasia in 1.In women with postmenopausal bleeding and a nonreassuring transvaginal ultrasound evaluation, a nondiagnostic office endometrial sample does not rule out endometrial cancer and further endometrial sampling is advisable.
