Establishing a mean postvoid residual volume in asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. To estimate mean postvoid residual (PVR) volumes among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women without significant lower urinary tract or pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.Patients presenting for well-women encounters were offered study participation. Women with a history of urinary incontinence greater than twice per week, urinary retention, symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, or neurologic disorders were excluded. Pelvic relaxation, if present, was characterized according to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system. Within 10 minutes of spontaneously voiding, PVR volume was assessed with bladder ultrasonography.A total of 96 patients were enrolled mean age was 60+/-11 years. The majority (80%) were postmenopausalMost asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women had a PVR volume less than 50 mL, which was unaffected by multiple factors that were thought to potentially affect bladder function. Establishing "normal" volumes in this population may aid in developing recommendations regarding appropriate bladder function and retention criteria for women who are symptomatic or those who have had pelvic floor surgery.
