Giant abdominal hydatid cyst masquerading as ovarian malignancy. Hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is a common parasitic infection of the liver. Disseminated intra-abdominal hydatid disease may occur with the rupture of the hydatid cyst into the peritoneal cavity, producing secondary echinococcosis. Occasionally, the cyst may not rupture, and instead, enlarge, thus mimicking gross ascites or huge ovarian tumours. We present a 30-year-old woman with a giant intra-abdominal hydatid cyst communicating with the liver, and discuss the management of her case.
