Cervical ectopic pregnancy case report: findings for the bedside sonographer. The evaluation of first trimester vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain is an important task for the emergency physician. The early identification of an ectopic pregnancy can help prevent significant morbidity and mortality for patients seeking emergency care. The increased use of bedside sonography by the emergency physician in the evaluation of these patients requires an increased knowledge about the variants and their appearance on sonogram. We present the case of a patient found to have a cervical ectopic pregnancy. A discussion of the diagnosis and management, as well as the findings on bedside sonogram are presented.
