Subjective effect of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery for uterine fibroids. We treated 69 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids using a magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) system. Our objective was to determine the clinical outcome of MRgFUS, focusing on symptom improvement, with emphasis on the time and extent of improvement.Patients who would have been otherwise offered conventional surgery were considered for eligibility. They were asked to report their symptom severities before and after treatment on the same query form. The questionnaire, given 6 months after treatment, included a question asking when the patients' symptoms started to improve. Their fibroids were classified into three types according to the signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images: type 1, low intensity as skeletal muscle, type 2, intermediate intensity, lower than myometrium but higher than skeletal muscle and type 3, high intensity, the same as or higher than myometrium.No severe adverse events occurred in any of the patients. Seven patients required alternative treatment after MRgFUS, with five of them having type 3 fibroids. Mean symptom scores were all reduced after MRgFUS, regardless of the symptom types. Frequent urination improved first, while heavy bleeding took longer to resolve than the other symptoms.MRgFUS is an effective and safe method for treating symptomatic uterine fibroids, especially for type 1 and type 2 fibroids. Type 3 fibroids, however, are difficult to treat using the current MRgFUS system.
