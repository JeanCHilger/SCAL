Three-dimensional ultrasonographic diagnosis and hysteroscopic management of a viable cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. Implantation of conception material within a cesarean section scar is an extremely rare form of ectopic pregnancy with devastating complications, such as uterine rupture and intractable bleeding. Both 2-D and 3-D transvaginal ultrasonographic devices are used adequately for precise diagnosis, but there is still a lack of consensus concerning management strategies. No therapeutic modality is suggested to be entirely efficacious and safe for preserving uterine integrity. We present here a 29-year-old woman with vaginal bleeding and a gestational sac with a viable embryo of 6 weeks of age that was implanted in a cesarean section scar. Serum beta-hCG levels were 16 792 mIU/mL. Following an unsuccessful treatment course of systemic methotrexate, the patient underwent operative hysteroscopy. Minimally invasive hysteroscopic resection of the ectopic gestational mass without major complication appears to be an alternative therapeutic approach with minimal morbidity and preservation of future fertility.
