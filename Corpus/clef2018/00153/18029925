Sonography of various cystic masses of the female groin. The purpose of this presentation is to review the pathologic spectrum of cystic masses that may involve the female groin region, with a correlation of the lesions with their sonographic appearance.We reviewed the sonographic findings of palpable groin masses showing a cystic pattern in female patients. The groin region is best depicted with a high-frequency (7.5- to 12-MHz) linear array transducer. Color Doppler sonography and an extended field of view are helpful in the differential diagnosis of variable groin masses.There are various cystic masses involving the female groin, such as round ligament cysts, varicosities of the round ligament, inguinal herniation of the ovary, cystic lymphangiomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, abscesses, and pseudoaneurysms.Sonography with color Doppler imaging is helpful for the differential diagnosis of the pathologic spectrum of cystic masses involving the female groin.
