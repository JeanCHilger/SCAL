Ultrasonographic endometrial thickness after medical and surgical management of early pregnancy failure. We sought to compare endometrial thickness after misoprostol or dilation and curettage (D&C) for early pregnancy failure and to assess the predictive value of endometrial thickness for subsequent D&C after misoprostol treatment.In a randomized trial of early pregnancy failure management, 491 women were treated with misoprostol vaginally, and 161 were treated with D&C. Transvaginal ultrasonography was planned for 2 and 14 days after misoprostol treatment, and 14 days after D&C.The mean endometrial thickness 14 days after treatment was 9.0 mm for the misoprostol group and 6.9 mm for the D&C group, (difference 2.1 mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-3.2). After the ultrasonograms 2 and 14 days after misoprostol, 13 (3.8%) and 12 (3.2%) women, respectively, subsequently underwent D&C. Women requiring D&C after successful expulsion had significantly greater endometrial thickness than those who did not at 2 days (mean difference 5.2 mm, 95% CI 1.6-8.8) and 14 days (mean difference 5.5 mm, 95% CI 2.3-8.8) after misoprostol. However, endometrial thickness was a poor predictor of subsequent D&C. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for endometrial thickness at 2 and 14 days were 0.71 and 0.73, respectively. Regardless of cutoff values used for predicting subsequent D&C, endometrial thickness had a positive predictive value of 40% or less.The difference in endometrial thickness between misoprostol treatment and D&C for early pregnancy failure is not clinically significant. Endometrial thickness is not a useful predictor of subsequent surgical intervention after successful expulsion of the gestational sac after misoprostol for early pregnancy failure.ClinicalTrials.gov,www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00177333I.
