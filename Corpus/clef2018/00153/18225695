Pregnancy achieved following IVF-ET after surgery for infertility with perforate transverse vaginal septum and incomplete septate uterus: case report. Transverse vaginal septum is a rare congenital anomaly. Imperforate transverse vaginal septum causes marked clinical symptoms, and is diagnosed at a young age in most cases. Perforate transverse vaginal septum is difficult to detect due to the absence of symptoms. In this study, we report a case of a 33-year-old infertile female with a perforate transverse vaginal septum and incomplete septate uterus who had wished to bear a child for over ten years, and consulted our hospital. Transverse vaginal septum was considered to be an etiological factor for infertility. After surgery for transverse vaginal septum, in vitro fertilization achieved pregnancy.
