Cervical length measurement by translabial sonography in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes: can it be used to predict the latency period or peripartum maternal infection? To determine the relationship between the translabial cervical length and the latency period or peripartum maternal infection in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).Fifty-five women with a singleton gestation and PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks who had a translabial ultrasound performed within 24 hours of membrane rupture were included in the study. Translabial sonography was performed to assess cervical length and funneling. Ultrasound results were not made available to the managing obstetricians.The mean gestational age at PPROM in our cohort was 29.7 +/- 2.8 weeks. The mean translabial cervical length was 2.8 +/- 1.1 cm, and the median latency period was 10 days (interquartile range 4-15 days). There was no statistically significant correlation between cervical length and latency period (r = 0.15, p = 0.28). Additionally, latency periods less than seven days were not associated with cervical length cutoffs of 2.5 cm or 1.5 cm, or the presence of cervical funneling. Similarly, none of these criteria were associated with the development of either chorioamnionitis or postpartum endometritis.Cervical length by translabial sonography was not associated with duration of the latency period or peripartum maternal infection in women with PPROM.
