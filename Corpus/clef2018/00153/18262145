Contrast infusion sonography in the post-Essure setting. To compare contrast infusion sonogram (CIS) to hysterosalpingogram (HSG) for use as a 3-month confirmation test after Essure.Pilot study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Healthy women in an academic multispecialty group.Seventeen women desiring permanent sterilization who had had successful bilateral Essure placement within 12 weeks.Contrast infusion sonography was performed and immediately followed by an HSG at the same appointment, between 1 and 12 weeks after Essure placement.To determine how well microinsert location and tubal status can be assessed with CIS, an adaptation of hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy), when compared with sequential HSG. Tubal occlusion rate within 4 to 8 weeks after Essure placement was also noted. All microinserts were readily identified with ultrasound, and location was accurately determined. In all patients (100%) with at least 1 tube patent on HSG, patency was also demonstrated on CIS by visualizing real-time flow in the tube or the presence of dye in the cul-de-sac or adnexa. There were no significant adverse events, and pain ratings were similar for both tests. The majority (88%) of patients felt strongly that they would prefer to have a 3-month confirmation test performed in the gynecologist's office rather than an unfamiliar radiologic facility. Tubal occlusion was noted on both CIS and HSG in 82% of patients before 12 weeks.Based on this pilot study with a small sample, CIS, an adaptation of HyCoSy, has comparable accuracy to HSG in the post-Essure setting. The safety, convenience, and comfort of an in-office test using ultrasound and a non-iodine-based dye would be a welcome alternative to HSG. There was also a high rate of bilateral fallopian tube occlusion noted on HSG at 4 weeks after Essure.
