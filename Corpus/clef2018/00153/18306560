Pure lipoma of the uterus: a rare case report. Pure fatty tumors of the uterus are exceedingly rare. The more common lipomatous tumor is lipoleiomyoma with varying amounts of two components. Most are post-operative chance findings following hysterectomy for leiomyoma. Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging can assist in pre-operative diagnosis. A 60 year old post-menopausal woman presented with a mass per abdomen. Ultrasound revealed fibroid uterus with lipomatous areas. The hysterectomy specimen showed a pure intramural lipoma of the uterus. As clinical symptoms and signs of uterine lipoma are indistinguishable from uterine leiomyoma, various imaging techniques can aid in pre-operative diagnosis. The diagnosis of pure lipoma of the uterus should only be made when any smooth muscle if present is confined to the periphery of the tumor.
