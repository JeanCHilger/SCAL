Follow-up in uterine fibroid embolization. Follow-up controls in patients after uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) should monitor clinical improvement of symptoms, document shrinkage of the fibroids, exclude malignancies and detect and treat potential complications of the intervention.A close cooperation with the referring gynecologist, sufficiently and carefully informing the patient about the routine follow-up procedure, potential complications and their clinical signs are necessary to fulfill this goal.Imaging is usually based on ultrasound imaging but may be supplemented by MRI. There are different complications in the early phase after UFE and in the later postembolization phase.
