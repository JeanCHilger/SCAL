The significance of neuroimaging in the evaluation of the newborn with neonatal asphyxia. This is a retrospective study of 3069 newborns admitted to the Neonatology Department of the 1st Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic of Cluj-Napoca, Romania.We considered 38 newborns with the diagnosis of neonatal asphyxia. The neuroimaging performed was transphontanellar ultrasonography, CT-scan, MRI, depending on case. Post asphyxic syndrome evaluation, complete neurological examination, EEG and neuroimaging were performed.The incidence of neonatal asphyxia was 1.15%. Neurological signs were present in 63.15% of the cases. Neurological aspects of newborns were present in different grades of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. EEG signs were present in 33.3% preterm newborns and 50% newborns at term. Transphontanellar ultrasonography showed different grades of intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia in 35%. CT-scan was performed in 3 cases. MRI evaluation was performed in 8 cases and showed different types of cerebral ischaemia and cerebral atrophy. Neuroimaging is a marker for the evolution of cerebral injury.The evaluation of the newborn with neonatal asphyxia must be complex, and include clinical data, EEG and neuroimaging.
