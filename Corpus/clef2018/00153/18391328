Visualization of biomechanical properties of female pelvic floor function using video motion tracking of ultrasound imaging. Real time ultrasound imaging is one of the many ways to clinically evaluate the anatomical and functional condition of female pelvic floor in patients with urinary incontinence. Reflex arc testing of the displacement of uro-gynecological structures during imaging provides a non-invasive way of visualizing their motility. The response from such tests invariably contains a very large amount of visual information, which is not readily captured and assimilated by the observer because it occurs so fast. For this reason only a portion of available information is retained, typically the beginning end ending frame of the image is preserved. Using video motion tracking, parameters were identified to define important biomechanical and temporal relationships. We conclude that new and clinically significant amount of original information about the female pelvic floor can be obtained through the proposed analysis of visualizations.
