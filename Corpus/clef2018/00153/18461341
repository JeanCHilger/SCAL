Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome following the sole administration of injectable gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (triptorelin) for the pituitary down-regulation and in vitro fertilization treatment: report of two cases. This report is to illustrate two cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome following the sole administration of injectable mid-luteal gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (triptorelin) for pituitary down-regulation. Both women underwent egg retrieval, and despite the transfer of good quality embryos, no pregnancy was achieved. The possible mechanism and management of the condition were discussed.
