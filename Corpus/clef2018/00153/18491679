Polypoid lesion of the gallbladder in childhood: case report and literature review. Gallbladder polypoid lesions are rare in the pediatric patient and sometimes represent an incidental finding. A 13 year old male was referred to the Padua Hospital Pediatric Department for an obesity. A routine abdominal ultrasound (US) detected a gallbladder polypoid lesion 6 mm in diameter, initially considered a gallbladder adenoma. Investigation did not detect any other biliary tract abnormality. After seven months, the asymptomatic patient underwent a follow-up US which revealed the disappearance of the polypoid mass. The following concerns are raised: what is the size of the polypoid mass that should be considered for surgery? How does the presence of symptoms worsen the diagnosis and lead to preferring a surgical approach (cholecystectomy) over an echographic follow-up?
