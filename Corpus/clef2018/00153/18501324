Incidence, clinical analysis, and management of ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas. The objective of the study was to identify the incidence, diagnosis, and therapeutic and histological particularities of ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas.This was a retrospective study of 24 patients who underwent surgical treatment for ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas between January 1994 and December 2006. Clinical, ultrasonographic, tumor marker, therapeutic, and histologic data were analyzed.The mean age of patients was 49 years. Thirteen patients were menopausal. Ultrasonographic findings were ovarian echogenic tumor in 6 cases, hypoechogenic tumor in 12 cases, mixed tumor in 6 cases, and anechogenic tumor in 1 case. Cancer antigen-125 level measured in 21 cases was abnormal in 3 cases. Twenty-one patients underwent laparotomy. Three patients underwent laparoscopy however, 1 was converted to laparotomy because of a suspected tumor. Histological findings were 16 fibromas and 9 fibrothecomas.Ovarian fibromas and fibrothecomas are uncommon, accounting for 3.3% of ovarian tumors. These lesions often occur in perimenopausal and menopausal patients. Clinical, ultrasonographic, and tumor marker data remain the best preoperative approach currently available for ovarian tumors. However, the diagnosis remains histological.
