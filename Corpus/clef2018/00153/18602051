Laparoscopic marsupialization of pelvic lymphocele under transvaginal ultrasonographic guidance. Lymphocyst formation is a common complication of pelvic lymphadenectomy. We treated a 54-year-old woman with lymphocele by laparoscopic marsupialization. She developed hydronephrosis as a result of retroperitoneal lymphocele after total abdominal hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer. Laparoscopic marsupialization under transvaginal ultrasonographic guidance was chosen because conservative therapy including percutaneous or transvaginal drainage ran the risk of bowel perforation. The 6-cm collection was opened and its edges were coagulated electrosurgically and sutured with the surrounding peritoneum. The postoperative course was satisfactory, and hydronephrosis was resolved. This highly effective minimally invasive procedure was beneficial to the patient.
