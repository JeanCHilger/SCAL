Ovarian remnant syndrome at the port site. Ovarian remnant syndrome is a rare gynecologic complication, mostly induced by difficult salpingo-oophorectomy with the residual ovarian tissue on the pelvic side wall. This is a report of a rare case of ovarian remnant syndrome at a port site after laparoscopic oophorectomy and a review of the related literature. A 22-year-old virgin had a laparoscopic oophorectomy for an endometrioma 5 years earlier. Postoperatively, she visited gynecologic clinics for a frequent painful sensation at the left port site. After sonographic examination and under the impression of a recurrent endometrioma, laparotomy and cyst excision were performed. Surprisingly, ectopic ovary was diagnosed by the pathologist. Review of the literature revealed ovarian remnant implantation at a port site as a very rare type of ovarian remnant syndrome. During laparoscopic oophorectomy in a woman without sexual exposure who is not a good candidate for culdotomy, the removal of the excised ovary through the port site is sometimes difficult and residual ovarian tissue implantation may occur. There are many methods to reduce the risk of port-site seeding, which we must keep in mind and execute to prevent such a complication.
