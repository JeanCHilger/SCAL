The diagnostic challenge of identifying isolated fallopian tube torsion: a case report of laparoscopic management. Torsion of adnexal structures is a relatively uncommon occurrence. Isolated fallopian tube torsion is an even rarer gynecologic cause of acute low abdominal pain. Diagnosis of this condition is frequently delayed because of the rarity of its occurrence and prolonged investigations to rule out more common causes of acute abdominal pain on a differential diagnosis. A case of a 32-year-old woman with isolated right fallopian tube torsion managed laparoscopically is presented.
