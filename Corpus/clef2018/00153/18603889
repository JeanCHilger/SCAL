Evaluation of endometrial changes and p53 expression in tamoxifen treated women: comparison of various methods. To compare transvaginal sonography (TVS), sonohysterography (SHG), hysteroscopy and endometrial aspiration (EA) and p53 expression in assessing endometrial abnormalities in women on tamoxifen.In a cross sectional study of 50 pre- and post-menopausal women receiving tamoxifen for > 2 years, all participants underwent TVS and EA. Those with endometrial thickness > 4 mm on TVS underwent hysteroscopy and SHG. Serum p53 antibody and p53 immunohistochemistry were tested in all women.The sensitivity and specificity when compared with histopathology as the reference standard were as follows: TVS 100% and 33.3%, SHG 85.7% and 50%, hysteroscopy 92.8% and 80.8%, serum p53 50% and 83.3%, and p53 immunohistochemistry 57.1% and 61.1%. Prevalence of endometrial abnormalities was not significantly different in asymptomatic and symptomatic women.Tamoxifen-users require routine testing for endometrial evaluation. TVS followed by hysteroscopy and biopsy is an effective option. p53 expression correlates with histological abnormalities.
