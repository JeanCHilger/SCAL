Laparoscopic management of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy: case report. Ovarian pregnancy is a rare variant of ectopic gestation. The diagnosis is often made at surgery and requires histological confirmation. The condition has not been reported locally and its diagnosis is easily missed. A case of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy in a 41 year old para 1 + 1 with secondary infertility is reported. The patient presented with lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at six weeks gestation with a serum B-hCG of 79.12 mlU/L. An ultrasound showed a complex left adnexal mass. She underwent a diagnostic and operative laparoscopy. A left oophorectomy was performed due to difficulty in achieving haemostasis.
