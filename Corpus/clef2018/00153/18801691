Ultrasonography in the management of massive postpartum hemorrhage by Blakemore tube tamponade. A previous study (2004) evaluated the efficiency and specified the indications of the Blakemore tube tamponade used in the treatment of massive postpartum haemorrhage. During the management of the last case, the insertion of the Blakemore tube was controlled by using ultrasonography. The use of ultrasonography could be helpful to diagnose and explain more quickly the cases of failure, improve the technics by adapting the volume of balloon catheter for optimal tamponade treatment and propose the creation of a new specially designed ovoid balloon catheter.
