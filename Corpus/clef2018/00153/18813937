Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in first decade of life. This report describes two rare cases of well-differentiated, non-invasive transitional cell carcinomas in children (Grade 1 Stage pTa). One was 8-year-old girl with a polypoid lesion and the other 9-year-old girl with kissing bilateral paraureteral lesions. The initial presentation was haematuria and symptoms of urinary tract infection. Subsequent course and investigation confirmed the diagnosis. Complete resection of the lesion and follow-up with urine cytology, vesical ultrasound and check cystoscopy at 4 years has showed no evidence of recurrence.
