Exaggerated placental site reaction following an elective abortion. We encountered a case of exaggerated placental site (EPS) reaction following an elective abortion. EPS is a miscellaneous trophoblastic lesion. There have been few reports describing its clinical course, and the ultrasonogram and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics have not been reported previously. We present the ultrasonogram and magnetic resonance imaging findings of EPS together with histopathological observations.
