Sonographic findings in adnexal torsion: a report of 34 cases. The aim of this study was to correlate the preoperative sonographic findings and operation type in cases with surgically proven adnexal torsion in our clinic.This retrospective study included 34 postmenarchal patients with adnexal torsion who were examined with ultrasound and then operated between November 2003 and October 2007. Surgical procedures performed were divided into two groups: (1) detorsion followed by aspiration or detorsion combined with resection of the adnexal cyst, (2) resection of the whole adnexa. Patients with additional adnexal pathologies as a cause of adnexal torsion were excluded from the study.Twenty-four out of 34 patients (71%) were treated with ovarian conservation and 10 (29%) with resection of the adnexa. Echogenic features of lesions identified in both patient subgroups were similar in appearance. The lowest resection rate was in the group with multicystic appearance (14%), and the highest in solid-cystic group (44.4%). The average mass size was not significantly different between resection (69.3 vs 86.1 mm) and conservation groups. The risk of adnexal resection was higher in cases with an adnexal mass larger than 60 mm (sensitivity 90%, specificity 54.1%) (P = 0.031). The blood flow was present in six of the 21 cases (28.5%). The number of cases who were treated with adnexal resection were significantly more in the group with absent blood flow (P = 0.045).Determination of preoperative sonographic appearance of the mass may be valuable, but it is not specific in the prediction of the operation type of the cases with adnexal torsion. The measurement of the diameter and assessment of blood flow in the adnexal mass might be helpful in detection of the cases who have high risk of adnexal resection.
