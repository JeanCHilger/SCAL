Fetal fibronectin testing in patients with short cervix in the midtrimester: can it identify optimal candidates for ultrasound-indicated cerclage? The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between fetal fibronectin (fFN) testing prior to ultrasound-indicated cerclage and obstetric outcome.Singleton pregnancies between 18 and 24 weeks' gestation with an ultrasound-diagnosed short cervix (< 25 mm) and funneling (> 25%) of the chorioamniotic membranes into the endocervical canal were analyzed. The fFN testing was performed and patients were randomized to cerclage or no-cerclage. Groups were stratified by fFN result. Cerclage patients were compared with no-cerclage patients. The primary outcome was delivery prior to 35 weeks' gestation.Spontaneous preterm birth prior to 35 weeks' gestation occurred in 15 (44.1%) fFN-positive-cerclage patients and 16 (55.2%) fFN-positive no-cerclage patients (P = .45). Similarly, it occurred in 16 (17.8%) fFN-negative cerclage patients and 11 (17%) fFN-no-cerclage patients (P = .99).fFN did not identify optimal candidates for cerclage. However, fFN testing before an ultrasound-indicated cerclage aids in counseling patients, anticipating the outcome of pregnancies complicated by cervical shortening.
