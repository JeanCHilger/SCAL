Hygiene in endovaginal gynecologic and obstetrical ultrasound in 2008. Hygiene of ultrasound probes is a hot topic in obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound. The issue concerns mainly the risk of contamination and the need for specific procedures to ensure a high degree of protection against infectious diseases, even if a disposable barrier cover is used. As there are no referenced quality criteria for these disposable probe covers, it is crucial to verify that they are CE marked. The use of condoms as probe covers is not recommended even though they present a lower rate of disruption compared to commercial probe covers. The global rate of probe cover perforation is of 1 to 9%. To date, there are no case reports of contamination by ultrasound examination, be it vaginal or abdominal. Nevertheless, every patient must be regarded as a potential source of infection. The French recommendations consider endovaginal ultrasound probes as semi-critical instruments and thus require intermediate-level disinfection. Because of the risk of disruption, American as well as Canadian and Australian recommendations insist on high-level disinfection of the probe. Every operator should follow reasonable hygiene rules and appropriate precautions should be taken in order to reassure the patients about the risks of contamination during any ultrasound examination.
