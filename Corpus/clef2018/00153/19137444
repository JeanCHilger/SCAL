Male infertility associated with adult dominant polycystic kidney disease: a case series. Although described earlier, the association of male infertility with adult dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is quite rare and unfamiliar to some of the multidisciplinary team members caring for affected men.Infertile men diagnosed to have ADPKD were evaluated by clinical characteristics including testis volume, as well as serum hormone levels, semen analysis, and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) because of low volume ejaculate.Semen analysis revealed low-normal volume, normal pH, and azoospermia/virtual azoospermia. Serum hormones were within the normal range. Transrectal ultrasonography demonstrated cystic dilatation of the seminal vesicles in all three men.Patients should be referred for andrological evaluation of a presentation similar to obstructive azoospermia. Their potential to achieve paternity by surgical sperm retrieval combined with assisted reproductive technology is another example of cooperation between andrologists and gynecologists.
