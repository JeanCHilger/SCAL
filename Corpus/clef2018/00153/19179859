Imaging of benign adnexal masses: characteristic presentations on ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Adnexal masses are common in the general population. Although ovarian cancer is a significant cause of mortality, large screening studies demonstrate that the majority of adnexal masses are benign. These benign masses include physiologic cysts, paraovarian masses, and benign ovarian lesions. It is important that gynecologists and radiologists appreciate the appearance of these lesions on multiple imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging to avoid unnecessary intervention.
