Patient suitability for magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound surgery of uterine fibroids. To assess selection criteria used to determine eligibility for magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids to assess the percentage of patients suitable for MRgFUS.A retrospective analysis of 144 patients seeking minimally invasive treatment options for symptomatic uterine fibroids at a single treatment center. Clinical eligibility for MRgFUS was assessed at a gynecology clinic by a Gynecology research fellow trained in the procedure and suitability was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Several techniques were used to mitigate against factors that are contra-indications for MRgFUS.100% of patients interested in MRgFUS were deemed clinically eligible for the procedure and 74% were deemed technically suitable to proceed with treatment.Mitigation techniques allow for less restrictive MRgFUS selection criteria for treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids. These less restrictive criteria are expected to expand the pool of patients for whom MRgFUS is a viable treatment option for uterine fibroid symptoms.
