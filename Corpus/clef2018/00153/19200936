Ultrasound imaging after evacuation as an adjunct to beta-hCG monitoring in posthydatidiform molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors associated with development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after hydatidiform mole (HM).A retrospective analysis of 189 patients with HM was performed. We recorded features such as maternal age, HM history, blood group, gestational age, uterine volume at evacuation, presence of theca lutein cysts, vaginal bleeding, and transvaginal ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging. We considered risk predictors to be the presence of nodules and hypervascularization within the myometrium or endometrium (positive ultrasound imaging). An univariate and multivariate analysis, with the COX nominal logistic model, was performed.Fourteen patients experienced GTN (7.4%). After univariate analysis, uterine size (P = .0139) and positive ultrasound results (P < .0001) were associated significantly with GTN development. At multivariate analysis, only positive ultrasound results maintained significance (likelihood ratio test: chi(2) = 0.0000).The risk of GTN is increased in patients with uterine involvement that is assessed by ultrasound imaging. None of the other prognostic factors that were evaluated was predictive of GTN development.
