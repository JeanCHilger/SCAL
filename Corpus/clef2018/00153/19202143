Combination of transvaginal sonography and clinical examination for preoperative diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of routine clinical examination (per vaginam, PV) combined with transvaginal sonography (TVS) for presurgical, non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis.Two-hundred women with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis were prospectively assessed by PV and TVS prior to laparoscopy and radical resection of disease and histological confirmation.Prevalence of endometriosis on the right/left (r/l) ovary, r/l uterosacral ligament (USL), pouch of Douglas (POD), vagina, bladder, rectovaginal space (RVS) and rectum was 12%, 13%, 12%, 22%, 15%, 11%, 2%, 4% and 24%. Sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios for combined use of TVS and PV resulted in 96/100%, 100/99%, 100/93%, 93/100% and -0.04/87.0The combination of PV and TVS accurately predicts the presence of endometriosis affecting the ovaries, vagina, rectum, USL, RVS and POD in patients with suspected endometriosis. We suggest the routine combination of PV and TVS as an essential part of the standard primary assessment of pelvic pain patients with suspected endometriosis.
