Laparoscopic management of ovarian dysgerminoma presenting with acute abdomen caused by adnexal torsion in a 17-year-old girl. Ovarian dysgerminoma cases very rarely present with acute abdomen due to adnexal torsion and the successful laparoscopic management of such a case has not been reported previously.A 17-year-old sexually inactive high school girl presenting with acute abdomen was referred to our emergency department. Transabdominal ultrasonography showed the presence of homogeneous tumor in the lower abdomen. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed and left ovarian tumor with adnexal torsion was identified. Left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed carefully to avoid damaging the tumor capsule and the excised tissue was removed after retrieval in an endobag. The histopathological diagnosis was pure ovarian dysgerminoma. The postoperative course was uneventful.Laparoscopic management with careful postoperative follow-up to monitor recurrence could be a treatment option in a young girl with dysgerminoma, if the disease condition is detected in the early stage.
