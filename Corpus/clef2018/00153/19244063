Gynecologic imaging reporting and data system: a new proposal for classifying adnexal masses on the basis of sonographic findings. The purpose of this study was to describe a new reporting system called the Gynecologic Imaging Reporting and Data System (GI-RADS) for reporting findings in adnexal masses based on transvaginal sonography.A total of 171 women (mean age, 39 years range, 16-77 years) suspected of having an adnexal mass were evaluated by transvaginal sonography before treatment. Pattern recognition analysis and color Doppler blood flow location were used for determining the presumptive diagnosis. Then the GI-RADS was used, with the following classifications: GI-RADS 1, definitively benignA total of 187 masses were evaluated. The prevalence rate for malignant tumors was 13.4%. Overall GI-RADS classification rates were as follows: GI-RADS 1, 4 cases (2.1%) GI-RADS 2, 52 cases (27.8%)Our proposed reporting system showed good diagnostic performance. It is simple and could facilitate communication between sonographers/sonologists and clinicians.
