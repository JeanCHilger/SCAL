Management of the first trimester miscarriages. A first trimester miscarriage is most often painfully experienced by the patients. The practitioner should be able to offer appropriate, timely, efficient and safe medical management, allowing a shorter convalescence without effect on subsequent fertility. Each step of the process of the miscarriage results in clinical and ultrasonographic characteristics, and requires a specific therapeutic strategy. Vaginal ultrasound allows confirmation of early pregnancy failure (missed miscarriage) diagnosis and to estimate the complete or incomplete removal of trophoblastic material. However, the endometrial thickness does not appear to be predictive for the risk of persistent bleeding or secondary surgery. Surgical evacuation of the product of conception remains the most effective and the quickest method of treatment. Depending on the clinical situation, medical treatment with misoprostol (missed miscarriage) or expectative attitude (incomplete miscarriage) do not increase the risk of complications, particularly the infectious one. However, these alternatives generally require more prolonged outpatient follow-up leading to more frequent consultations and surgical emergencies.
