Digital bowel cleansing free colonic polyp detection method for fecal tagging CT colonography. Fecal tagging computed tomographic colonography (ftCTC) reduces the discomfort and the inconvenience of patients associated with bowel cleansing procedures before CT scanning. In conventional colonic polyp detection techniques for ftCTC, a digital bowel cleansing (DBC) technique is applied to detect polyps in tagged fecal materials (TFM). However, DBC removes the surface of soft tissues and hampers polyp detection. We developed a colonic polyp detection method for CT colonographic examination that enables the detection of polyps surrounded by air and polyps surrounded by TFM without DBC.CT values inside the polyps surrounded by air and polyps surrounded by TFM tend to gradually increase (blob structure) and decrease (inverse-blob structure) from outward to inward, respectively. We developed blob and inverse-blob structure enhancement filters based on the eigenvalues of a Hessian matrix to detect polyps using their intensity characteristic. False-positive elimination is performed using three feature values: volume, maximum value of filter outputs, and standard deviation of CT values inside the polyp candidates.The proposed method is applied to 104 cases of ftCTC images that include 57 polyps larger than 6 mm in diameter. The sensitivity of the method was 91.2% (52/57) with 11.4 false positives per case.The proposed method detects polyps with high sensitivity and 11.4 false positives per case without adverse effects on the DBC.
