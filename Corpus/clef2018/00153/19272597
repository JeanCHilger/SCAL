Influence of water intake on the waiting time prior to gynecologic transabdominal ultrasound. To investigate the effect of volume of water intake on the length of time before the bladder is sufficiently full prior to undergoing transabdominal ultrasound.Ninety-three patients scheduled for transabdominal ultrasound were enrolled between November 2007 and April 2008 and randomly allocated to 3 study groups by volume of water intake: 300, 400, and 500 mL. The total waiting time was recorded when the bladder was sufficiently full to undergo transabdominal ultrasound. The final bladder volume was measured using three-dimensional ultrasound.Mean waiting times were 68.65+/-30.12 min, 64.2+/-26.18 min, and 54.38+/-12.75 min for patients ingesting 300, 400, and 500 mL of water, respectively (P=0.060). The final bladder volumes for the 3 groups were not statistically different (263.06+/-99.21 mL, 275.37+/-113.05 ml, and 316.17+/-101.31 mL P=0.113).Differences in the volume of water ingested in the range of 300-500 mL did not affect the waiting time before undergoing transabdominal ultrasound.
