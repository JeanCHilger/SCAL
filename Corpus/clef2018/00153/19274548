A pilot evaluation of saline sonohysterography for postmenopausal bleeding with thickened endometrium. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and cost implications of pilot introduction of saline sonohysterography for postmenopausal bleeding with thickened endometrium (>or= 5 mm), at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. The investigation was attempted in 48 patients who were found to have a thickened endometrium (>or= 5 mm) on transvaginal ultrasound scanning. The attempt was successful in 45 patients (93.8%). Failures were due to (1) cervical stenosis and (2) leakage of saline from the cervix. Difficult catheterisation of the cervix causing pain was encountered in a minority of cases. Two-thirds of patients were found have focal lesions and were booked for hysteroscopic resection. These patients included 30 with polyps, which were precisely described in all of them. In view of this low complication rate and high accuracy, the technique was integrated as a standard method of investigation for postmenopausal bleeding at the hospital.
