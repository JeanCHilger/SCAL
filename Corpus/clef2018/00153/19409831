The role of ultrasound examination to evaluate ovarian reserve of infertile patients. The accurate assessment of ovarian reserve is an essential step before the treatment of infertile couples. Ovarian reserve could either be evaluated through clinical or biological parameters, but ultrasound plays a remarkable role, since it permits the direct visualization and count of ovarian antral follicles. Nevertheless, the available literature data are conflicting about the real sensibility and specificity of this method to predict the exact number of retrieved oocytes or the occurrence of pregnancy after a procedure for medical assisted reproduction. New technologies have been developed, as the 3D-ultrasound, who does not ameliorate ultrasound accuracy, but permits the reduction of the time necessary for patient's examination and virtually eliminates inter- and intra-observer bias. The place of the ovarian artery flow evaluation by Doppler remains unclear and need more studies.
