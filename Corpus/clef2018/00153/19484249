Psammomatoid ossifying fibroma with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst of frontal sinus. Psammomatoid ossifying fibroma (POF) is a rare, slowly progressive tumor of the extragnathic craniofacial bones, with a tendency toward locally aggressive behavior.The pathognomonic histologic feature is the presence of spherical ossicles, which are similar to psammoma bodies.Fibro-osseous lesions composed of POF and aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) of the frontal sinus in a 12-year-old boy is reported, followed by a literature review.To our knowledge, this is the second case of a fibro-osseous lesion composed of ossifying fibroma with reactive ABC to be reported in the literature.
