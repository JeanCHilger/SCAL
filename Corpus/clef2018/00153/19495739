Spatial allelic imbalance of BCL2 genes and chromosome 18 territories in nonneoplastic and neoplastic cervical squamous epithelium. Several studies suggest a correlation between genome architecture and gene function. To elucidate mechanisms of gene positioning during cell differentiation and malignant transformation we investigated the nuclear positions of the BCL2 alleles and chromosome 18 territories in different layers of nonneoplastic cervical squamous epithelium and cervical squamous carcinomas in relation to gene expression. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and three-dimensional (3D) image analysis using tissue sections revealed that one BCL2 allele was located more peripherally than the other one in nuclei of the basal layer of nonneoplastic epithelium. During terminal cell differentiation the outer BCL2 allele showed a shift towards the nuclear center. In BCL2-expressing carcinomas the inner BCL2 allele was located more peripherally compared with the basal layer of nonneoplastic epithelium. Our results suggest a functional relevance of unequal allelic BCL2 gene positioning and support the hypothesis that transcriptional BCL2 activation is associated with BCL2 relocation towards the nuclear periphery.
