Uterine torsion in delayed diagnosis of abnormal anterior placentation: a report of 2 cases. Uterine torsion has been associated with a variety of adverse outcomes ranging from fetal distress to maternal death. Uterine torsion has also been reported in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies.We report 2 cases of uterine torsion with abnormal anterior placentation identified at cesarean section, which had previously been disguised as posterior placenta previas.Given the increased risk of placenta accreta with an anterior placenta and prior cesarean scar, uterine position should be considered in the evaluation of a presumed posterior placenta, particularly with ultrasound findings suggestive of accreta such as placental lakes.
