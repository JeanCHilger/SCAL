Ultrasonography and computed tomography for management of adnexal masses in Iranian patients with suspected ovarian cancer: results of a prospective study. To determine and compare the accuracy of sonographic and computerized tomography (CT) scan assessments in distinguishing between benign and malignant adnexal masses in an under-studied population of Iranian patients.Transabdominal sonography (TAS) and CT reports of 75 women with adnexal masses (34 malignant, and 41 benign) who were consecutive operated patients at a tertiary gynecology cancer center (Tehran, Iran) were examined. The sonography examinations were operated by a radiologist experienced in the gynecologic oncology field. Biomarkers were determined in blood samples. For CT and TAS, to classify masses as malignant or benign, receiver operating curves (ROC) were assessed and the areas under the curves were compared.For TAS the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91%, 68%, 71% and 90%, respectively. For CT scans the results were 85%, 56 %, 62% and 83%, respectively. The AUC of sonography assessment to diagnose malignancy was significantly higher than that of CT scan (0.8 vs.0.71 p<0.05).Transabdominal sonography proved to be a sensitive method for preoperative detection and staging of suspected ovarian cancer. Biomarkers and CT scan imaging add no additional findings for pre-operative characterization of ovarian masses.
