Evaluation of a daily used navigation system for FESS. The aim of this study is to proof the clinical efficiency by using a modern navigation system for Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS).An optical navigation system was used in clinical routine of 300 patients. Two groups with 150 patients each were examined. Group A was treated with navigation assistance (Karl Storz Navigation Panel Unit NPU), Group B was treated without navigation by conventional FESS. Examination period was limited to 12 months. Median follow-up is 22 and 26 weeks. Perioperative, intraoperative and postoperative parameters were recorded by workflow-analysis, clinical and radiological findings and standardized questionnary.Application of the navigation system needs 1.1 min additional perioperative time in average. Intraoperative time reduction by the navigation system was about 10 min per case (Group A 32.6 (SD 11.2) min, Gruppe B 42.7 (SD 9.5) min). Specific information by the navigation system was evaluated in all surgical areas as usefull and additional to a-priori-knowledge. Postoperatively patients from group A (10/89) show lower rate of re-polyposis then in group B (24/71). Fenestration of the sphenoid sinus were sufficient by CT-evaluation in 100% (group A) and 23% (group B).The advantages of the examined navigation system in comparison to the gold standard of FESS are proven. Navigation assistance led to an reduced intraoperative time consumption, increased postoperative results and lowered the workload of the surgeons.
