The role of ultrasound in the exploration of pelvic floor disorders. Dynamic ultrasound, especially perineal and introital, allows the appreciation of the prolapses (cystoptosis, bladder neck and urethral mobility,enterocele, rectocele). It remains, however, clearly more limited in the precise study of posterior colpoceles, and especially in anorectal disorders, than colpocystodefecography or dynamic MRI. Endoanal ultrasound is the first line morphological examination of the anal sphincter. Perineal and introital ultrasound examinations are useful to appreciate certain complications with suburethral tape and pelvic mesh. For an appreciaton of the morphology of the pelvis and post-mictional residual, the ultrasound remains the first line examination. Pelvic and endovaginal ultrasounds should be systematic, in the absence of MRI, in the presurgical assessment of a prolapse: checks for an ovarian lesion or endrometrial cancer (obesity being a risk factor in the menopaused woman), evaluation of uterine volume in the younger woman.
