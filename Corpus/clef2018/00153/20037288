Fibroma of the omentum resembling an ovarian tumor in the pelvis. We would like to report the case of a patient with fibroma of the omentum that resembled an ovarian tumor in the pelvis. Since primary tumours of the omentum are rare, there is a paucity of information about the biology of such tumors in the basic texts and literature. An ultrasound examination of the patient revealed a mass, likely of ovarian origin, which consisted of liquid and solid components. It was suspected to be a malignant ovarian tumor. However, laparotomy demonstrated it was an omental tumor. This case shows that it can be difficult to pre-operatively diagnose omental fibromas because of their close resemblance to ovarian tumors.
