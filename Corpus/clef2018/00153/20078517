Polyorchidism: a three-case report and review of the literature. The presence of more than two testes confirmed by histology is called polyorchidism. Polyorchidism is an extremely rare congenital anomaly with a few more than 100 cases reported in the literature. The majority of reported cases are asymptomatic patients, others present with cryptorchidism, hydrocele, varicocele, epididymitis, infertility, testicular malignancy and testicular torsion. Over a 2-year period, we encountered three patients who were found to have polyorchidism two men presented with cryptorchidism and one with chronic scrotal pain. Physical examination of the first and the third patient revealed normal testes in the scrotal sac, the other scrotal sac was empty and small solid mass (atrophic left testes) was palpated in the inguinal canal. Ultrasonographic examination of the scrotum and inguinal region confirmed the findings of the physical examination. Ultrasonographic examination of the second patient revealed supernumerary testes within the scrotum. Orchiectomy was made on the first and third patients' supernumerary testes and ipsilateral inguinal high ligation was applied for herniorrhaphy. A conservative approach was preferred for the second patient, maybe preserving a potentially functional supernumerary testis to improve the capacity for spermatogenesis. The risk of malignancy justifies the removal of an atrophic and ectopic testis in polyorchidism. However, it would appear safe to preserve a viable intrascrotal supernumerary testis found incidentally at surgery, provided that the patient is followed-up in the long term.
