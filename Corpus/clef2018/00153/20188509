The role of cross-sectional imaging in male infertility: a pictorial review. Infertility is a common problem. The role of imaging in assisting clinical evaluation is discussed. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are first-line, noninvasive imaging techniques that provide accurate definition of anatomical causes of infertility. This affords an opportunity to deliver timely and appropriate treatment. This pictorial review illustrates normal imaging anatomy and various causes of male infertility, and focuses on congenital and acquired testicular abnormalities and post-testicular obstruction, such as congenital absence of the vasa deferentia, seminal vesicle cysts, prostatic utricle cysts, Mullerian cysts, ejaculatory duct cysts (Wolffian cysts), and epididymal obstruction.
