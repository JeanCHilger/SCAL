Expectant management of ultrasonically diagnosed ovarian dermoid cysts: is it possible to predict outcome? The aim of this study was to assess the natural history of ultrasonically diagnosed ovarian dermoid cysts in a large group of women who were managed expectantly, and to assess the factors that were associated with failure of expectant management.Our database was searched for dermoid cysts diagnosed on ultrasonography by a single expert operator between 2001 and 2007 in this retrospective study. In women who opted for expectant management, demographic data including age, gravidity and parity were recorded. Indications for scan, site of cysts, dimensions and the outcomes of expectant management were also recorded.Two hundred and eighty-nine women were diagnosed with a total of 323 dermoid cysts by a single expert ultrasound operator. 93/289 (32.2% 95% CI, 26.8-37.6%) women with 105/323 (32.5%The success rate of expectant management of dermoid cysts is high and this approach should be considered as a viable alternative to surgical management.
