Detection of endometrial pathology using saline infusion sonography versus gel instillation sonography: a prospective cohort study. To compare saline infusion sonography (SIS) with gel instillation sonography (GIS) in terms of feasibility and diagnostic accuracy.Prospective cohort study.Leuven University bleeding clinic.A total of 804 patients: two consecutive cohorts of 402 women undergoing SIS or GIS.Vaginal ultrasound (n=804) followed by SIS (n=402) or GIS (n=402) office hysteroscopy in 685 patients, and endometrium sampling in 487 patientsPatients' characteristics, technical failure rates, and final diagnosis. Pathology was defined as endometrial hyperplasia, polyp, cancer, or intracavitary myomas.The technical failure rate (difference between proportions and confidence interval) was 5.0% for SIS versus 1.8% for GIS, respectively (3.21 [0.69-5.95]). Failure due to inadequate distension was 1.5% versus 0.3% for SIS and GIS, respectively (1.25Gel instillation sonography is a feasible, accurate alternative for SIS in the evaluation of women with abnormal bleeding, and has fewer technical failures.
