Outpatient hysteroscopy: a routine investigation before assisted reproductive techniques? To evaluate the importance of subjecting the patient to an outpatient (office) hysteroscopy (OH) before assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and patient compliance, possible side effects, and complications of the procedure.Comparative observational cross-sectional study.University hospital.One hundred fifty-two patients attending the outpatient infertility clinic for pre-ART (IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI]-ET) investigations, with normal uterine findings on hysterosalpingography (HSG).Transvaginal sonography (TVS) and OH (using a rigid, 30-degree, 4-mm hysteroscope) by the vaginoscopic "no touch" technique.Diagnostic value and compliance of OH.The procedure was successful in 145 patients (95.4%) 51 of them (35.2%) had previous ART failures. Abnormal hysteroscopic findings were observed in 48 women (33.1%), in which endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, and intrauterine adhesions were the most common findings. The TVS was specific (100%) but not sensitive (41.7%) compared with OH. Abnormal hysteroscopic findings were significantly higher in patients with previous ART failure(s). The procedure was acceptable in almost all patients with no reported complications.The OH should be part of the infertility workup before ART even in patients with normal HSG and/or TVS. This is especially relevant in cases with prior failed ART cycles.
