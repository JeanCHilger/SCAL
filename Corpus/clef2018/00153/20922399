Management and outcomes of adnexal torsion: a 5-year experience. To discuss the surgical results of patients with diagnosis of adnexal torsion.One hundred and fifty patients with diagnosis of adnexal torsion who presented to our clinic between January 2005 and December 2009 were included in this retrospective analysis. Data regarding age, gravidity, parity, size of mass, operation time, and duration of hospitalization were recorded and compared between the patients who had laparoscopy to those who had laparotomy. The pathological results of patients were also recorded.Fifty-eight patients were treated laparoscopically while 92 patients had laparotomy. The most frequent presenting symptom was pelvic pain (96%). Laparoscopy group consisted of young patients with low parity operation and hospital stay time was shorter in laparoscopy group. Velocity loss in Doppler ultrasonography was noted in 81.3% of the patients. Of the laparotomy group 35 postmenopausal patients had hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, and staging surgery was done for 16 of them. The pathological finding was found to be malignant in four and borderline serous tumor in four patients.Laparoscopy is preferred for young patients who want to preserve their fertility. Because of high risk of malignancy in postmenopausal ovarian masses presenting with torsion frozen section should be used. If not possible or not conclusive, staging surgery is more appropriate especially if there is suspicion of malignancy.
