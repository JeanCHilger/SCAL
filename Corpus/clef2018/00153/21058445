Preoperative transvaginal ultrasound guided needle biopsy for primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium. Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium (PSCCE) is an extremely rare tumor and little information is available about its treatment and prognosis. We report a case of PSCCE diagnosed with preoperative transvaginal ultrasound guided needle biopsy. A 73-year-old woman presented with prolonged abdominal pain. Her endometrium was found to be slightly thickened, and endometrial biopsy showed no carcinoma tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a uterine tumor and transvaginal ultrasound guided needle biopsy specimens of the tumor showed squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent laparotomy and was given a diagnosis of PSCCE in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIa. After the operation, the patient was treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) using cisplatin. She remains free of disease at 6 months after CCRT. Preoperative needle biopsy may be helpful to make a diagnosis of PSCCE.
