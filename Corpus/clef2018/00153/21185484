Anatomic evaluation of the female of the infertile couple. One third of infertility cases are due to anatomical abnormalities of the female reproductive tract: endometrial polyps (33%), bilateral tubal blockage (12%), hydrosalpinx (7%), sub-mucosal fibroids (3%) and pelvic endometriosis. These may need surgical correction which could restore fertility. This review aim to determine which examinations should be performed first. Hysterosalpingography shows sensitivity of only 65% but it increases the achievement of spontaneous pregnancy by three times. Office hysteroscopy has an excellent sensitivity (>95%) for diagnosing intra-uterine lesions. Pelvic ultrasound, whose good sensitivity is improved by adding 3D imaging and hysterosonography, seems as efficient as office hysteroscopy in diagnosing uterine cavity abnormalities. Moreover, it also efficiently diagnoses pelvic diseases such as hydrosalpinx or endometrioma without laparoscopy. A first line laparoscopy is indicated in for woman suspected of endometriosis or tubal pathology (history of complicated appendicitis, previous pelvic surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease). For the others straight forward cases, the majority of patients, hysterosalpingography and pelvic ultrasound seem to be sufficient as primary diagnostic tool.
