Fibroadenoma of the vulva--simultaneous with breast fibroadenomas and uterine myoma. To present a rare case of multiple fibroadenomas in breast and vulva and myomas in the uterus. In addition, to show the usefulness of receptor detection as a basis for the indication of antiestrogens.A 30-year-old patient presenting with a history of mammary fibroadenomas since the age of 16 years and uterine myomas since the age of 25 years. From age 26 to 29 years, she was operated on 3 times for fibroadenomas of the vulva. On the third time, she presented with 8 vulvar fibroadenomas. On this last occasion, a low expression of estrogen receptors was identified, together with a high expression of progesterone receptors (ER/PR pharmDx Dako). Tamoxifen was indicated at 10 mg/d during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle for 12 months. After 18 months from initiation of the treatment, the patient was found free of tumors in the vulva, with mammary tumor regression and a nonhomogeneous diffuse uterine myometrium.The presence of solid benign-type tumors in the vulva associated with mammary fibroadenomas and uterine myomas leads one to suspect the fibroadenomas. The histopathological diagnosis and the identification of the hormonal receptors are important for control purposes and therapeutic indications.
