The value of hysteroscopy in diagnosis of chronic endometritis in patients with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion. We performed this study in order to investigate the role of chronic endometritis (CE) in unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) and to determine the correlation between hysteroscopic and histologic findings of CE in patients with unexplained RSA. We also tried to find out the relation between CE and primary vs. secondary RSA.One hundred and forty-two consecutive patients with unexplained RSA and 154 fertile women were enrolled in this study. All the patients and controls underwent hysteroscopy and, at the same time, endometrial biopsy. CE was suspected when hysteroscopy revealed signs of focal or diffuse endometrial hyperemia or endometrial endopolyps (less than 1mm in size). Histopathologic diagnosis of CE was based on superficial stromal edema, increased stromal density, and pleomorphic stromal inflammatory infiltrate dominated by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Results were compared between cases and controls as well as those with primary (n=61) and secondary (n=81) RSA.Patients with RSA had a significantly higher incidence of CE both hysteroscopically (67.6% vs. 27.3% p<0.0001) and pathologically (42.9% vs. 18.2%CE is associated with unexplained RSA. Hysteroscopy, with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity, is suitable for the diagnosis of CE in those with unexplained RSA. CE should be taken into consideration in those with secondary unexplained RSA.
