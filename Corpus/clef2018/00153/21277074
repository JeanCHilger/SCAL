Overactive bladder symptoms and uterine adenomyosis--is there any connection? The aim of this study was to investigate a possible connection between uterine adenomyosis and the prevalence of symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), and to study the impact of OAB symptoms on the quality of life (QoL) of women with uterine adenomyosis.In this prospective pilot study, we included 98 women, 54 of them with an ultrasound (US) diagnosis of uterine adenomyosis and 44 with normal-appearing uterine myometrium during transvaginal US examination. After interview all women completed two questionnaires, the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire. Data were analyzed with SPSS statistical software by means of non-parametric statistics and logistic regression.The average age of all the women was 44 years. Women from the adenomyosis and control groups did not differ in any of the observed clinical variables. Analysis of the UDI questionnaire showed that irritative symptoms were most prevalent in the adenomyosis group as compared to the control group, 22.3% and 7.8%, respectively. Urge urinary incontinence was found in 25.9% of women in the adenomyosis group (3.7% in the control group). Results of logistic regression confirmed the greatest negative impact of irritative symptoms on QoL in women with uterine adenomyosis (p<0.000).As compared with healthy controls, women with adenomyosis more often experience OAB symptoms which significantly decrease their QoL. The connection between adenomyosis and OAB remains uncertain.
