Ovarian-sparing surgery for ovarian teratoma in children. Ovarian teratoma (OT) is the most common ovarian neoplasm in children. Oophorectomy has been the standard treatment but may impair fertility. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and outcome of ovarian-sparing surgery (OSS) for OT.We retrospectively studied all children treated for OT at a pediatric teaching hospital in Paris, France, between March 1992 and July 2006. OSS was performed when deemed technically feasible in patients who had no lymphadenopathy by preoperative imaging or surgical exploration, normal tumor marker levels, and calcifications on radiographs.We identified 30 patients, including 29 with unilateral OT and 1 with synchronous bilateral OT. Emergent surgery was performed in five patients, among whom four had ovarian torsion requiring oophorectomy and one underwent OSS. Of the 26 OTs in the 25 remaining patients, 10 were managed with OSS and 16 with oophorectomy. Subsequently, ultrasound monitoring detected OT development in the contralateral ovary in 4 (14%) patients, after a median of 3 years (range, 1-14 years) OSS was performed in all four cases. The patient with bilateral synchronous OT, managed by OSS initially, underwent unilateral oophorectomy 3 years later for a recurrence. Overall OSS was performed for 15 (42%) OTs.Our results suggest recommendations for preserving fertility whenever possible without compromising the oncological prognosis. In particular, OSS should be reserved for patients who meet all criteria for localized mature teratoma. Long-term follow-up is crucial.
