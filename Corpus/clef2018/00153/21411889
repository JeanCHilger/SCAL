Analytical vector generalization of the classical Stoner-Wohlfarth hysteron. In view of the difficulties in using the well-known Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) ferromagnetic single-domain particle as a vector hysteresis unit in statistical models of hysteresis like the Preisach-type model or in micromagnetic models, we propose a new description of the single-domain ferromagnetic grains by using a vector hysteron (VH) as the 2D and 3D generalization of the rectangular hysteron. The vector hysteron introduced from magnetic symmetry considerations describes analytically the properties of a range of single-domain ferromagnetic particles and also provides the physical motivation for the linear form of the energy barrier used in several dynamic models. In this paper we show the main characteristics of the analytical vector hysteron by comparing it with the well-known Stoner-Wohlfarth model. We compare the hysteresis curves, switching fields and energetic properties of the uniaxial single-domain particles as provided by the two models.
