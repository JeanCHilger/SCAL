Possibility of correction of the lipid disorders in patients with cholelithiasis and gallbladder cholesterosis. To evaluate the possibility of incorporating organic drugs Hepatosan and Entherosan in the complex therapy of patients with gallstone disease and gall bladder cholesterosis (reticulated polypus form) on the basis of literature data and own research.It has been found that the physiological effect of drugs Entherosan and Hepatosan is directed on the improvement cavity and wall digestion processes, that leads to the reduction (disappearance) of dyspeptic symptoms (eliminating discomfort in the epigastrium, bloating, diarrhea) in most of the patients. The main features of Entherosan are: normalization of gastro-intestinal tract motor activity, intestinal microflora, enteroprotective effect of the drug and its influence on intestinal and cellular pools of cholesterol that leads to the activation of cavitary and parietal digestion. The essential point of Hepatosan is to stimulate 7alpha-hydroxylase, resulting in strengthening of cholesterol oxidation and to an increase the pool of LCD in enterohepatic circulation. This factor, coupled with hepatoprotective action of the drug, ensures the deletion of biliary insufficiency.The incorporation of drugs Entherosan and Hepatosan in the complex conservative therapy of cholelithiasis and reticulated polypus forms of gall bladder cholesterosis is pathogenetically substantiated.
