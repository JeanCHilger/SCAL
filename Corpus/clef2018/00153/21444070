Effects of ovarian endometrioma on embryo quality. The proportions of good, fair, and poor embryos in 13 women with bilateral endometriomas were compared with those of 39 women without endometriomas and were found to be similar (47.2% vs. 41.1%, 28.3% vs. 32.8%, and 24.3% vs. 26.0%, respectively). Therefore, it appears that the presence of bilateral endometriomas during IVF treatment is not associated with reduced embryo quality.
