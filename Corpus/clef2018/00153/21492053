Short-term results of 42 endoscopic ampullectomies: a single-center experience. Benign lesions of the major papilla are rare but raise the problem of their medical care. We studied the efficacy, safety, and histology of the endoscopic ampullectomy.Forty-two endoscopic resections of the major papilla were undertaken in 23 males and 19 females of a mean age of 63. Five patients (12%) presented with a familial adenomatous polyposis. The assessment of resectability included preoperative histology, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in 26 patients (62%) always showing intra-mucosal lesion. The resection was performed with a duodenoscope, using a diathermic loop with a pure current section.The resection was realized in one piece for 34 patients, in 2-4 fragments for 8 patients. A plastic pancreatic stent was inserted in 26 patients (62%), a plastic biliary stent in 10 patients (24%). There were no deaths but nine complications (21%): six acute pancreatitis (four patients with a pancreatic stent, contrary to the literature), three delayed gastrointestinal bleeding. The final histological result was fibrosis and inflammatory tissue in 7 patients, low-grade dysplasia in 20 patients, high-grade dysplasia or in situ carcinoma in 10 patients, invasive adenocarcinoma in 1 patient, and somatostatinoma in 2 patients (concordance of 72% with the initial histology). The resection was complete in 39 patients (93%). Three patients had additional surgery because of positive margin of resection or bad histology criteria. The median of follow-up in 33 patients with a complete resection was of 15 months, and we did not note any recurrence in 29 patients (88%).Endoscopic ampullectomy is an efficient treatment for superficial lesions of the papilla, despite a significant but rarely severe morbidity. Preoperative EUS is mandatory, preoperative histology is advisable. Long-term follow-up is necessary.
