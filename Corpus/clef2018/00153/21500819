Biotin-doped porous polypyrrole films for electrically controlled nanoparticle release. A novel method for the preparation of biotin-doped porous conductive surfaces has been suggested for a variety of applications, especially for an electrically controlled release system. Well-ordered and three-dimensional porous conductive structures have been obtained by the electrochemical deposition of the aqueous biotin-pyrrole monomer mixture into particle arrays, followed by subsequent removal of the colloidal particles. Advantageously, direct incorporation of biotin molecules enhances the versatility by modifying surfaces through site-directed conjugate formation, thus facilitating further reactions. In addition, the porosity of the surfaces provides a significant impact on enhanced immobilization and efficient release of streptavidin-tagged gold nanoparticles. Biotinylated porous polypyrrole (Ppy) films were characterized by several techniques: (1) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate surface topography, (2) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to assess the potential-dependent chemical composition of the films, (3) four-point probe evaluation to measure the conductivity, cyclic voltammetry to observe surface eletroactivity, and contact angle measurement to evaluate the surface wettability, and (4) fluorescence microscopy to image and quantify the adsorption and release of gold nanoparticles. Overall, our results demonstrate that these biotinylated porous Ppy films, combined with electrical stimulation, permit a programmable release of gold nanoparticles by altering the chemical strength of the Ppy-biotin interaction.
