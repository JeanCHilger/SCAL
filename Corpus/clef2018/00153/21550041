Endometrial thickness predicts endometrial hyperplasia in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Body mass index is predictive of sonographic endometrial stripe thickness, which in turn is predictive of endometrial hyperplasia in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. For every 1-mm increase in endometrial stripe, the odds ratio of hyperplasia increased by 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.10).
