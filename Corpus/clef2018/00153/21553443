Pediatric cardiology. Thanks to embryological knowledge, morphological anatomy and segmental analysis, paediatric cardiology is today an exact science. Modern diagnostically and therapeutical approach in paediatric cardiology allows early application of foetal echocardiography in order of achieving diagnosis of congenital heart anomalies in utero. Diagnostic modalities in paediatric cardiology are represented the application of transthoracic echocardiography, transoesophageal, 3D and in recent years 4D echocardiography with possibilities of heart imaging via magnetic resonance and computerised tomography. Rhythm disturbances id successfully detected by application of 24-72 hrs ECG Holter monitoring. Invasive techniques starting from balloon atrioseptostomy up to diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterisation are the pre condition of lege artist treatment of group of congenital heart anomalies. Establishing foetal echocardiography with transinternet expert supervision, with team work of gynaecologist and paediatric cardiologists in Bosnia and Herzegovina would significantly reduced the number of congenital heart anomalies as well as the costs of cardio surgery and postsurgical care and in the same time would plan needed intervention/surgeries of heart anomalies. Invasive cardiology with foetal and transoesophageal echocardiography as well as widening of spectrum of cardio surgical operations by local team, represents the imperative of strategy in next decade with continuity of research in paediatric cardiology.
