Long-term metformin treatment is able to reduce the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its hepatic involvement in young hyperinsulinaemic overweight patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The objective of this study is to determine the ability of metformin treatment in reducing the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its hepatic involvement in young hyperinsulinaemic overweight patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).Clinical Trial.We recruited 140 hyperinsulinaemic overweight women with PCOS in their reproductive age. Metformin treatment (500 mg × 3/die) was prescribed to each patient for twelve months.The primary outcome was to evaluate the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and MS in hyperinsulinaemic overweight patients with PCOS. The secondary outcome was to evaluate, in the same patients, the effects of metformin therapy on endocrine, metabolic and hepatic parameters.At basal evaluation, NAFLD was diagnosed in 81 of 140 patients with PCOS (57·85%) MS was present only in the NAFLD group (32·09%vs 0%Treatment with metformin is indicated in all hyperinsulinaemic overweight patients with PCOS, especially in those with NAFLD. These data appear even more interesting considering their increased risk to develop metabolic and hepatic complications.
