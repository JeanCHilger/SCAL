Clinical analysis of ovarian pregnancy: a report of 49 cases. To clinically analyze cases of ectopic ovarian pregnancy and to generate data regarding the evaluation and management of suspected ectopic ovarian pregnancies.We retrospectively analyzed 49 ovarian pregnancies that were surgically treated at Cheil General Hospital and Women's Healthcare Center between January 1996 and December 2009. We analyzed patient age, parity, symptoms, risk factors, preoperative diagnosis, and ovarian pregnancy type.During the study period, the incidence of ovarian pregnancy was 1.59% of all ectopic pregnancies (49/3081) 45/49 (91.8%) were primary ovarian pregnancies. At the time of diagnosis, mean age was 30.7 years (SD: ± 4.4 years) and mean parity was 0.63 (SD: ± 0.8). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (42.9%) and vaginal bleeding (28.6%). The most common sonographic findings were fluid surrounding the ovarian pregnancy and ovarian enlargement. In regard to surgical treatment, ovarian wedge resection was most often performed (85.7% of cases), followed by oophorectomy (8.2% of cases). The most common risk factors were endometriosis (16 patients) and a history of abdominal surgery (19 patients).Ovarian pregnancies are extremely rare and difficult to diagnose both pre- and intra-operatively. Our data may assist surgeons in understanding the clinical presentation of ovarian pregnancy and in counseling patients. Larger studies are warranted to gather more data on this rare form of ectopic pregnancy.
