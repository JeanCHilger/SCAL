Granular cell tumor of the esophagus: description of an infrequent benign tumor. Granular cell tumors (GCT) are infrequent tumors first described by Abrikossoff in 1926. Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in about 6% of GCT, the esophagus being the most frequent location. These tumors are usually benign and asymptomatic and are usually found incidentally when an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is carried out for another reason, showing an isolated polyp or sessile submucosal nodule, covered by intact yellowish mucosa and with firm consistency. Endoscopic ultrasonography has significantly improved the diagnosis of these lesions. Nowadays endoscopic mucosectomy is the treatment of choice of esophageal GCT with a low frequency of complications. Histologic analysis of the surgical specimen shows specific characteristics such as positivity for S-100 protein. We present two new cases of esophageal GCT that were diagnosed recently and discuss the most relevant features of this infrequent disease.
