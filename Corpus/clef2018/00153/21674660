Endometrioid ovarian carcinoma in a woman with a history of infertility and multiple in-vitro fertilization treatment cycles. Ovarian cancer is rarely diagnosed during assisted reproduction. Several case-control and cohort studies have described its incidence within the infertile population well after the assisted reproductive process. We present a case of endometrioid adenocarcinoma that developed during the ovarian stimulation process and show corresponding ultrasound images of its development.
