Abdominal pain in the general doctor's practice. Abdominal pain is a frequent symptom and in the majority of cases the underlying disease is not life threatening. The general practitioner's first task is to differentiate between inflammatory and other diseases. The patient's history, the clinical examination and laboratory tests form the basis for the differential diagnosis. A sonography is the first additional examination in the vast majority of the cases. Accidentally found gallstones usually do not require surgical intervention. Surgery in asymptomatic patients should be limited to gallbladder polyps and patients with calcifications in their gallbladder wall.
