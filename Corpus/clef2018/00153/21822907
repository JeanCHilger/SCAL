Three Dimensional Power Doppler evaluation of human endometrium after administration of oxytocine receptor antagonist (OTRa) in an IVF program. To compare endometrial and subendometrial morphological changes and vascularity as measured by 3D Power Doppler sonography, based on a specific scoring system between women subjected or not to oxytocine receptor antagonist (OTRa) during IVF cycles.Twenty-six women were divided into groups according to OTRa (Atosiban tractocide) administration. The first group (control n = 13 women) was examined with 3D Power Doppler 3 days after embryo transfer. The second group (n = 13 women) was administered 7.5 mg intravenous tractocide 2 days after embryo transfer and a 3D Power Doppler was performed after a day.The control group presented the following ultrasonographic characteristics: (a) echogenic endometrium in all cases, (b) endometrial thickness >7 mm in all cases (84.6%), (c) endometrial volume >2.31 cm(3) in 5 cases (38.5%), (d) abnormal sub-endometrial halo in 3 cases (23.1%), (e) endometrial blood flow in 6 cases (46.2%) and (f) complex vessel's architecture in 2 cases (15.4%). In women who underwent OTRa administration were observed: (a) echogenic endometrium in 1 case (7.7%), triple line endometrium in 12 cases (92.3%), (b) endometrial thickness >7 mm in all cases, (c) endometrial volume >2.31 cm(3) in 11 cases (84.6%), (d) abnormal sub-endometrial halo in 3 cases (23.1%), (e) endometrial blood flow in 11 cases (84.6%) and (f) complex vessel's architecture in 6 cases (46.2%).Women who have taken OTRa presented an endometrium with characteristics more predictive of implantation.
