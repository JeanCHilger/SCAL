Assessment of ovarian volume reduction with three-dimensional ultrasonography after cystectomy for endometrioma. The aim of our study was to assess ovarian tissue loss related to endometrioma cystectomy by 3D-ultrasonography.We have retrospectively included 15 women with no previous ovarian surgery who benefited from cystectomy of an unilateral endometrioma the diameter of which was superior to 30mm. Cystectomy has been performed using an ovarian tissue-sparing procedure with no incision of the ovarian cortex. Patients underwent ultrasonography at least 9 months after the surgery. Several ovarian parameters, such as the area on longitudinal cross-section, the volume and the antral follicles count (AFC), were measured on both operated and contra lateral ovary, and then were compared using Mann and Whitney test. The relationship between the reduction of operated ovary volume and preoperative endometrioma diameter was evaluated by multiple regression.Operated ovary presented a significant reduction in area (mean reduction 229.8mm(2)±47.6 P<0.0001), volume (mean reduction 5.8cm(3)±1.16Endometrioma cystectomy leads to significant reduction in ovarian parenchyma volume and AFC, when compared to contra lateral ovary. This event must be taken into account in the choice of treatment strategy, especially in the case of enlarged, bilateral and recurrent endometriomas, recurrence, as well as in women presenting with other risk factor for ovarian failure.
