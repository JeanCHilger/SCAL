Standardization of the gynecological emergency ultrasound examination. Standardization of the gynecological emergency ultrasound examination could allow more accurate evaluation in gynecologic or general emergency unit. A systematic set of images, "Standardized Acute Female Echography" (SAFE), was defined. In practice, four pictures are realized whatever presenting complaint (set "A"). These pictures describe the normal anatomy and allow verifying the quality of ultrasonography realization. The picture A1 is obtained by abdominal probe and investigates the Morison's pouch. The pictures A2, A3 and A4 are obtained by transvaginal probe and correspond respectively to the mid-sagittal uterus view, the right ovary and the left ovary. For each of these pictures, some quality criteria were defined allowing a control of ultrasound examination. When abnormality is detected, others pictures (set "B)" are required to describe it. These pictures are called B1 in case of intra-uterine abnormality and B2 in case of adnexal abnormality. This standardization of pelvic ultrasonography could allow a quality control and a delegation of the ultrasound examination by training physicians or diagnostic medical sonographers without repetition of the examination. SAFE could be a reference in the field of gynecological emergencies imaging picture by improving diagnostic and therapeutic management.
