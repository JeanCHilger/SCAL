The frequency of metabolic syndrome is higher among PCOS Brazilian women with menstrual irregularity plus hyperandrogenism. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a heterogeneous phenotypic distribution that can potentially lead to variations in metabolic repercussions. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 372 women of reproductive age (146 of whom were ovulatory and 226 with PCOS) divided into groups according to PCOS phenotype: (i) complete phenotype involving menstrual irregularity (MI), hyperandrogenism (H), and ultrasound (US) findings of polycystic ovaries (132 patients) (ii) MI + H (18 patients)
