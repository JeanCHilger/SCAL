Prospective evaluation of the IOTA logistic regression model LR2 for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. To assess the accuracy of the IOTA logistic regression model LR2 for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.This was a prospective single-center study of women with an ultrasound diagnosis of an adnexal tumor. They were all examined by a single Level-II ultrasound operator, who had received training in the systematic examination of ovarian tumors in accordance with the IOTA guidelines. In all women the likelihood of the adnexal lesion being malignant was calculated using the IOTA LR2 model. All women underwent surgery within 120 days of ultrasound examination and the ultrasound findings were compared with operative findings and the final histological diagnosis.One hundred and twenty-four women were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 53.2 (range, 20-91) years and 61/124 (49.2%) women were postmenopausal. 66/124 (53.2%) women had malignant lesions on postoperative histological examination. The IOTA LR2 model had a sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI, 89.5-99.6%) and a specificity of 69.0% (95% CI, 55.5-80.5%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve was 0.93 (SE, 0.022 95% CI, 0.89-0.97), which was not significantly different from 0.92 (SE, 0.018) reported in the original study (P > 0.05).When evaluated prospectively, the accuracy of the IOTA LR2 model was similar to that reported in the original study.
