Fractal dimension of chromatin texture of squamous intraepithelial lesions of cervix. The aim of this study was to explore the role of fractal dimension (FD) of chromatin texture in routinely stained Papanicolaou's smears and to distinguish the different grades of cervical intraepithelial lesions and normal cervical cells. We selected 14 each cases of normal, low grade cervical intra epithelial lesions (LSIL), and high-grade cervical intra epithelial lesions (HSIL) of Papanicolaou's stained cervical smears. Fractal dimension of the pseudo three-dimensional grey image of the nuclear chromatin was measured in 140 nuclei of each group. Mean FD of the normal cases, LSIL cases, and HSIL cases were 2.4225 ± 0.06410, 2.5159 ± 0.03291, and 2.5905 ± 0.06840, respectively. ANOVA test showed significant differences of mean FD in all these three groups (P < 0.000). Fractal dimension of the chromatin texture is easy to perform and can be done in routinely stained Papanicolaou's smear. It is reproducible and gives valuable information about the chromatin texture of the nucleus. In future, this promising variable can be incorporated along with other image morphometric features for accurate classification of dysplastic cells in cervical smear.
