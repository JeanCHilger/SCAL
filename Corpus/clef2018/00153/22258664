Solely inhibin B producing ovarian tumour as a cause of secondary amenorrhoea with hot flushes: case report and review of literature. In this report, we describe a case of a solely inhibin B producing fibrothecoma presenting with secondary amenorrhoea and hot flushes. Typical laboratory findings were an elevated LH, elevated inhibin B, low FSH and low estrogen. The World Health Organization classification of amenorrhoea was not applicable since the combination of low estrogen and low FSH suggested a central cause, whereas actually there was an ovarian cause. With staging laparotomy, a bilateral borderline tumour was detected in combination with a fibrothecoma. This report underpins the concept of inhibin B being a selective FSH secretion inhibitor of ovarian origin. Furthermore, a literature review on these topics is included.
