The use of aortic occlusion balloon catheter without fluoroscopy for life-threatening post-partum haemorrhage. This article describes the use of a balloon catheter introduced via the femoral artery into the abdominal aorta without the use of fluoroscopy to stabilize six patients with life-threatening post-partum haemorrhage. The femoral artery was localized blindly or with the use of ultrasound. Immediate control of the bleeding was achieved in all patients, and the procedure was believed to be life saving for some patients. One patient with a narrow and fragile aorta had an aortic rupture necessitating surgical repair, which may have been caused by the balloon. In these six cases, the procedures were carried out by interventional radiologists. However, this procedure can also be performed by anaesthesiologists or surgeons who are trained in vascular access techniques.
