Outcome of unintended pregnancy after ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids. To evaluate the safety of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) ablation of uterine fibroids among women with unintentional pregnancy within 1 year of therapy.A retrospective analysis was conducted of 435 women who underwent USgHIFU therapy at Chongqing Medical University, China, between October 1, 2006, and October 1, 2009.Unplanned pregnancy was reported by 24 women within 1 year of USgHIFU ablation 8 of these women had desired pregnancy before undergoing treatment. A total of 27 fibroids were detected, 24 of which were treated (mean volume 65.9Â±58.8 cm(3)). Pregnancy was continued by 7 women without any complications. One pregnant woman who had desired pregnancy before therapy underwent an induced abortion owing to concerns about the effects of USgHIFU on the fetus. Fourteen women without pregnancy intention before USgHIFU therapy chose to undergo induced abortionPregnancy within 1 year after USgHIFU ablation of uterine fibroids appears safe however, large scale studies are required to confirm these data.
