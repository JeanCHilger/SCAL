Male genital abnormalities in intrauterine growth restriction. Previous studies have shown a correlation between hypospadias and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), suggesting an association between placental insufficiency and abnormal genital development. This study sought to analyze the association of IUGR and genital abnormalities apparent on fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).This retrospective study included 22 MRI scans of 20 male fetuses between 20 and 35 weeks of gestation presenting with IUGR. On MRI, penile length and testicular descent were evaluated. Student's t-testing and analysis of covariance were used to compare MRI penile length measurements with published normative data obtained from fetal ultrasonography (US) and MRI. McNemar testing was used to evaluate testicular descent in IUGR, compared with reported fetal MRI normative data.The penile length in IUGR fetuses was shorter than in normal fetuses (p<0.001). Furthermore, six of 20 fetuses presented with a micropenis (2.5 SD below the mean value for age). Undescended testes were significantly more frequent in IUGR fetuses than in normal fetuses (p=0.004).Our data confirm that abnormal fetal growth may be associated with penile shortening and, potentially, also undescended testes.
