Clinical diagnosis and complications of paratubal cysts: review of the literature and report of uncommon presentations. Paraovarian or paratubal cysts (PTCs) constitute about 10 % of adnexial masses. Although they are not uncommon they rarely cause symptoms and are usually incidentally found. Actual incidence is not known. The symptoms occur when they grow excessively, or in case of hemorrhage, rupture or torsion.Here, literature review reporting the incidence, presentation and complications of PTCs is performed. Uncommon presentations of PTCs in three different cases, a giant PTC, torsion of PTC and borderline paratubal tumor, are also reported and discussed.Ultrasonography, CT or MRI may be performed in preoperative evaluation but none of these imaging techniques have specific criteria for diagnosis. So, in most cases misdiagnosis as an ovarian mass remains to be a problem.Paratubal cysts can become extremely big before causing symptoms. Torsion is another urgent issue regarding PTCs, necessiating urgent surgery for preservation of the ovary and the tube. Although malignancy is rare, borderline paratubal tumors have been reported in the literature.
