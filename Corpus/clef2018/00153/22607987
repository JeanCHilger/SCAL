About two cases of intra-uterine incarceration post-vacuum aspiration: diagnosis and management. We report two cases of endo-uterine incarceration occurred after vacuum aspiration. In the first case, it is a sigmoid fringe incarceration in a patient asymptomatic. In the second case, it is a fallopian incarceration whose diagnosis was made during an infertility evaluation. The hysterography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have confirmed these diagnoses. The treatment of these incarcerations was surgical and realized in two steps by hysteroscopy combined with laparoscopy. Monitoring by hysterography and hysteroscopy after three months has been proposed to assess the impact on future fertility.
