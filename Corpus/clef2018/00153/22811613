A large amniocele with protruded umbilical cord diagnosed by 3D ultrasound. An amniocele is a herniation of the amniotic sac through a uterine defect. Uterine rupture during pregnancy may develop as a result of a pre-existing injury, uterine anomaly, or unscarred uterus. A 30-year-old patient, with a history of 2 vaginal deliveries, presented an amniocele complicated by left fundal perforation and was evaluated with 3-dimensional ultrasound at 23 weeks. Because of worsening lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, she underwent exploratory laparotomy. Herein, we report a uterine rupture with amniocele.
