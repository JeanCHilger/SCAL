Genital tuberculosis with variable presentation: a series of three cases. Tuberculosis (TB) is still frequently observed in third-world countries like Africa and Asia. Here we report three cases of genital TB with variable presentation. First case was a lady of reproductive age group who presented with polymenorrhagia and postcoital bleeding with unhealthy cervix. Histopathology of cervical tissue revealed tubercular cervicitis. Second and third cases presented with different complaints like discharge per vaginum, postcoital bleeding and pain in lower abdomen with growth over the cervix. Cervical biopsy was inconclusive of TB but endometrial tissue sampling for TB PCR was positive. This shows that newer diagnostic marker test can help us to detect secondary genital TB.
