Three-dimensional spectral domain optical coherence tomography of retina in choroidal metastasis due to uterine endometrial carcinoma. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) three-dimensional (3D) imaging in choroidal metastasis, due to uterine endometrial carcinoma, is reported for the first time. SD-OCT revealed a dome-shaped elevation of the retina. Neurosensory detachment with splitting of the retinal layers, at some places, was observed. 3D SD-OCT allows evaluation of secondary retinal pigment epithelial and intraretinal changes due to metastatic choroidal lesion.
