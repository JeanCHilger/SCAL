Bilateral uterine artery chemoembolization with methotrexate for cesarean scar pregnancy. The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of uterine arteries embolization (UAE) for the treatment of cesarean scar pregnancies (CSP).Forty-six women with CSP were identified between March 2008 and March 2010. All of the patients underwent UAE combined with local methotrexate.Forty-five patients were successfully treated. One patient had an emergency hysterectomy after 20 days because of massive vaginal hemorrhage. The mean time until normalization of serum Î²-human chorionic gonadotrophin was 37.7 days, and the mean time until CSP mass disappearance was 33.3 days. The mean hospitalization time was 10.5 days. The complications were mainly fever and pain, which were alleviated with symptomatic treatment. All 45 patients had recovered their normal menstruation at follow-up.Bilateral uterine artery chemoembolization with methotrexate appears to be a safe and effective treatment for CSP and causes less morbidity than current approaches.
