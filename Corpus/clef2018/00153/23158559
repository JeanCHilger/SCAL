Ovarian ultrasonographic features in reproductive age females with polycystic ovary syndrome and the establishment of ultrasonographic criteria. To understand the ovarian ultrasound imaging features in the reproductive age females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 396 PCOS patients aged 18 - 35 years were recruited from our gynaecology & endocrinology clinic, including obese (OB-PCOS group, n = 153) and non-obese (NOB-PCOS group, n = 241). And 635 reproductive period females with normal menstruation for the control group, including obese (OB-CON group, n = 72) and non-obese (NOB-CON group, n = 563). Questionnaire surveys were conducted on their menstrual history. Vagina or rectum ultrasound methods were employed to determine the values of ovarian follicle number (FN) and ovarian volume (OV). Also the clinical symptom scores and endocrine and metabolic indices were measured.(1) As compared to the control group, the values of ovarian FN and OV 95% site for physiological high limit were 10 and 9.5 ml respectively. (2) In PCOS patients, their ovarian volumes and the number of follicles were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.01). (3) In 90.4% of these patients, their values were OV > 9.5 ml and/or FN â‰¥ 10. And in 66.9% PCOS patients of reproductive age, the polycystic ovarian changes of ultrasound imaging reached the Rotterdam consensus diagnostic criteria.The features of ovarian ultrasound imaging in reproductive period PCOS patients are enlarged ovarian volume and increased follicles numbers. The preliminary Chinese ovarian ultrasonographic diagnostic cut-off points have been proposed for reproductive period PCOS patients.
