Ultrasound follow-up for gallbladder polyps less than 6 mm may not be necessary. The management of ultrasound (US) detected gallbladder (GB) polyps remains a dilemma. The aim of this study was to assess the size distribution and the outcome of US follow-up of GB polyps.The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. US reports from patients examined with abdominal US in our department from January 2008 to the end of December 2009 were reviewed with a view to including all patients with GB polyps. Patients with GB polyps are routinely recommended a 2-year follow-up with US every six months. The GB polyp size was recorded at baseline and at subsequent US reports. Pathology reports were finally reviewed for all patients with GB polyps to check who underwent cholecystectomy and to register the histological diagnosis.A total of 203 patients (median age 54 years range 19-95 years) with GB polyps were includedWe recommend that follow-up US of patients with GB polyps < 6 mm is avoided. Alternatively, the intervals between US follow-up of GB polyps < 6 mm may be extended.not relevant.not relevant.
