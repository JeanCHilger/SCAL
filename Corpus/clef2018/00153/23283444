Contrast-enhanced ultrasound versus conventional ultrasound in the diagnosis of polypoid lesion of gallbladder: a multi-center study of dynamic microvascularization. To assess the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the diagnosis of polypoid lesions of gallbladder (PLGs).CEUS was performed to 116 patients (mean age, 49.6 years range, 21-80 years) with PLGs from 8 university hospitals. 9 cases of biliary sludge were proven by surgery and the remaining 107 cases were confirmed by histopathological examination. The confidence level, diagnostic performance, inter-observer agreement of two independent readers with different experience was assessed. The readers were blind to the imaging and clinical results of the patients.There were significant differences between benign and malignant PLGs in patient age, gender, lesion size, echogenicity, stalk, time-to-peak, vascularity on CEUS, enhancement pattern, and wall destruction. The confidence levels increased significantly and the interobserver agreement increased from 0.425 to 0.601 after CEUS. The sensitivity increased from 22.2 to 77.8% after CEUS in the staff radiologist, and from 22.2 to 66.7% in the resident radiologist. The correctly characterized lesions were 64.7% before versus 87.1% after CEUS (P=0.125) for the staff radiologist, and 57.8% versus 70.7% for the resident radiologist (P=0.007). No significance was found in the subgroup of lesionsâ‰¤1.0 cm before and after CEUS for the two radiologists.CEUS using convex multifrequency probes could detect the dynamic microvascularization of PLGs greater than 1.0 cm and facilitate the differentiation between benign and malignant tumors.
