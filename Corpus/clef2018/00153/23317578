To describe a rare case of hydrosalpinx torsion in a virgin patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.A 25-year-old woman with previously diagnosed MRKH syndrome in whom lower abdominal pain led to discovery and resection of a hydosalpinx of unusual origin in a university hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology, Japan.Laparoscopy revealed a twisted left-sided hydrosalpinx, and the mass was resected laparoscopically. Results of the blood test for Chlamydia trachomatis were positive, but results of the PCR test were negative. Our case was unusual in that hydrosalpinx is rare in virgin patients with MRKH. The cause of the hydrosalpinx was unclear, but one possibility is excess tubal secretions from the fallopian tube.
