Three-dimensional angioultrasonography for the prediction of malignancy in ovarian masses. To determine the efficacy of the angiographic indexes of 3D power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) for the diagnosis of malignancy in complex ovarian masses.A prospective, observational study of 72 patients with complex adnexal mass.In the morphological study, 3D ultrasound showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, PLHR and NLHR of 84.6%, 81.9%, 85.1%, 81.8%, 4.65 and 0.19. No differences in vascular indexes (VI, FI, VFI) between malignant and benign masses were found: VI 5.38 (CI 95% 3.06-7.7) vs. 6.29 (CI 95% 4.41-8.17) (p = 0.53) FI 29.6 (CI 95% 25.17-34.08) vs. 33.8 (CI 95% 30.03-37.3) (p = 0.15)3D-PDA values increase progressively, but not significantly, with the stage of the disease.
