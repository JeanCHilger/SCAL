Water-fat MRI for assessing changes in bone marrow composition due to radiation and chemotherapy in gynecologic cancer patients. To assess the feasibility of using fat-fraction imaging for measuring marrow composition changes over large regions in patients undergoing cancer therapy.Thirteen women with gynecologic malignancies who were to receive radiation and/or chemotherapy were recruited for this study. Subjects were imaged on a 3T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner at baseline (after surgery but before radiation or chemotherapy), 6 months, and 12 months after treatment. Water-fat imaging was used to generate high-resolution, 3D signal fat fraction (sFF) maps extending from mid-femur to L3. Treatment changes were assessed by measuring marrow sFF in the L4 vertebra, femoral necks, and control tissues.Pretreatment and 6-month scans were compared in nine women. sFF increased significantly in both the L4 vertebral marrow (P = 0.04) and the femoral necks (P = 0.03), while no significant change was observed in control regions. Qualitatively, chemotherapy changes were more uniform in space, whereas the radiation-induced changes were largest in marrow regions inside and close to the target radiation field.Water-fat MRI is sensitive to changes in red/yellow marrow composition, and can be used for quantitative and qualitative assessment of treatment-induced marrow damage.
