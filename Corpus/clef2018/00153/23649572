Extensive central ossifying fibroma of the maxilla: a case report. Central ossifying fibroma (COF) is a benign osteogenic neoplasm, with fibrous tissue and calcifications similar to bone, which has the clinical presentation of an asymptomatic bulging. It is more common in the mandibular premolar and molar region, in the third and fourth decades of life, and in women more frequently than men. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice and additional reconstruction is essential due to the functional and esthetic problems faced by the patient. This article describes the surgical treatment and subsequent reconstruction in a 22-year-old man with COF and an expansile lesion of the anterior maxilla. Enucleation of the lesion was performed and porous high-density polyethylene biomaterial was used for reconstruction.
