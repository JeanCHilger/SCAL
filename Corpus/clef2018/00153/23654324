Renal impairment as a complication of uterine fibroids: a retrospective hospital-based study. Leiomyomas can cause obstructive renal impairment and renal failure. This was a retrospective study of women with renal impairment seen at the University of the West Indies Hospital, Jamaica, between 2000 and 2004, looking at aetiology and severity (group 1). We also evaluated patients, in the same hospital, with fibroids who had ultrasonography during a later period (2006-2011), comparing those who had hydronephrosis and those without (group 2). In group 1, 274 women were coded as renal impairment. Case notes for 160 patients (59%) were analysed. Uterine fibroids accounted for 13/160 (8.1%) of cases. Comparing cases with and without fibroids, none of those with fibroids were over 50 years old compared with 59.3% of the others, OR 0.02 (CI 0.00-0.35) p = 0.0001. Hospital data for renal failure showed that most mean values were significantly better for those with fibroids. Urea, 8.59 mmol/l (SD 9.89) vs 17.00 mmol/l (SD 13.41) p = 0.003 Creatinine 300.15 μmol/l (SD490.92) vs 424.05 μmol/l (SD553.29) p = 0.022 and Creatinine clearance 73.21 ml/min (SD 38.92) vs 44.25 ml/min (SD 49.71) p = 0.017. However, mean potassium values were similar, 4.52 mmol/l (SD 0.61) vs 4.85 mmol/l (SD1.03) p = 0.2. In group 2, there were 216 patients and we found 31 (14.35%) patients at ultrasonography with hydronephrosis from fibroids. These patients had significantly larger uteri than those without hydronephrosis but renal function was similar, with only urea values significantly worse. Leiomyomas can cause renal impairment, however the prognosis appears good.
