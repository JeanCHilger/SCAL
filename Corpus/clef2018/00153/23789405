Forensic medical assessment of the origin of the missed early post-traumatic abortions. The objective of the present study was to develop an algorithm for the forensic medical assessment of the origin of the missed early post-traumatic abortions. The analysis of the available data on the main variants of traumatic pregnancy interruption was carried out. Diagnostic features of the missed early post-traumatic abortions are considered along with the possible errors in the use of the current approaches to forensic medical assessment of their origin. The proposed algorithm for the forensic medical assessment of the origin of the missed early post-traumatic abortions takes into consideration the specific features of the objects of interest and includes the analysis of the results of ultrasonic studies of the uterine cavity and histological investigations of the scraps of endometrial tissue. Absolute and probabilistic criteria for spontaneous and traumatic origin of the missed early post-traumatic abortions. The proposed algorithm is recommended for the use in routine clinical practice for the elucidation of the causes of the missed early post-traumatic abortions.
