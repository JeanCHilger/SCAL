Prospective study on magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery for symptomatic uterine fibroid: short-term follow up. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) in treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyoma among Chinese reproductive age women.From April 2010 to April 2012, 80 premenopausal women with symptomatic leiomyoma volunteered to participate in this prospective study in Department of Outpatient of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Among 23 reproductive aged patients with size of uterus less than 16th gestational weeks, 2.5 to 10 cm of diameter of myoma, less than 10 myomas and expressing symptoms clearly were treated by MRgFUS. Treatment data, non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR) and adverse events were recorded. After treatment, patients were followed up at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Patients at initial screening and each time of the follow-up filled out uterine fibroid symptoms quality of life (UFS-QOL), which include symptoms severity score (SSS) and health-related quality of life (HRQL). The volumes of leiomyoma and uterine were evaluated on MRI before and after the treatment (at 6 and 12 months, respectively). Before operation, routine blood test were performed on all patients, anemia patients at 3 months and 1 year after treatment were checked with blood test.(1) Treatment data and adverse events: the mean therapeutic temperature was (69 ± 7)°C, the mean treatment time was (144 ± 62) min, the mean NPVR was (62 ± 23)%. Adverse events included mild erythema(1/23), abdominal cramp (8/23), vaginal discharge (5/23), and leg numbness (4/23). (2) The rate of secondary surgery: one patient was treated by myoectomy and hysterectomy within one year following up and 4 patients chose surgical treatment during the second-year follow-up. (3) Volume change:the volumes of leiomyoma before the treatment and 6, 12 months after the treatment are 75.6(P25 = 43.8, P75 = 128.9), 52.3(P25 = 23.8, P75 = 111.2), 45.9(P25 = 26.3, P75 = 71.7) cm(3), respectively and the volumes of uterine before the treatment and 6, 12 months after the treatment are 270.0 (P25 = 208.4, P75 = 390.3), 216.4 (P25 = 151.1, P75 = 290.0), 200.0 (P25 = 149.1, P75 = 267.6) cm(3), respectively. Both leiomyoma and uterine volumes decreased significantly after treatments (P < 0.01). (4) UFS-QOL change:the symptoms severity score (SSS) before the treatment and 3, 12 months after the treatment are (34 ± 13), (22 ± 11), (19 ± 12), which decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The health-related quality of life (HRQL) before the treatment and 3, 12 months after the treatment are (74 ± 15), (82 ± 13), (89 ± 10), which increased dramatically (P < 0.01). (5) Hemoglobin (HGB) change: eleven patients suffered from anemia before treatments, the mean HGB before treatment was (87 ± 6) g/L and were (106 ± 14) g/L 3 months after treatment, (112 ± 10) g/L 12 months after treatment. The HGB was increased significantly after treatments (P < 0.01).MRgFUS is a safe and effective non-invasive management for symptomatic uterine leiomyoma in short-term follow up. But there is additional treatment ratio after MRgFUS.
