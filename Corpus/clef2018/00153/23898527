Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in ovarian tumors. To determine the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in diagnosing ovarian tumors.Both conventional ultrasonography (CUS) and CEUS were performed in 86 patients with ovarian masses. A total of 106 ovarian masses from those patients were examined for pathological changes. The blood flow and color scores determined by CUS and CEUS and the contrast intensity determined by CEUS were analyzed and compared with the pathological results.Blood flow was detected in 91 ovarian masses by CUS, with 27 diagnosed as benign and 79 as malignant. Blood flow was detected in 106 ovarian masses by CEUS, with 33 diagnosed as benign and 73 as malignant. CUS had 84.9% diagnostic accuracy, 92.0% sensitivity, 67.7% specificity, 87.3% positive predictive value, and 77.8% negative predictive value. CEUS had 92.5% diagnostic accuracy, 93.3% sensitivity, 90.3% specificity, 95.9% positive predictive value, and 84.8% negatvie predictive value.CEUS is a better instrument than CUS for diagnosing ovarian tumors through blood flow detection.
