Different phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome in Turkish women: clinical and endocrine characteristics. This study presents the differences in clinical, endocrine and metabolic parameters among different polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes in Turkish women. Four hundred and ten women with PCOS were evaluated, while 97 healthy women served as controls. PCOS were defined by oligo-anovulation (OA), hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (PCO). Patients were subdivided into four phenotypes: OA + HA + PCO (phenotype 1), OA + HA (phenotype 2), HA + PCO (phenotype 3), OA + PCO (phenotype 4). Phenotypes 1-4 were present in 47.1%, 13.2%, 21.2% and 18.5% of patients, respectively. They were also divided into three groups according to the BMI (<25 kg/m(2) 25≤ and ≤30 kg/m(2)
