Ovarian torsion in children: management and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, management, and outcomes in children with ovarian torsion.The charts of 50 patients with 53 cases of ovarian torsion treated between January 1989 and March 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Long term follow up was available for 20 girls who had their ovaries left in the abdominal cavity after detorsion.In 22 cases ovaries were removed, and in 31 cases the torsion was relieved and the ovaries left in the abdominal cavity. Twenty-five of the salvaged ovaries were black-bluish and 10 bluish in color. Since 2005, after a change in preferred treatment, all ovaries treated by detorsion were left in the abdominal cavity. The long term results were observed clinically and by ultrasound in 20 girls. Multifollicular ovaries were found in 17 girls. One girl had a normal size paucifollicular ovary, a one-year-old girl had a normal size ovary with microfollicles, and one girl had no ovarian material detectable by ultrasound.Long term analysis of the treatment of ovarian torsion revealed that ovaries treated by detorsion and left in the abdominal cavity preserved their normal anatomy and function. Conservative surgical treatment proved to be safe. None of the girls had thromboembolism or peritonitis, and no malignant tumors were found in the operated ovaries.
