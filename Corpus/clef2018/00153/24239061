A case of mobile aortic arch thrombus with systemic embolisation--a management dilemma. We report the case of splenic infarct secondary to embolisation from a polypoid 17 mm√ó10 mm thoracic aorta thrombi in a 60 year-old female. The management and prognostic value of thoracic aorta thrombi are poorly defined in literature. This patient was successfully treated with oral anticoagulation as opposed to surgical intervention. Repeat transoesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography have demonstrated marked reduction in thrombi size with no further embolic event.
