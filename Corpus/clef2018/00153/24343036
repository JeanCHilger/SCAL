Diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: AMH in combination with clinical symptoms. We assessed the utility of using anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) and clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), oligo/amenorrhea (OA), and hyperandrogenism (HA) for diagnosing PCOS, and compared their diagnostic accuracy with those of classical diagnostic systems.A total of 606 females were admitted to a university hospital with menstrual irregularities or symptoms of hyperandrogenism were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Fasting blood samples were collected. Pelvic and/or abdominal ultrasonography and clinical examination were performed. Patients were evaluated for the presence of PCOS according to conventional diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic performance of using serum AMH levels alone and in various combinations with the clinical features of PCOM, OA, and HA were investigated.For the diagnosis of PCOS, the combination of OA and/or HA with AMH showed 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity according to the Rotterdam criteria 83% sensitivity and 89% specificity according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteriaThe serum AMH level is a useful diagnostic marker for PCOS and is correlated with conventional diagnostic criteria. The combination of AMH level with OA and/or HA markedly increased the clinical scope for PCOS diagnosis and can be introduced as a possible objective criterion for the diagnosis of this disease.
