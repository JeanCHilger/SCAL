An unusual cause for epigastric pain in pregnancy. Spontaneous uterine rupture with herniation of the amniotic sac in a 33-week primigravida. A 29-year-old in vitro fertilisation patient presented at 33 weeks of gestation with abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a cystic lesion adjacent to the fundus. During caesarean section, a defect at the fundus was identified with herniation of the amniotic sac through this defect. There were no complications postoperatively and the patient made an unremarkable recovery. With at least one maternal death reported in the most recent confidential enquiry into maternal death, uterine rupture is an obstetric emergency and can have catastrophic outcomes. The incidence of uterine rupture as a result of previous perforation is unclear with little published data and few case reports. Cases of uterine rupture after perforation following hysteroscopic resection of fibroids, uterine septum are well published but the authors found no known previous cases related to laparoscopy. Counselling patients post perforation should include discussion regarding the management of future pregnancies and the risk of uterine rupture.
