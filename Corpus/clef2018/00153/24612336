Isolated hydatid cyst of uterine cervix: A case report. Hydatid disease is an endemic infection which can affect any organ, mainly the liver and lungs. Peritoneal echinococcosis is usually known to occur secondary to hepatic hydatid cyst rupture into the peritoneal cavity. An isolated cyst in the pelvic cavity is considered as primary only when there are no other hydatid cysts. Herein, we report an isolated pelvic-cervical hydatid cyst which presented without any involvement of the other abdominal organs or lungs. Our patient, a 27-year-old woman with the primary complaints of dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain, had thin-walled large cystic mass originating from the cervix, diagnosed by ultrasonography. She underwent surgery with the most likely initial diagnosis of exophytic fibroid with cystic degeneration. Gynecologists should be aware of the possibility of isolated primary hydatid cyst of the pelvic cavity and should consider this condition in the differential diagnosis of cystic pelvic masses, especially in areas where the disease is endemic.
