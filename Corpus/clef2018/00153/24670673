Uterine artery embolization for uterine arteriovenous malformation is associated with placental abnormalities in the subsequent pregnancy: two cases report. Uterine arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is generally associated with uterine trauma such as dilatation and curettage, therapeutic abortion, uterine surgery and uterine malignant tumors(1)). Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is performed on patients with uterine AVM who have desire for future pregnancy(2)). Some successful pregnancies were reported after UAE for uterine AVM(5,6)), however complication during pregnancy has not been described clearly. We herein for the first time report two cases of successful pregnancy and spontaneous delivery after UAE for uterine AVM who had placenta accreta and placental abruption respectively. Although successful pregnancy is possible after UAE for AVM, placenta abnormalities have to be considered during pregnancy and after delivery.
