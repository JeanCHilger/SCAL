Do measurements of uterine septum using three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging agree? To evaluate the agreement between measurements of uterine septum by 3-D ultrasound (3-D US) and magnetic resonance imaging.Fourteen women with a uterine septum underwent both a 3-D US and an MRI followed by hysteroscopic metroplasty in a tertiary care infertility clinic within a university teaching hospital. The agreement between 3-D US and MRI measurements of septum length (SL), septum width (SW) and the distance between fundal serosa and septal tip (SSD) was compared using the Bland Altman limit of agreement analysis.3-D US correctly identified all women who had a uterine septum identified with MRI. The mean difference in SL was 2.7 mm (upper limit of agreement and lower limit of agreement were 10.3 mm and -4.8 mm, respectively). The mean difference in SW was 2.3 mm (upper limit of agreement and lower limit of agreement of 10.4 mm and -9.2 mm, respectively). The SSD mean difference was 2.8 mm (upper limit of agreement and lower limit of agreement of 10.6 mm and -5 mm, respectively).Categorical agreement in diagnosis was 100% and agreement between 3-D US and MRI measurements was good with narrow differences. Variations were unlikely to be greater than intra- and inter-observer variations anticipated in MRI readings. 3-D US can replace MRI for diagnosis and measurement of uterine septa.
