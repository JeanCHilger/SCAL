Diagnosis and treatment of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. The aim of this study was to review our case load of the treatment and outcomes of patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC).Data about 21 patients were reviewed retrospectively to determine age, clinical symptoms and findings, preoperative screening, operative findings, surgical history, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications.There were 14 men and 7 women (mean age, 65 Â± 11.3 yr). Preoperative ultrasonography of 17 patients showed a gallbladder stone in 14 patients, adenomyomatosis plus stones in 2 patients, and a polyp in 1 patient. There were 5 patients with acute cholecystitis and 16 patients with chronic cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening was noted in 3 of the 12 patients who had abdominal computed tomography. Frozen section examinations were done in 5 patients. Radical cholecystectomy was done in 1 patient because of suspected carcinoma.It is difficult to diagnose XGC preoperatively or intraoperatively, and the definitive diagnosis depends exclusively on pathologic examination.
