Solitary schwannoma of the gallbladder: a case report and literature review. Schwannomas occurring in the gallbladder are extremely rare. Preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder schwannomas appears to be very difficult because they are normally asymptomatic and are often found incidentally. Until now, only five cases have been reported in the literature. To our knowledge, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features of gallbladder schwannomas have not been reported before in other studies. We treated a 55-year-old male patient with gallbladder schwannoma in China. He had no symptoms, and the lesion was incidentally found by conventional ultrasound (US) when performing a health examination. The patient had normal liver function moreover, serum carcinoembryonic antigen and alpha-fetoprotein were within the normal ranges. The lesion showed no blood flow signals on color Doppler US, and the wall beneath the lesion was intact on CEUS. The lesion was believed to be a benign entity
