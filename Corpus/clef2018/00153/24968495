Study of endometrial thickness by ultrasonography in regular and irregular menstrual cycles. Endometrium is the mucosal layer of uterus. Throughout the reproductive age endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during each lunar month to prepare the uterus for implantation. Endometrium proliferates and regenerates during menstrual cycle. The most common cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding during a woman's reproductive years is dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Aim of this study was to compare endometrial thickness in regular and irregular menstrual cycles. A total of 111 patients with regular and irregular menstrual bleeding were selected. Age, duration of menstrual cycle, detailed menstrual history, endometrial thickness, difference in endometrial thickness before and after treatment were recorded. Endometrial thickness was recorded by ultrasonography. In patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, if endometrial thickness was less than 8mm first medical line of treatment was advised. If endometrial thickness was greater than 8mm, line of treatment depended on age and pattern of bleeding.
