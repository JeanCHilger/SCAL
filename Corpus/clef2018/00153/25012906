Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm manifesting as delayed postpartum hemorrhage after precipitous delivery: three case reports. Precipitous delivery may lead to serious maternal and neonatal complications. Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP) is one of the causes of delayed postpartum hemorrhage. Here we describe 3 cases of UAP manifesting as delayed postpartum hemorrhage after precipitous delivery. The duration of the second stage of labor in cases 1, 2, and 3 was 15, 15, and 60 min, respectively. Excessive vaginal bleeding occurred 10, 9, and 31 days after delivery, respectively. Ultrasonogram and pelvic angiography revealed the UAP in each case and uterine artery embolization was performed. UAP may be a complication of precipitous delivery.
