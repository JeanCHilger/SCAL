Sonohysterography in peri- and postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding or abnormal endometrial appearance. To assess the usefulness of SIS and to compare its diagnostic accuracy with conventional transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and hysteroscopy (HSC) to detect intracavitary abnormalities in peri- and postmenopausal women with abnormal endometrial appearance or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) prior to admission.The study group consisted of 40 patients in peri- and postmenopausal period referred to the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Warsaw due to AUB or abnormal endometrial appearance on TVS between January 2013 and June 2013. All the participants underwent TVS followed by SIS in order to plan further management. Only the patients with uterine abnormalities on TVS examination, proved by SIS were qualified for HSC. Hysteroscopical guided biopsies were taken in cases with focal lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of TVS, SIS and HSC were calculated by comparison with the final pathological diagnosis as the gold standard.The comparison of the three diagnostic procedures revealed that the diagnostic accuracy of SIS and HSC is superior to conventional TVS. SIS and HSC had identical accuracy for submucosal myomas (PPV and NPV 1.0 for both), while in case of polypoid lesions the accuracy of HSC was higher than of SIS (HSC: PPV 0.8, NPV 1.0 SIS: PPV 0.75Due to its accuracy and cost-effectiveness, SIS could be regarded as a primary diagnostic method allowing proper qualification for further invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the detection of uterine abnormalities among peri- and postmenopausal women.
