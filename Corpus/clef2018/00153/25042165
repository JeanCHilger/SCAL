Use of three-dimensional power Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of uterine arteriovenous malformation and follow-up after uterine artery embolization: Case report and brief review of literature. Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) of the uterus can cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Unexplained, heavy vaginal bleeding in a reproductive age woman should raise suspicion for an AVM. Here a 37-year-old woman had increasingly severe vaginal bleeding for 15 days. Serum Î²-hCG was elevated. Two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound suggested retained products of conception. Before dilation and curettage (D&C), color Doppler and three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler demonstrated findings indicative of uterine AVM. A bilateral uterine artery embolization was performed without complications. Three months after uterine artery embolization, 3D power Doppler ultrasonography found complete resolution of the AVM. This case illustrates the importance of assessing both gray-scale and 3D power Doppler, and the ability of postprocedure Doppler to assess resolution.
