Transvaginal management of cesarean scar section diverticulum: a novel surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of transvaginal management of cesarean section scar diverticulum. MATERIAL/METHODS We evaluated 64 patients receiving transvaginal management of previous cesarean scar defect (PCSD).The PCSD was successfully treated by transvaginal surgery, without evident complications. The mean operation time was 33.6±4.1 min, blood loss was 37.9±16.8 ml, and the mean hospital stay after surgery was 6±2.9 days. Symptoms related to the prolonged menstruation in 53 patients were improved after surgery, vaginal bleeding time was reduced by an average of 7.3±2.8 days, and a significant difference was noted between the mean pre- and post-operative duration of menstruation (P<0.01). Of 11 patients with guttate between menstrual periods, guttate was absent in 9 patients and improved in 2. Clinical improvement was observed in 85.9% (55/64).Transvaginal intervention is feasible and safe for the management of PCSD.
