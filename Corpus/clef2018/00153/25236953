Routine vs. expert-guided transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of endometriosis: a retrospective review. The objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of routine trans vaginal ultrasound (TVUS) compared to expert-guided transvaginal ultrasound (ETVUS) for the diagnosis of endometriosis.A retrospective chart review performed at a Canadian tertiary center specializing in the diagnosis and management of endometriosis. All cases with surgically confirmed endometriosis and an ETVUS completed at a single center were included for review and compared to routine TVUS performed for the same indication.Forty cases met the inclusion criteria. Mean patient age of the study population at first surgical diagnosis was 31.2 Â± 6.9 years. Dysmenorrhea (76.9 %) and chronic pelvic pain (74.3 %) were the most common presenting symptoms. Sensitivity of routine TVUS was 25 % (10/40), compared to 78 % (31/40) with ETVUS, (P < 0.01). Comparisons were made based on site of disease. Routine TVUS and ETVUS detected bladder involvement in (0/40) vs. 5 % (2/40) ureter (0/40) vs. 7.5 % (3/40)ETVUS is more sensitive than routine TVUS to diagnose endometriosis, identifying lesions other than endometrioma and is of assistance in surgical planning and patient counseling.
