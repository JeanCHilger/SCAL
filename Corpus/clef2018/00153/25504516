A case of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix associated with lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia: radiologic-pathologic correlation. Gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAS) of the uterine cervix is a recently defined subtype of mucinous adenocarcinoma. GAS is proposed to include minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) as a very well-differentiated form and has been suggested to arise from lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH). We report the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of a GAS associated with LEGH. On MRI, the LEGH component was detected as multiple cystic lesions arranged in a "cosmos pattern", while the GAS was depicted as a predominantly solid lesion containing obvious adenocarcinoma and MDA components, which appeared as mass-like and infiltrative components, respectively. The GAS exhibited tiny cysts on three-dimensional T2-weighted images, high intensity on diffusion-weighted images mostly due to T2 shine-through effect according to apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, and reticular enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, which reflected numerous dilated glandular structures of the tumor. Low ADC was only observed at the deepest invasion front of the obvious adenocarcinoma component. Our case suggests that the MRI features of GAS vary depending on the tumor's histological components, and it is important to be aware of these imaging features when evaluating LEGH on MRI.
