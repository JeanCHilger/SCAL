Adnexal mass in the postmenopausal patient. The adnexal mass in a postmenopausal patient poses an important diagnostic and management dilemma for primary care providers and gynecologists. Postmenopausal women are at a significantly increased risk of gynecologic malignancy yet even in this population the majority of adnexal masses are benign. Evaluation and management of these lesions centers on the identification of malignancy, especially ovarian cancer, while avoiding unnecessary intervention in patients with benign lesions. Tumor markers and imaging can help in the evaluation of adnexal mass in postmenopausal women. Transvaginal ultrasound has long been considered the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of adnexal masses. Particularly in the setting of high frequency utilization of transvaginal probes, which project high quality images allowing for detailed descriptions of the macroscopic appearance of the mass, and remains the least expensive of all imaging modalities currently available. For adnexal masses that are highly suspicious for cancer, women should be referred a gynecologic oncologist and facility for optimal care.
