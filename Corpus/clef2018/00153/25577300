Resveratrol improves insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized controlled trial. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a major health problem worldwide. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol found in edible plants that has a variety of biochemical and physiological effects.To evaluate the effect of resveratrol on insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial: 60 subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were given 2 placebo capsules (placebo group) or 2 150mg resveratrol capsules (resveratrol group) twice daily for three months. Liver ultrasound imaging, anthropometric profile, serum liver enzymes, insulin, glucose, C-peptide, lipid profile, and inflammation-related cytokines were compared pre and post-treatment.Compared with the placebo group, resveratrol significantly decreased aspartate aminotransferase, glucose and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [-6.00 (-9.00, -3.00) IU/L, -0.64±0.31mmol/L, and -0.41±0.35mmol/L, respectively, P≤0.001] alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol [-7.00 (-11.0, -2.50) IU/L and -0.67±0.50mmol/L, respectively, P=0.002], and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (-0.60±1.15, P=0.016). In the resveratrol group significant reductions of the levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, cytokeratin 18 fragment, and fibroblast growth factor 21 [-0.53±1.30pg/mL, -26.9 (-70.3, 5.12) IU/L and -23.3 (-43.0, 0.31) pg/mL, respectively, P<0.05] and elevation of adiponectin level [1.22 (-0.37, 1.60) ng/mL, P=0.025] were observed.Resveratrol supplementation may benefit patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
