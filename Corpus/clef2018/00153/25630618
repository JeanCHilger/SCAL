Customized vaginal vault brachytherapy with computed tomography imaging-derived applicator prototyping. A novel customized vaginal brachytherapy mould technique has been developed for clinical use. This image-guided technique provides a brachytherapy applicator solution for irregular vaginal vault configuration and/or a wide vaginal apex relative to the vaginal introitus that would be sub-optimally treated with standard cylinders.The customized vaginal applicator is generated by the following process: CT images are obtained with contrast-soaked vaginal packing in situ to highlight unique anatomical detail. A 3-dimensional digital model is developed from the images and subsequently converted into a custom applicator with the use of stereolithography, which is an additive manufacturing technique whereby layers 50-100 μm thick of resin are deposited and polymerized using a laser to create intricate 3-dimensional objects. The density of the applicator and the dose delivered using the custom applicator were both measured to ensure accurate dosimetry.The CT-based densities of a clinical vaginal cylinder and the cylinder generated using stereolithography were 1.29 ± 0.06 g/cm(3) vs 1.28 ± 0.01 g/cm(3), respectively. The mean measured dose from a representative stereolithographed applicator normalized to dose measured for a single plastic catheter was 99.8 ± 4.2%. In patient dosimetric results indicate improved coverage of the lateral aspect of vaginal vault with the custom cylinder relative to the standard cylinder 700 cGy vs 328 cGy, respectively, at a representative lateral vaginal dose point, while simultaneously achieving relatively narrow dose distribution in the anterior/posterior direction.Stereolithographic applicator production was available within a clinically acceptable timeframe, and its clinical feasibility and utility has been demonstrated.
