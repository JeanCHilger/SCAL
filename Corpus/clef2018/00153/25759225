Three cases of enteroenteric intussusception examined by three-dimensional computed tomography enteroclysis. Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) enteroclysis or virtual enteroscopy is a novel technique to explore the entire small bowel using a modified protocol of virtual colonoscopy by inflating the small bowel with air. In our hospital, the procedure is performed routinely for cases with suspected gross lesions. We performed 3D CT enteroclysis for three cases with enteroenteric intussusception bowel. The lesions associated with intussusception were identified, single-incision laparoscopic surgery was performed, and diagnoses of lipoma and Peutz-Jeghers polyp were made in two cases. 3D CT enteroclysis did not reveal any associated lesion in the third case. This was followed by an intraoperative exploration during gastrectomy for stomach cancer, but no intestinal lesion was found. A diagnosis of idiopathic intussusception and its spontaneous release was made, and no recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. 3D CT enteroclysis seems to be an appropriate modality for the evaluation of enteroenteric intussusception.
