The association between follicular size at the time of spontaneous rupture and pregnancy rates in clomiphene citrate treated PCOS patients in coit cycles. To investigate the follicular size at spontaneous rupture on pregnancy rate in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing clomiphene citrate (CC) ovulation.Cross-sectional study.One hundred and four women with ovulatory cycles after use of CC followed by ultrasound to determine the follicle size at the time of rupture, which was subsequently correlated with the occurrence of pregnancy or not in coit cycles.In the group of follicular rupture at a mean diameter ≤25 mm (n = 54), pregnancy rate was 35.1% and when follicular rupture occurred at a mean diameter >25 mm (n = 50), it was 34% (p > 0.05). When different diameters at follicular rupture were randomly correlated with the pregnancy rate, there was no significant difference.Our data suggest that the occurrence of pregnancy after ovulation induction with CC in women with PCOS is not associated with follicle size at the time of rupture.
