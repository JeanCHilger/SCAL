Successful treatment of a cervical pregnancy with a single low dose methotrexate regimen. Until very recently cervical pregnancies have been treated with surgery, usually hysterectomy. The development of endovaginal ultrasound, which allows early diagnosis, and methotrexate chemotherapy have opened up new therapeutic options. A 45-year-old multigravida presented at 8 weeks' gestation with vaginal bleeding. Endovaginal ultrasound demonstrated a cervical pregnancy with a fetal pole, 1.2 x 1.4 cm sac, no cardiac pulsations, and an empty uterus. After discussion with the patient, single low dose methotrexate 1.5 mg/m2 was given intramuscularly. The patient's hCG titre was 5882 IU-(Third International Standard). Over a 5-week period the hCG titres fell, and the gestational sac disappeared. The patient experienced intermittent vaginal bleeding and cramping but was managed as an outpatient. Single low dose methotrexate may be a successful management option in selected cases of cervical pregnancy.
