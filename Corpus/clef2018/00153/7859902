Vascular resistance in uterine and ovarian arteries: its association with infertility and the prognosis of infertility. In this study we investigated the blood flow in uterine (u.a.) and ovarian arteries (o.a.) in healthy women and infertility patients and the relationship of vascular resistance to the etiology and the prognosis of infertility. A total of 101 consecutive infertility patients referred to hospital for investigations were studied by Doppler ultrasound. Couples with male infertility were excluded. The control group comprised 19 healthy women having regular menstrual cycle and no history of infertility. The pulsatility index (PI) in o.a. and u.a. was measured in pre- and post-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle. The PI values of the controls were compared with those of the patients with various infertility etiologies. The PI values of the infertility patients who subsequently delivered were compared with those of the patients failing to deliver. Infertility patients had high PI in o.a. and u.a. in the luteal phase more often than controls. High vascular resistance in u.a. and o.a. in the luteal phase reduce the take-baby-home rate.
