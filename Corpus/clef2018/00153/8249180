Color-Doppler ultrasound in ovarian masses: anatomo-pathologic correlation. In the radiologic assessment of ovarian masses, the major difficulty consists in the late recognition and lack of parameters for a differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lesions, especially in the post-menopause when the incidence of cancer is higher. The use of a transvaginal probe and the color-Doppler examination have recently improved the study of the female pelvis. This study is aimed to verify the possibility of the color-Doppler imaging to differentiate between malignant and benign ovarian lesions during transvaginal echographies, on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the vascular pattern of the ovarian lesions.Twenty-six expansive ovarian lesions were studied: 8/26 showed no vascular signals and were considered benign as confirmed at histology. In the remaining lesions with some vascularization, the resistance index (RI) was evaluated: those with RI > 0.40 were considered benign, those with RI < 0.40 malignant. In 8/9 benign lesions and 7/9 malignant neoplasms, the results of color-Doppler were coherent with histology. The results showed a sensibility of 87.5% and a specificity of 88.8% for the transvaginal examination.The main advantages of the color-Doppler transvaginal examination are: the high frequency of visualization of the ovaries, even in postmenopausal patients the definition of small lesions
