Abdominal ultrasound combined with histological and cytological fine needle biopsy of suspected ovarian tumors. To investigate, in a population of women suspected of an ovarian mass, whether pelvic ultrasound (US) and US combined with US-guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) increased the detection rate and whether tumor specific diagnoses could be obtained, a cohort of 307 patients suspected of an ovarian mass underwent US examination as part of routine gynecologic work-up. In cases of solid or solid/cystic lesions a US guided FNB for histology as well as cytology was proposed. All 35 primary ovarian cancers, 6 of 7 secondary ovarian cancers, and 3 of 4 non-ovarian cancers were demonstrated on US. Among 17 cases with normal palpation and an ovarian mass on US, operation disclosed 3 ovarian cancers. FNB identified 24 of 27 primary ovarian cancers and 7 of 7 cancers of extra-ovarian origin. The use of US, in this study, increased the detection of masses in the pelvis and FNB provided a reliable verification.
