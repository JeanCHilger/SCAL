Work-up and management of incidentally found hypoechoic lesions of the testis. This study reviews our experience with the presentation of occult echo-poor lesions of the testis in patients who were seen with problems such as infertility, prostatitis or orchialgia. A range of pathologic problems revealed by scrotal ultrasonography in these patients is presented, and we compared surgical and pathological findings to those of preoperative scrotal ultrasonography. Scrotal ultrasound appears to be a highly sensitive but nonspecific diagnostic technique.
