Early detection of endometrial cancer by transvaginal color Doppler. The present study aimed at evaluating the possibility of using transvaginal color Doppler sonography in early detection of endometrial cancer. This method was performed on 276 patients with uterine tumors before hysterectomy. Neovascularization was detected in 167 (67%) benign masses, while all malignant masses (26) were vascularised. The final diagnosis was made following pathological examination. Tumoral arterial blood flow was detected in all (26) patients with endometrial cancer. The blood flow analysis showed a significantly lower (P < 0.05) resistance index (RI = 0.37 +/- 0.07) in the cases of endometrial cancer than in patients with benign uterine lesions (0.54 +/- 0.09). Central vessels within endometrial carcinoma tended to have lower velocity and impedance compared to peripheral ones. Significant difference in the impedance of uterine artery blood flow, represented with RI between mentioned groups occurred (P < 0.05). There is a downward trend in the uterine artery RI in patients with endometrial cancer (mean RI = 0.64, ranged from 0.53 to 0.72) regarding benign lesions (mean RI 0.74, ranged from 0.64 to 0.82).
