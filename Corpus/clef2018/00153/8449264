Combined bilateral tubal and multiple intrauterine pregnancy after ovulation induction. Over the last 20 years, the frequency of multiple pregnancy has increased mainly because of the introduction of exogenous pituitary gonadotropins in the treatment of sterility. The incidence of ectopic pregnancies also increased during the same period of time. This paper describes the first reported case of a simultaneous bilateral tubal and multiple intra-uterine pregnancy after ovulation induction with human gonadotropins.
