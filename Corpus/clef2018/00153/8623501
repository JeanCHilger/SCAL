Endometrial ultrasonography - An alternative to invasive assessment in women with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. To test the reliability of endometrial sonography in selecting women with abnormal postmenopausal vaginal bleeding for further diagnostic assessment.Endometrial thickness was measured in 368 consecutive women by abdominal or vaginal sonography prior to invasive assessment (hysteroscopy, curettage). The association of abnormal and endometrial thickness (4 mm or greater) with endometrial cancer was determined.Abnormal endometrial thickness was observed in 116 of 368 women. Subsequent assessment diagnosed endometrial carcinoma in 16 subjects, 15 of whom had abnormal endometrial thickness. One case with normal endometrial thickness was suspected at sonography because of the irregular appearance of the endometrium.Had it been used to select subjects for further assessment, sonography would have missed no cancer, and unnecessary invasive assessment (under general anesthesia in 20% of cases) would have been spared in 68% (251/368) of the subjects. Endometrial sonography should be routinely used to select women with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding for further investigations.
