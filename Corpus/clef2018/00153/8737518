Value of ultrasound in early detection of endometrial carcinoma. The purpose of our study was to examine the diagnostic value of the biometry of the endometrium for the early detection of endometrial carcinomas in postmenopausal women as well as to compare our results with those of other authors.In 69 post menopausal women the endometrial thickness measured by vaginosonography before diagnostic curettage or hysterectomy was compared with the histological results.Using a cutoff value of 6 mm, a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 24%, a positive predictive value of 16%, and a negative predictive value of 97% were established.Endovaginal ultrasound evaluation of the endometrial thickness is not specific enough to be used screening method for the early detection of endometrial carcinoma.
