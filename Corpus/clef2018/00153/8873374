A fibroepithelial urethral polyp protruding into the base of the bladder: sonographic diagnosis. A case of congenital urethral polyp in a 10-month-old boy is presented. These rare congenital tumors can lead to urinary retention, hematuria, urinary tract infections, hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Traditionally the diagnosis was based either on voiding cystourethrography or cystoscopy. The sonographic features of these polyps have only been reported in a few cases in the past. This modality is not infrequently the imaging procedure of choice in the work-up of children with signs and symptoms related to the urinary system. In the case presented herein the polyp was demonstrated initially by sonography as a soft tissue mass arising at the base of the urinary bladder. The differential diagnosis of these lesions is presented.
