Primary male infertility caused by congenital prostatic cyst: sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Congenital cysts in the midline of the prostate gland can cause obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts leading to congestion and dilation of the seminal vesicles with the result of small volume ejaculate or infertility. We report the case of a patient who underwent transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of primary male infertility. The images obtained revealed a congenital cyst of the prostate gland. Transurethral marsupialization of the cyst subsequently resulted in normalization of the semen analysis and restitution of the patient's fertility.
