Interference of proteins involved in the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 with human papillomavirus E6-mediated degradation. The oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are able to efficiently target p53 for degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. We previously demonstrated inefficient HPV E6-mediated degradation and resulting high steady-state levels of p53 in cell hybrids between a peripheral neuroepithelioma cell line and a cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa). We now show that the p53 protein in these cell hybrids was cytoplasmically sequestered and exhibited sporadic punctate staining, which is characteristic of the p53 expression pattern observed in neuroblastic neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines, in which p53 is also sequestered. We hypothesized that the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in the cell hybrids might correlate with its inability to be rapidly degraded by HPV E6. Using NB cell lines as a model system to test this hypothesis, we demonstrated that the introduction of HPV E6 into two NB cell lines resulted in p53 insensitivity to HPV E6-mediated degradation. This was assessed by both pulse-chase analysis of p53 in metabolically labeled NB cells and western blotting. The enhanced stability of p53 was not due to a lack of HPV E6 expression or to a mutant conformation of the p53 protein. Our results therefore suggest that proteins involved in the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 may also interfere with the ability of HPV E6 to target p53 for degradation.
