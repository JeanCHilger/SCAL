Evaluation of the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and human papilloma virus infection in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. To investigate the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and the coexistence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.Cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and colposcopic examinations were performed in 48 renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Microbiological and histopathologic findings were discussed.The patients were evaluated as to cervical neoplasia risk factors and the results were found to be statistically insignificant (p>0.05). Genital neoplasia was encountered in 20 of the 48 renal transplant patients. Koilocytosis developed in 6 out of 8 (75%) patients who were receiving high dose immunosuppressive therapy due to transplant rejection. HPV was found in 2 out of 48 patients these 2 patients had koilocytosis in their cervical biopsies. The difference between the positive predictive value of colposcopic evaluation and the Pap smear was found to be insignificant (p>0.05). However, if colposcopy had not been performed in two cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia class I (CIN-I) and in one case of cervical microinvasive carcinoma, the cases would have been incorrectly diagnosed as normal by the false-negative results of the Pap smear.Renal transplant patients who were undergoing immunosuppressive therapy were found to be at increased risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. All the patients using immunosuppressive agents should be followed-up by Pap smears every six months and by colposcopic evaluation every year. Avoiding high-risk sexual acts will decrease the risk of HPV transmission and the risk of genital neoplasia as well.
