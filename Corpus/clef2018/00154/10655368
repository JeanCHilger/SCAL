A novel and rapid PCR-based method for genotyping human papillomaviruses in clinical samples. Many human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes are associated with cervical carcinoma. We demonstrate the utility of an innovative technique for genotyping of HPV in cervical tissue samples. This method provides an accurate means of identification of the specific HPV genotypes present in clinical specimens. By using the MY09-MY11 and the GP5(+)-GP6(+) consensus primer pairs, HPV sequences were amplified by nested PCR from DNA isolated from cervical smear samples. This led to the production of an approximately 140-bp PCR product from the L1 (major capsid) gene of any of the HPVs present in the sample. PCR was performed with a deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture which resulted in the incorporation of deoxyuridine into the amplified DNA product at positions where deoxythymidine would normally be incorporated at a frequency of about once or twice per strand. Following the PCR, the product was treated with an enzyme mix that contains uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) and endonuclease IV. UNG removes the uracil base from the nucleotide, and endonuclease IV cleaves the phosphodiester bond at this newly formed abasic site, producing fragments of various sizes. By having end labeled one of the amplification primers, a DNA ladder which is analogous to a "T-sequencing ladder" was produced upon electrophoresis of the products. By comparing this T-sequencing ladder to the known sequences of HPVs, the genotypes of unknown HPV isolates in samples were assigned. Data showing the utility of this technique for the rapid analysis of clinical samples are presented.
