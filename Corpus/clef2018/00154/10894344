Guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical smears 1998. Four important changes have been introduced in the revised guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical smears, 1998. 1. For the purposes of management, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS) have been included with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL/CIN1/HPV) except where the smear raises the possibility of a high grade squamous intraepthelial lesion (HSIL) or favours glandular dysplasia. 2. Women with low grade cytological and histological intraepithelial abnormalities will, after initial follow-up, revert to three yearly screening. 3. Requirements for those practising colposcopy have been defined. 4. A formal review of all cases of invasive cervical cancer is advocated.
