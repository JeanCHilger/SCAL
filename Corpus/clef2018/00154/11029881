A 35-year-old man with cerebral hemorrhage and pheochromocytoma: the second brain-dead organ donor in Japan. A 35-year-old man was brought into the emergency room of Keio University Hospital by ambulance because of a sudden onset of coma. His Glasgow Coma Scale was 3 and his blood pressure 150/100 mmHg. CT scanning revealed a subcortical hemorrhage 8 cm in diameter. His respiration deteriorated rapidly, and an emergency craniotomy was performed for hematoma removal and cerebral decompression. Postoperatively the patient remained in a deep coma (GCS = 3) requiring respiratory support. The family presented an organ donor card previously signed by the patient, and brain death was confirmed in accordance with Japan's transplant law. As a result of two tests conducted six hours apart brain death was confirmed on the 5th postoperative day. With the family's consent, the donor's heart, kidneys and skin were removed for organ transplantation to be performed in other institutions. An autopsy was performed after the removal of the organs and skin. An extensive subgaleal hemorrhage was found in the left cerebral hemisphere, and microscopic examination revealed extensive necrosis with karyolysis of neuronal cells, but no viable neuronal cells were found in the cerebrum. The brain stem was marked by edema, hemorrhage, infarction necrosis and neuronal cell loss. The cerebellum was swollen and congested and showed autolysis of the granular layer. These findings suggested brain death syndrome with respirator brain. Other autopsy findings included a huge pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland, bilateral bronchopneumonia, liver congestion and fatty metamorphosis with four cavernous hemangiomas, and mild chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. This patient was the second brain-dead organ donor and the first brain-dead patient to undergo postmortem examination in Japan.
