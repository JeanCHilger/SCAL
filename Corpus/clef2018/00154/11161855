Effect of BPV1 E2-mediated inhibition of E6/E7 expression in HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cells. E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk-type human papillomavirus are major etiological agents for cervical carcinomas and are continuously expressed in those cancer cells. They inhibit cell cycle control functions by inactivating p53 and Rb proteins and also immortalize cells through the induction of telomerase activity. Expression of E6 and E7 genes in HeLa, an HPV18-positive cell line, has been shown to be inhibited by the E2 protein of bovine papillomavirus (BPV1), and this resulted in the activation of the p53-mediated growth inhibitory pathway followed by an inhibition of cell proliferation. In this study, the effect of BPV1 E2-mediated inhibition of E6 and E7 expression was examined in HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines recently established from Korean patients.BPV1 E2 was expressed in the test cells through acute infection of an SV40-BPV1 recombinant virus. Its effect on cell proliferation was assessed through MTT and DNA synthesis assays, and the status of factors involved in cell cycle control was examined through Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.BPV1 E2 expression caused a significant decrease in E6/E7 transcription in all three cell lines. This was accompanied by an increase in the levels of p53 protein and activity and a decrease in the expression of Cdc25A, a Cdk2-activating phosphatase. Concomitantly, E2F1 activity and cellular DNA synthesis capacity were significantly reduced.These results indicate that inhibition of E6/E7 gene expression in the HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cells induces suppression in cell proliferation by activating the growth inhibitory factors, p53 and Rb, and also by downregulating the cell cycle stimulatory factor, Cdc25A.
