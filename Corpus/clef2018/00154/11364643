Cervical cancer and women with HIV. Cervical cancer is preventable, and can be cured when detected early. It has long been regarded as a disease of sexually active women, and malignancy in the cervix is now associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added cervical cancer to its list of AIDS-defining conditions in 1993. Women on immune suppressive therapies experience more HPV-related events, including warts, dysplasia and cancer. HIV-positive women need to continue monitoring their health via Pap smears every six months. Results from several studies are included, as well as guidelines for interpreting Pap results. A table details common treatments for warts.
