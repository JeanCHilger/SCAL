Changing risk factors for HIV infection. HIV infection in women is a growing problem in developing countries. Risk factors for HIV infection vary from country to country and may change with time.We describe a retrospective review of the epidemiologic characteristics and associated gynecologic diseases of all HIV-infected women seen at two tertiary-care hospitals in Mexico City.One hundred thirty consecutive patients were included in the study from March 1985 to January 1996. Mean age at HIV diagnosis was 36.2 years (range: 16-76). Of the 75 women diagnosed with AIDS prior to 1992, 58 (69%) were infected through blood transfusion and 17 (20%) through sexual contact. After January 1992, 11 (23%) acquired infection through blood transfusion and 28 (60%) through sexual contact these differences were statistically significant (p <0.0001). Prior to 1992, 66 (90%) women presented in stage IV, whereas after that year only 29 (51%) (p <0.001) presented in stage IV. Of 92 patients on whom a cervico-vaginal smear was carried out, human papillomavirus infection was identified in 22 (24%) women, nine (9.8%) had morphologic evidence of a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (four with mild or moderate dysplasia and five with in situ cervical carcinoma). Four patients had invasive cervical carcinoma.The main risk factor for HIV infection in Mexican women with AIDS changed from transfusion acquired to sexually acquired in 1992. As a country, we were successful in providing safe blood but failed to prevent sexual transmission. Our patients had a high frequency of cervical carcinoma and precursor lesions associated with human papilloma virus.
