Early monitoring of P(ti)O(2), P(ti)CO(2), pH and brain temperature in patients with brain injuries and the clinical significance. To explore the regulation of early brain tissue metabolic changing after brain injuries and the clinical significance.There were 17 patients with brain injuries. Early dire ct monitoring of P(ti)O(2), P(ti)CO(2), pH and brain temperature, dynamic observation of the relation between various parameters and clinics after brain injuries were performed.Early changes of P(ti)O(2), P(ti)CO(2) and pH were closely correlated with outcome. The death rate obviously increased when P(ti)O(2) was continuously lower than 9 mmHg within 24 hours after injuries. Secondary brain injury prolonged and aggravated brain tissue metabolic disturbance. When intracerebral pressure was over 30 mmHg P(ti)O(2) began to decrease. The brain temperature in brain death patients was evidently lower than axillary temperature.The direct monitoring of P(ti)O(2), P(ti)CO(2), pH and brain temperature is safe and accurate and can find early anoxia da mage to brain tissue and provide reliable basis for clinical therapy. It ha s an instructive significance in selecting and studying a new treatment method in brain injuries. And it can be taken as a criterion in clinical judging brain deaths.
