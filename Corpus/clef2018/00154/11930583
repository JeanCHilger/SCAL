The role of human papillomavirus in screening for cervical cancer. To review the options for effectively screening for cervical cancer, including human papilloma virus (HPV) identification, cytologic screening, colposcopy, or a combination approach. Current pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and patient preparation and education related to cervical cancer screening and prevention are also included.Comprehensive review of current literature, including research and review articles.Because the Papanicolau (Pap) smear is a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool, further studies must be done to identify the actual nature of discovered abnormalities. Of particular concern is the classification of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), which may simply indicate inflammation, or may be the first indicator of serious pathology. Following ASCUS Pap smears with HPV screening will allow for a clarification of the best approach to treatment. A screening algorithm supported by a review of the literature is proposed.Cervical cancer is a preventable disease caused by certain forms of HPV. Current screening protocols are based on the use of the Pap smear and in areas where this test is routine and available, morbidity and mortality rates have dropped dramatically. Many women throughout the world and in underserved regions of the U. S. do not have adequate access to routine screening with Pap smear technology. As long as women continue to die needlessly of cervical cancer, more comprehensive and accessible screening methods must be explored. (Cutting the unnecessary worldwide and in the U. S.).
