Prevalence of genital human papillomavirus among Lebanese women. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), and more specifically of HPV 16, in a group of Lebanese women.Type-specific prevalence of cervical HPV and the presence of cytological abnormalities were determined in a cohort of Lebanese women. The population included 1,026 women, 18-76 years, seeking routine gynecological care at a tertiary care center. Demographic and behavioral data were collected. HPV DNA was detected in cervical scrapes by polymerase chain reaction using consensus primers. Cervical cytological abnormalities were identified by Papanicoleau (Pap) smears.The mean age of our population was 40 +/- 11.3 years. General HPV DNA was detected in 50 patients (4.9%). The high-risk HPV type 16 DNA was detected in 31 patients (3%). Patients with HPV 16 were more likely to have an abnormal pap smear than those with negative tests (6.6% vs 1.6%, p < 0.05), and more likely, but not significantly, to be smokers (21.4% vs 18.4%, p = 0.5). The age-specific prevalence of HPV increased with age and peaked at 60-69 years.The prevalence of HPV in this small group of Lebanese women is similar to its prevalence in the Mediterranean countries. The presence of HPV, its known association with the development of cervical neoplasia, and the lack of a universal screening program for cervical cancer in our country should be used to enforce implementation of proper screening programs.
