Human papillomavirus type 16 status in cervical carcinoma cell DNA assayed by multiplex PCR. Integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA into host genome occurs early in cancer development and is probably an important event in malignant transformation of cervical cancer. The HPV genome integration usually disrupts E2 gene open reading frames. It results in the lack of E2 gene suppressor of the synthesis of E6 and E7 products which, in turn, leads to the overexpression of E6 and E7 genes. The oncogenic HPV types (HPV16, -18, -45, and -58) can be present as episomes or may integrate into human chromosomes. Sixty-six cervical cancer patients positive for HPV16 were tested for the presence of E6, E2, E1, and L1 genes. Multiplex PCR was carried out in all cases. Using cluster analysis, the calculated ratios of E1/E6, E2/E6, L1/E6, E1/E2, and E2/(E1*E6) gene amplification products were divided into two or three statistically different groups. These were used for statistical analysis of the prevalence of specific gene types in histological types of cancer, different levels of clinical staging, and histologically confirmed nodal metastases. The statistical analysis proved a significant correlation in the ratios of E2/E6 and E1/E2 only. The E2/E6 and E1/E2 were higher in carcinoma in situ than in advanced squamous cancers. The E2/E6 ratios were lower in higher clinical stages. The multiplex PCR estimation of the E2/E6 ratio could be a simple method for selecting patients with a high risk of a poor outcome in a standard stage-dependent treatment procedure.
