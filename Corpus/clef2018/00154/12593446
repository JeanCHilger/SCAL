Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and human papilloma virus infection in renal transplant recipients. An association between human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia has been well established Renal transplant recipients on long term immunosuppression are prone to viral infection. It is possible that there may be an increased prevalence of papilloma virus infection and associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in these women. Prospective study of 42 renal transplant recipients and 41 age and parity matched controls was undertaken to determine whether HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) occurred more often in renal allograft recipients and to assess the relative risk. All women underwent Pap smear, colposcopy, histological examination of biopsy specimen and polymerase chain reaction for HPV 16. Cytology did not pick up HPV infection in any of the women. Colposcopy revealed HPV infection in 15 and CIN in 14 women in the immunosuppressed group and HPV in 7 and CIN in 5 women in control group. Histological evidence of HPV was found in 24 and CIN in 10 women in immunosuppressed group and HPV infection in 13 and CIN in 3 women in control group, giving an odds ratio of 6.1. More women in the immunosuppressed group had CIN of higher degree as well. PCR revealed infection by HPV 16 in 17 cases and 14 controls giving an odds ratio of 1.3. Therefore renal allograft recipients on immunosuppression should be screened by colposcopy and directed biopsy at regular intervals.
