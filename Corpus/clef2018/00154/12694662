Evaluation of adenoassociated virus 2 and human papilloma virus 16 and 18 infection in cervical cancer biopsies. Protective roles of adenoassociated virus (AAV) 2 in cervical tumorigenesis are controversial. In an effort to clarify this issue, we tested prevalence of AAV 2 and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cervical lesions and adjacent normal tissues.Tissues of cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) I (20 patients), CIN II (24 patients), CIN III (25 patients), and invasive cancer (23 patients) were investigated by microdissection and PCR using HPV-16-, HVP-18-, and AAV-2-specific primers.AAV 2 was detected in 11 out of 20 CIN I (55%), 21 out of 24 CIN II (84.5%), 13 out of 25 CIN III (52%), and 12 out of 23 invasive cancer cases (52.2%). However, HPV 16 was detected in none out of 20 CIN I, 2 out of 24 CIN II (8.3%), 6 out of 25 CIN III (24%), and 6 out of 23 invasive cancer cases (26.1%). HPV 18 was detected in 1 case in CIN II (4.2%) and 2 cases in CIN III (8%). In 92 perilesional normal tissues, AAV 2 was detected in 53 cases (57.6%), displaying 25% of CIN I, 83.3% of CIN II, 52% of CIN III, and 65.2% of invasive cancer.The differences in AAV 2 prevalence are not significant between CIN and normal tissues. However, differences in HPV 16 are significant in CIN III and invasive cancer, as compared to CIN I, CIN II, and normal, suggesting no significant correlation between AAV 2 and cervical cancer. Thus, these results support the notion that AAV 2 is not associated with cervical tumorigenesis.
