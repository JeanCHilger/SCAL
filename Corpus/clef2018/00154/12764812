Expression and clinical implication of multidrug resistance gene and multidrug resistant-associated protein gene in patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. To study the relationship between the expression of MDR-1 mRNA/P-glycoprotein (P-gp). MRP mRNA and the clinical pathological characteristics of the patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assay was used to detect the expression of MDR-1 mRNA and MRP mRNA in 25 specimens of the untreated advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Meantime, immunohistochemistry SABC technique was used to test P-gp in 60 tumor specimens.The positive expression rates of MDR-1mRNA and P-gp in hypopharyngeal carcinoma were 48 percent (12/25) and 38.3 percent(23/60), respectively. There was a correlation between expression of MDR-1 mRNA and its product P-gp in 25 patients using RT-PCR assay(P < 0.05). The positive expression rate of MRP mRNA was 52 percent (13/25), which was significantly related to metastases of cervical lymph node (P < 0.01).Forty-eight percent of the untreated patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma presented positive expression of MDR-1 mRNA, which was correlated with its gene product P-gp. The expression of MRP mRNA was associated with increased tumor dissemination and metastases.
