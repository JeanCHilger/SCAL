Detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA from a lymphoma-like lesion of the uterine cervix. The case of a 60-year-old woman in whom a lymphoma-like lesion of the cervix was found during an episode of silent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is presented. Fractional curettage was performed because of abnormal endometrial smear. The endocervical curettage specimens were diagnosed as highly suggestive of malignant lymphoma, but microscopic examination of a subsequent hysterectomy specimen revealed a benign lymphoid hyperplasia. Those were retrospectively interpreted as a lymphoma-like lesion of the cervix. In the absence of clinical symptoms of infectious mononucleosis, the results of serologic tests for EBV revealed an active EBV infection. EBV DNA was demonstrated in nuclei of large lymphoid cells in endocervical curettage specimens by in situ hybridization. She is alive and well 32 months postoperatively. When female patients with lymphoma-like lesions of the lower genital tract are encountered, examinations for EBV are recommended.
