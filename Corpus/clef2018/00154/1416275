Monitoring of intracranial pressure with intraparenchymal fiberoptic transducer. Technical aspects and clinical reliability. A fiberoptic intracranial pressure transducer (Camino) was assessed prospectively in 100 patients. In all, 122 sensors were inserted intraparenchymally at the bedside, without the help of a neurosurgeon. Before the procedure, patients were given 2 to 4 mg of phenoperidine. The scalp was opened over a few millimeters in the frontal paramedian area. A burr holc was made with a 2 mm bit. The dura mater was opened and a hollow screw inserted in the diploÃ«. When the zero of the transducer had been obtained, a 5 cm length was inserted within the screw. The transducer was then about 5 mm deep within cerebral parenchyma. The procedure took an average of about 15 min. An intracerebral haematoma around the transducer occurred five times. One had to be drained surgically. There were no infectious complications. The daily baseline drift was about 0.3 mmHg. The system seemed to be reliable: there was close agreement between the intracranial pressure (ICP), neurological status and CT scan findings. In trauma cases, there was also good correlation between mean ICP and the basal cistern obliteration score, finally, ICP became equivalent to mean arterial blood pressure in all brain dead patients. It is concluded that this system may be used in all cases where ICP requires to be monitored, even when the lateral ventricles are no longer visible, or when craniotomy has been performed. This will most probably result in a more extended use of ICP monitoring in neurosurgical intensive care.
