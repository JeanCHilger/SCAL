A meta-analysis of ultrasound-guided versus clinical touch embryo transfer. To determine the relative efficacy of ultrasound-guided embryo transfer and embryo transfer by clinical touch alone.Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing ultrasound-guided embryo transfer with embryo transfer by clinical touch alone.Infertility centers providing treatment with in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer.Women undergoing embryo transfer.Embryo transfer with or without transabdominal ultrasound guidance.Clinical pregnancy rate and embryo implantation rate.A total of eight prospective controlled trials were identified. Of these studies, four were nonrandomized or quasi-randomized and four were genuinely randomized. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly increased chance of clinical pregnancy following ultrasound-guided embryo transfer in all studies and in the genuinely randomized subgroup. The embryo implantation rate was also significantly increased following ultrasound-guided embryo transfer.Ultrasound-guided embryo transfer significantly increases the chance of clinical pregnancy and significantly increases the embryo implantation rate.
