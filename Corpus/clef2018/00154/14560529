Testing for human papillomavirus: data driven implications for cervical neoplasia management. The results of the National Cancer Institute-sponsored ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), the only randomized longitudinal trial in cytopathology, have provided a wealth of data to benchmark practice and stimulate discussion regarding the usefulness of human papillomavirus testing. These landmarks aided the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology's broad-based consensus conference in integrating the Bethesda deliberations and ALTS data into clinical management. The outcomes of these open- and wide-ranging discussions have a direct impact on all who practice in this area. This article highlights the impact of these data on the contemporary practice of cytopathology and emphasizes the interaction between pathologists and clinicians.
