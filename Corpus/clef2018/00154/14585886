Can history, ultrasound, or ELISA chlamydial antibodies, alone or in combination, predict tubal factor infertility in subfertile women? This study aimed to determine whether medical history, transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) or Chlamydia trachomatis antibody testing (CAT), alone or in combination, could provide a non-invasive, clinically useful screening test for predicting tubal factor infertility (TFI) in subfertile women.Prior to tubal evaluation, relevant medical history, TVU findings, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG CAT results were collected. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR) and accuracy for predicting TFI, as determined by laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation, were calculated for each test alone, and in parallel and series combination.Thirty per cent (63/207) were diagnosed with TFI. The highest sensitivity (67%, 95% CI: 54-77) included any positive test, yet missed one in three women with TFI. The highest specificity (100%, 95% CI: 97-100) required all three tests positive, but identified only three women. Only the combination of CAT and TVU rated as a good clinical test, but confidence intervals were wide due to the small numbers affected. The combination of CAT or TVU and CAT alone reported the highest accuracy (73%, 95% CI: 66-78), misdiagnosing one in four women.Medical history, TVU appearances, and ELISA IgG CAT alone, or in combination, failed to predict accurately TFI in subfertile women.
