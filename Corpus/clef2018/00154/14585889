Depletion of ovarian reserve in young women after treatment for cancer in childhood: detection by anti-Müllerian hormone, inhibin B and ovarian ultrasound. Treatment of cancer during childhood may result in loss of primordial follicles from the ovary.Ten cancer survivors and 11 controls with regular menstrual cycles, in addition to 10 cancer survivors and 10 controls taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) were recruited. Subjects were investigated on days 3-5 of a menstrual cycle, or week 3 of COCP administration before and 24 h after administration of 225 IU FSH.Serum FSH levels were elevated in cancer survivors with regular menstrual cycles (7.5 +/- 1.4 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 IU/l P = 0.02), while anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were lower (13.0 +/- 3.0 versus 21.0 +/- 3.4 pmol/lThe study results demonstrate both hormonal and biophysical evidence of partial loss of the ovarian reserve in young cancer survivors. This was detected both in women with normal menstrual cycles and during COCP administration.
