Correlation between histological criteria and human papillomavirus presence based on PCR assay in cervical biopsies. The aim was to correlate histological findings in cervix lesions to human papillomavirus (HPV), as detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One hundred and seven women with atypical Pap smear were submitted to colposcopic examination, and suspicious images were biopsied. The PCR assay was performed with the primers MY09/11 and GP05/06+ and, as control, the beta-globin gene was amplified. The morphological findings were correlated to HPV positivity: parakeratosis, acanthosis, koilocytotic atypia (KA), binucleation, dyskeratosis, and number of mitoses. From 107 patients, 61 biopsies were taken: 11 chronic cervicitis (CC), 36 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (13 CIN I 10 CIN IIAlthough indicative, none of the studied morphological criteria was always related to PCR virus detection, denoting some limitations for histological diagnosis.
