A 71-year-old man with Cushing reflex. The Cushing reflex in comatose intensive care patients usually indicates that intracranial perfusion is about to be abolished.A 71-year-old man suffered an attack during which he became comatose. After 14 hours he developed polyuria, dilated fixed pupils and Cushing reflex. The cause was believed to be a global anoxic brain oedema. Coma, apnoea and absent brain stem reflexes suggested brain death.Angiography with contrast injected into the aortic arch showed preserved circulation in both internal carotid, middle and anterior cerebral arteries, but absence of basilar artery circulation. A cerebral CT scan was initially normal, but 14 hours later a new scan demonstrated infarction of the brain stem, cerebellum and occipital lobes. The Norwegian criteria for organ donation were not fulfilled as these require stop of all intracranial circulation. The respirator was disconnected and the patient died.The Cushing reflex can be seen after profound ischaemia in the posterior cerebral circulation with preserved circulation to the forebrain. Ischaemia of the brain stem alone may be sufficient to elicit the Cushing reflex.
