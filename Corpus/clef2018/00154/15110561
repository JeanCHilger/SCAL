Living donor kidney transplant in Italy: is the underutilization justified? Living donor transplants (LDtx) represent an underutilized resource in Italy. It is, however, a therapeutic option that deserves greater consideration not only due to the increasing gap between the number of uremic patients on waiting lists (6956) and the number (1464) of cadaveric transplants (CADtx), as evidenced in 2002, but also due to the advantages of LDtx over CADtx. The superiority of LDtx include better graft survival, independent of the donor/recipient relationship, less need for dialytic treatment with preemptive transplants and reduced immunogenicity of the graft due to the brain death-related "cytokine storm." Moreover, some emerging procedures namely laparoscopic nephrectomy instead of open surgery and spiral CT instead of renal angiography namely, reduce the physical and socioeconomic burden of the donor. In the light of these considerations, LDtx should be reconsidered in the Italian scenario of kidney transplantation.
