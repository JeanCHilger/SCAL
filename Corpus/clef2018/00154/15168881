Cytologic differential diagnostic problems in ulcerative cervicitis. To improve the detection rates in the determination of signs consistent with ulcerative cervicitis against signs of intraepithelial neoplasia, in PAP smears.We investigated the frequency of establishing a diagnosis of a simple ulcerative cervicitis by histology in a cohort of 58 females with cervical cytology suggestive of intraepithelial neoplasia.There was found a detection rate of 81.58% in the determination of ulcerative cervicitis by cytology and a rate of 100% in the determination of HPV-infection, CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3 respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between cytology and histology in the diagnosis of ultracerative cervicitis (p>0.5, chi-square).There is an overestimation of the cytological signs in the diagnosis of ulcerative cervicitis 18.42%). There is also an excellent agreement in the diagnosis of HPV-infection and CIN grades (100%) between cytology and histology, discordant with the literature (2.4%-71%).
