Prevalence and typing of HPV DNA by hybrid capture II in women with ASCUS, ASC-H, LSIL, and AGC on ThinPrep Pap tests. Testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA is now a viable option for the management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). The utility of reflexive HPV DNA testing for women with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells-not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS), ASCUS subtypes, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) has not been well established. In the present investigation, reflex Hybrid Capture II HPV DNA testing results were evaluated for HPV prevalence and type in 371 women with abnormal cytologic diagnoses of ASCUS-not otherwise specified (ASCUS-NOS), ASCUS-suspicious for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASCUS-L), atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), AGC-NOS, and LSIL on ThinPrep Pap tests. Positive high-risk HPV DNA was identified in 53.6% of the study samples, including ASCUS-NOS 40.2% ASCUS-L 71.4%, ASC-H 37.5%, LSIL 88.6%, and AGC-NOS 0%. We conclude that reflex HPV DNA testing appears to not be useful for colposcopy triage for cytologic diagnoses of LSIL or AGC-NOS.
