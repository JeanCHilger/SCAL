Effect of age on ovarian stromal flow measured by three-dimensional ultrasound with power Doppler in Chinese women with proven fertility. Increasing age is associated with reduced ovarian stromal blood flow detected by three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasound in infertile patients. However, little information exists in the literature regarding the effect of age on the ovarian stromal blood flow in fertile women.On the second to fourth day of their menstrual cycle, fertile Chinese women who had regular monthly cycles and no history of tubal and ovarian surgery underwent a transvaginal scan with 3D power Doppler to determine total antral follicle count (AFC), total ovarian volume, total ovarian vascularization index (VI)/flow index (FI)/vascularization flow index (VFI). Serum FSH and vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations were checked.Out of 177 women scanned, 138 women were included in the final analysis. Total AFC and serum FSH were significantly different among four age groups (< or = 30, 31-35, 36-40 and > or = 41 years). Total ovarian VI and VFI were significantly lower in women aged > or = 41 years. AFC had the best correlation with the age of women, followed by serum FSH concentration and ovarian 3D power Doppler indices. The rate of decline of total ovarian VI was 0.18% per year.Ovarian stromal blood flow was significantly reduced only in women aged > or = 41 years.
