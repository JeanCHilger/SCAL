A second Pap smear during colposcopy: is it really worth it? The aim of this study was to determine whether the clinical value of a second Pap smear during colposcopy outweighed its cost-effectiveness and reliability parameters. We studied retrospectively 569 cases focusing on A) The initial Pap smear, B) The smear performed during colposcopy, C) The colposcopic findings, and D) The histopathological reports of the cases where biopsy sampling was performed. In 380 patients (67%), the second Pap smear corresponded to the first one. In 13% of the patients, the cytological lesions were worse (particularly in 2% of the patients staging increased from HPV-associated reactive cellular changes to CIN II, or from CIN I to CIN III), and in 20% slighter than the initial. In 79% of the cases revealing more serious lesions in the second smear, the histological result of the biopsy corresponded to that of the initial smear. Conclusively, only 2% seem to benefit from a second repeat Pap smear during referral colposcopy.
