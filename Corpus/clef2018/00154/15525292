Undulating toe movements in brain death. For many years, death implied immobility. Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports of spontaneous or reflex movements (SRMs) in patients with Brain death (BD). The presence of some movements can preclude the diagnosis of BD, and consequently, the possibility of organ donation for transplantation. McNair and Meador [(1992), Mov Dord7: 345-347] described the presence of undulating toe flexion movements (UTF) in BD patients. UTF consists in a sequential brief plantar flexion of the toes. Our aim was to determine the frequency, characteristics and predisposing factors of UTF movements in a prospective multicenter cohort study of patients with BD. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of BD were assessed to evaluate the presence of UTF using a standardized protocol. All patients had a routine laboratory evaluation, CT scan of the head, and EEG. Demographic, clinical, hemodynamic and blood gas concentration factors were analyzed. amongst 107 BD patients who fulfilled the AAN requirements, 47 patients (44%) had abnormal movements. UTF was observed in 25 (23%) being the most common movement (53%). Early evaluation (OR 4.3, CI95% 1.5-11.9) was a predictor of UTF in a multivariate regression model. The somato-sensory evoked potential (SSEPs) as well as brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) did not elicit a cortical response in studied patients with UTF. This spinal reflex is probably integrated in the L5 and S1 segments of the spinal cord. Abnormal movements are common in BD, being present in more than 40% of individuals. UTF was the most common spinal reflex. In our sample, early evaluation was a predictor of UTF. Health care professionals, especially those involved in organ procurement for transplantation, must be aware of this sign. The presence of this motor phenomenon does not preclude the diagnosis of BD.
