Expression and function of laminin receptor in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. To investigate the role of 67 000 laminin receptor (LN-R) in the processes of invasion and metastasis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.Expression of 67 000 LN-R mRNA in 20 cases with laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas and corresponding normal tissues was determined by RT-PCR, and the relationship between its expression level and patients' clinicopathological features was analyzed. Expression of 67 000 LN-R on the surface of AMC-HN-8 laryngeal carcinoma cells was examined by flow cytometry. The effect of 67 000 LN-R monoclonal antibody (MLuC5) on the adhesive and invasive abilities was observed by adhesion test and Boyden chamber invasiveness test in vitro.The expression level of 67 000 LN-R mRNA in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that in normal tissues (P < 0.05). The expression level of 67 000 LN-R mRNA in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas with cervical lymph node metastases was higher than in those without cervical lymph node metastases (P < 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between the expression level of 67 000 LN-R mRNA and the degree of tumor differentiation, the level being higher in poorly differentiated tumors (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry showed that (80.9 +/- 0.9)% of AMC-HN-8 cells expressed 67 000 LN-R. MLuC5 inhibited the adhesion of AMC-HN-8 cells on LN, and after treated with MLuC5 for 60 and 120 minutes, the adhesion inhibition rate was 57.1% and 63.2%, respectively. The invasive ability to artificial basement membrane was reduced by MLuC5.Laryngeal carcinoma overexpressing 67 000 LN-R has stronger invasiveness, and 67 000 LN-R monoclonal antibody may contribute to prevent metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma.
