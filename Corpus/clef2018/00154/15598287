Colposcopic and histologic findings in women with a cytologic diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. The optimal method for managing a patient diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) has not yet been established. The interim guidelines published by the National Cancer Institute suggest that a patient should be referred for colposcopy after the second ASCUS diagnosis within 2 years.To assess the significance of ASCUS in predicting the presence of underlying squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) of the uterine cervix.Women undergoing colposcopy for ASCUS cytology at a teaching hospital in Tehran University, in the years 1998-2001, considered eligible to enter this retrospective study.Of the 266 patients who underwent colposcopy, 28 (11%) had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 16 (6.3%) had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) two (0.8%) had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 48 (18.8%) had flat condyloma.Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) on a cervical smear is a good marker for detecting underlying SIL and condyloma. Thus, immediate colposcopy and directed biopsy are appropriate follow-up procedures.
