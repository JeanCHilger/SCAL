Identification by CT scan of ischemic stroke patients with high risk of brain death. The identification of patients with high risk of evolution to brain death is one of the more important tasks of transplant coordination teams. Although most of pool of potential donors come from the group of patients who suffer a head injury or hemorrhagic stroke, the procurement of organs from brain-dead patients suffering an ischemic stroke as the cause of brain damage must also be considered. The main objective of this study was to investigate the radiological signs that in the CT scan of admission to a neurological ICU are more frequently associated with progression to brain death. We studied the CT scans of 15 brain-dead patients after an ischemic stroke versus the scans of 15 recovered patients admitted to ICU with the same diagnosis. The radiological signs included: insular ribbon sign, hyperintensities inside the big arteries of the base of the skull, hemispheric hypodensities, midline shift, and compression of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. There were two signs significantly associated with brain death: midline shifts and the compression of the ambiens cistern. It may be concluded that analysis of the CT scan at admission of patients with an ischemic stroke in the ICU can predict the risk of evolution to brain death.
