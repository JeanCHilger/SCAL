A case report of split liver transplantation for two adult recipients in Korea. We report a case of split liver transplantation (SLT) for two adult recipients, which was the first successful case in Korea. The brain-dead donor was a 22-year-old man weighing 65 kg, but his liver volume was estimated as 2120 mL on computed tomographic volumetry. As it seemed to be too large for a 60-kg recipient candidate, SLT was planned after assessment of lobar liver volume and middle hepatic vein anatomy. The right lobe was mobilized first and the liver parenchyma transected along the right border of the middle hepatic vein. The 1240-g right lobe (segments 5 to 8) graft was implanted into a 57-year-old male patient with acute-on-chronic liver failure in the same manner as a living-donor graft. After that, routine procedures of cadaveric multiorgan procurement were performed. The 670-g left lobe (segments 1 to 4) with a retrohepatic vena cava, common bile duct, and aortic patch was implanted into another 37-year-old male recipient. These two recipients recovered uneventfully surviving 12 months to date. We integrated the surgical techniques learned from hundreds of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplants into this first trial of two adult SLT.
