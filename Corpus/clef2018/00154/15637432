Successful pregnancy and delivery after removal of gonadotrope adenoma secreting follicle-stimulating hormone in a 29-year-old amenorrheic woman. We report a case of ovarian hyperstimulation related to a gonadotroph adenoma in a 29-year-old woman. The patient presented with amenorrhea and large cystic ovaries. Her serum estradiol was markedly elevated (up to 31,100 pmol/l). Serum LH was low, but serum FSH and PRL were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging study revealed a pituitary macroadenoma. After successful removal of the pituitary tumor, FSH, LH and estradiol normalized and fluctuated within normal ranges thereafter. The patient resumed regular cycles of menstruation and conceived spontaneously. During pregnancy, estradiol increased and FSH and LH decreased. The finding confirms restoration of negative feedback of estradiol on FSH and LH secretion. The pregnancy course was uneventful and enlargement of ovaries did not occur.
