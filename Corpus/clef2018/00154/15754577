Cervical pregnancy. Until quite recently the diagnosis of cervical pregnancy was an indication for hysterectomy, because of mortality among patients with cervical pregnancy, coming up to 60%. During last 15 years methods of conservative therapy has developed in order to avoid the necessity of hysterectomy and to keep patient's fertility. Among these the most promising method is using of methotrexate (MTX), which is now the most commonly used agent in case of conservative forms for the treatment of cervical pregnancies. It should be stressed successful in treatment of cervical pregnancy in women, who wish to remain fertile, depends on early and proper diagnosis. MTX can be administered up to 13 weeks of gestation, with the highest efficacy between 6-8 weeks of pregnancy. We reported a case of cervical pregnancy treated successfully with methotrexate therapy combined with curettage of the cervical canal and uterine cavity. Serial beta HCG serum determination and ultrasonography were used to diagnose the pregnancy and to monitor therapy. Treatment was effective and the patient reproductive capability was preserved.
