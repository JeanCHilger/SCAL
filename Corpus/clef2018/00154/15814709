Intraepithelial cell neutralization of HIV-1 replication by IgA. HIV is transmitted sexually through mucosal surfaces where IgA Abs are the first line of immune defense. In this study, we used paired IgA and IgG mAbs against HIV gp160 to study intraepithelial cell neutralization and inhibition of HIV replication. African green monkey kidney cells, Vero C1008, polarizable epithelial cells transfected to express the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), were transfected with HIV proviral DNA, and intracellular neutralization mediated by the mAbs was assessed. D47A and D19A IgA, which neutralized HIV in a conventional assay, potently inhibited intracellular HIV replication as assessed by infecting HeLa-CD4-long terminal repeat/beta-galactosidase cells (human cervical carcinoma cell line) and CEMx174 cells (human T cell line) with apical supernatant, basolateral medium, and cell lysate from transfected cells. D47A also inhibited the production of virus as assessed by direct assay of p24. In contrast, D47 and D19 IgG, sharing the same V regions, but which were not transcytosed by the pIgR, did not inhibit intracellular HIV replication, nor did D47A and D19A IgA in pIgR- cells, incapable of transcytosing IgA. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed prominent colocalization of HIV protein and D47A, in agreement with the intracellular neutralization data. D10A, which did not neutralize HIV in the conventional assay, and irrelevant IgA did not show intracellular neutralization or colocalization. Control studies with two kinds of conditioned medium confirmed that HIV neutralization had indeed occurred inside the cells. Thus, during its transcytosis through epithelial cells, HIV-specific IgA can neutralize HIV replication.
