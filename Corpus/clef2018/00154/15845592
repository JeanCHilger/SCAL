The safety of ultrasonically guided testis aspiration biopsies and efficacy of use to predict varicocelectomy outcome. We hypothesized that infertile men with varicoceles have molecular/genetic defects that interact with varicoceles to induce infertility. Studies directly on testis tissue appeared to be a way to link histology, markers for molecular/genetic defects and spermatogenesis, but testis biopsies may induce morbidity. In this report, we present safety and efficacy data on ultrasonically guided, single stick, percutaneous aspiration.Biopsies were performed on 115 infertile men with varicoceles and five men with obstructive azoospermia. Morbidity was examined by pre- and post-biopsy ultrasound, efficacy by ability of two markers to predict >50% increase in sperm density post-operatively. All patients had three pre- and three post-operative semen analyses.78.3% of patients had no ultrasonic testicular defects immediately post-biopsy. By 2 months, 100% had no defects. Biopsy markers [testicular cadmium (<0.453 ng/mg tissue) and an intact calcium channel mRNA sequence] predicted >50% increase in sperm density with 82.9 and 90.5% accuracy, respectively.Ultrasonically controlled, percutaneous aspiration testis biopsies are safe. Specimens so acquired can assist study of molecular/genetic markers associated with spermatogenesis in infertile men with varicoceles. Tissue cadmium level, calcium channel sequence and other markers may predict outcome of varicocele surgery.
