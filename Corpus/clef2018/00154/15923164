Survivin as a marker of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and high-risk human papillomavirus and a predictor of virus clearance and prognosis in cervical cancer. We analyzed survivin as a marker of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and a predictor of HPV clearance and disease outcome in cervical cancer in 302 samples (squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs], 150 CIN lesions, 152) by immunohistochemical staining with survivin antibody and HPV testing using polymerase chain reaction. HR-HPV types were associated closely with CIN and SCC. There was a significant linear relationship between grade and intensity of survivin expression (P = .0001). Survivin overexpression also was associated strongly with HR-HPV type (P = .0001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed survivin and p16(INK4a) as equally strong independent predictors of HR-HPV. Deregulated survivin expression did not predict clearance or persistence of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN or survival in cervical cancer in univariate (P = .417) or multivariate analysis. After adjustment for HR-HPV, stage, age, and tumor grade in the Cox regression model, only stage (P = .0001) and age (P = .0001) remained independent prognostic predictors. Survivin seems to be an early marker of cervical carcinogenesis. Up-regulated survivin expression was an independent predictor of HR-HPV in cervical lesions, most plausibly explained by its normal transcriptional repression by wild-type p53 being eliminated by HR-HPV E6 oncoprotein.
