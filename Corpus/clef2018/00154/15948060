Fitz-Hugh-Curtis-syndrome mimicking acute cholecystitis: value of new ultrasound findings in the differential diagnosis. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis is a rare syndrome characterised by perihepatitis following pelvic inflammatory disease. We report the case of a patient with a right ovarian teratoma, abnormal liver tests and pain in the right abdomen and shoulder, initially attributed to an acalculous cholecystitis. Before gynaecological surgery, a repeat ultrasound scan found several small avascular peritoneal masses at the upper dome of the liver, not reported in the initial examination. This prompted laparoscopic exploration of the subdiaphragmatic space, and the final diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis-syndrome was made. Such ultrasound finding appears to be a new diagnostic feature of this syndrome.
