Brain death after severe traumatic brain injury: the role of systemic secondary brain insults. Secondary brain insults predominantly due to hypotension are frequent among patients with fatal traumatic brain injury. We assessed the correlation between different systemic secondary brain insults and brain death in 404 patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) after severe traumatic brain injury. We collated data on hypoxemia and hypotension prior to as well as the occurrence of hypoxemia, hypotension, shock, anemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperthermia within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. We also considered both the presence of extracranial injuries and the category of traumatic brain injury using computerized tomography. The 59 patients (14.6%) who developed brain death, were significantly older than patients without a fatal neurological outcome (46.1 +/- 22 vs 29.5 +/- 14.9 years P < .0001). Intracranial mass lesions, whether surgically evacuated were more frequent among brain-dead patients. The systemic secondary brain insults significantly associated with brain death were hypoxemia, hypotension, shock, anemia, and hyperglycemia within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. After multivariate analysis, the factors that independently predicted brain death were the occurrence of shock (odds ratio [OR], 6.74
