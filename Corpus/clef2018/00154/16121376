Epidemiologic correlates of cervical human papillomavirus prevalence in women with abnormal Pap smear tests: a Taiwan Cooperative Oncology Group (TCOG) study. To explore factors affecting human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence in all grades of cervical neoplasia among Chinese women, 1,264 women with abnormal cervical cytology attending the gynaecologic clinics of 11 major medical centres in Taiwan. Patients were interviewed and underwent complete gynaecologic examination including colposcopy. Cervical scrapings were collected for HPV DNA detection by both Hybrid Capture-2 (high-risk probe) and L1 consensus PCR-reverse line blot. The prevalences of HPV in the four different diagnosis groups: (i) suspicious (n = 316), (ii) low-grade intraepithelial lesion (n = 474), (iii) high-grade intraepithelial lesion (n = 450), and (iv) cancer (n = 16), were 36.1%, 74.7%, 83.6%, and 100%, respectively. In the latter two groups, Patients less than 30 or 40 years old, respectively, tended to be infected more frequently with HPV than the older patients were. The main correlates of HPV prevalence were lifetime number of sex partners (odds ratio (OR) for two or more partners: 2.44 95% CI, 1.44-4.15), vaginal douching after intercourse (OR for douching frequently: 1.44
