The role of ultrasound scanning of endometrium in the superovulation stimulation program during in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. The intensive introduction of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer into the clinical practice of sterility treatment has conditioned the necessity of developing reliable methods of control of the response of ovaries to the application of gonadotropic hormones for stimulating superovulation. There is not sufficient data about prognostic value of ultrasound scanning of structure of endometrium before or after the day of HCG administration in IVF cycles. Several authors have revealed differences in endometrial structure between the women with or without pregnancy. According to the results of our studies, the endometrium thickness has a rather positive prognostic index for evaluating the possibility of the occurrence of pregnancy. Therefore, it is a highly informative ultrasound criterion for making a decision of the completion of superovulation induction and introduction of the embryo transfer and, consequently, makes an important contribution to the in vitro fertilization procedure optimization.
