Diagnosis of male infertility. A detailed medical history and clinical examination are important steps in the diagnosis of male infertility. Tests include semen analysis according to WHO standards, laboratory tests (mainly determination of follicle-stimulating hormone) and scrotal sonography. Invasive diagnostic procedures, such as testicular biopsy or investigation of seminal pathway obstruction, are generally combined with therapeutic sperm retrieval for cryopreservation or microsurgical refertilization.
