Ovarian neoplasms and pregnancy. The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence of ovarian malignant neoplasms in pregnancy. In the prospective study, during a 2-year period of time, we had the ethical dilemma concerning the conciliar treatment vs the patient's wish to deliver and save the reproductive capabilities. We examined 37 pregnant women the incidence of ovarian cancer was 13.5% vs 6.5% in other works. Diagnoses were made by ultrasound criteria and physical examinations. Statistically significant results were obtained by Student t test. Mean gestational age was 20.1 weeks and mean age 31.1 years. Treatment depends on the neoplasms type, grade, and presence of the metastatic pathways. In benign neoplasms, we used laparoscopic treatment with minor invasion. Distribution of benign neoplasms was in the same range as that in other works.
