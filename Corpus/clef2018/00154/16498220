Meningeal hemangiopericytoma manifesting as massive intracranial hemorrhage--two case reports. Meningeal hemangiopericytoma is rare, and only seven cases have manifested as intracranial hemorrhage. We treated two patients with meningeal hemangiopericytoma manifesting as life-threatening massive intracerebral hemorrhage. Case 1: A 66-year-old woman presented with consciousness disturbance and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography showed a mass lesion in the right frontal parasagittal region and massive hematoma in the brain tissue at the medial border of the lesion. Immediate evacuation of the hematoma was performed. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-enhanced mass lesion with small intratumoral hemorrhage. The tumor was removed totally through a bilateral frontal craniotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. The histological diagnosis was meningeal hemangiopericytoma. Radiotherapy was not performed. Case 2: A 59-year-old man presented with consciousness disturbance. Computed tomography showed a mass lesion in the right frontotemporal convexity region and massive hematoma in the brain tissue at the medial border of the lesion. His neurological condition was refractory to any treatment and the clinical diagnosis of brain death was confirmed. Autopsy was performed and the histological diagnosis was meningeal hemangiopericytoma. Meningeal hemangiopericytoma manifesting as intracranial hemorrhage is quite rare, but carries the risk of life-threatening massive bleeding from the tumor.
