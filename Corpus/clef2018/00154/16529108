Annular phased-array high-intensity focused ultrasound device for image-guided therapy of uterine fibroids. An ultrasound (US), image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device was developed for noninvasive ablation of uterine fibroids. The HIFU device was an annular phased array, with a focal depth range of 30-60 mm, a natural focus of 50 mm, and a resonant frequency of 3 MHz. The in-house control software was developed to operate the HIFU electronics drive system for inducing tissue coagulation at different distances from the array. A novel imaging algorithm was developed to minimize the HIFU-induced noise in the US images. The device was able to produce lesions in bovine serum albumin-embedded polyacrylamide gels and excised pig liver. The lesions could be seen on the US images as hyperechoic regions. Depths ranging from 30 to 60 mm were sonicated at acoustic intensities of 4100 and 6100 W/cm2 for 15 s each, with the latter producing average lesion volumes at least 63% larger than the former. Tissue sonication patterns that began distal to the transducer produced longer lesions than those that began proximally. The variation in lesion dimensions indicates the possible development of HIFU protocols that increase HIFU throughput and shorten tumor treatment times.
