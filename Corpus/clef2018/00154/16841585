Vaccination against human papillomavirus for the prevention of cervical cancer. Persistent infections with high-risk Human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer. This fact could imply that vaccination against HPV could prevent this disease. Such vaccines could be aimed at the prevention of HPV infections or the treatment of infections, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. There are two prophylactic candidate vaccines against the high risk HPV types 16 and 18, which appear to be safe and effective in preventing incidental and persistent HPV infections. Phase III studies should reveal whether these vaccines will also have long-term effects by preventing the development of CIN and eventually cervical cancer. The introduction of such an HPV vaccine in the Netherlands, its cost-effectiveness and introduction into the existing national vaccination programmes needs to be studied. The vaccination of girls before they become sexually active seems to be the most effective approach, although older women can also profit from prophylactic vaccination. The current community-based screening, possibly complemented by an HPV test, needs to be continued to identify and treat presently HPV-infected women. In a population with an existing community-based screening program for cervical cancer, a vaccine preventing persisting infection with high-risk HPV will further reduce the incidence of HPV-related cervical cancer.
