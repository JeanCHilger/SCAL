Little knowledge about human papillomavirus among young Norwegian women. Little is documented about Norwegian women's knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV). The purpose of this study was to investigate young Norwegian women's knowledge of HPV transmission and diseases associated with the virus.From September 1998 to December 2000, 898 women aged 16 - 24 years were recruited to a study on the natural course of HPV-infections. At the beginning of the study, 323 participants at 8 of the 16 selected health centres answered a questionnaire regarding motivation for and openness about study participation, and knowledge about transmission and diseases associated with the virus. Data were analysed with Chi-quadrate test and logistic regression in SPSS.Only 20 % (63/323) of the women had heard about HPV before they were enrolled in the study. 15 % (49/323) answered questions about causal relationships between HPV, cervical cancer and genital warts correctly. No correlations were found between HPV knowledge and age, sexual behaviour, or previous testing/history of chlamydia infection.Knowledge about viral transmission and diseases associated with HPV is low among young Norwegian women.
