Combined human papillomavirus DNA and human papillomavirus-like particle serologic assay to identify women at risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of a second generation human papillomavirus (HPV) virus-like particle (VLP)-based ELISA as an adjunct to HPV DNA testing to identify women at risk for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Participants provided blood, cervical samples and interviewer-obtained questionnaire information. HPV VLPs for types 16, 18, 33, 45 and 52 were produced using a baculovirus expression system. These highly purified VLPs were used in a polymer-based ELISA test. Cases with biopsy-confirmed CIN (CIN I, n = 237 CIN II, n = 56
