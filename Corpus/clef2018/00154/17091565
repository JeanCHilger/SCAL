Recent advances in human papillomavirus vaccines. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections and the etiologic agent of cervical dysplasia and cancer. Recent research on the safety and efficacy of prophylactic vaccines against HPV has shown promising results with nearly 100% efficacy in preventing persistent infections and cervical dysplasia. Several approaches are being tested in therapeutic vaccine clinical trials whereby E6, E7, or both agents are administered in live viral vectors, as proteins, or in nucleic acid form. Cell-based therapeutic vaccines are also being tested. HPV vaccines have the potential to eradicate a major cancer and source of morbidity around the world.
