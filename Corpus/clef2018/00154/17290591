Twenty years of contributions to the study and prevention of uterine cancer. During 20 years of preventive study of the oncogenic risk of cervix-uterine cancer in the Republic of Panama, applying the protocol of the Gynecology Institute of the University of Padua, Italy, we diagnosed 5,009 cases out of the 9,312 patients studied. We classified them according to the degree of the pathology, guiding the patients to the appropriate treatment and the respective follow-up, and concluding that those women who do not follow recommendations have five times more probability of suffering from cervix-uterine cancer. Moreover, the age groups between 20 and 40 years old with HPV infection that do not have access to these procedures are highly vulnerable.
