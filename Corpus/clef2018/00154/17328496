Value of cytology in papillary condylomatous lesions of the cervix. To determine the value of cytology in detecting mature and immature papillary condylomas of the uterine cervix.We evaluated 240 cases of plane cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 (CIN 1), and 23 papillary condylomas by Pap smear and biopsy and classified histologic sections according to maturity and keratinization. We reevaluated corresponding cytologic smears and identified criteria of low grade squamous lesion (LSIL) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.Thirteen (56.5%) papillary lesions were histologically classified as mature, 6 (26%) as immature and 4 (17.3%) as mixed. Fifteen lesions (65.2%) were nonkeratinized, 2 (8.6%) keratinized and 6 (26%) partially keratinized. Corresponding smears were cytologically diagnosed as LSIL (6, 26%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) (7, 30.4%) and negative (10, 43.4%). Careful cytologic review diagnosed only two of the 13 mature lesions few cytological criteria of LSIL and HPV infection were observed. Koilocytes were seen in just 1 case. Sample limiting factors occurred in 4 cases: 2 cytologically diagnosed as LSIL, 1 asASCUS and 1 as negative for lesion.Cytology was not effective in the detection of cervical condyloma acuminatum, independent of limitations in sample adequacy and of the degree of maturity or keratinization of the lesions.
