Pap test update. 2006 was an eventful year in the area of screening to prevent cervical cancer. New screening guidelines were introduced nationally in July, and in November the Australian Government agreed to fund one of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil, under the National Immunisation Program.This article discusses the cervical screening program and the Pap test in the era of HPV vaccination.With the introduction of a vaccine to prevent the acquisition of significant genital HPV types, many practitioners will be questioning the continuing need for the Pap test. But for those women who have missed out on the vaccine, the Pap test will still play a crucial role in preventing the development of cervical cancer, and the vaccinated cohort will need to continue screening in some form as the vaccine does not cover all the HPV types responsible for anogenital cancer.
