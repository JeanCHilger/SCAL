Validity of self-reports of return for routine repeat screening in an ovarian cancer screening program. Cancer screening research relies on reliable and valid measurement of cancer screening behavior. Self-reports of screening constitute a cost-effective approach to measuring screening behavior however, demonstration of suitable validity of these self-reports is critical. We evaluated the validity of self-report of return for repeat, routine, annual transvaginal sonography (TVS) screening for ovarian cancer. Participants (n = 535) in a university-based ovarian cancer screening program for asymptomatic, average risk women completed a telephone interview 18 months following an initial, baseline TVS screening test. Self-reports of return for a repeat, routine ovarian cancer screening test since baseline were obtained and compared with objective records of repeat screening from the screening program database. Overall agreement of self-reports and objective records of ovarian cancer screening was 97.57% (kappa = 0.94). Sensitivity was 0.98, specificity was 0.96, positive predictive value was 0.98, and negative predictive value was 0.96. The month of last screening was accurately identified by 80% of participants. It was concluded the validity of self-reports of TVS screening for ovarian cancer is very high and may even exceed the validity of self-reports of participation in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening over similar recall periods. Consequently, self-reports of TVS screening may serve as a cost-effective substitute for more objective methods of assessing TVS screening behavior.
