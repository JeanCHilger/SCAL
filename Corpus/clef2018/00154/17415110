Comparison of human papilloma virus testing and spectroscopy combined with cervical cytology for the detection of high-grade cervical neoplasia. This study compared the performance of cervical cytology plus human papilloma virus testing (Pap + HPV) or cervical spectroscopy (Pap + CS) for identifying high-grade cervical neoplasia in a high-risk population of women referred for colposcopy.Each of 113 subjects underwent spectroscopy, thin-layer cytology, HPV testing, colposcopy, biopsy when indicated, and/or endocervical curettage. Evaluable data for analysis were collected for 102 of the subjects. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for both strategies.Pap + HPV and Pap + CS achieved equivalent sensitivities (95%) for high-grade lesions, with both detecting 17 of 18 histology confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ lesions. Pap + HPV had a specificity of only 27.4% compared with 65.5% for Pap + CS (p < .0001).Spectroscopic interrogation of the cervix is equally sensitive and 2-fold more specific than HPV testing when combined with cervical cytology for identifying high-grade cervical neoplasia.
