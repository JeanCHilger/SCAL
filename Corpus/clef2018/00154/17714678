High-risk cervical epithelial neoplasia grade 1 treated by loop electrosurgical excision: follow-up and value of HPV testing. This study was undertaken to evaluate the value of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in the follow-up of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion treated by loop electrosurgical excision procedure because of the risk criteria established by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ie, unsatisfactory colposcopy or positive endocervical curettage, persistence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or high-risk HPV infection for longer than 2 years and older than 40 years).Seventy-seven women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion treated by loop electrosurgical excision procedure and followed-up with colposcopy, cytology, and high-risk HPV detection using Hybrid Capture II.More than 67% (67.6%) of women had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 in the specimen 22% a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2-3Patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 and risk factors have a significant risk of harboring a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2-3 lesion. A conservative approach should be considered when basal high-risk HPV test is negative. High pretreatment high-risk HPV loads should be considered a risk factor for developing residual/recurrent disease. Posttreatment Hybrid Capture II has an extremely high sensitivity for detecting recurrences.
