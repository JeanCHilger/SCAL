Improved rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia detection in human papillomavirus DNA hybrid capture testing. Numerous studies have established a link between human papillomavirus (HPV), squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and carcinoma of the cervix. Testing for HPV DNA in addition to cytology in screening programs for cervical cancer has been suggested to increase detection rates.HPV DNA testing (performed by hybridization antibody capture assay I or II), cytology and biopsy (performed within 1 month of each other) were retrospectively reviewed for a series of 155 women. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of HPV testing vs. cytology were calculated using biopsy as the gold standard. These values were also calculated in a subgroup of 37 individuals older than 35 years.The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of DNA hybrid capture HPV testing for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were 86%, 44%, 26% and 93%, respectively. The respective values for cytology detection of high-grade CIN were 17%, 97%, 56% and 82%.HPV testing was significantly more sensitive for detecting high-grade CIN than cytology (86% vs. 17%). Our data support immediate colposcopy and biopsy, rather than follow-up Papanicolaou testing, if the test for HPV DNA is positive for an intermediate- to high-risk type.
