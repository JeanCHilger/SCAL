Human papillomavirus genotype distribution in high grade cervical lesions (CIN 2/3) in France: EDITH study. High grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) have a high potential to progress to invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Pap testing including follow-up and treatment of CIN 2/3 is currently the best prevention of ICC, but is associated with morbidity, namely obstetrical adverse effects and psychological distress. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is universally accepted as the necessary cause of ICC. The objective of the present study was to describe the type-specific prevalence of HPV in CIN 2/3 in France and hereby to locally estimate the potential benefit of an HPV 16/18 L1 virus-like particles (VLP) vaccine. A total of 493 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded CIN 2/3 specimens were analyzed. Medical records were examined for patient related data. HPV were genotyped with the INNO-LiPA assay allowing the detection of 24 HPV genotypes. The overall prevalence of LiPA detectable HPV was 98%. The most prevalent genotype was HPV 16 (62%) followed by HPV 31 (15%), 33 (12%), 52 (9%), 51 (8%), 58 (7%), 35 and 18 (4%). Multiple infection with at least two different high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes was observed in 26% of all specimens including 2.6% with HPV 16 and 18 multiple infections. The present study indicates that HPV 16 is by far the most common HPV type associated with CIN 2/3 in France. With an HPV 16 and 18 prevalence of 64%, HPV 16/18 L1 VLP vaccines would be expected to significantly reduce the burden associated with the management and treatment of CIN 2/3 in France.
