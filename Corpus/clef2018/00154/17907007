Attitudes toward HPV testing: interview findings from a random sample of women in Ontario, Canada. As most women diagnosed with cervical carcinoma have been "inadequately screened," improvements in screening are critical. After abnormal Pap test findings (through liquid-based cytology), residual specimens now can be tested simultaneously for oncogenic types of Human Papilloma virus (HPV). If these "reflex" HPV tests are negative, Pap tests need not be repeated for 12 months. Women with positive oncogenic HPV tests, however, can be referred immediately for colposcopy. There has been concern that "stigma" issues could be associated with positive HPV status (because of its sexual transmission) that might cause women to avoid this reflex HPV testing. We addressed this concern by assessing whether stigma issues surface in relation to HPV testing. We randomly selected 20 women and administered to them semistructured telephone interviews that included responses to a scenario of reflex HPV-DNA testing. Interview transcripts were analyzed qualitatively. Highly limited knowledge levels were found about HPV, but, following education about screening options, there was no rejection of HPV testing. In conclusion, it appears that women favor reflex HPV testing due to its "convenience" and perceptions that it is "the least intrusive option more definitive than Pap testing."
