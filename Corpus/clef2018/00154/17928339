A protective and broadly cross-neutralizing epitope of human papillomavirus L2. We generated a monoclonal antibody, RG-1, that binds to highly conserved L2 residues 17 to 36 and neutralizes human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and HPV18. Passive immunotherapy with RG-1 was protective in mice. Antiserum to the HPV16 L2 peptide comprising residues 17 to 36 (peptide 17-36) neutralized pseudoviruses HPV5, HPV6, HPV16, HPV 18, HPV31, HPV 45, HPV 52, HPV 58, bovine papillomavirus 1, and HPV11 native virions. Depletion of HPV16 L2 peptide 17-36-reactive antibodies from cross-neutralizing rabbit and human L2-specific sera abolished cross-neutralization and drastically reduced neutralization of the cognate type. This cross-neutralization of diverse HPVs associated with cervical cancer, genital warts, and epidermodysplasia verruciformis suggests the possibility of a broadly protective, peptide-based vaccine.
