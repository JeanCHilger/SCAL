Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncogene transcripts increases the specificity of the detection of a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The oncogenic potential of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes depends on the expression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7. Thus, the detection of these transcripts could serve as a factor in the evaluation of a woman's risk of development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).A nested RT-PCR assay for the detection of E6/E7 oncogene transcripts of all known HR-HPV genotypes was established. Cervical scrapes of 779 HR-HPV-DNA-positive women exhibiting all grades of CIN were examined.Spliced E6/E7 oncogene transcripts of all the HR-HPVs were detected in numerous samples. In 459 cases with agreement between the cytologic and histologic findings, the prevalence increased with lesion severity: CIN 0, 18% CIN I, 58%Besides the identification of HPV DNA, the detection of HR-HPV E6/E7 oncogene transcripts may serve as a valuable tool in increasing the specificity of HPV testing.
