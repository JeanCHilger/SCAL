Application of high-risk human papillomavirus testing in women with abnormal cytology. To detect the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infectious condition in women with abnormal cytology and evaluate its values in the screening of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.We used hybrid capture 2 (hc2) method to examine 949 patients with abnormal cervical cytology results [ > or =atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) according to the 2001 The Bethesda System diagnosis criteria]. All subjects also received colposcopy for tissue studies.Among 949 patients with abnormal cytology, the diagnoses of atypical squamous cells (ASC), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were made in 432, 310, and 207 patients, respectively. The high-risk HPV positive rate in ASC, LSIL, and HSIL were 40.3%, 44.8%, and 89.4%, respectively. The numbers of patients with pathologically confirmed results of negative intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1, 2, 3 (CIN 1, 2, 3), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were 335, 388, 118, 101, and 7, and the high-risk HPV positive rate was 17.3%, 66.2%, 92.4%, 97.0%, and 100%, respectively. Among patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), rate of HSIL in high-risk HPV positive group and negative group were 10.2% and 0.8%, respectively (P < 0.01). In screening HSIL, the sensitivities of cytology [ > or = ASC cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)] and cytology ( > or = ASC-H) plus high-risk HPV testing were 0.925 and 0.991, and the specificities were 0.510 and 0.748, respectively (P < 0.01). Sensitivitives of cytology ( > or = LSIL) and cytology (> or = LSIL) plus high risk HPV in detecting HSIL were 0.898 and 0.982, respectively, while the specificitives were 0. 567 and 0.779, respectively (P < 0.01).The positive rate of high-risk HPV increases with the gravity of cervical lesions. In patients with abnormal cervical cytology, high-risk HPV testing can improve the sensitivity and specificity in the screening of HSIL.
