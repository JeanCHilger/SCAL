What school nurses need to know about cervical cancer, HPV, and the new vaccine. At least 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year in the United States, accounting for at least 4,000 deaths. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women. The human papilloma virus (HPV) has been linked to at least 70% of all cervical cancer. HPV can be divided into 2 categories: (a) low risk, which is responsible for genital warts, and (b) high risk, which is responsible for cervical cancer. An effective new vaccine has been approved that will decrease the spread of infection caused by HPV, therefore decreasing the future incidence of cervical cancer and genital warts. Understanding the risks of acquiring HPV and the increased risk for cervical cancer may lead to enhanced vaccine acceptance.
