Longitudinal cytological follow-up of patients with a papanicolaou test interpretation of "atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance" that was followed by a negative reflex test for high-risk human papillomavirus types. The 2001 consensus guidelines essentially equated the follow-up management of patients with a Papanicolaou (Pap) test interpretation of negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy and those with an interpretation of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) that was followed by a negative reflex test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) types: follow-up cytology in 12 months. As several years have elapsed since these guidelines attained some measure of widespread implementation, we sought to determine whether, in routinely diagnosed cases, the full spectrum of follow-up cytological findings are indeed identical in these 2 groups. Clinical and pathological data of consecutive patients with a Pap test interpretation of ASC-US during a 6-week period (n = 587), in which reflex human papillomavirus testing was performed (n = 497) and in which HR HPV types were not detected (n = 300), were reviewed (study group). A randomly selected control group of 300 patients whose Pap tests were reported as negative (negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy) during the same period were similarly reviewed. The follow-up Pap tests were classified into the various Bethesda 2001 diagnostic categories, and both groups were compared. The average follow-up duration in the study and control groups was 26.03 and 25.9 months, respectively. When all of the follow-up Pap tests in each group (study, n = 555 control, n = 356) were used for the comparisons, patients in the study group were significantly more likely to have an abnormal follow-up Pap test result than the control group patients (24.9% vs 7.6%, P < 0.0001)
