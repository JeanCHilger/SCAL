Sonohysterography and endometrial cancer: incidence and functional viability of disseminated malignant cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sonohysterography in patients with endometrial cancer and to determine whether (1) transtubal fluid spill occurs during routine sonohysterography, (2) a critical infusion volume for spill exists, or (3) disseminated cancer cells demonstrate viability.At laparotomy, sonohysterography was performed on 16 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma. Volumes at which tubal spill occurred were recorded. Collected specimens were processed and incubated. After evaluation for viable cells, cytologic analysis was undertaken.The median volume that was required for adequate sonohysterography was 8.5 mL. Five patients (31%) had transtubal spill. With an additional saline solution flush, the median total volume for a spill was 20.5 mL. Two patients (12.5%) had viable benign cells that were cultured after routine sonohysterography. One patient (6%) had nonviable carcinoma cells that were identified.Transtubal spill occurs during sonohysterography. No critical spill volume was identified. A highly diagnostic tool when abnormal bleeding is evaluated, sonohysterography has a low probability of cancer cell dissemination.
