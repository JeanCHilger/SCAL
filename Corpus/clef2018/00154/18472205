Study on the prevalence of human papillomavirus in the anal canal of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III. The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the anal canal of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade III.Two groups were compared. In group I (study group), 40 women who had undergone cervical biopsy with a histopathological result indicating CIN III were evaluated. Group II (control) consisted of 40 women with normal results from colposcopic examination and colpocytological tests. The women in group I who presented high-grade neoplasia in colpocytological tests underwent collection of material from the uterine cervix and anal canal for investigating HPV DNA using the Hybrid Capture II technique. Colposcopy and cervical biopsy were then performed. If CIN III was confirmed, HPV DNA was investigated in the material collected. In group II, colpocytological tests and colposcopy were performed and, if normal, the procedure was similar to that followed for group I, except that no biopsy was performed.In group I, 39 women (97.5%) were positive for HPV in the uterine cervix and 14 women (35%) in the anal canal. In group II, only four women (10%) had a positive HPV test, for both the uterine cervix and the anal canal.The prevalence of HPV in the anal canal of the women with CIN III was greater than in the women without CIN III.
