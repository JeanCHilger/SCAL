Atrio-oesophageal fistula after radiofrequency ablation: predominant neurological symptoms. A 58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for septic shock and meningitis. He had undergone, three weeks earlier, a radiofrequency ablation for drug-refractory atrial fibrillation. A polymicrobian septicemy suggested a digestive etiology. A CT scan suggested an atrio-oesophageal fistula with cerebral and renal emboli. The patient deceased from brain death. The diagnosis of atrio-oesophageal fistula was confirmed by autopsy.
