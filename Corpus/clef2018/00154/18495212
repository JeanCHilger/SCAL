Epidemiologic analysis of histologic cervical inflammation: relationship to human papillomavirus infections. Infections with carcinogenic human papillomaviruses, the causal agents of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer, as well as infections with noncarcinogenic human papillomaviruses, are common but typically resolve spontaneously. Effective cell-mediated immune responses are critical for human papillomavirus clearance however, data relating cervical inflammation to the outcome of human papillomavirus infection are lacking. To investigate this topic, we performed a masked parallel review of inflammation in the stroma and epithelium of cervical biopsies (n = 564) collected from a retrospectively defined subcohort of women systematically followed up in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study. Women in our analysis had undergone colposcopically directed enrollment biopsies diagnosed as negative or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 and had corresponding human papillomavirus polymerase chain reaction test results of negative (n = 250), positive for a single carcinogenic (n = 237), or noncarcinogenic (n = 81) type. Inflammation in cervical stroma varied with cofactors for human papillomavirus progression: current smokers showed less inflammation (odds ratio, 0.55
