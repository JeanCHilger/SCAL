The role of the cytological screening, HPV-test and the colposcopy for early detection of the precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. We tried to summarise our and foreign experience in the field of early finding and screening of the precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix.521 patients were examined and followed cytologically, by HPV test and colposcopically for 10 years period (1997-2007).According to our data from the examination of 521 patients-the sensitivity of the cytological method was 65-90%. HPV-DNA test is economically more effective than the cytological method, because it eliminates the need for second clinical examination and taking Pap smear, as well as it reduces the number of the colposcopically examinations with 40-60%. That is why the HPV-DNA test is more sensitive primary screening method than the conventional Pap smear test for finding of CIN with high grading. It can have a very important role in the primary cervical screening in the developing countries. Nevertheless this the cytological screening remains as a basic method in the early finding and screening of precancer and cancer of the cervix. The colposcopical method is widely used in the every day practice of the oncogynaecologist. This method is mostly used after obtaining of abnormal pap smear test or after positive result from HPV test.The cytological screening, HPV test and colposcopy are not competitive tests for early finding and screening of cervical precancer and cancer. They have to combine together with the purpose of better early diagnose and adequate treatment of these diseases.
