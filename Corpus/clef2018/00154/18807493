May ureaplasmas in genital tract of HPV-positive women influence abnormal cytology of cervix?. The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence of Ureaplasma urealyticum (U.u.) and Ureaplasma parvum (Up.) in 168 women diagnosed with LSIL infected and not infected with HPV vs. 82 women with no cytological abnormalities in the cervix (control group). The material used in the study were cervical secretions samples. PCR was used to confirm the presence of HPV and to identify the species of ureaplasmas. U.p. was significantly more frequent in both groups of women. In the study group, ureaplasmas were more frequently isolated in the HPV infected (31%) vs. HPV negative (16%) women. No direct relationship was found between ureaplasmas and LSIL. Statistical analysis showed, that infection with HPV occurred more frequently in the presence of ureaplasmas (OR = 1.79 95% PU 0.90-3.53
