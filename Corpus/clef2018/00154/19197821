Infertility in women: combined sonohysterography and hysterosalpingography in the evaluation of the uterine cavity. To evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of combined hysterosalpingography (HSG) and sonohysterography (SHG) in the study of infertile women.208 women affected by primary (184) or secondary sterility (24) were divided in two random groups. Group 1 underwent only HSG and group 2 underwent simultaneous HSG and SHG. The results obtained in the two groups were correlated with the results of hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, considered Gold Standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values and likelihood ratio (LR) of HSG alone and combined HSG/SHG were calculated. Results were evaluated with t-test, Pearson's Chi square or Fisher exact test when appropriate and ROC analysis.In group 1, hysteroscopy revealed no pathology in the uterine cavity in 70/104 patients, but evidenced 47 abnormalities related to the uterine cavity in 34 women. HSG outcome was in accordance with hysteroscopy in 27/34 cases of abnormalities, and in 64/70 cases of normal outcome. Sensitivity 0.79, specificity 0.91, PPV 0.82, NPV 0.90, LR+ 9.26. In group 2, hysteroscopy revealed no pathology in the uterine cavity in 64/104 patients but 52 abnormalities related to the uterine cavity in 40 women. HSG and SHG outcomes were confirmed by hysteroscopy in 39/40 cases of abnormalities of the uterine cavity and in 60/64 cases of normal uterine cavity. Sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.94, PPV 0.91, NPV 0.98, LR+ 15.60. Statistical analysis showed that combined HSG and SHG yielded elevated specificity and LR+ and therefore few cases of false positive outcome.Combined performance of HSG and SHG can shorten diagnostic investigation time and reduce the discomfort to the patient as the injector is fed into the cervix only once. This may also reduce the patient's anxiety level as one of the causes of infertility.
