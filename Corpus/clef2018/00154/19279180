Performance of a polymer-based DNA chip platform in detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus in clinical samples. Human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a key role in the development of cervical and laryngeal cancers. The aim of our study was to compare the performance of a new hydrogel-based HPV genotyping biochip assay (Biochip) to a commercially available and CE-marked conventional PCR followed by reverse hybridization (GenID-PCR). One hundred twenty-three samples were available for the study. Of these samples, 101/123 were gynecological swabs, 8/123 were swabs or biopsy samples of genital warts, 7/123 were biopsy samples of otorhinolaryngeal lesions, 5/123 were samples of skin warts, and 2/123 were samples of orolabial abnormalities. These molecular methods for HPV genotyping showed comparable sensitivity and specificity. However, 19/123 of the results were discrepant. Specifically, Biochip showed better performance in the detection of multiple infections, especially when more than one high-risk genotype was present. Due to the different probe configurations used in the two assays, GenID-PCR achieves only group-specific detection of many HPV genotypes, whereas Biochip allows for specific identification. Overall, the newly developed HPV chip system (Biochip) proved to be a suitable tool for HPV detection and genotyping it also proved to be superior for establishing HPV genotyping methods.
