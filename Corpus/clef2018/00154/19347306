Detection and genotyping analysis of human papillomavirus isolates from liquid-based cervical cytology specimens. The detection of oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) from exfoliated cervical cells collected in liquid-based preservative fluid at the time of the annual Pap test can be accomplished using PCR-based amplification methods. DNA sequence analysis of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) permits determination of the HPV viral subtype. DNA sequence analysis of the E6 and E7 ORFs permits further detection of various HPV genotype variants within a given HPV viral type. These techniques can be readily adopted by most laboratories employing standard molecular biology techniques.
