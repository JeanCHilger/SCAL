Frequency of HPV infection in pre-malignant lesions of cervix at the public institution "Institute for Health Protection of Women and Maternity" of Sarajevo Canton. About 75% of adolescent and younger adult women get in contact with human papilloma virus (HPV). Some of them develop clinically manifested changes identified on Pap smear as ASCUS (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) or SIL (Squamous lntraepithelial Lesion). Infection with high-risk genital HPV is considered to be a pre-condition for the occurrence of precancerous lesions and cancer, while in HPV infections with low-risk types such possibilities are extremely rare.We have analyzed pathological-cytological results of cervical-vaginal smears in the period 1997-2001 and 2001-2005, where HPV typing has been performed. Examinees are divided in two groups--low-risk and high-risk, and are compared with different types of cell abnormalities (ASCUS, SIL, CIN).Low-risk HPV is twice more common than the high-risk oncogenic I-IPV. More than 2/3 of abnormal colposcopy results are verified with presence of HPV infection.HPV infection is most common in women 20-30 years of age and is present in all types of epithelial dysplasias.
