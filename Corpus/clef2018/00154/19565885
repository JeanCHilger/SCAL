A case-control study on the association of RFC-1 polymorphism and cervical cancer. To evaluate the possible association between RFC-1 polymorphism and cervix carcinoma, as well as the interaction between polymorphism and human papilloma virus16 (HPV16).Based on a hospital-based case-control study, 107 cases which were diagnosed as cervical cancer pathematologically and 107 controls with hysteromyoma, were selected by frequency, matched with age and habitation. HPV16 and RFC-1 A80G polymorphism were detected by special PCR and RFLP.(1) HPV16 infection rate in cases (56.07%) was higher than that in controls (31.78%) with the adjusted OR of 3.25 (95% CI: 1.74-6.08). (2) All the genotypes were tested by Hardy-Weinberg balance. (3) Compared with RFC-1 AA,RFC-1 GG had higher risk for cervical cancer with OR of 2.42 (95% CI: 1.01-5.81). (4) No statistical significance was noticed regarding the interaction between RFC-1 polymorphism and HPV16 in logistic regression method.The introduction of RFC-1 80GG gene type could increase the risk of cervical cancer.
