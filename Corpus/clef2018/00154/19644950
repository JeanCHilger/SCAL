Three-dimensional ultrasound features of the polycystic ovary in Chinese women. To quantify the three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound characteristics of ovaries in Chinese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to compare these with previous data on a Caucasian cohort with PCOS.3D pelvic ultrasound was performed in 40 Chinese women with PCOS and 40 controls. Ovarian volume, stromal volume and echogenicity, and antral follicle count (AFC) were measured and ovarian blood flow was quantified using both 3D power Doppler and two-dimensional (2D) pulsed wave Doppler. These data were compared with previously published data on a Caucasian cohort with PCOS.Compared with controls, women with PCOS had a higher AFC (median (range), 15 (11-30) vs. 5.5 (1-10) per ovary, P < 0.01), ovarian volume (12.32 (8.10-16.16) mL vs. 5.64 (2.62-8.81) mL, P < 0.01) and stromal volume (9.74 (6.44-13.56) mL vs. 4.07 (1.52-6.67) mL, P < 0.01) but were comparable in stromal echogenicity and ovarian blood flow as measured by 3D power Doppler or 2D pulsed wave Doppler indices. However, in comparison with a previously reported Caucasian cohort with PCOS, the ovaries of Chinese women with PCOS had a significantly smaller stromal volume (median (range), 9.74 (6.44-13.56) mL vs. 10.79 (5.65-17.12) mL, P < 0.05), were less echogenic as reflected in a lower mean gray value (22.43 (13.13-35.50) vs. 32.36 (19.35-53.71), P < 0.01), and had reduced ovarian blood flow as reflected in a lower flow index (30.19 (23.32-44.88) vs. 33.54 (21.88-51.65), P < 0.05).Based on 3D ultrasound measurements, Chinese women with PCOS have an increased stromal volume compared with controls. However, their stromal volume, echogenicity and vascularity is significantly lower than that in Caucasian women with PCOS. The possible etiology for these differences is discussed.
