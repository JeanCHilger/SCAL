Imaging features of nonepithelial tumors of the bladder. To summarize the imaging features of nonepithelial tumors of the bladder.The Imaging findings in 20 surgically treated patients with pathologically proved nonepithelial tumors of the bladder were retrospectively analyzed. The tumors included leiomyoma (n = 9), pheochromocytoma (n = 6), leiomyosarcoma (n = 2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), carcinosarcoma (n = 1), inflammatory myofibroblastoma (n = 1).The leiomyomas were round or ellipse in shape with a sharp border and homogeneous density, and showed a low signal intensity on T1WI and T2WI in 1/1 case slight enhancement on CT after contrast enhancement in 6/7 casesMost leiomyomas and pheochromocytomas of the bladder show some typical imaging features on CT, MRI and ultrasound, which are helpful in making correct diagnosis and treatment plan preoperatively. Other malignant nonepithelial bladder tumors do not show special imaging characteristics and can only be diagnosed qualitatively.
