A survey of the knowledge and attitude of Jordanian obstetricians and gynaecologists to cervical cancer screening. The objective of the survey was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of Jordanian gynaecologists toward screening for cervical cancer. A pre-tested postal questionnaire was mailed to all 462 licensed gynaecologists in Jordan. Three questions were designed to assess knowledge and two questions to assess attitudes to screening for cervical cancer. A total of 392 obstetricians and gynaecologists completed the survey with a response rate of 84.4%. Although the majority of Jordanian obstetricians and gynaecologists were able to correctly identify all the important aetiological factors associated with cervical cancer and recognised the importance of cervical cancer screening, many of them were not confident that the Pap smear was the most cost-effective screening test, or that human papillomavirus testing improved the sensitivity of detection of pre-invasive and invasive cervical disease.
