Pelvic cyst: renal or ovarian? Ovarian cyst is a common gynecologic finding. Renal cysts develop in 15% of women older than 70 years, and nephroptosis in 20% of the population, primarily in women. Herein, we review these conditions and present a case in which the patient had a cystic kidney in combination with nephroptosis. At vaginal ultrasound performed with the patient in an upright position, the kidney slid down into the pelvis, thus imitating an ovarian mass. At laparoscopy, the patient was positioned head down, and the kidney, lying near the diaphragm, was not seen.
