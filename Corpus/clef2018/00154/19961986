Cytologic regression in women with atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and negative human papillomavirus test. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytologic regression in women with atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and negative high-risk human papillomavirus test.The 45 women with atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and negative high-risk human papillomavirus at baseline were analyzed about the cytologic regression during 2 years of follow-up. The cumulative rate of cytologic regression was calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves.Of 45 women, the cumulative rates were as follows: 55.6% obtained cytologic regression before 6 months, 84.4% by 1 year, and 95.6% at 2 years. Cytologic regression was not influenced by age, menopausal status, and baseline human papillomavirus load. However, the 1-year cumulative regression rate in women with previous cervical lesions was significantly lower than those without (P=.02), even much lower in women with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (P=.008).Most women with atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and negative high-risk human papillomavirus could obtain cytologic regression within 2 years. Women with antecedent cervical lesions need longer time to reach this regression.
