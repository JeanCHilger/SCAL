Up-regulation of 14-3-3sigma (Stratifin) is associated with high-grade CIN and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) at baseline but does not predict outcomes of HR-HPV infections or incident CIN in the LAMS study. To assess whether the potentially high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV)-related up-regulation of 14-3-3sigma (stratifin) has implications in the outcome of HPV infections or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, cervical biopsy specimens from 225 women in the Latin American Screening Study were analyzed for 14-3-3sigma expression using immunohistochemical analysis. We assessed its associations with CIN grade and HR HPV at baseline and value in predicting outcomes of HR-HPV infections and the development of incident CIN 1+ and CIN 2+. Expression of 14-3-3sigma increased in parallel with the lesion grade. Up-regulation was also significantly related to HR-HPV detection (P = .004 odds ratio, 2.71
