Specificity of radionuclide brain blood flow testing in brain death: case report and review. Brain blood flow tests with diffusible radiopharmaceuticals are often done as an ancillary test in brain death (BD). We report a case of an infant with absent brain blood flow on an anterior planar image despite persistent breathing and extensor posturing. We reviewed the literature from 1980 to 2008 using MEDLINE and PubMed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of these tests in the diagnosis of BD. Search terms were any combination of: brain death and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), radiopharmaceuticals, technetium Tc 99m exametazime, or organotechnetium compounds. The sensitivity of absent brain blood flow on planar imaging for clinically confirmed BD is 119/153 = 77.8% [95% CI 70.5%-83.7%]
