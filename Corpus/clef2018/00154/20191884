Applications of 3-D ultrasound in female infertility. 3D ultrasound is an emerging technology with great promise to further this role. This overview describes and illustrates the applications of three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound in female infertility. The authors illustrate their cases where 3D ultrasound was beneficial for infertile patients. The obvious advantages are that 3D ultrasound offers more rapid and reproducible image acquisition as well as enhanced visualization and post-processing capabilities. Its main applications include assessment of uterine congenital anomalies, intrauterine pathology, tubal patency, polycystic ovaries, ovarian follicular monitoring and endometrial receptivity. Ongoing research will likely continue to define the clinical role of 3D ultrasound and it is possible in the near future to regard to 3D ultrasound as the Golden Standard for pelvic imaging.
