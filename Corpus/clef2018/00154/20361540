P16INK4A--A possible marker in HPV persistence screening. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of p161NK4a expression levels with the cytological group of cervical carcinogenesis (NILM, ASCUS, LSIL, HSIL, cancer groups), in order to establish its value as potential diagnostic marker.The smears obtained from 50 women with/without suggestive HPV infection pathology were subjected to cytological investigations. The viral testing was based on the detection of HPV DNA using the INNOLIPA kit, while the semiquantitative expression levels of p16INK4a were estimated by RT-PCR.p16INK4a expression level was correlated with the cytological degree of cervical lesions. In LSIL patients, p16INK4a values were 1.36 times greater than in NILM subjects (p = 0.07). In HSIL/cancer patients, p16INK4a values were 2.38 times greater than in NILM patients (p = 0.002). We also noticed significant differences between ASCUS: HSIL group (p = 0.02) and LSIL: HSIL (p = 0.07) group. The p16INK4a expression level was dependent of HPV genotype, p16INK4a mRNA presence being correlated with the presence of hrHPV in low and high risk lesions.
