Early and mid-term outcomes following surgical management of infective endocarditis with associated cerebral complications: a single centre experience. Surgical management of patients with infective endocarditis (IE) who have suffered preoperative cerebrovascular complications remains controversial. This study evaluates the impact of timing from stroke to valvular surgery on the early and mid-term neurological sequelae, functional status and quality of life in this high-risk group of patients with IE.Data on 13/108 (12%) patients with IE who suffered cerebrovascular complications during the period 1998-2009 was prospectively collected. Mean follow-up was 37.2 months (100% complete).Three of 13 (23%) suffered haemorrhagic stroke, 10/13 (77%) had embolic events (nine, stroke one, TIA). The clinical diagnosis was made by a neurologist in 6/13 (46%) and confirmed in all by CT scan. Twelve of 13 had motor deficit involving MCA territory. Thirty-day mortality was 2/13 (one, cardiacResults regarding timing for haemorrhagic stroke cannot be defined from the small numbers. Timely surgical intervention (embolic greater than two weeks and preferably four weeks in absence of heart failure) is associated with acceptable neurological outcome, functional class and quality of life.
