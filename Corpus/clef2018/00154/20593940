Prevalence and genotypes of human papillomavirus among Thai women. One of the most common cancers in women worldwide is cervical cancer, with death rates highest in less developed countries, including Thailand. This study was conducted to explore the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and its related cytological abnormalities among women attending cervical screening clinics in Thailand using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). LBC specimens (ThinPrep, Hologic, West Sussex, UK) were subjected to PCR of the E1 region to identify the most prevalent HPV types. Information on age and cytology grade was also collected. Among a total of 1,662 women, 29 different HPV types were found and the overall HPV prevalence was 8.7%. HPV prevalence among the general population amounted to 7.8%. The following HPV types were identified: HPV16 (17.9%), HPV90 (16.6%) and HPV71 (10.3%). The rates of other types were as follows HPV66 (6.9%), HPV52 (6.2%), HPV34 (5.5%), HPV31 (5.3%), HPV42 (4.8%) and HPV39 (3.4%). HPV infection peaked in women aged around 20-39 years and thereafter gradually declined. As expected, HPV DNA can be found in normal cytology specimens. These results which elucidate HPV distribution in Thailand could be useful for vaccine development and the national cervical cancer prevention program.
