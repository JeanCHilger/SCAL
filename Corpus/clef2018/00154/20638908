IVF and embryo development subsequent to ovarian torsion occurring during the resumption of meiosis. This report describes an unusual case of ovarian torsion during an IVF cycle prior to vaginal oocyte retrieval and the subsequent embryo development. A 27-year-old, whose husband carries a balanced translocation, presented on stimulation day 11 (day after human chorionic gonadotrophin administration) with signs of right ovarian torsion. Transvaginal ultrasound identified decreased right ovarian venous flow but preservation of right ovarian arterial flow. She underwent emergency laparoscopic right ovarian detorsion followed by vaginal oocyte retrieval on postoperative day 1. Ten oocytes were retrieved from the right detorted ovary, 4/10 (40%) were fertilized and 3/4 (75%) became blastocysts. Fifteen oocytes were retrieved from the left ovary, 14/15 (93%) were fertilized and 9/14 (64%) became blastocysts. All 18 embryos biopsied for preimplantation genetic diagnosis carried unbalanced translocations and none were transferred. The markedly reduced fertilization rate of the oocytes from the previously torted ovary is similar to the rate described in a prior report and likely related to decreased but maintained ovarian arterial flow. This report is unique because not only was the patient's ovarian torsion surgically corrected prior to oocyte retrieval but also the embryos originating from the previously torted ovary had excellent development with 75% progressing to the blastocyst stage.
