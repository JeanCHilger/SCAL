Significance of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA detection in women 50 years and older with squamous cell papanicolaou test abnormalities. Data on cytologic screening and follow-up disproportionately reflect findings from frequently screened younger women, and data from screened women 50 years and older using newer screening technologies remain limited.To better understand the utility of adjunctive high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing for disease risk stratification in women 50 years and older with a range of liquid-based cytology, abnormal, squamous cell Papanicolaou test results.Liquid-based cytology cases interpreted as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)During the study period, 4855 women 50 years and older had HSIL, LSIL, ASC-H, or ASC-US Papanicolaou test results and hrHPV testing. In 89.3% of HSIL cases, 71.0% of LSIL cases, 38.9% of ASC-H cases, and 14.2% of ASC-US cases, hrHPV test results were positive. The positive predictive value of a positive hrHPV test for histopathologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3(+) detection was 90.5% with HSIL, 15% with ASC-H, 9.8% with LSIL, and 3.2% with ASC-US. A negative hrHPV test result had a 100% negative predictive value for histopathologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3(+) in both LSIL and ASC-H cases.In women 50 years and older, a positive hrHPV test result significantly increased the likelihood of follow-up histopathologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 /3(+) in patients with HSIL, LSIL, and ASC-H Papanicolaou test results compared with women with negative hrHPV test results. No cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3(+) diagnoses were documented in women 50 years and older with LSIL or ASC-H Papanicolaou test results and negative hrHPV test results.
