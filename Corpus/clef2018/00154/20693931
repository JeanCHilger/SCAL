Computed tomography may demonstrate pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage in diffuse cerebral edema after cardiorespiratory arrest. To report the cases of two children who died from diffuse cerebral edema after cardiorespiratory arrest and who had radiologic findings of subarachnoid hemorrhage on computed tomography, the presence of which was excluded on subsequent postmortem examination.Case notes, clinical records, and postmortem reports of two children who became brain stem dead after cardiorespiratory arrest.Radiologic mimics of subarachnoid hemorrhage have been reported in the adult literature and are termed pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage. A diagnosis of pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage, rather than true subarachnoid hemorrhage, should be considered in the context of diffuse cerebral edema after cardiorespiratory arrest. Interpretation of the radiologic finding of subarachnoid hemorrhage in a child after a prolonged cardiac arrest should be cautious to avoid unnecessary and deleterious management and investigation for aneurysms.
