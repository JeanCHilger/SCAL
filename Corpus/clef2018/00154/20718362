Evaluation of genotyping of human papilomavirus by a new DNA liquid chip based on Luminex XMAP. To evaluate the diagnostic value of Luminex XMAP liquid chip for HPV detection.Detect HPV DNA with the liquid chip and HC II in 264 cases, including 231 of cervical cancer and 33 of cervical scrapes. The accordance of two methods were compared and DNA sequencing was performed in conflicting samples and single (infection samples.There is an excellent agreement between the methods. The overall incidence of HPV was 82.95%, the most common genotypes were HPV 16, 52, 58, 18, 11, 31, 6, 39, 33, 56, 70. Among all the positive types, 117 were single type and 102 were multiple types, and 87.43% were high-risk HPV genotypes and 12.57% were low-risk genotypes. Based on the criteria of histology and pathology, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative-predictive value of HPV liquid chip and HC II for detecting all cases of CIN II, III and carcinomas were respectively 93.07%, 87.88%, 98.17%, 64.44% and 94.81%, 87.88%, 98.21%, 70.73%.The common types of HPV infection are 16, 52, 58, 18, 11, 6, 56 and 31. Multiplex HPV genotyping by Luminex XMAP liquid chip appears to be highly suitable for diagnostic screening and large-scale epidemiological studies.
