Predicting the progression of cervical precursor lesions by human papillomavirus genotyping: a prospective cohort study. Only a subset of cervical precursor lesions progress to cervical cancer and because of the lack of the predictive markers, it cannot be ascertained which lesions will progress or not. To estimate the risk of disease progression associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, we followed 570 Japanese women with cytological LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and histological CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) grade 1-2 lesions (479 CIN 1 91 CIN 2) at 3 to 4 month intervals for a mean follow-up period of 39.1 months. At entry, we detected HPV DNA in cervical samples by polymerase chain reaction-based methodology. Over the period of follow-up period, 46 lesions progressed to CIN 3 while 362 regressed to normal cytology. Women with multiple HPV infections were more likely to have persistent lesions (hazard ratio [HR] for regression, 0.65
