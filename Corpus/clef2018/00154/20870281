Distribution of human papillomavirus 58 and 52 E6/E7 variants in cervical neoplasia in Chinese women. The specific intratype HPV genome variations may be associated with the development of cervical cancer in specific geographic regions and a given population. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 58 and 52 have been found to be relatively prevalent among Asian women including Chinese women. This study aimed to assess the risk of HPV 58 and 52 variants for cervical cancer and its precursors in Chinese women.A total of 2021cervical samples were collected. After DNA extraction and genotyping, a total of 298 (177 HPV58-single positive and 121 HPV52-single positive) DNA samples were analyzed for E6 and E7 sequence variations by direct sequencing.A total of 29 new reported variations of HPV 58 and 52 were found. For HPV58, the presence of C632T (T20I) and G760A (G63S) variants in E7 showed a positive trend of the association with the severity of neoplasia (P(trend)<0.05, χ² test for trend).These findings suggest that C632T (T20I) and G760A (G63S) variants in HPV58 E7 are probably risk factors associated with the development of cervical cancer in Chinese women. The presence of HPV58/52 E6 and E7 variants may be different in Chinese women.
