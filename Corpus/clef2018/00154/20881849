Cervical adenocarcinoma resembling breast lobular carcinoma: a hitherto Undescribed Variant of Primary Cervical Adenocarcinoma. Most cervical adenocarcinomas are of the so-called usual or endocervical type, and consist entirely or predominantly of glandular formations. We describe 3 cases of an unusual morphologic variant of cervical adenocarcinoma largely composed of bland epithelial cells, with occasional intracytoplasmic lumina, arranged in a variety of architectural patterns, including diffuse, small glandular, insular, trabecular, and Indian file arrangements. The overall appearances closely resembled a breast lobular carcinoma. In all cases, there was a minor superficial component of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, suggesting that the component that resembled breast lobular carcinoma, arose from the differentiated neoplasm. All cases were diffusely p16-positive, and 2 that underwent human papillomavirus testing contained high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus, type 16 and 18 in 1 case each. In all cases, there was loss of e-cadherin membranous immunoreactivity in the areas resembling breast lobular carcinoma, a similar pattern of staining to that seen in the latter neoplasm and possibly accounting for the morphologic features. In 2 cases, there was extracervical spread, including distant lymph node metastasis in 1. In reporting these cases, we highlight an unusual morphologic variant of cervical adenocarcinoma closely resembling breast lobular carcinoma and which may have an aggressive behavior.
