Review of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and squamous lesions of the uterine cervix. With heterosexual transmission becoming the primary mode of transmission, more women are being infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Accrued data from around the world indicate that these HIV-infected women exhibit higher rates of persistent HPV infection with multiple oncogenic viruses, more abnormal Pap tests, more prevalent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions, and aggressive invasive cervical cancer compared with their HIV-negative counterparts. In countries where HAART was introduced more than a decade ago, HPV-related disease is increasing among ageing HIV-positive women. The high rate of cervical disease seen in HIV-positive women has prompted recommendations for more aggressive surveillance. The best strategy to screen HIV-infected women, particularly in resource-poor nations, remains challenging. This article reviews the collective literature regarding HIV and squamous lesions of the cervix and highlights these key issues.
