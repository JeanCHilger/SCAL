Koilocytes are enriched for alkaline-labile sites. This study investigated possible variations in the chromatin structure of koilocytes resulting from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Alkaline-labile sites (ALS) were detected with the DNA breakage detectionâ€“fluorescence in situ hybridization (DBD-FISH) technique using a whole human genome DNA probe obtained from individuals without koilocytosis. The variable levels of ALS present were measured quantitatively using image analysis after whole-genome DNA hybridization. A significant increase in the number of ALS was observed in koilocytes compared with normal cells. We demonstrated that the presence of ALS could be an indicator of chromatin change in koilocytes caused by HPV infection.
