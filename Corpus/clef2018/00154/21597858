Hpv detection in stained cytological cervical specimens and correlation with cytology and histology. It has been suggested that detection of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia contributes to transition to high grade lesions and cancer. Currently, the PAP smear is the primary screening tool to identify women with cervical disease, specifically cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN). In the present study we examined the utility of HPV detection and typing by PCR, in women with cytological and/or histological evidence of low grade squamous lesion (LGSL), using stained PAP cervical smears. HPV infection was confirmed in 21 out of the 31 (68%) specimens examined.
