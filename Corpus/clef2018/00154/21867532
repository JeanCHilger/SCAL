Neuromuscular electrical stimulation and biofeedback therapy may improve endometrial growth for patients with thin endometrium during frozen-thawed embryo transfer: a preliminary report. To investigate the effect of pelvic floor Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) Therapy in improving endometrial thickness in women with thin endometrium.41 patients undergoing assisted reproduction with a thin endometrium (less than or equal to7 mm) were recruited and advised to go for a pelvic floor NMES in frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle. PHENIX Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Therapy System was used according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol for 20 to 30 minutes of intermittent vaginal electrical stimulation on the treatment days.A total of 20 and 21 were included in the NMES and non-NMES groups respectively. 12 out of 20 (60%) patients developed endometrial thickness equal to or more than 8 mm after the NMES therapy, which was the primary outcome. The mean thickness of endometrium before and after was respectively 5.60 mm (0.82 mm) and 7.93 mm (1.42 mm) in the therapy group versus 5.50 mm (1.00) and 6.78 mm (0.47) in the control group the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.002). There was higher pregnancy rate in the NMES group (42% versus 35%) but the difference was not statistically significant.Neuromuscular Electrical stimulation therapy may be effective for the patients with a thin endometrium. Further studies are needed to investigate its effectiveness.
