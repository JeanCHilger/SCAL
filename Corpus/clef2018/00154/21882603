Value of HPV (hybrid capture 2) testing for assessing the effectiveness of conservative surgical treatment in CIN2-3/carcinoma in situ and microinvasive cervical cancer. The prospective study in 525 patients with CIN2-3/CIS and microinvasive cervical cancer showed the association of epithelial lesions with HPV HR in almost all cases. This allowed using HPV-testing for conservative surgical treatment (ablation, LEEP/ LLETZ, conization) efficacy assessment and patient follow-up. The value of HPV-testing for residual disease and recurrence detection was higher that of cytology and colposcopy. HPV-testing showed 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value. Hybrid Capture 2 test was more useful for residual disease and recurrence detection than PCR, showed higher specificity (96% vs. 79,2%) and positive predictive value (44.8% vs. 13.4%). After conservative surgical treatment of CIN2-3/carcinoma in situ and microinvasive cervical cancer Hybride Capture 2 is to become negative thus confirming the adequacy of neoplastic tissue excision.
