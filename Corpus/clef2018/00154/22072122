Nuclear co-expression of p14ARF and p16INK4A in uterine cervical cancer-derived cell lines containing HPV. The Papanicolaou test (Pap) has been responsible for a significant reduction of cervical cancer-related morbimortality. In order to increase its sensitivity and specificity new markers have been studied and incorporated to cytological and histological methods for diagnosis for cervical cancer, such as p16INK4A that has been considered the immunocytochemical marker of choice for detection of HPV related cancers. We considered that p14ARF could be a complementary marker in order to improve the accuracy of cytological diagnosis because its genetic proximity to p16INK4A. We performed a systematic analysis of several putative cervical cancer markers in order to evaluate their performance in the detection of malignancy, in comparison with p16INK4A and p14ARF, using immunocytochemistry (ICC), immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analyses. Most markers were non-specific and could not discriminate HPV infected cancer cell lines from other non HPV malignant. In contrast, nuclear co-expression of p16INK4A and p14ARF was observed only in HPV-transformed cancer cell lines. Notably, in C-33A cervical cancer cells (HPV negative), p14ARF was present in the nucleoli, but p16INK4A was conspicuously absent from the nuclei of these cells. We conclude that both markers p16INK4A and p14ARF are complementary and should be evaluated jointly in order to improve the accuracy of cytological diagnosis of cervical cancer.
