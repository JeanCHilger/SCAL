Defining the validity of classical and non-classical cellular changes indicative of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion encompassing human papillomavirus infection in relation to human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as of now has been beyond doubt to be the causative agent for cervical carcinoma. Its morphological identification in Pap smear is important.To define the validity of classical and non-classical cellular changes indicative of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) encompassing HPV infection in relation to positivity for 'high risk' HPV16 as well as for 'low risk' HPV6/11.A total of 3000 Papanicolaou smears were screened, of which 150 were reported as low grade-SIL encompassing HPV infection (LSIL-HPV). Subsequently cervical scrapes from these 150 subjects, along with equal number of normal women as controls, were collected and processed for HPV deoxy-ribonucleic acid testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).ON THE BASIS OF CYTOMORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PAP SMEARS, HPV INFECTION WERE CATEGORIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING TWO GROUPS: Classical (koilocytic) changes (CC) encountered in 30 women and non-classical changes (NCC) encountered in 120 women. It was observed that 21 (70%) CC and 46 (38.3%) NCC of HPV infection were positive for HR-HPV16 however only 12 cases (10%) of NCC and two cases (6.6%) of CC were positive for LR-HPV 6/11. Majority (41.7%) of HPV positive cases were reported in the age group of 25 to 30 years and HPV positivity decreased with the increasing age.Classical cellular changes are not the only diagnostic features for HPV infection in Pap smear, non-classical diagnostic features also support the diagnosis of HPV infection and may be positive for HR-HPV16.
