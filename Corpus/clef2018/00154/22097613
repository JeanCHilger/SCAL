The study of combining high-risk human papillomavirus types checking and cytologic test in the screening of cervical lesions. To study the relationship between thinprep cytologic test and the types of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in cervical precancerous lesion screening.To perform high-risk HPV types test in 1375 samples. Choose 256 positive samples to take thinprep cytologic test (TCT) and directed biopsies under colposcopy. Adopting two-channels real time PCR to genotype and quantify eight high risk HPV DNA (high risk types: HPV 16, 18, 45, 31 intermediate risk types: HPV 33, 52, 58, 67).There are 256 positive samples in High risk HPV DNA test (18.62%). WNL rate for TCT is 16.41% (42/256), ASCUS and above rate for TCT is 83.59% (214/256). There is no statistically significant difference in the viral loads of HPV infection rate between the TCT negative patients and positive patients (P > 0.5). Positive correspondence rate for TCT and biopsy are 92.86% (39/42), 81.36% (48/59), 85.19% (23/27) and 9/10.High-risk HPV types checking combined with TCT and biopsy can raise positive rate significantly. It should be used as a reliable method for early diagnosis in cervical cancer and CIN screening.
