Factors associated with time to colposcopy after abnormal Pap testing in HIV-infected women. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for cervical dysplasia and require timely follow-up after an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test.This retrospective cohort study assessed the proportion of HIV-infected women with colposcopic evaluation after an abnormal Pap test. Time to colposcopy within 12 months after an abnormal Pap test was assessed with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling in a diverse cohort of HIV-infected women between October 1, 2003, and September 30, 2007.One hundred seventy-seven subjects had an abnormal Pap test: 22 high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL 12%), 120 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSILAlmost one third of HIV-infected women did not have a follow-up colposcopy by 12 months after an abnormal Pap test. Since HIV-infected women are at particularly high risk for cervical cancer, these results are unacceptably poor. Identification of the barriers to appropriate follow-up and targeted interventions are necessary to improve timely follow-up for cytologic abnormalities in this high-risk population.
