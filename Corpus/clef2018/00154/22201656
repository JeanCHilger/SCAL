Increasing mammography and cervical cancer knowledge and screening behaviors with an educational program. To evaluate the effectiveness of using an educational program based on self-efficacy to increase knowledge and create behavior change regarding recommended mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening guidelines.Pretest and post-test, prospective.An urban county in northern Indiana.56 women who attended one of four educational programs and 47 women who responded 15 months later.The one-hour educational programs based on self-efficacy included vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion regarding breast and cervical screening practices. Two programs were offered to local church groups as part of a health fair, and two were offered through health promotion initiatives sponsored by private businesses.Demographics, knowledge of breast and cervical cancer, and screening behaviors.Knowledge of risk and screening guidelines increased significantly immediately following the educational program (p < 0.001) and did not decrease significantly 15 months later (p = 0.57). Family history and history of human papillomavirus and sexually transmitted diseases were the top known risk factors for breast and cervical cancers, respectively. Participant-reported rates of screening behaviors increased 15 months later for mammography (100%) and Pap test (84%).Educational interventions based on self-efficacy increased knowledge of breast and cervical health and helped increase the rate of mammography and Pap tests.Preparing women with strategies to complete a mammogram and Pap test is an important approach to enhancing self-efficacy and increasing screening behaviors.
