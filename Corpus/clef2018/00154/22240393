Incidence of human papillomavirus infection in male sexual partners of women diagnosed with CIN II-III. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a very common sexually transmitted disease which has been strongly related to cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), penile cancer and intraepithelial and infiltrating anal squamous cell carcinoma.To describe the HPV status of male sexual partners of women diagnosed with CIN II/III and to evaluate the practical usefulness of the HPV detection in urine as a reliable marker of genital high-risk HPV infection in men.Ninety-one heterosexual male partners (mean age 32.7) were included in the study. A panel of epidemiological data was recorded. Peniscopy was performed at the first visit and after 6 months. Urine samples and anal and penile scrapings were obtained and Hybrid Capture II test for high-risk HPV was performed. Physical examination disclosed clinically or peniscopic lesions in only 5.4% patients. HPV was isolated in 12.9% and 6.2% of penile and anal scrapings respectively whereas HPV detection was positive in 28% of urine samples. Overall, 41% of the evaluated patients presented at least one finding diagnostic of HPV infection.HPV detection in male partners of women with CIN is a frequent event, and urine HPV detection by Hybrid Capture test is a sensitive method for its detection. The determination of HPV in urine samples seems to be a simple method to investigate the subrogated genital HPV infection in men.
