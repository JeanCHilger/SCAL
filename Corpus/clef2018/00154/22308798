Ovarian reserve. Ovarian reserve assessment has become critical when counselling infertile couples. This evaluation should be conducted in all women over 35 years, or earlier in case of familial history of premature ovarian failure, gonadotoxic treatment of short menstrual cycles. The first step for ovarian reserve assessment is to measure basal hormonal status, i.e. day 3 FSH and estradiol. If necessary, antral follicle count performed by a skilled operator and/or serum AMH level can give some relevant additional information. The historical concept of 2-years waiting does not make sense any more regarding the current delay in childbearing. Therefore, the infertility workup, and particularly ovarian reserve assessment, should be initiated after 6 months of infertility in all women over 35 years of age.
