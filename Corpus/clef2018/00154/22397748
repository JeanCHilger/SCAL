Repeat transvaginal ultrasound-guided ovarian interstitial laser treatment improved the anovulatory status in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. To assess the effectiveness of repeated transvaginal ultrasound-guided ovarian interstitial laser treatment in the management of anovulatory patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A retrospective study was performed in our department on 27 anovulatory PCOS women who failed to respond to the first ultrasound-guided transvaginal ovarian interstitial laser treatment. Each woman received a repeat procedure and postoperative rates of ovulation and pregnancy were monitored.Of 27 patients, 18 (66.67%) ovulated spontaneously following the repeated ultrasound-guided transvaginal ovarian interstitial laser treatment Ten women became pregnant within six postoperative months and a cumulative pregnancy rate of 37.04% was achieved. There were no significant operative complications.Repeated ultrasound-guided transvaginal ovarian interstitial laser treatment is an effective and safe management in anovulatory PCOS patients who fail to respond or have a transient response to the first transvaginal ovarian interstitial laser treatment.
