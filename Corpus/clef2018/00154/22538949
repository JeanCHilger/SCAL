Human papillomavirus infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in dialyzed patients. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a risk factor for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The incidence of certain cancers such as HPV-associated CIN is higher among dialysis patients than in the general population. In the literature there are few studies on the prevalence of HPV infection among dialyzed women and almost all of these studies concerned women with positive Pap smears. We enrolled 73 hemodialyzed women attending our center from January 2009 to December 2010 29 denied informed consent and 44 underwent Pap tests and cervical curettage for HPV (mean age 62 Â± 15 years). We found HPV positivity in 6 women (prevalence 13.6%). The prevalence of CIN in our sample was also 13.6% (6/44), 83.3% of which HPV related. Since cervical curettage for HPV is a cheap and easy to perform test with high specificity and sensitivity, we believe it is worthwhile including it in the pre-transplant workup of such women to lower the incidence of CIN in dialyzed patients and transplant recipients.
