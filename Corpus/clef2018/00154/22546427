Inferior epigastric artery pseudoaneurysm following trocar injury. Herein is described the development of an inferior epigastric pseudoaneurysm caused by a trocar injury during laparoscopic surgery. After the accessory trocar was placed in the left lower quadrant, the patient's condition became clinically unstable, requiring blood transfusions postoperatively and transfer to our tertiary care center. On arrival, she continued to have pain, with a palpable tender mass in the left lower quadrant. A computed tomography scan revealed a 5 Ã— 6-cm mass in the anterior rectus sheath, with central hyperattenuation. This was better characterized at ultrasonography. The findings were consistent with an unstable pseudoaneurysm from the left inferior epigastric artery, with surrounding hematoma. Urgent embolization was performed by Interventional Radiology using coils inserted distal, into, and proximal to the pseudoaneurysm. The patient's condition was stable after the procedure, and she returned to the referring hospital for convalescence. Pseudoaneurysm of the inferior epigastric artery from a trocar injury is a rare occurrence. This case is the first report of a pseudoaneurysm forming in the inferior epigastric artery resulting from a trocar injury during gynecologic surgery.
