Increased regression and decreased incidence of human papillomavirus-related cervical lesions among HIV-infected women on HAART. To determine the impact of HAART on incidence, regression, and progression of cytopathological abnormalities in HIV-infected women.Prospective cohort.HIV-infected women (N=1123) from Soweto, South Africa underwent serial cervical smears that were analyzed and reported using the Bethesda System. The results of HAART and non-HAART users were compared using two statistical approaches: a survival analysis assessing risk of incident smear abnormality among women with baseline normal smear results and analysis with marginal models assessing for an association between HAART use and likelihood of regression/progression in consecutive smears.After multivariate survival analysis, women using HAART with a normal baseline smear were 38% less likely to have an incident smear abnormality during follow-up than nonusers [confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.91 P=0.01]. Multivariate marginal models analysis identified a significantly increased likelihood (odds ratio 2.61Our large prospective cohort study adds significant weight to the side of the balance of clinical research supporting the positive impact of HAART on the natural history of human papillomavirus-related cervical disease in HIV-infected women.
