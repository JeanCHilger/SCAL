Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma associated with atypical glandular cells on liquid-based cervical cytology. In 2008, the management of women in Ireland with atypical glandular cells changed to immediate referral to colposcopy. The optimal management of these women is unclear. A balance between the detection of occult disease and overtreatment is required.Our study aim was to document the experience of this policy at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin. Information from the computerized data management system was analysed with the statistical package SPSS.In 2009, 156 women attended colposcopy following a single atypical glandular cell diagnosis on liquid-based cytology. The mean age was 41 years. Thirty (19.2%) women had abnormal vaginal bleeding, 31 (19.9%) were smokers and 34 (21.8%) had received previous treatment. The colposcopy was satisfactory in 125 (80.1%) and unsatisfactory in 31 (19.9%). Cervical histology was available for 146 (93.6%) women: 57 excisional procedures and 89 diagnostic biopsies. Abnormal histology was detected in 46 women (31.5%). Four women (2.7%) had invasive cancer, five (3.4%) had adenocarcinoma in situ, 21 (14.4%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 and 16 (11.0%) had CIN1. No abnormality was detected in 100 women (68.5%), including 35 (61.4%) of those who had undergone excisional procedures. The colposcopic impression in this group was unsatisfactory in 10 women (28.6%), glandular abnormalities in six (17.1%), high- and low-grade changes in 12 (34.2%) and six (17.1%) women, respectively, and normal in one (2.9%). The findings were essentially negative in the remaining 10 women: overall, 30 (19.2%) of the 156 women referred to colposcopy had at least CIN2.This study confirmed significant levels of high-grade disease in women referred to colposcopy with atypical glandular cells on cytology. Concerns about undetected endocervical disease resulted in high levels of negative excisional biopsies. Alternative strategies, including endometrial sampling, human papillomavirus testing and discussion at clinicopathological meeting, should be considered.
