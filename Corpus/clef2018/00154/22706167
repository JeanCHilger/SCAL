Probiotics enhance the clearance of human papillomavirus-related cervical lesions:  a prospective controlled pilot study. Probiotics have been proposed for a number of urogenital infectious conditions. In this study, we examine a possible effect on human papillomavirus (HPV)-related precancerous lesions in cervical cytology. We conducted a prospective controlled pilot study, in which 54 women with an HPV+low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion diagnosis in their PAP smear were followed for 6 months. The intervention group consumed a daily probiotic drink during the study period the control group received no treatment, according to common care policy. Outcome measures were the control PAP smear and HPV status after 6 months. Probiotic users had a twice as high chance of clearance of cytological abnormalities (60 vs. 31%, P=0.05). HPV was cleared in 19% of control patients versus 29% of probiotic users (P=0.41). This exploratory pilot study suggests that the probiotic studied promotes the clearance of HPV-related cytological abnormalities. If confirmed, this would represent an entirely new option to manage cervical cancer precursors.
