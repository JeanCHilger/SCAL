Epidemiology and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women of Henan Province, China. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the commonest sexually transmitted infection, which is associated with various clinical conditions. This study aimed to determine the distribution of HPV genotypes in the women of Henan Province, China.Cervical samples were collected by liquid-based method and consecutively evaluated cervical cytology and the presence of HPV DNA. Cytological classification was made according to the Bethesda 2001 criteria. HPV DNA was tested with xMAP technology by Luminex200â„¢.In cervical abnormalities, the infection rate of HPV was 84.0%, single type was 71.0%, multiple type was 13.0%, high risk HPV was 78.0% and low risk HPV was 8.0%. The most common genotypes found were HPV16, 52, 58, 33, 18, 6 and 39. The most common HPV genotypes were HPV16, 52, 6, 58 and 33 in NILM, HPV16, 52, 18, 58 and 6 in ASCUS, HPV52, 16, 58, 6 and 39 in LSIL, HPV16, 33, 58, 18 and 51 in HSIL, and HPV16, 18, 33, 58 and 52 in ICC, respectively. The prevalence of single HPV and multiple HPV was 64.8% and 13.3%, respectively. Age-specific prevalence of multiple HPV exhibited a "U" shaped curve.Single HPV genotype infection was predominantly detected in different groups of cervical lesions in Henan Province, and HPV16, 52, 58, 33, 18 and 6 were the priority HPV types.
