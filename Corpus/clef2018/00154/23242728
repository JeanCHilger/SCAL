Antisepsis regimen in the surgical treatment of HPV generated cervical lesions: polyhexamethylene biguanide vs chlorhexidine. A randomized, double blind study. To reduce the risk of local infections after surgical treatments for HPV infected cervical lesions, the post-operative regimen is generally based on the use of vaginal antimicrobial agents.The efficacy and safety of polyhexamethylene biguanide-based vaginal suppositories was compared to a similar chlorhexidine-based treatment, in the post recovery regimen after surgical treatment of cervical lesions.50 women who underwent to CO2 laser therapy for cervical lesions were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of antiseptic treatment with chlorhexidine digluconate vaginal suppositories, or polyhexamethylene biguanide vaginal suppositories (Monogin®/Biguanelle® ovuli, Lo.Li. Pharma, Italy). A weekly follow-up check was performed for 6 weeks.Polyhexamethylene biguanide-based treatment showed improved efficacy compared to chlorhexidine, in terms of healing process and prevention of bacterial infections.Due to its safety and effectiveness, the vaginal treatment with polyhexamethylene biguanide is preferred to chlorexidine, in accordance with previously reported in vitro evidences.
