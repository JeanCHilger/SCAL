Current recommendations for cervical cancer screening: do they render the annual pelvic examination obsolete? The development of a screening test for cervical dysplasia has been a major force in diminishing the worldwide incidence of invasive cervical cancer. Screening intervals recommended by professional organizations have changed over the past half century. Recognition of the human papillomavirus (HPV) as the causative agent and enhanced understanding of the natural history of HPV and cervical dysplasia in different age groups have prompted the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other professional societies to defer Pap smear screening to intervals no less than 2 years apart in women 21-29, and every 3 years in women 30 and over assuming no prior history of cervical dysplasia. Screening should start no sooner than age 21. These recommendations more closely resemble those currently practiced in Europe and other parts of the developed world. Those who have undergone hysterectomy no longer need screening unless high-grade dysplasia was present. Although the value of pelvic examination is not debated in women with symptoms referable to the female genital tract, the endorsement by several professional societies of less than annual cervical cancer screening in healthy women also begs the question of whether annual pelvic examination (speculum and/or bimanual examination) benefits asymptomatic women. Some sexually transmitted infections are amenable to self-insertion of a vaginal probe or detectable by voided urine specimen. Bimanual examination is insensitive in detecting early ovarian cancer with a high false-positive rate leading to patient anxiety, excessive diagnostic testing, and unnecessary surgical procedures. Future study should focus on the frequency in which healthy asymptomatic women should undergo pelvic examination.
