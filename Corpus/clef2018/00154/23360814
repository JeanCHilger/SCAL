Characterization of ovarian tumors and staging ovarian cancer with 3-dimensional power Doppler angiography: correlation with pathologic findings. The aims of this study were to evaluate ovarian tumors with 3-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3-DPDA), to determine its correlation with histology findings, and to explore its role in staging patients with ovarian cancer.Three hundred eighteen women with an unknown unilateral pelvic mass were referred for preoperative evaluation by 3-DPDA angiography. Patients' ages ranged from 18 to 72 years (47.4 Â± 13.8 years). Sonographic criteria used for the characterization of ovarian tumors were based on a system that included morphological characteristics, histological evaluation, and Power Doppler imaging.Two hundred twenty-five tumors were histopathologically diagnosed as benign and 93 as malignant. Sensitivity and specificity of the 3-DPDA of ovarian masses reached 93.5% and 92.9%, respectively, whereas positive predictive value was 84.5% and negative predictive value was 97.2%.Three-dimensional power Doppler sonography is an effective imaging technique for discriminating ovarian neoplasms and classifying them according to histopathology.
