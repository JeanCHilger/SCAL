Ovarian tumor characterization and classification: a class of GyneScanâ„¢ systems. In this work, we have developed an adjunct Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that uses 3D acquired ultrasound images of the ovary and data mining algorithms to accurately characterize and classify benign and malignant ovarian tumors. In this technique, we extracted image-texture based and Higher Order Spectra (HOS) based features from the images. The significant features were then selected and used to train and test the Decision Tree (DT) classifier. The proposed technique was validated using 1000 benign and 1000 malignant images, obtained from 10 patients with benign and 10 with malignant disease, respectively. On evaluating the classifier with 10-fold stratified cross validation, we observed that the DT classifier presented a high accuracy of 95.1%, sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 97.7%. Thus, the four significant features could adequately quantify the subtle changes and nonlinearities in the pixel intensities. The preliminary results presented in this paper indicate that the proposed technique can be reliably used as an adjunct tool for ovarian tumor classification since the system is accurate, completely automated, cost-effective, and can be easily written as a software application for use in any computer.
