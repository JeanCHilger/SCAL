Comparison of follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, ovarian volume, and antral follicle count, based on the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop system, among community-based women in China. This study aims to describe changes in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), ovarian volume (OV), and antral follicle count (AFC), and to examine their relationships at the same menopause stage, based on the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) system, among Chinese women in community settings.Prospective longitudinal study design was used to analyze the sex hormone levels, OV, and AFC of 327 community women aged 30 to 65 years. They were followed up at 1 year.Significant differences in FSH, E2, and OV were observed at baseline and on follow-up (all P<0.001). Significant differences in E2 were observed between baseline and follow-up for women in premenopause (-2.743, P=0.006) and late postmenopause (-5.213, P<0.001). There were significant differences in FSH between baseline and follow-up in early menopausal transition (MT) (-2.430, P=0.015) and late MT (-3.737, P<0.001). There were significant differences in OV between baseline and follow-up in late MT (-3.805, P<0.001) and early postmenopause (-4.341, P<0.001). There were significant differences in AFC between baseline and follow-up in premenopause (-2.046, P=0.041).These results suggest the existence of significant associations between FSH, E2, OV, AFC, and menopause status, supporting the use of the STRAW system among community-based women in China. Further study of the MT is recommended to confirm the appropriateness of the STRAW system for Chinese women.
