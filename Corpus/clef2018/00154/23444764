Conservative management of massive hematoperitoneum caused by ovulation in a patient with severe form of von Willebrand disease--a case report. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding condition that involves extended or excessive bleeding, caused by the deficiency or defect of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Hematoperitoneum as a complication of gynecologic diseases represents acute condition which is usually caused by the hemorrhagic corpus luteum or a rupture of either ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. The authors present a unique case of conservatively managed massive hematoperitoneum caused by ovulation in a patient with severe form of von Willebrand disease who had right adnexectomy due to hemorrhagic corpus luteum four months prior. This conservative management by blood product and factor concentrate support could be a method of choice in selected hemodynamically stable patients. Furthermore, recurrent bleeding episodes following ovulation could be prevented by suppression of ovulation using oral contraceptive pills.
