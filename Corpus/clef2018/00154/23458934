Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infections in healthy Saudi women attending gynecologic clinics in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the major cause of cervical cancer. There is little published data on the prevalence of HPV infection among Saudi women. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HPV in a group of women in the western region of Saudi Arabia.A prospective study of Saudi women seeking gynecologic care at King Abdulaziz University Hospital from March 2010 to January 2011.Four hundred eighty-five Saudi women of different age groups attending gynecology clinic were tested for high-risk HPV DNA. HPV DNA was detected in cervical scrapes using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) high-risk HPV DNA test. The prevalence of HPV DNA positivity in different age groups was calculated.Out of the 485 specimens, 27 (5.6%) were positive for the high-risk HPV. The highest percentage was among women aged 60 years and older. Patients in the age group 40-49 years were more likely to accept HPV testing with a total of 188 patients.The prevalence of HPV in this group of Saudi women is similar to what was reported in some Arab countries and lower than that reported in developed countries. This information could be used to help in establishing a primary screening program using HPV DNA testing in Saudi Arabia.
