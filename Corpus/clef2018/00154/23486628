Anterior sacral meningocele mimicking ovarian cyst: a case report. Anterior sacral meningocele (ASM) is a rare congenital anomaly, characterized by herniation through a defect in the anterior aspect of the sacrum. We reported a case of ASM associated with neurofibromatosis, which was mimicking a complex ovarian cyst in ultrasonography. ASM can easily be misdiagnosed as an ovarian cyst and needle aspiration can cause intracranial hypotension syndrome or even death.
