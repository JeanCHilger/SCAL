Sociodemographic inequalities in sexual activity and cervical cancer screening: implications for the success of human papillomavirus vaccination. Papanicolaou smear screening has significantly reduced cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. However, inequalities still persist across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. These inequalities have been associated with differential participation in screening. However, even with equal participation to screening, some women may still have greater risk of cervical cancer because of sexual behavior. We aim to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of women who reported greater sexual activity and/or screening underuse.We used data from (i) the Canadian Community Health Survey-2005, a population-based survey of 130,000 Canadians, and (ii) a multicenter study including 952 women screened for cervical cancer.Aboriginals and women with lower SES reported greater sexual activity and lower screening participation, which may produce synergetic effects toward higher cervical cancer risk. Women who did not complete high school and aboriginals were, respectively, 3.6 and 2.5 times more likely to report sexual debut before 15 years old compared with women with university degree and Caucasians. Women who did not complete high school were 2.2 times more likely to have never been screened compared with women with university degree. East and South Asian women were, respectively, 4.3 and 3.1 times more likely to have never been screened than Canadian-born women but reported lower levels of sexual activity and were adherent to screening guidelines when screened at least once.The success of human papillomavirus vaccination at reducing cervical cancer and inequalities will depend on achieving high coverage among high-risk subpopulations.These groups must be monitored closely, and if need be, targeted for additional interventions.
