Characterization and evaluation of pre-clinical suitability of a syngeneic orthotopic mouse ovarian cancer model. To develop and characterize the pre-clinical suitability of a syngeneic mouse epithelial ovarian cancer model in immunocompetent hosts.ID8 mouse ovarian surface epithelium cells were implanted into the left ovarian bursa of C57BL/6 mice. Using conventional as well as ultrasound-based techniques and histopathological analysis, the tumor weights, volumes, metastases, ascites and vascularity were observed over a period of 16 weeks.Ovarian weights and volume increased 12- and 7-fold, respectively. Ultrasound measurements of ovarian ID8 tumors correlated with the actual size obtained following surgical excision. Ascites and metastasis were first observed at 12 weeks post-orthotopic implantation. Histopathological analysis indicated similarities between orthotopically-generated ovarian tumors and human ovarian tumors. However, there was less evidence of angiogenesis in this animal model.The development of this mouse model closely replicates characteristics seen in human ovarian cancer with feasibility of using ultrasound to assess tumor formation, progression and vascularization.
