HPV-genotypes in high-grade intraepithelial cervical lesions in Danish women. A study was undertaken to assess the distribution of high-risk HPV-genotypes in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplastic lesions in Danish women.Observational, cross-sectional.Danish data from a multi-centre study undertaken in 13 European countries.290 archived fixed biopsies with high-grade cervical lesions from the Departments of Pathology at the University Hospitals in Hvidovre and Odense, Denmark.Relevant histological samples were anonymized and shipped to a central laboratory for histopathology review and PCR-testing for HPV-DNA. A standardised HPV-test methodology was utilised to enable comparison of HPV-genotype distribution.Of 290 Danish cervical samples, 276 were evaluated as histologically adequate and all of these were HPV-positive (HPV⁺). Of the HPV⁺ samples 77.9% were diagnosed with a single HPV-type, with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)3 diagnosed in 82.3% and CIN2, CIN2/3, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and AIS⁺ other high-grade lesion diagnosed in the remaining 17.7%. The most prevalent HPV-types were: HPV16 (54.0%), HPV33 (13.5%), HPV31 (10.7%), HPV18 (7.9%) and HPV52 (4.7%). Of the HPV⁺ samples, 21.4% were diagnosed with multiple HPV-types, with CIN3 diagnosed in 79.6% and CIN2, CIN2/3, AIS and AIS⁺ other high-grade lesion diagnosed in the remaining 20.4%. The most prevalent HPV-types were: HPV16 (49.2%), HPV31 (30.5%), HPV52 (27.1%), HPV51 (20.3%), HPV18 (16.9%), HPV33 (13.6%), HPV45 (11.9%), with 0.7% unknown types.HPV16 and HPV18 were detected in approximately 75% of high-grade intraepithelial cervical lesions in a Danish population (single or multiple infections) these two genotypes are considered causative in at least 61.9% of the high-grade intraepithelial lesions (single infection).
