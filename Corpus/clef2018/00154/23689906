Torque teno mini virus infection in chronic cervicitis and cervical tumors in Isfahan, Iran. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) is classified as the Betatorquevirus genus of Anelloviridae. Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population.79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction.Totally 62% of the tested samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster.The presence of the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus.
