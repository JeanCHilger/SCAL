Molecular diagnostics of pulmonary metastasis from cervical cancer. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are largely implicated in the carcinogenesis of cervical carcinomas. Their role in lung carcinomas, however, is still unclear. We describe the case of 44-year-old female chain-smoker with previous HPV-related cervical cancer and a new distant tumour in the lung after many years. The histologic distinction between metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and another primary squamous cell tumour of the lung can be difficult and has important clinical implications. The aim of our study was to investigate whether HPV was present in both the patient's cervical cancer and her subsequent primary lung cancer in order to appropriately plan therapy. We tested both the paraffin-embedded tissue of the cervical cancer and the lung cancer for HPV DNA using the Qiagen HPV Sign Genotyping Test, which detected HPV16-DNA in both tumours. The Qiagen HPV Sign Genotyping Test is a reliable method to detect HPV-DNA in tissue and cytological materials, thus making it possible to distinguish metastatic cervical carcinoma from a new primary tumour in different sites.
