Factors associated with high-risk HPV positivity in a low-resource setting in sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to determine demographic and behavioral factors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity in a community-based HPV self-collection cervical cancer screening pilot project.HPV self-collected samples were obtained from 199 women aged 30-69 years in the impoverished urban Ugandan community of Kisenyi, during September through November 2011. Demographic and behavioral information was collected. Descriptive statistics and a logistic regression model were used to analyze factors associated with HPV positivity.There was overwhelming acceptance of HPV self-collection in this community. High-risk HPV prevalence was found to be 17.6%. Lower levels of formal education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.40 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-2.03) were associated with higher prevalence of HPV as was use of oral contraception (AOR, 2.01Screening should be targeted and prioritized for women with lower levels of education, oral contraceptive use, and human immunodeficiency virus positivity as they have the highest HPV prevalence in this low-resource population.
