Current cervical cancer prevention strategies including cervical screening and prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccination: a review. As screening methods evolve and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination efforts gain traction, knowledge of the current evidence on effectiveness of prevention methods is critical to support further development of programs.Screening has dramatically reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality however, further progress could be made with implementing new screening techniques, such as HPV DNA testing. Continued focus has been given to methods such as visual inspection with acetic acid/Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) and self-testing, which may provide an alternative in settings and populations wherein infrastructural challenges and logistical barriers pose challenges to achieving high screening coverage. Postlicensure studies of HPV vaccine show continued effectiveness against genital warts, the first outcome possible to measure. Of note, age-at-vaccination seems to play a pivotal role in effectiveness. Studies examining safety of the HPV vaccines could not confirm any increased risk associated with vaccination.Existing cervical screening techniques are effective however, programs should consider implementing HPV DNA testing where applicable and further process developments for alternative methods may result in improved results. The HPV vaccine is safe and effective and should be given before sexual debut to achieve maximum protection.
