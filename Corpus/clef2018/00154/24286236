Uterine myomas treated with microwave ablation: the agreement between ablation volumes obtained from contrast-enhanced sonography and enhanced MRI. This study explores the agreement between ablated uterine myoma volumes obtained from contrast-enhanced sonography and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after microwave ablation therapy.Twenty uterine myomas in 18 patients (average size: 5.56 ± 1.26 cm) were successfully treated by microwave ablation. Contrast-enhanced sonography and enhanced MRI were performed within 7 days after the treatment. The ablation range of uterine myomas was observed and the ablation volume was calculated. By using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman regression analysis, the agreement between ablated uterine myoma volumes obtained from contrast-enhanced sonography and enhanced MRI after microwave ablation therapy was analysed.The ablated volume ranged from 13.66 to 135.27 cm(3) after ablation, and the mean volume was 66.59 ± 35.71 cm(3) by using contrast-enhanced sonography. Respectively, the ablated volume ranged from 10.88 to 137.83 cm(3), and the mean volume was 66.81 ± 35.45 cm(3) by using enhanced MRI. The limits of agreement between the two methods were (-10.83 cm(3), 8.39 cm(3)), ICC was 0.991 (F = 209.61, P < 0.05), and 95% confidence interval is (0.976, 0.996). The results revealed a good agreement between the two examination methods of contrast-enhanced sonography and enhanced MRI.Contrast-enhanced sonography and enhanced MRI can be used interchangeably in observing the ablation range of uterine myomas treated with microwave ablation. Contrast-enhanced sonography can be used as a preferred non-invasive examination and for follow-up. Meanwhile, enhanced MRI can be used to comprehensively determine the relationships among uterine myomas, the entire uterus, and surrounding tissues.
