Prevalence of cervical high-risk human papillomavirus infections in kidney graft recipients. Female kidney graft recipients are regarded as a group at risk of cervical cancer development. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of cervical high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in female kidney graft recipients in comparison to healthy controls.We assessed the prevalence of HR-HPV and CIN in 60 female kidney graft recipients of reproductive age in outpatient care of the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Warsaw. The control group consisted of 60 healthy women. Cervical swabs were analyzed with use of Amplicor HPV Roche Molecular Systems test, detecting DNA of 13 types of high-risk HPV: 6, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68.HR-HPV was detected in 11/60 kidney recipients and 15/60 healthy women (p=0.37). There was no correlation between HR-HPV presence and immunosuppressive regimen, underlying disease, graft function, or time interval from transplantation. In both groups, higher prevalence of HR-HPV was observed in females with â‰¥2 lifetime sexual partners. Abnormal Pap test results in 2 kidney recipients (2 cases of HSIL) and 2 healthy women (LSIL and HSIL) required colposcopy-guided cervical biopsy, which in all cases revealed CIN2+.Female kidney graft recipients seem to be equally exposed to cervical infection with HPV of high oncogenic potential as the healthy population.
