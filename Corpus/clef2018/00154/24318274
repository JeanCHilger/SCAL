Ovarian hydatid disease. Hydatid disease, also known as Echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus. The human cystic variant primarily affects liver and lungs. The pelvic location of the disease is a rare finding usually secondary to a ruptured liver cyst, although it may also appear as a primary lesion affecting the genital organs. Despite its rarity, in endemic areas, pelvic hydatid disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex adnexal cystic mass, to make an appropriate treatment strategy. The suspected diagnosis is based on imaging studies and serodiagnostic techniques, in which a new field of research attempts to find a standardized test with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. We report a case of primary pelvic hydatid disease in postmenopausal women operated for suspected ovarian cancer.
