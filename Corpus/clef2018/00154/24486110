Effect of concurrent radiochemotherapy and chemotherapy on serum proteins for prospective predictors of patients with HPV induced cervical cancer. To evaluate the effectiveness of radiochemotherapy and chemotherapy on human papilloma virus induced cervical cancer patients by the estimation of serum proteins and magnetic resonance imaging.HPV 16/18 viral DNA was detected in the plasma of cervical cancer patients (n=50) by PCR using HPV consensus primers. Of the 50 cervical cancer patients, 25 cases undergoing radiation with chemotherapy and another 25 cases undergoing chemotherapy. Levels of pre- and post-treated serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen, soluble CD44, cancer antigen-125 were measured and evaluated the tumour size at pre- and post-radiation based on magnetic resonance images. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in terms of protein levels and represented as whisker line graphs.Of the amplified 50 samples, HPV 16 and 18 strains were identified as 48 and 44%, respectively. Serum protein levels were significantly increased in both pre-treated groups when compared to healthy group. Post-treated (radiotherapy) cervical cancer patients' shows decreased tumour size when compared to pre-treated groups. Taking consideration of proteins, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, soluble CD44, cancer antigen-125 levels are more decreased in patients treated with radiochemotherapy than chemotherapy alone. The decreased levels of proteins were significantly higher in early stage of the cervical cancer than the advanced stage of cancer patients.Serum levels of protein markers are more improved in patients treated with radiochemotherapy than chemotherapy hence, radiochemotherapy may be the best choice of treatment with reference to proteins at early stage of cervical cancer when compared to chemotherapy alone.
