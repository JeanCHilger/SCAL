Recurrent high-grade cervical lesion after primary conization is associated with persistent human papillomavirus infection in Norway. This retrospective registry-based study aimed to assess the human papillomavirus (HPV)-type distribution in primary and recurrent high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+), and to discriminate pre-existing from newly-acquired infections.Cervical specimens from 58 women (median age (Q1-Q3): 37.6 (31.7-44.9)) who underwent primary (1998-2003) and repeat conizations were confirmed as CIN2+ during expert pathology review. HPV testing was performed using PCR MP-TS123 Luminex for 16 HPV types. Molecular HPV16 E6 and HPV18 LCR DNA sequencing was performed on specimens with persistent HPV16/18.All 58 paired cones were HPV positive 49 had CIN3+ in the primary cone. Forty-seven (95.9%) women with primary CIN3+ and recurrent CIN2+ had persistent high-risk (hr) HPV infection, of which 74.5% were HPV16/18. Two women had probable newly-acquired HPV16/52/56 and HPV39 infections. One woman with persistent HPV52 also had a probable new HPV16 E6 variant in the recurrent CIN2+. Median time delay (Q1-Q3) between conizations was 2.0 years (1.1-4.0), being shorter for women older than 40 years: 2.6 years (1.1-3.7) than for women younger than 40 years: 6.0 years (2.0-8.7). Primary conization histology revealed CIN3, cervical adenocarcinoma in situ and microinvasive carcinomas in 43 (87.8%), 5 (10.2%) and 1 (2.0%) women, respectively. Primary HPV16- and HPV18-infected CIN3+ had a shorter delay between conizations: 1.8years (1.2-4.4) and 2.2 years (0.4-NE), respectively, compared to HPV33-: 3.8 years (3.3-7.8) or other HPV type-infected: 8.2 years (6.0-NE) CIN3+.Routine post-conization hr-HPV DNA testing together with cervical cytology may provide a better prediction for potential recurrent disease. Further, primary prevention through adolescent vaccination may prevent CIN2+ and its recurrence.
