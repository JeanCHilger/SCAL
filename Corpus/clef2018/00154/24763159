Cost-utility of routine endometrial evaluation before le fort colpocleisis. Routine preoperative evaluation of the endometrium before Le Fort colpocleisis is often recommended. There are no data, however, to support this practice. In select patients, it may not be a necessary addition to the preoperative evaluation of Le Fort colpocleisis.A decision analysis model was created to compare uterine evaluation, by either endometrial (EM) biopsy or transvaginal ultrasound, to no evaluation for a hypothetical cohort of women undergoing Le Fort colpocleisis. We assumed the absence of risk factors for EM cancer. Probabilities and health outcome utilities were obtained from literature review. Medicare charges were used to estimate cost in 2012 US dollars. Cost-utility analysis was performed using US recommendations from a health plan perspective.At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000, no evaluation is superior to both biopsy and ultrasound. At a 64% probability of cancer, biopsy is more cost-effective than no evaluation and ultrasound.Compared to biopsy and ultrasound, in low-risk women, no EM evaluation before Le Fort colpocleisis demonstrates superior cost-utility.
