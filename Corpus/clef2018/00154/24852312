Algorithmic approach to solid adnexal masses and their mimics: utilization of anatomic relationships and imaging features to facilitate diagnosis. Solid adnexal masses, while less common than their cystic counterparts, may present a challenge for radiologists given the wide range of histologic entities that occur in this region. Pelvic masses, especially when large, can seem overwhelming at first but application of an algorithmic approach allows for more confident assessment. This approach focuses first on the use of anatomic relationships and interactions of various pelvic structures to localize the mass' origin. For instance, the directionality of ureteral displacement can suggest if a mass is intra or extraperitoneal. Then, key discriminating imaging features, such as the presence of fat, hypervascularity, or low T2 signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be applied to further narrow the list of diagnostic possibilities. Entities such as leiomyomas, nerve sheath tumors, congenital uterine anomalies, and vascular abnormalities (ovarian torsion or iliac vessel aneurysm) in particular are often accurately characterized with sonography and/or MRI. For solid adnexal masses in which a definitive diagnosis by imaging is not reached, information germane to clinicians regarding further management can still be provided, principally with regard to surgical vs. nonsurgical treatment.
