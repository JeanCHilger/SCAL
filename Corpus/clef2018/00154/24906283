Hydatidiform mole presentation as a tubal ectopic pregnancy. Presentation of hydatidiform mole as tubal ectopic pregnancy is very rare. These patients usually present with ectopic pregnancy and are later diagnosed with hydatidiform mole on the basis of histological examination following surgery. We present the case of a 32-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain and vaginal bleed since 2 days of presentation. She was vitally stable. There was mild tenderness in hypogastrium and left iliac fossa. Pelvic examination showed mild bleeding per vaginum and fullness in both fornices. The patient was suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasonography of pelvis revealed fluid in cul-de-sac and a sac like mass of 1.8 cm attached to the left ovary. On laparotomy, there was a left sided tubal ectopic pregnancy and subsequently left salpingectomy was done. Histopathology of the tissue sample showed features of partial hydatidiform mole. Ectopic pregnancy can present as hydatidiform mole in rare cases for which histological examination of the tissue is required to establish the diagnosis.
