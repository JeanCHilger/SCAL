Spontaneous rupture of tubal leiomyoma causing haemoperitoneum. Leiomyomas are benign tumours that usually originate from the genital tract organs, particularly from the uterus. Spontaneous rupture of leiomyomas is a relatively rare condition. Herein, we report a 70 years old lady who was admitted through the emergency room with sudden abdominal pain. A ruptured mass originating from the fallopian tube, causing haemoperitoneum was revealed at laparotomy. Pathological examination revealed cellular leiomyoma.
