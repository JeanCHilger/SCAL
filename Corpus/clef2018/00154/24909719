Complex of molecular genetic and immunohistochemical methods for detection of human papillomavirus in the bladder cancer epithelium. A battery of tests for detection human papillomavirus DNA, mRNA corresponding to viral oncogenes, and viral oncoprotein E7 in cancer bladder urothelium was piloted in 35 samples of bladder cancer. DNA of human papillomavirus type 16 (causes cervical cancer) was found in 16 (46%) samples E6/E7 oncogene transcript and E7 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus type 16 were detected in 10 and 7 human papillomavirus DNA-positive samples, respectively. These findings attest to association of bladder cancer with human papillomavirus in Russia.
