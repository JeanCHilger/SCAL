Impact of human papillomavirus coinfections on the risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and cervical cancer. The molecular and epidemiologic effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) coinfections in the risk of developing cervical cancer is yet unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency HPV coinfections at different stages of cervical lesions in the development of cervical cancer and the impact of HPV specific type interactions on high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) risk.HPV testing was performed in 931 cervical samples diagnosed as: negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)In HPV positive samples, coinfections are as common in ICC/HSIL as in LSIL/NILM (47.12% and 40.17%, respectively). There is an increased risk to ICC/HSIL when multiple high-risk HPV types are present. The coinfection of HPV68 with HPV16 increases the risk of ICC/HSIL (OR=14.54, P=0.012, after multivariate adjustment), related to the presence of HPV16 or HPV68 alone.These results sustain that specific HPV coinfections confer an increased risk to develop ICC/HSIL.
