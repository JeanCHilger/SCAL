HPV-negative carcinoma of the uterine cervix: a distinct type of cervical cancer with poor prognosis. Using highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, we reanalysed all cervical carcinomas (CCs) found to be human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative by Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) to determine the prevalence of true HPV-negativity. We also evaluated the characteristics of the patients with tumours with confirmed HPV-negativity.Observational study.Barcelona, Spain.A cohort of 136 women with CC (32 adenocarcinomas, 104 squamous cell carcinomas) who had pre-treatment HC2 testing.All negative cases were reanalysed and genotyped for HPV using three PCR assays (SPF10, GP5+/6+ and E7-specific assay).Percentage of confirmed HPV-negative and HPV-positive tumours. Clinicopathological features and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of both groups.Fourteen of 136 women (10.2%) were negative for HPV by HC2. After reanalysis by PCR-based techniques only 8/136 (5.8%) tumours were confirmed as HPV-negative, whereas in six cases different HPVs were identified [HPV-11, -16 (two tumours), -18, -45, and -68]. Confirmed HPV-negativity was more frequent in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas (5/32, 15.6% versus 3/104, 2.9%, respectively P = 0.017). Patients with CCs with confirmed HPV-negativity had significantly worse DFS than women with HPV-positive tumours [51.9 months (95% CI 12.2-91.7 months) versus 109.9 months (95% CI 98.2-121.5 months)An HC2-negative result is an uncommon finding in women with CC, but in almost half of these cases HPVs are identified by more sensitive techniques. CCs with confirmed HPV-negativity are more frequently adenocarcinomas, and seem to be associated with worse DFS.
