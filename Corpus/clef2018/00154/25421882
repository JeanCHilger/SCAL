Liquid-based cytology and HPV DNA testing using intra-anal specimens from HIV-negative women with and without genital HPV-induced lesions. Screening for anal cancer using cytology has not been considered in immunocompetent women. The aim of this study was to identify cytological atypia and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in intra-anal specimens from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative women with and without genital HPV lesions.This study was a cross-sectional analysis of 142 women who were negative for the HIV: 80 with genital lesions that were associated with HPV and 62 without HPV-induced lesions. The women were evaluated at the Federal University of Cear√° from October 2011 to June 2012. The statistical analysis included the Fisher exact test and the odds ratio (CI 95%).Atypical anal cytology was observed in 24 (29.3%) patients in the study group and in 11 (17.8%) patients in the control group. In cases with at least two sites of HPV-associated lesions, 12 (41.4%) presented atypical cytology (P = 0.0220 OR = 2.7621, 1.1579-6.5889). When the practice of anal sex was evaluated, atypical cytology was observed in 22/43 (34%) [P = 0.0214Based on the results, liquid-based cytology may be used to detect intra-anal lesions, especially among women who have a history of anal intercourse or who have genital HPV-associated lesions at multiple sites.
