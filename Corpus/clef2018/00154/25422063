Clinical features, treatment and outcomes of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia in a Chinese tertiary centre. The aim of this study is to review a cohort of cases with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) in a Chinese tertiary centre and to analyze the relationship between VAIN and cervical neoplasm, the treatment of the disease, and the outcomes.We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing treatment for VAIN from January 2007 to June 2013. All the data of demographics, history, histological information, and HPV testing results were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 10.0 software.The study comprised of 184 patients. 132 out of 184 cases were diagnosed with cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). 19 cases occurred after treatment of cervical neoplasia, and 33 patients were without any cervical lesion at the time of diagnosis. The average age of total patients was 48.30 Â± 11.58. There were no significant differences in age, parity, and HPV infection among different groups. No significant differences were found in age, parity, and HPV infection between low-grade VAIN1 and high-grade VAIN (VAIN2 and VAIN3). The main treatment was electrofulguration and focal resection. The primary remission rate was 87.62 %. Four patients of VAIN1 were observed with the result of no recurrence in three cases.VAIN is a disease which has a close relationship with cervical neoplasia. Electrofulguration treatment with local resection is a suitable treatment with a much lower recurrence rate. For VAIN 1, observation may be a good choice especially for younger patients.
