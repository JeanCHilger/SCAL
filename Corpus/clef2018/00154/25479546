Prospects of molecularly-targeted therapies for cervical cancer treatment. Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women worldwide and is responsible for 275.000 deaths each year. The development of cervical cancer has been linked to cell cycle disturbances caused by persistent expression of high- risk HPV oncoproteins (E5, E6 and E7), which modulate the expression of host genes and cellular microRNAs. An estimated 5 million women throughout the world are currently infected by HPV and several of them will develop invasive cervical cancer. Despite failures in conventional screening tests, approved therapies have no direct effect on HPV infection. In view of this, effective therapy for cervical cancer is still urgently needed, particularly in developing countries where more than 85% of fatal cases occur. In this paper we review the current molecular targeted therapies which are being explored and may have a significant impact on the treatment of HPV- related cervical dysplasia and carcinoma.
