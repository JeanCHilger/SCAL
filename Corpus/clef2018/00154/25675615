Cytology in patients with chlamydial endocervicitis. A short review of the biological and epidemiological established causal role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in all types of cervical cancer most cancers of the vagina and anus of the cancer of the vulva, penis, and oropharynx, as and other types of cancer causally related to HPV such as skin cancer, melanoma and cancers of the conjunctiva exposure of other sexually transmissible infections (STD), such as Chlamydia trachomatis as co-factors that modify risk are required for transfer of cervical HPV infection to cancer.By comparing changes in smears in Papanycolau /PAP/ patients with chlamydial and nehlamidialen endotservitsit to assess the involvement of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cofactor for the development of cancer.Prospective study results direct immunofluorescence study /DIF/ for Chlamydia trachomatis and results in PAP smears.708 patients were sexually active at the age of 16 to 65 years, classified by age 16 to 19, 20 to 29, 30 to 65, with a proven endotservitsit of gynecological examination, with studies made Chlamydia trachomatis /DIF/, a smear Pap.There is no difference between the average values of cytology of patients in the PAP I and PAP II, positive Chl. trachomatis, ie., And that it is statistically insignificant. The number of patients with Chl. trachomatis, PAP II /positive/, more than the number of patients with Chlamydia trachomatis PAP I /positive/ Having inflammatory changes in smear of PAP II-82/65.6% compared with PAP I-36 pieces /28.8%/ shows that two thirds of patients positive for Chl.trachomatis, have cytology PAP II. Patients with PAP IV, IV-V are in the group of Chlamydia trachomatis /negative/. These are lacking in the group of Chlamydia trachomatis /positive/. Our results give us reason to conclude that Chlamydia trachomatis is not affected by co-factor prevalence of significant abnormalities in the cervical smear, but inflammatory changes in cytology may be the result of infection with C. trachomatis
