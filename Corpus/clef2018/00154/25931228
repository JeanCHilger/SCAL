Analysis of human papillomavirus infection in 16 320 patients from gynecologic clinic. To evaluate the genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in patients from gynecology clinic, and to investigate the association of persistent HPV infection with cervical lesions.From January, 2009 to December, 2013, clinical data of 16 320 patients in Third Xiangya Hospital were collected. A retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the overall prevalence of HPV infection. The prevalence of HPV infection in different ages and subtypes were compared. The prevalence of persistent HPV infection and results of cervical cytology were analyzed.The overall HPV prevalence was 26.54%. The lowest overall and high-risk HPV prevalence were found in women at the age of 30-39 years old (P<0.05) the highest ones were found at the age of over 60 years old, with significant difference among the aged groups (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in low-risk HPV prevalence among the aged groups (P=0.693). The clearance rate of HPV was 87.65% one year later. There was no significant difference in high-risk and low-risk HPV infection between the non-persistent positive group and the persistent positive group (P=0.545), but the difference in single and multiple subtypes infection between these 2 groups was significant (P<0.05). In the persistent positive group, the most common genotypes were HPV 16, 52, 58, CP8304, and 33. The incidence of ASC-US, HSIL or SCC was significantly increased in the persistent positive group.Persistent HPV infection mainly consists of multiple and high-risk HPV infection. It is necessary to focus on the prevention of HPV 16, 52 and 58 persistent infection in our region.
