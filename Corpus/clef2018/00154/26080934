High-risk HPV genotyping PCR testing as a means of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions early screening. To explored high-risk HPV genotyping PCR testing whether as a feasible means for the early screening of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.From January 2013 to June 2014, 15,192 outpatients in China-Japan Friendship Hospital voluntary were tested by high-risk type HPV genotyping PCR. The average age of them were (33±8) years old. High-risk HPV types genotyping PCR tested by fluorescence PCR technology, in which 13 kinds of high-risk HPV subtypes were detected, including HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68. A total of 4,315 cases of them were tested by the liquid-based cytology (LCT), among them with positive of high-risk HPV genotyping tested by PCR (n=2,366) were biopsy under colposcope (648 cases) in those LCT results were positive or LCT negative but HPV16 positive or LCT negative but had the clear clinical symptoms or and non-HPV16 positive but with clear clinical symptoms. (1) Analysis high-risk HPV infection status of 15 192 women. (2) As the pathological diagnosis was the gold standard in the diagnosis of cervical lesions, analysis of the relationship among high-risk HPV infection, virus loads and cervical lesions. (3) To evaluated the value of high-risk HPV genotyping PCR tested method in screening of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.⑴ Of 15,192 cases tested by high-risk HPV genotyping PCR, 2,366 cases were HPV positive (HPV infection), the overall infection rate was 15.57% (2,366/15,192), in which a single subtype of HPV infection in 1,767 cases, infection rate was 11.63% (1,767/15,192), and multiple subtypes of HPV infection (two and more subtypes HPV infection) in 599 cases, infection rate was 3.94% (599/15,192). The HPV16, 52 and 58 infections were the most common HPV subtypes in 13 subtypes, the infection rate was 3.95% (600/15,192), 2.86% (435/15,192) and 2.67% (406/15,192), respectively. (2) The most relevant subtypes with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II and even higher lesion were HPV16, 52 and 58, accounted for 57.7% (154/267) of all above CIN II lesions. The most relevant subtype with the cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN) II or above lesions was HPV18, 3 cases with CGIN II or above lesions were all single HPV18 infection. The pathologic examination positive percentage of patients which HPV virus loads≤10(3) copys/10(4) cells was 18.2% (25/137), while the pathologic examination positive proportion was 33.3% (247/742) which HPV virus loads≥10(4) copys/10(4) cells, there was statistically significant difference between them (χ2=27.06, P=0.000). (3) Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detection of CIN II or above using HPV genotyping PCR were 96.11%, 85.76%, 30.94% and 99.70%, respectively.There were a guiding significance for high-risk HPV genotyping PCR tested in screening of cervical cancer and precancerous lesion. HPV16, 52 and 58 were related to the severe cervical squamous epithelial lesions, while HPV18 was related to cervical severe glandular cell pathological changes. HPV genotyping is feasible and economical as the first choice of opportunistic screening in tertiary hospitals.
