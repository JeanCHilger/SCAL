Clinical significance of HPV L1 capsid protein detection in cervical exfoliated cells in high-risk HPV positive women. To explore the clinical significance of human papillomavirus L1 capsid protein detection in cervical exfoliated cells in high-risk HPV positive women.From November 2012 to June 2013, 386 high-risk HPV positive (detected by hybrid capture II) cases were enrolled as eligible women from Huzhou Maternity & Child Care Hospital and Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. All eligible women underwent liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep) followed by colposcopy. Biopsies were taken if indicated. Cervical exfoliated cells were collected for HPV L1 capsid protein detection by immunocytochemistry. Expression of HPV L1 capsid protein in groups with different histological diagnosis were compared, and the role of HPV L1 capsid protein detection in cervical exfoliated cells in cervical lesions screening was accessed.Total 386 enrolled eligible women were finally diagnosed histologically as follwed: 162 normal cervix, 94 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 128 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 2 squamous cervical cancer (SCC). The positive expression rate of HPV L1 in HSIL+ (HSIL or worse) group was significantly lower than that in LSIL- (LSIL or better) group (19.2% vs 66.4%, P=0.000). While identifying HSIL+ in HPV positive cases and compared with cytology, HPV L1 detection resulted in significant higher sensitivity (80.77% vs 50.77%, P=0.000) and negative predictive value (NPV 87.18% vs 76.47%, P=0.004), significant lower specificity (66.41% vs 81.25%, P=0.000), and comparable positive predictive value (PPVHPV L1 capsid detection in cervical exfoliated cells have a role in cervical lesions screening in high-risk HPV positive women, and may be a promising triage for high-risk HPV-positive/cytology-negative or ASCUS women.
