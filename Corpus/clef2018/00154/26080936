The role of HPV genotyping testing in follow-up of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion after treatment. To assess the clinical value of HPV genotyping in follow-up after treatment for cervical high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).Two hundred and thirty eight patients with HSIL receiving conization in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from Dec, 2006 to Jan, 2009 were accrued in our study. All the patients were prospectively observed after conization every 6 months for 3 times or till histologically confirmed recurrence. The items in every visit included pelvic examination, cervical cytology and HPV genotyping. Twenty-one HPV genotypes were detected by PCR-hybridization method. The last follow-up was July 31, 2010, and the median follow-up time was 28.3 months (range 6.5-43.0 months). Kaplan-Meire method as used for analyzed the median recurrent time, and the relationships between HPV status and recurrent disease were calculated by and log-rank test and Cox-regression model.Among the 238 patients, 110 cases (46.2%, 110/238) had positive result of HPV DNA testing at any visit. The most common HPV types detected in follow-up were HPV16 (45.6%), HPV58 (26.5%), and HPV52 (16.9%). There was no correlation between recurrent disease and any individual high risk HPV infections (P>0.05). Seventeen recurrent cases (7.1%) were identified in 238 patients within a median recurrent time of 14.9 months (range 6.0-32.1 months). In univariate analyses, HPV positive at any visit, persistent infection, multiple infection, type specific persistent infection and positive HPV at 18 months after conization were indicators for residual/recurrent disease (P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, only multiple HPV infection (HR=8.6, 95% CI: 1.8-41.7, P=0.008) and type specific persistent HPV infection (HR=5.1, 95% CI: 1.0-24.8, P=0.042) had an elevated risk of recurrent disease.HSIL with multiple HPV infection and type specific persistent HPV infection in follow-up are at high risk of recurrent disease. Patients with HPV turning into negative within 18 months after treatment have a low risk of recurrence.
