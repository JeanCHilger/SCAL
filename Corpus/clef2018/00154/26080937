Diagnostic value of multiply biopsies and endocervical curettage on cervical lesions. To investigate the value of multiply biopsies and endocervical curettage (ECC) on diagnosing cervical lesions.For the detection of cervical lesions, Shenzhen cervical cancer screening trial II (SHENCCAST II) program combined methods of HPV screening with liquid-based cytology (LBC), any positive indicators was then performed multiply biopsies and ECC under colopscopy. A total of 2,558 clear colposcopic images and pathological diagnoses were reviewed. To analyse the pathological results and primary screening results of the negative colopscopic images for discussing the value of multiply biopsies and ECC.Overall 2,558 women's colposcopic images and sampling results were completed and validated. 69.98% (1,790/2,558) women had normal colposcopy appearances. Among them, 2.23% (40/1,790) were diagnosed as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II or worse (CIN II+). The odds ratio of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was 28.37 (P=0.000) and atypical squamous cell cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) was 15.07 (P=0.001). HPV types 16, 52, 58, 31, 33 and 18 were related to high-grade cervical lesion with the odds ratio of 3.11 (P=0.017). Hybrid capture II (HC-II) DNA test results shown that women with HPV positive were 3.58 times more risky than those of HPV negative, which was related to high-grade cervical lesion (P=0.025). Among the 2,558 women, CIN II+ detective rate from ECC were 40.7% (44/108) in older group (≥40 years) were higher than that of 19.2% (24/125) in younger group (<40 years χ2=13.01, P=0.000). CIN II+ detective rate from multiply biopsies were 90.7% (98/108) in older group (≥40 years) were higher than that of 88.8% (111/125) in younger group (<40 yearsThe results shown that only performed multi-site biopsies with abnormal colposcopy appearances may be missed some highgrade cervical lesion. For the positive indicators during screening should be performed randomly multi-sites biopsies and ECC under colopscopy, which may be helpful to reduce miss diagnosis.
