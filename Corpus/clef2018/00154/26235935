Human leukocyte antigen class II DRB1*1302 allele protects against cervical cancer: At which step of multistage carcinogenesis? We investigated the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles in multistage cervical carcinogenesis. Cross-sectional analysis for HLA association with cervical cancer included 1253 Japanese women: normal cytology (NL, n = 341), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1, n = 505), CIN grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3, n = 96), or invasive cervical cancer (ICC, n = 311). The HLA class II allele frequencies were compared by Fisher's exact test or the Ï‡(2) -test. The Bonferroni adjustment corrected for multiple comparisons. Among the study subjects, 454 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology were prospectively monitored by cytology and colposcopy every 3-4 months to analyze cumulative risk of CIN3 within the next 10 years in relation to HLA class II alleles. HLA class II DRB1*1302 allele frequency was similar between women with NL (11.7%) and CIN1 (11.9%), but significantly decreased to 5.2% for CIN2/3 and 5.8% for ICC (P = 0.0003). Correction for multiple testing did not change this finding. In women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology, the cumulative risk of CIN3 diagnosed within 10 years was significantly reduced among DRB1*1302-positive women (3.2% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.03). In conclusion, the two different types of analysis in this single study showed the protective effect of the DRB1*1302 allele against progression from CIN1 to CIN2/3.
