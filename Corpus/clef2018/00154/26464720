Association between interluekin-17 gene polymorphisms and the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population. We conducted a study to analyze the association of three common SNPs of IL-17A rs2275913 and rs3748067 and IL-17F rs763780 gene polymorphisms with the risk of cervical cancer in a Chinese population. Our study included 352 cervical cancer patients and 352 controls between January 2013 and December 2014. Genotyping of IL-17A rs2275913 and rs3748067 and IL-17F rs763780 genes was performed by multiplex PCR assays using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). By χ(2) test, there was significantly difference in the genotype distribution of IL-17A rs2275913 between cervical cancer patients and control subjects (χ(2)=11.45, P=0.003). By conditional logistic regression analysis, we found that individuals with the GA and AA genotypes were associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer when compared with the GG genotype in codominant model, and the adjusted Ors (95% CI) were 1.57 (1.13-2.18) and 2.01 (1.15-3.49), respectively. In dominant model, we found that the GA+AA genotype of rs2275913 was correlated with a moderate increased risk of cervical cancer compared with the GG genotype (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.20-2.24). We only found significant interaction between rs2275913 polymorphism and HPV-16 or 18 infection in the risk of cervical cancer (P for interaction <0.05). In conclusion, our study suggests that IL-17A rs2275913 polymorphism may affect the development of cervical cancer in codominant and dominant models, and this gene polymorphism has interaction with HPV-16 or 18 infection.
