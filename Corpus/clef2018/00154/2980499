Xenon/CT cerebral blood flow determination following cranial trauma. Xenon/CT cerebral blood flow (CBF) analysis has been utilized in the evaluation of 35 patients sustaining severe cranial trauma. The patient population included closed head injury, focal hematoma, and the sequelae of trauma including coma, persistent alteration of consciousness, and brain death. Xe/CT CBF analysis has proven helpful in the determination of appropriate degrees of hyperventilation therapy for the head injured patient. The technique is helpful for determining both local and remote changes of CBF as an aid in deciding upon surgical intervention. Severely decreased flows, compatible with brain death, can be demonstrated. The technique shows promise in the evaluation of physiologic changes accompanying therapy for the injured brain.
