Building up a computerized follow-up register and information system for cervical cytology. It is well known that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection are closely related to cervical cancer. The cervical cytology examination (pap-test), followed by a colposcopic examination and a biopsy are the common tools for the early detection and the establishment of diagnosis of the cervical precancerous lesions. The monitoring and surveillance of those precancerous lesions is essential for the prevention of cervical cancer and for effective patient management. Nowadays, the long-term care of patients with a chronic and/or serious disease is feasible with the use of computerized follow-up registers or through more complex information systems. Nevertheless, manual recording is still the predominant method of data collection in 'Alexandra' University Hospital and this is the case in most health services in Greece due to scarcity of resources. A 'circulating' outpatient card, where information on gynecologic cytology, colposcopy and biopsy examinations is recorded, was the basis for the development of a computerised follow-up register and information system for cervical cytology in the Department of Cytopathology.
