Predictive value of brain-stem auditory evoked potentials in children with post-traumatic coma produced by diffuse brain injury. In the present study, brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) in 31 children in post-traumatic coma with diffuse brain injury were examined. The BAEPs were recorded in the first 72 h after hospital admission and the findings of 29 patients related to the level of neurological recovery at 6 months after head injury. On the basis of the results, children were divided into three groups: the first consisted of children with bilateral and normal BAEPs (n = 19) the second of those with asymmetrical BAEPs (n = 6)
