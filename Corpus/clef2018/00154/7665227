Human papillomavirus and cervical neoplasia: a case-control study in Taiwan. As part of a large-scale, community-based cervical neoplasia screening project in rural Taiwan, a case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the etiologic role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in this mainly monogamous (2% reported having multiple sexual partners) female population. A total of 88 biopsy-confirmed cases and 261 cytologically normal controls were selected for the study. The case group included 40 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 9 of CIN 2, 36 of CIN 3 and 3 cases of invasive cancer. Cervical swabs collected at screening from study subjects were tested for HPV DNA by an LI consensus primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. HPV DNA was found in 92% of high-grade cases (CIN 2-3 and invasive cancer) 54% of low-grade cases (CIN 1)
