Identification of genital human papillomaviruses in cervical biopsy specimens: segregation of specific virus types in specific clinicopathologic lesions. We have established a critical identification method for the full spectrum of genital human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in clinical specimens. It was based on the recognition of PstI, BanI and MspI cleavage patterns of HPV DNA detected by blot hybridization with HPV 58 DNA probe at Tm -40 degrees C. By this method, we identified 24 different types of genital HPV including 5 novel types (HPV 59, 61, 62, 64 and 67) in the specimens collected at one hospital and found almost all the HPVs with the authentic cleavage patterns of their respective prototypes. In 235 cervical biopsy specimens, HPV 6 or 11 was found in exophytic condyloma acuminatum (15/15) but not in any cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) specimens. In contrast, HPV 18, 30, 43, 54, 56, 59, 62, 66 and 67 were identified in CIN I (28/71) or II (4/56) but not in CIN III, while HPV 16, 31, 33, 35, 39, 51, 52 and 58 were identified in CIN III (83/93) as well as in CIN I (34/71) and II (47/56). The result indicates that heterogeneous genital HPVs prevail all over the world. In addition, HPV 6 and 11 are etiologic agents only of exophytic condyloma, whereas the other HPVs are etiologic agents of CIN with the segregation of specific HPVs in CIN III. We propose a new clinicopathologic grouping of genital HPVs founded on nucleotide homology of the HPV genome.
