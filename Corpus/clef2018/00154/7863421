Anatomic basis of vascular distribution in combined removal of liver and pancreas (28.5.93). Based on the study of the arterial distribution of 120 hepatic grafts removed from brain-dead patients, the authors assess the possibilities of vascular partition in cases of combined removal of the liver and pancreas. The discussion deals with the vascular distribution of each organ. The presence of a right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric a. (SMA) requires preservation of the SMA with the hepatic graft, while the pancreas is removed with the celiac trunk (CT) and its branches. The presence of a left hepatic artery arising from the CT requires its preservation with the hepatic graft, the pancreas being removed with the SMA and the splenic artery.
