Semiautomated detection of human papillomavirus DNA of high and low oncogenic potential in cervical smears. Detection of DNA from human papillomaviruses (HPV) of high and intermediate oncogenic risk in cervical smears may predict the presence of cervical cancer or may indicate precancerous changes. Here we describe a semiautomated polymerase chain reaction system for the detection and classification of HPV DNA that is present in clinically significant amounts in routine cervical scrapes.
