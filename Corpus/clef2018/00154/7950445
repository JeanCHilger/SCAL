Radiosurgical treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. In the present study we present our experience and data with loop electrosurgical excision procedures for the treatment of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated lesions and intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix. 58 patients underwent loop excision because of colposcopically suspect cervical lesions. In 78 cases cone biopsy (large loop excision of the transformation zone, LLETZ + partial resection of the cervical canal) was performed. In 80% of the loop excisions the lesions were removed with clear resection margins. Patients undergoing LLETZ conization were compared to patients who had a cold knife conization previously. The two groups were matched with regard to age, parity and histology. The cone specimen of patients with LLETZ conization revealed lesion-free margins in 93% compared to 87% in the group with cold knife conization. Operation time and duration of hospital stay were significantly shorter in the group of LLETZ conization. Loop electrosurgical excision procedures therefore represent an adequate method for the treatment of HPV-associated lesions and intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix.
