Studies on the influence of ovarian small cysts on endocrine in patients with polycystic ovaries. To clarify the influence of small follicular cysts in ovaries on endocrine in ovulatory patients with multifollicular ovaries (MFO), the comparative study of endocrine among ovulatory patients with MFO and anovulatory patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) were examined. In ovulatory patients with MFO, there was no significant correlation between the increase in the number of ovarian cysts and gonadotropin levels, however, estrone and androgen levels tended to increase as the number of cysts increased. LH levels in PCOS were significantly higher than those in patients with more than 10 small cysts however, there was no significant difference in androgen levels between the two. It was suggested that MFO is a progressive disease and that the presence of more than 10 small follicular cysts in each ovary in ovulatory women may be latent PCOS.
