Haematocervix during hormonal replacement therapy. A postmenopausal woman, receiving cyclic hormonal therapy, presented to our clinic with acute pelvic pain, absence of withdrawal bleeding and clinical signs of vagal stimulation (nausea and vomiting). Vaginal exploration and ultrasonographic imaging accounted for haematocervix, which was confirmed by surgical blood evacuation.
