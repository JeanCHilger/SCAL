Analysis of cytomorphologically abnormal cervical scrapes for the presence of 27 mucosotropic human papillomavirus genotypes, using polymerase chain reaction. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of 27 mucosotropic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes (HPV 6, 11, 13, 16, 18, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61 and 66) in cytomorphologically abnormal cervical scrapes (Pap IIIa-Pap IV n = 1,373) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method on crude cell suspensions. The scrapes were analyzed for the presence of HPV DNA by HPV general-primer-mediated PCR (GP-PCR), which allows the detection of a broad spectrum of HPV types at the subpicogram level. Subsequently, 2 HPV typing procedures based on either type-specific PCR (for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33) or characterization of GP-PCR products by hybridization (for HPV 13, 30, 32, 35, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61 and 66) were applied. Increasing total HPV prevalence was found with increasing severity of dysplasia from 71% in Pap IIIa to 100% in Pap IV scrapes (carcinoma in situ). The scrapes which were positive by type-specific PCR included 47% cases of Pap IIIa, 71% cases of Pap IIIb and 90% cases of Pap IV. Moreover, 12% of Pap IIIa scrapes, 6% of Pap IIIb scrapes and 8% of Pap IV scrapes revealed positivity for one or more of the remaining HPV types, as determined by successive hybridizations of the GP-PCR products. Taking the typing data together, we noted that the level of HPV heterogeneity decreased from 22 different HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61 and 66) detected in the group of Pap IIIa scrapes to 13 (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59 and 61) and 10 HPV genotypes (HPV 6, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 51, 52, 54 and 58) in the Pap IIIb and Pap IV classes, respectively. An increasing prevalence rate from Pap IIIa to Pap IV was found for HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45 and 54. The prevalence rate of identified HPV genotypes increased from 59% in Pap IIIa to 98% in Pap IV, indicating that almost all high-risk HPV genotypes related to cervical cancer in The Netherlands have been characterized.
