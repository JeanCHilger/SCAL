Epidural hematoma with atypical clinical course. The prognosis of epidural haematomas (EDH) is generally favourable if an operation is carried out in good time. Suspected EDH is mostly diagnosed as a result of a "typical" neurological manifestation (initial unconsciousness/asymptomatic interval/loss of consciousness), which then leads to an in-depth diagnosis (X-ray of the skull, CT, MRI). However, atypical clinical manifestations are frequent and can result in dangerous delays in diagnosis and treatment. A decisive factor in the early detection of EDH is close clinical-neurological monitoring by specially trained staff and their prompt reaction when changes occur, no matter how minor. Qualitative changes in the patient's state of consciousness and behaviour are just as important in this respect as quantitative ones.
