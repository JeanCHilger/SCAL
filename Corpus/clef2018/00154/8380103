Human papillomaviruses and other influences on survival from cervical cancer in Panama. To determine the influence on survival from cervical cancer of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and other factors including age, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibody status, and number of pregnancies.We followed 196 women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer in Panama for an average of 32 months. Clinical and risk-factor information was obtained from these women through an interview and review of medical records. We assessed HPV DNA status by testing tumor specimens using polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot, and slot blot techniques. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the risk of mortality associated with selected variables.Eighty-one percent (N = 144) of the women tested for HPV were positive. Absence of HPV DNA was associated with a 1.9-fold excess risk of mortality (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.3) after controlling for age, clinical stage at diagnosis, number of pregnancies, and HSV-2 seropositivity. Women diagnosed with cervical cancer before the age of 30 had a ninefold excess risk of dying compared with those diagnosed at age 50 or older (relative risk [RR] 9.3, 95% CI 3.4-25.5). Parity was also an independent prognostic factor. Women with six or more pregnancies had a 2.5-fold excess risk of dying compared with women with three or fewer (95% CI 1.2-5.3). Years of education, presence of HSV-2 antibodies, age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, oral contraceptive use, and cigarette smoking were not significantly associated with prognosis.These findings suggest that women negative for HPV DNA, those who are diagnosed at an early age, and those who have multiple pregnancies might have more aggressive tumors.
