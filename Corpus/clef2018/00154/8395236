Genital cancer and Langerhans cells. This review describes the role of Langerhans cells (LC) in immunity and suggests that they participate in immunosurveillance. Evidence is presented for the role of the LA-1 oncogene in cervical carcinogenesis. A hypothesis is presented in which LC are involved: (i) in presentation of the LA-1 oncoprotein to the immune system thereby inducing killer T cell responses against neoplastic epithelial cells, and (ii) direct interaction with LA-1 oncoprotein positive tumor cells including expression of adhesion molecules that may affect morphology/interaction of normal cervical cells. Predictions made by this hypothesis, which can be tested experimentally, are listed.
