Determinants of the geographic variation of invasive cervical cancer in Costa Rica. The incidence of cervical cancer in Costa Rica is about twice as high in the coastal regions as in the interior. To study these regional variations, we used data from a 1986-1987 case-control study of 192 Costa Rican women with invasive cervical cancer and 372 controls. Risk factors identified included the following: The study participant's (1) number of sexual partners, (2) age at first sexual intercourse, (3) number of live births, (4) presence of type 16/18 human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, (5) venereal disease (VD) history, (6) Pap smear history, and (7) socioeconomic status. The adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each of these risk factors were as follows: (1) > or = 4 vs. 1 sexual partner: RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.5 (2) age of initiation < or = 15 vs. > or = 18 years: RR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.9-2.5
