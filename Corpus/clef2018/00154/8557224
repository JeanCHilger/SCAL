Human papillomavirus is associated with the frequent detection of warty and basaloid high-grade neoplasia of the vulva and cervical neoplasia among immunocompromised women. A total of 158 women who either HIV-infected or under iatrogenic immunosuppression were examined regularly during a 4-year period to evaluate if certain vulvar neoplasms and cervical neoplasia have similar associated risk factors. Patients with CIN were matched prospectively with immunocompetent controls with CIN. Forty-eight cervical lesions were detected among patients, including 2 invasive carcinoma and 15 CIN-3 lesions, compared to 11 vulvar lesions, including 2 invasive carcinoma and 7 VIN-3 lesions. Women who have more than five life-time partners were more likely to have HPV-DNA positive cervical swabs and vulvar scrapes as well as cervical and/or vulvar neoplasia. Compared to 2.7% of controls 15.2% of patients with CIN had coexisting high-grade lesions of the vulva. With 1 exception all patients with vulvar neoplasia either suffered from symptomatic immunodeficiency or received immunosuppressive drugs for more than 10 years. Except for 1 VIN-3 lesions, all vulvar neoplasms were associated with HPV-DNA types 16, 31, and/or 33. Six of nine patients as well as the 2 controls with coexisting vulvar and cervical neoplasia had the same HPV-type associated with both lesions. All vulvar lesions were classified as either "warty" or "basaloid". In conclusion cervical and bowenoid/basaloid vulvar neoplasia seem to have a similar HPV-related genesis. Malfunction of the cellular immune response appears to be a cofactor in the genesis of HPV-associated neoplasia at both sites.
