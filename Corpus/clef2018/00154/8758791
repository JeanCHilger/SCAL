Comparison of human papilloma virus-DNA in condyloma acuminatum, cervical cancer and the female genital tract. To examine human papilloma virus (HPV) infection rate and types in several lesions of the genital tract and to observe the relation between HPV and host cells for differential handling of cases and for early diagnosis.Tissues from 89 cases of condyloma acuminata, 76 cases of cervical cancer and swabs from 198 cases of normal vaginal were analysed by polymerase chain reaction for HPV infective rate. Main HPV types were compared and Southern blot was used to compare the physical pattern of HPV in condyloma acuminata and cervical cancer.The positive rates of HPV-DNA in condyloma acuminata and cervical cancer were respectively 98.9% and 94.7%. The primary types of the former were HPV 6, 11 and of the latter mainly 16 and 18. The latent infective rates in normal vagina was 37.4%, among which, HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 consisted of only 21.6%. HPV11-DNA in condyloma acuminata existed mainly in episodic form. Most of HPV16-DNA in cervical cancer integrates into the host cells with variation.The different types of HPV are related to particular morphology and characteristics of lesions. The relation of HPV-DNA to host cell and can offer some reference for the determination of the character of the lesion, and it may be award of malignant transformation.
