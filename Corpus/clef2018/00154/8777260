Human papillomaviruses in gynecological cancer. Human papillomavirus-related anogenital neoplasia is an active area of basic and clinical research. The research topics are broad based, but mostly are focused on delineating the clinical utility of human papillomavirus testing, the natural history of human papillomavirus infections and associated premalignancies, characterization of the oncogenic role of human papillomavirus in sites other than the uterine cervix, and the mechanisms of human papillomavirus-associated carcinogenesis.
