Detection of HPV 16 and HPV 18 infection in patients with cervical neoplasia. Definite types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) are considered an etiological factor in the occurrence of cervical carcinoma. Determining the persistence of some HPV types associated with cervical carcinoma is important in defining and following precancerous lesions. The most sensitive method in the determination of these viruses is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Because of the convenience and the fastness it provides, cytological cervical material is preferred for the analysis. In our study infection with HPV 16 and HPV 18 was investigated in the cervical scrapes of 33 subjects with cervical carcinoma. The DNAs isolated from the samples were amplified by PCR. HPV 16 and HPV 18 types were identified by Southern Blot hybridization. The positivity rates for HPV 16 and HPV 18 in 33 subjects with cervical carcinoma were 54.5% and 45.4%, respectively. The corresponding value in the control group was only 5.5%. PCR combined with Southern Blot is the most sensitive method for scanning programmes and in defining and monitoring the risk groups for developing cervical neoplasia.
