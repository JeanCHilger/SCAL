Prevalence of HPV infection and histologic correlations. 476 patients with cervical lesions were examined for HPV presence in the lower genital tract. The ViraPap/ViraType detection set was used. Prevalence of low oncogenic risk group of HPV types (LR-HPV) was 12.2% a that of intermediate and high risk group (HR-HPV) was 28.5%. It is compared with control series of 168 women undergoing interruption of pregnancy (prevalence of LR-HPV 3.0% and of HR-HPV 13.7%) and with a control series of 137 STD (sexually transmitted disease) bearers (prevalence of LR-HPV 3.6% and of HR-HPV 19.0%). HR-HPV positivity was found in 37.8% of patients with CIN I, 46.7% with CIN II and 35.3% with CIN III. 16 of 20 cases (80%) with invasive cervical cancer were HR-HPV positive. The authors confirmed a statistically significant difference of HR-HPV positivity between series of women with interruption of pregnancy, with CIN and with invasive cervical cancer. Among HR-HPV positive cases, 76.5% had CIN or invasive cancer of cervix. The role of HPV testing in clinical management of cervical lesions is evaluated and considered meaningful by authors.
