Correlation between the presence of anti HPV33 VLP antibodies and HPV DNA in cervical neoplasia patients. The L1 capsid proteins derived from human papillomavirus (HPV) type 33 were expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system using Sf9 insect cells. Selected sera originating in women from case-control study carried out in Spain and Colombia found negative and positive for HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 DNA were tested in ELISA for the presence of IgG antibodies to purified virus-like particles (VLP). The reactivity was type-restricted with the possible exception of HPV31.
