The role of Hühner's direct post-coital test in the evaluation of conjugal sterility in the African environment in Senegal. (Apropos of 2593 post-coital tests performed by the clinical cytology, cytogenetic and reproduction biology laboratory at the University Hospital Center in Dakar, Senegal) 1983-1993. About 2593 post-coïtal tests (PCT) or Hühner direct tests were realised in the laboratory of clinical cytology, cytogenetics and reproductive biology of the University medical Centre of Dakar, Senegal from 1983 to 1993. Analysing the results, the authors showed the importance of the infectious factor in women and also the role of male deficiency in conjugal sterility in black African environment. These realities have been confirmed cytospermiologic test deficient results. These sperm exams have shown among other things, the prevailing number of azoospermia (25%) and of oligo-asthénotératozoospermia (44%) in husbands of sterile women in the black African environment of Senegal. Pap's Tests have been jointly realised at the same time as 1902 PCT. The results have enabled us to track down 120 cervix with precancerous and cancerous cell alterations 81 condylomas (HPV), 25 CIN1, 11 CIN2 and 3 CIN3 (CIN: cervical intra-epithelial Neoplasia). These facts suggest a cautious technics, and a prudent interpretation of the results and taking into account the competence and the subjectivity of the practitioner. We have learnt from the study that we must give as much as possible to biologists of Reproduction in southern countries, where conjugal sterility and cervix precancerous and cancerous cell alterations are high, a polyvalent training so that they can practise jointly the post-coïtal or Hühner direct test (PCT) and the Papanicolaou Colpocytologic Test (TP), provided that one owes a microscope.
