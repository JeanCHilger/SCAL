Analysis of E2 amino acid variants of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and their associations with lesion grade and HLA DR/DQ type. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and HPV 18 E2 amino acid variants and host HLA DR/DQ haplotypes have been identified by direct nucleic acid sequencing from cervical scrapes. HPV16 E2 variants co-segregate with a nucleotide variant at nt350 (in E6), which previously has been associated with persistent infections. Both HPV16 and HPV18 E2 variants occur relatively more frequently in individuals with HLA DR/DQ haplotypes 0401/0301 and 1101/0301 but are not related to lesion grade.
