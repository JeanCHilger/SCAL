Large infarcts in the middle cerebral artery territory. Etiology and outcome patterns. Large supratentorial infarctions play an important role in early mortality and severe disability from stroke. However, data concerning these types of infarction are scarce. Using data from the Lausanne Stroke Registry, we studied patients with a CT-proven infarction of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory that covered at least two of three MCA subterritories (deep, superficial anterior [superior] and posterior [inferior] territory). We compared these patients with patients presenting more limited infarction in the MCA territory. Our study group of large MCA (laMCA) infarction contained 208 patients, corresponding to 7.6% of all ischemic infarctions in the Lausanne Stroke Registry. Seventy-two patients had complete infarction in the whole MCA territory (coMCA). Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion (41%) and ICA dissection (12%) were more common than in limited superficial MCA (lsMCA) infarct and anterior circulation infarct (p < 0.001). Among the patients without ICA occlusion, atrial fibrillation (33% p < 0.002) and cardiogenic embolism in general (54%
