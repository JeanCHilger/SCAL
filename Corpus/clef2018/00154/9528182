Human papillomaviruses and carcinogenesis of the uterine cervix: future prospects in the domain of detection and prevention. It is now admitted that certain genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), mainly HPV types 16 and 18, play an etiological role in the origin of the great majority of invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix and their intraepithelial precursors. Such an evidence has modified our understanding of the natural history of cervical cancer and should result in new approaches for the early diagnosis and prevention of precursor lesions. Sensitive, specific and reliable HPV detection tests have been progressively designed but their use as routine tests requires multicentric studies, involving large series of women, to evaluate their usefulness in the clinical management or the screening of patients and to establish their limits and cost-effectiveness. It is already most likely that the association of HPV detection tests to cervicovaginal cytology would increase the detection rate of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and constitute a means for quality control in cytology. The viral origin of most cancers of the uterine cervix paves the way for their prevention by vaccination against the main oncogenic HPV genotypes and provides hope for specific immunotherapy of associated neoplasia.
