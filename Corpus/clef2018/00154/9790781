Does typing of human papillomavirus assist in the triage of women with repeated low-grade, cervical cytologic abnormalities? To evaluate the ability of testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) using the hybrid capture technique to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in patients with repeated low-grade cervical cytologic abnormalities and an adequate and normal colposcopy.Hybrid capture testing and LEETZ were performed on 166 women with repeated low-grade cervical cytologic abnormalities who were referred for colposcopy which was to be adequate and normal.A highly significant correlation (P < 0.0001) was found between a positive test for high-risk HPV types and the finding of CIN II,III. In 67 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance on repeated cytologic studies, a positive test for high-risk HPV types had a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 96.5%, respectively, for detecting CIN II,III. In 99 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions found on repeated cytologic study, a positive test for high-risk HPV types identified all patients as having CIN II,III on cone biopsy (sensitivity, 100%), with a specificity of 86.4%. Restriction of tissue sampling to women who were positive for high-risk HPV types would have reduced the number of tissue samplings performed to 20.4%, while identifying 20 of 21 patients with biopsy-confirmed CIN II, III.A positive hybrid capture test for high-risk HPV types is highly sensitive and specific for detecting CIN II,III in patients with repeated low-grade cervical cytologic abnormalities and an adequate and normal colposcopy and may be used in the triage of these women before performing tissue sampling.
