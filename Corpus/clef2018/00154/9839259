"HPV effect" in the female lower genital tract. A community study. To determine the distribution of "human papillomavirus (HPV) effect" and intraepithelial neoplasia in the lower female genital tract in one community with a prospective study.In a family practice setting, colposcopy was offered to all women presenting for a routine cervical cytologic smear. Directed biopsies were taken from areas staining abnormally with acetic acid or iodine.This study of 224 women showed a high incidence of HPV effect in the lower genital tract (68%), including 18% on the vulva. The age distribution suggests a coital influence. A five-year review showed persistence of HPV effect on the vulva or vagina in only one patient. One other woman developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1.HPV effect is common in the lower genital tract of women under the age of 30 years. Colposcopic study suggested that HPV effect on the vulva and vagina is transient. The relatively high incidence of HPV effect on the vulva may explain why cervical HPV and CIN generally appear only after coitarche, as a consequence of physical transfer. This may help explain why women with a single lifetime sexual partner are not exempt from the risk of cervical cancer or its precursors.
