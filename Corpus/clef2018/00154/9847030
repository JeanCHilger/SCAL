Stressful events, pessimism, natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells in HIV+ black women at risk for cervical cancer. This study examines whether stressful negative life events and pessimism were associated with lower natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and T cytotoxic/suppressor cell (CD8+CD3+) percentage in black women co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and human papillomavirus (HPV), a viral initiator of cervical cancer.Psychosocial interviews, immunological evaluations, and cervical swabs for HPV detection and subtyping were conducted on 36 HIV+ African-American, Haitian, and Caribbean women.Greater pessimism was related to lower NKCC and cytotoxic/suppressor cells after controlling for presence/absence of HPV Types 16 or 18, behavioral/lifestyle factors, and subjective impact of negative life events.A pessimistic attitude may be associated with immune decrements, and possibly poorer control over HPV infection and increased risk for future promotion of cervical dysplasia to invasive cervical cancer in HIV+ minority women co-infected with HPV.
