Relationship between human papillomavirus type 16 in the cervix and intraepithelial neoplasia. To evaluate a temporal relationship between the presence of cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16 and the risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Fifty-four women with HPV 16 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive tests were selected from the gynecologic outpatient clinic of the Reinier de Graaf Hospital, Delft, The Netherlands. At least three successive PCR tests were performed in each woman at intervals of 6 months. The PCR HPV 16 assay was performed in conjunction with cervical smear, and colposcopy and biopsy, if indicated. Women with at least three consecutive positive PCR tests were defined as having persistent HPV 16 infections. Women with one positive test followed by two negative tests were defined as having transient infections. Subdivided into two groups, 25 women had persistent infections and 29 had transient infections.In significantly more women in the persistent group compared with the transient group, CIN developed (11 of 25 versus six of 29, P = .036). Lesions in women with persistent HPV 16 infection were more severe (six of 11 were CIN III versus one of six P = .041).Persistent infection with HPV 16 is associated with a higher risk of developing CIN, which is often high-grade.
