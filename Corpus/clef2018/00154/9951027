Intra-arterial fibrinolysis in acute thrombosis of the basilar artery. Ischemia in the territory of the basilar artery presents with a variable clinical picture of hemiparesia-tetraplegia, progressive deterioration of level of consciousness, irregular respiration and apnea leading to irreversible coma and death in between 75% and 86% of cases. The usual treatment is supportive.We present the case of a 49 year old woman with acute thrombosis of the basilar artery and a progressive course leading to coma. No bulbar lesions were seen on the CT scan done in the Emergency Department. Thrombosis of the basilar artery and permeable bilateral carotid systems were shown on arteriography. There were no contra-indications to fibrinolysis. Following local fibrinolytic treatment with urokinase the patient had full recovery from her neurological disorder and no sequelae. The basilar artery remained permeable six months later.Emergency treatment with cerebral intra-arterial fibrinolysis within the first six hours, in a case of neurological deficit progressing in the basilar artery territory, with persistence of brain-stem functions and no signs of decerebration (provided there are no contra-indications to fibrinolysis and the initial cerebral CT scan shows no bulbar lesions) may save the patient's life, with total or partial recovery of brain-stem function.
