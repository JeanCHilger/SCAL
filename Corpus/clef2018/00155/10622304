Screening for cervical neoplasia by self-assessment for human papillomavirus DNA. We evaluated self-collected vaginal human papillomavirus tests for cervical cancer screening and compared it with the specimens taken directly from the cervix in 247 patients at high-risk for cervical disease. The sample taken by the patient showed human papillomavirus DNA in a higher percentage than the sample taken by a doctor. Sensitivity of high-risk human papillomavirus types for high-grade cervical precursors (CIN 2/3) and invasive cervical cancers were 93% for both methods.
