Cervical cancer suppressor gene is within 1 cM on 6p23. We previously showed loss of heterozygosity at 6p to be a common genetic alteration in cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To characterize this critical area of deletion in chromosome 6, we evaluated 107 invasive cervical cancers, using 23 polymorphic markers. Genomic DNA from microdissected frozen or paraffin-embedded cervical tumors and corresponding normal tissue was analyzed. Fifty-three percent (57/107) of the cervical tumors showed loss in 6p. Deletions were found in all stages and histologic types. Ninety-one percent (52/57) of these tumors had a loss at 6p23. One tumor defined the distal area of deletion at marker D6S429. Two tumors defined the proximal area of deletion at marker D6S1578. Genotyping of parental DNA was done on 16 cases to evaluate the origin of chromosomal loss. The deletion occurred in the paternal chromosome in 10 tumors and in the maternal in six. Within each tumor, the same parental chromosome was lost at all tested heterozygous 6p markers. The order of the polymorphic markers and estimate of distances in the critical region were confirmed by generation of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig and pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Our data strongly suggest that a gene important in cervical cancer tumorigenesis is located within a 1-cM region of 6p23, and it is not imprinted.
