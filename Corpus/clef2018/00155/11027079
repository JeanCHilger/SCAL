New technologies in gynecologic cytology. New technologies are trying to make significant changes in the way we perform the Pap smear test, a test that has undergone no significant modification since its inception. Efforts have focused on improving sampling with liquid-based methods, improving detection of abnormal cells with automated screening and improving the detection of human papillomavirus with assays practical for use in routine clinical material. This article reviews the performance of the new technologies to date, with an emphasis on those that are currently approved for cervical cytology testing. In the aggregate, these technologies can have a positive impact on cervical disease detection and intervention.
