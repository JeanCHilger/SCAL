Progression of cervical lesions in HIV-seropositive women: a cytological study. It has been reported that cervical intraepithelial lesions have a more aggressive course in HIV-seropositive than in HIV-seronegative women. In the present investigation, the progression of these cervical lesions was studied in a group of HIV-seropositive women. Of 1,587 patients, 200 (12.6%) had a cytological diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) or invasive carcinoma. In 409 patients, more than one cytological smear was collected in 3(1/2) years. Progression occurred in 39 cases. In 24 (61.5%), the first diagnosis was benign cellular changes (BCC) and the second was low-grade SIL (LSIL) (1-yr interval in 21 cases) in 11 (28.2%), the first was BCC, and the second, high-grade SIL (HSIL) (1-yr interval in 9 cases)
