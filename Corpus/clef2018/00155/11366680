Vitamin A and HPV. A study of nearly 1,000 women who were either HIV positive or at risk for HIV infection examined the relationship between immune suppression, vitamin A deficiency, and HPV-related cervical lesions. Pap smears were performed and CD4 and plasma retinol, a form of vitamin A, levels were measured. The prevalence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) was highest in women with significantly decreased retinol levels, and lowest in women with higher levels of retinol. Previous animal studies have associated low retinol levels with precancerous lesions. Results suggest that vitamin A supplements may decrease rates of precancerous cervical changes in HIV positive women.
