Obligations to provide appropriate patient management. The Pap test is a successful method of preventing cervical cancer, but it does have significant false negative and false positive rates. The main aim of screening is the detection of precursor lesions, both regression and progression of which may occur, making it difficult to decide upon follow-up and further therapy. Around the world there are many differences, as a far as the frequency of the disease, the organization and economic background of the health care system, the use of different additional diagnostic tools and even the terminology considered. All these factors underline the importance of a consensus on a "minimum level" of obligations to provide appropriate patient management. The screening interval should be two to five years, in some cases even annually. The cytopathologist has an obligation to recommend repeat smears in cases of cytologic abnormalities likely to regress. We recommend the use of standard terminology and stress the importance of a "common language" in cervical cytology. Colposcopy and biopsy are obligatory in cases of HSIL and cancer. We suggest that in severe cases women should be provided with detailed written and verbal information.
