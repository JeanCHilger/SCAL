Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer: genetic background of the neoplastic process. In a 2-year period, 136 HPV positive cytological samples of the cervix uteri were analyzed at the Department of Molecular Pathology, National Institute of Oncology, Hungary. Comparison with the international data obtained from the literature revealed that the Hungarian epidemiological data bore closest resemblance to the European ones except some differences. The HPV18 is rather seldom encountered in this country. Similarly low occurrence was noted only in Japan. However, the 14.1% occurrence rate of HPV58 in Hungary is by far higher than that in any other country in this analysis except Japan where this virus is of similarly high frequency. In Hungary, the incidence of HPV59 is relatively high just like in Central and South America. HPV33 and HPV66 infections occur in a significantly higher number with Hungary than in any of the countries studied. In our study The European type variant of HPV16 (E-V-350G) occurred in 2/10 CIN II-III cases. The authors also compared the various clinico-pathological grouping of HPV types published, and identified several inconsistencies. Viruses considered to have high risk occurred in intact epithelium, CIN I-II-III and carcinoma alike. The general tendency was, however, that certain viruses correlated with specific clinico-pathological entities. At present there is no reason to include the PCR-based HPV typing in the mass screening of cervical cancers. HPV typing and physical state of the virus can reasonable be determined if the cervical cytology is suspect for HPV infection or even control examination after "loop" conisation. Negative cytology completed with negative HPV-DNA test means the lack of cancer risk even in the case of a previously removed CIN or carcinoma. However, a positive HPV test detected after conisation associated with negative cytology finding indicates a risk of 70% of the development of CIN within 2 years.
