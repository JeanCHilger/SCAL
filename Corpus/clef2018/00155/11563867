Current methods of testing for human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus DNA testing is gaining wider acceptance, yet the majority of testing is still undertaken in the research setting using protocols that are unsuitable for clinical diagnostic laboratories. Large-scale clinical human papillomavirus DNA testing is likely to be introduced as an adjunct to cervical cytology, so the cytology laboratory is an appropriate place for it to be undertaken. This poses a challenge for any human papillomavirus DNA test since it will be performed by technicians not specifically trained in virology or molecular biology, and will need to produce consistently reliable results in this setting. This is only realistically possible with a standardized and quality-controlled, commercially produced human papillomavirus DNA test. There is currently only one such commercially available assay, although there are a number of research-based tests that could logically lead to additional commercial products. The technological basis of these assays, together with available performance data, is reviewed in this chapter and the clinical utility of the tests is evaluated.
