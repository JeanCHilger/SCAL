Screening for human papillomavirus infection in asymptomatic women in Hungary. A multicentre epidemiological survey was carried out in order to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, persistent cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in women in Hungary.A total of 728 women were examined for the prevalence of HPV. The estimated overall rate of HPV infection was 17%. In univariate analysis the strongest predictors were young age (< or =24 years), unmarried family status, smoking, a pathological Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, having a condyloma and previous gynaecological cancer in the family (age and marital status being the most important predictors). In multiple regression analysis, young age (< or =24 years)(odds ratio = 1.86, 95% confidence interval = 1.19-2.90, P < 0.01), smoking (1.78, 1.17-2.71, P < 0.05), an abnormal Pap smear (6.92, 2.68-17.84, P < 0.001), having a condyloma (4.22, 1.42-12.58, P < 0.01) and living in a region where the unemployment rate is relatively high (1.56, 1.24-2.82, P < 0.01) were associated risk factors for HPV infection.The prevalence of HPV infection in young women in Hungary is high. Screening for HPV is suggested only in women with an unfavourable gynaecological history who are < or =24 years old.
