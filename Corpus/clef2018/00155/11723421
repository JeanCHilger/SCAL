CIN: multicentric study of therapeutic strategies. Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) is a dysplastic lesion that precedes cervical cancer. The diagnosis is made by colposcopic, cytologic and bioptic exams. Therapy may be physical, pharmacological or surgical.We prepared a model of interview (consisting of 9 questions) for 33 colposcopic centers in the Lazio region. Our aim was to evaluate their therapeutic strategies for CIN and cervical condylomata. We referred to SIGO 1999 guidelines for CIN therapy and to European guidelines for cervical condylomata therapy.The centers used drugs more for HPV infections (57%) than for dysplasia (33%). Drug therapy was used more in the past (66.67%). Actually they prefer treating CIN I with electrocoagulation diathermy (DTC), CIN II with loop electrosurgical excision procedures (LEEP) or Laser, CIN III with cold knife conization or LEEP, cervical condylomata with laser or DTC.The results show that the centers prefer physical therapy. Therapeutic strategies comply with SIGO 1999 guidelines for therapy of CIN and with European guidelines for cervical condylomata partially.
