Video colposcopy in diagnosis of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. To study the accuracy and efficiency of video colposcopy in diagnosis of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and clinical significance of seven colposcopic signs.Two hundred and seventy-five patients with an abnormal cervical smear or vulva condyloma acuminata were re-evaluated by video colposcopy. 265 cervical biopsies performed under the guidance of video colposcopy for pathological study, as well 8 endocervical curettage (ECC) and 237 loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).The sensitivity, specificity and positive rate of video colposcopy in evaluation of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions were 95.9%, 77.7%, and 84.5%. Video colposcopy diagnostic accuracy was 93.8% tally with the pathological results in observing normal transformation zone. False negative rate was 6.1%. 76.2% of cases with subclinical papillomavirus infection by acetowhite epithelium, while false negative rate was 23.7%. Twin signs, triple signs and cervical carcinoma were 100.0% tallying with the diagnosis of cervical lesions.Video colposcopy can be a very accurate diagnostic method in clinical practice. It is quite sensitive in diagnosis of severe cervical lesions. However, there was a relative high false negative rate in diagnosing mild cervical lesions.
