Detection of human papillomavirus genome in cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. The aim of this work was the assessment of the correlation between different types of HPV and abnormal stages of uterine cervix.The smears were simultaneously collected for both cytooncologic examination and PCR identification of HPV viruses. Cytologic smears were classified according to the Bethesda system.A strong relationship between the presence of HPV types 16, 18 and 33 and the intensification of cytologic changes was confirmed. The more advanced abnormal changes in the uterine cervix, the more often presence of these HPV types. The presence of HPV types 6 and 11 were more often in low grade lesions.The conclusions from this examinations are: there is a proportional correlation between the grades of Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions, uterine cervix carcinoma and the presence of oncogenic types of human papillomavirus.
