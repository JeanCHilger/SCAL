PCR and Digene Hybride Capture System I in identification of human papillomavirus. We have analyzed and compared two different systems used in identification of DNA HPV. 100 samples obtained from patients with I degree and II degree Papanicolaou smears and 200 from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were analyzed. The obtained data indicate higher sensitivity of the PCR method compared to Digene Hybride Capture System.
