Low risk and high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and cervical cancer in Zimbabwe: epidemiological evidence. To establish the prevalence of detectable low-risk and high-risk, oncogenic HPV types in cervical swabs of women with histologically proven cancer of the cervix.Cross sectional study.Harare Central and Parirenyatwa Hospitals.119 women with histologically proven cervical cancer of whom 63 had the degree of differentiation of the tumour reported.Frequency of infection with high and low-risk human papillomaviruses.The presence of HPV DNA was demonstrated in 63% (75/119) of cases. Low risk HPVs were present in 26% (31/119) and high-risk HPVs were demonstrated in 51% (61/119) of samples tested. Co-infection with both low-risk and high-risk HPVs was observed in 14% (17/119) of the specimens. High-risk HPVs were detected in 55% (21/38) of poorly differentiated tumours while 60% (15/25) of moderately and well-differentiated tumours showed the presence of high-risk HPVs.High-risk human papillomaviruses are associated with cervical cancer. There was no significant difference in the frequency of high-risk HPV types in women with moderately to well-differentiated tumours and those with poorly-differentiated tumours.
