VIN 3: a clinicopathologic review. A retrospective review of the management of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (VIN 3) over a 16-year period from 1981 to 1997 was conducted. Complete information was available for analysis on 101 patients. The mean age was 53.9 years (range 14-102 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 36 months (range 2-184 months). Fifty-eight percent of patients presented with pruritus. The disease was multifocal in 51% and unifocal in 49% of cases and the left labium majus was the most frequently affected site (27%). Co-existent or previous genital disease was identified in 39% of patients and 8% had a history of invasive gynecological cancer. Histologic evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was found in 31% of patients. Wide local excision was the most frequently used treatment modality (78%). Thirty-eight percent of patients required at least one further treatment for recurrent disease. Smoking, multifocality, HPV effect, and positive surgical margins were not found to be significant predictors of recurrence. There were three (3%) cases of progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, one at 6, 7, and 7 years after initial treatment.
