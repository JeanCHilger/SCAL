The application of human papillomavirus testing to cervical cancer screening. Although cytologic screening has considerably reduced the incidence of cervical cancer, there are some problems which remain to be solved, such as the low sensitivity of this procedure. HPV testing is fundamentally different from conventional cytologic testing, because it evaluates the HPV infection itself, the most important causative factor for cervical cancer. In this study, the roles and clinical applications of HPV testing in cervical cancer screening are examined from 3 standpoints: in primary screening, in the management of women with low-grade cytologic abnormalities, and in the follow-up after treatment of pre-invasive or early invasive lesions.
