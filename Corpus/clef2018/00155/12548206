Herpes simplex virus type II is not a cofactor to human papillomavirus in cancer of the uterine cervix. Cells that were cotransfected with herpes simplex virus-16 and the herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho -2 DNA induce tumors in nude mice. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the role of herpes simplex virus type 2 as a cofactor to human papillomavirus in cervical cancer.Cervical cells that were obtained with an endocervical Cytobrush brush (Medscand) from 439 women (50 women with cancer lesions, 65 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 80 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 244 healthy subjects) and DNA that was extracted from 150 cervical cancer biopsy specimens were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho -2 and Bgl IIC transforming DNA sequences.All 439 cervical samples and 150 cervical cancer biopsy specimens tested negative for herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho -2 and Bgl IIC DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Overall, none of 200 samples (0%) from women with invasive cervical cancer contained herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho -2 or Bgl IIC DNA (95% CI, 0.0-1.8).Although herpes simplex virus type 2 Bgl IIN transforms epithelial cells in vitro, it was not detected in cervical cancer specimens.
