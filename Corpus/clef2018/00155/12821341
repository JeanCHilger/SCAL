Detection and typing of HPV genotypes in various cervical lesions by HPV oligonucleotide microarray. This study was conducted to evaluate a clinical efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) oligonucleotide microarray (Biomedlab Co., Seoul, South Korea) for the detection of HPVs in various cervical lesions.HPV DNAs from 234 patients were analysed by two methods. Among those, 212 patients were classified into 5 groups according to the histologic diagnosis: chronic cervicitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, CIN II, CIN III, and invasive cervical carcinoma. PCR-RFLP could detect 7 types of high-risk HPVs (HPV 16/18/31/33/35/52/58) and HPV microarray could detect 15 types of high-risk HPVs (HPV 16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59/66/68/69) and 7 types of low-risk HPVs (HPV 6/11/34/40/42/43/44).HPV genotyping by HPV oligonucleotide microarray revealed that HPV16 was the most frequent type (30.2%) in all specimens tested and was significantly more frequent in CIN III and invasive carcinomas than other lesions.HPV DNAs were detected in 158 and 174 of the 234 cervical samples by PCR-RFLP and HPV microarray, respectively. The correlation between the two methods was good in detecting HPVs in general (kappa index = 0.69) and HPVs 31 and 52 (kappa index = 0.70 and 0.70, respectively) and excellent in detecting HPVs 16, 18, 33, 35, and 58 (kappa index = 0.90, 0.88, 0.92, 0.77, and 0.84, respectively). Double HPV infection was detected in 10 cases and one triple infection was detected. By combining cytology and HPV testing, the sensitivity was improved to 87.5, 95.5, 96.1, and 97.2% in CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, and carcinoma, respectively.This results suggest that HPV oligonucleotide microarray is a highly comparable method to the previously used PCR-RFLP method for the detection of HPVs in cervical specimens. Genetic informations for HPV infection in cervical specimens may offer new strategies in manipulating the patients harboring cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma.
