Longitudinal study of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and at-risk HIV-seronegative women. We examined incidence and correlates of progression and regression of abnormal cervical cytologic test results, defined as at least low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs), in 774 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and 391 HIV-seronegative women monitored semiannually for up to 5.5 years. During follow-up, 224 (35%) HIV-seropositive women and 34 (9%) HIV-seronegative women had incident SILs detected by Pap test 47 (7%) HIV-seropositive women developed high-grade lesions. The incidence of SILs was 11.5 cases among HIV-seropositive and 2.6 cases among HIV-seronegative women per 100 person-years of observation (rate ratio, 4.5
