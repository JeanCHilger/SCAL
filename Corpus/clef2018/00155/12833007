Pearly penile papules: still no reason for uneasiness. Penile lesions and pearly penile papules (PPP) are frequently found in male sexual partners of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The former have been associated with human papillomavirus (HPV).We estimated the prevalence of PPP in male sexual partners of women with CIN, and investigated the association between PPP and flat and papular penile lesions found in these men. We further evaluated a possible association between PPP and HPV, age, and CIN grade of the female partner.We evaluated by penoscopy the presence of HPV-associated penile lesions and PPP in 226 male sexual partners of women with CIN. HPV was tested by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay and in situ hybridization.The prevalence of PPP was 34% and was not associated with the presence of penile lesions or a positive HPV test. Age and CIN grade of the female partner were not related to the presence of PPP.The prevalence of PPP in male sexual partners of women with CIN is comparable with the prevalence described in men of more diverse populations. Our data do not support a causative role for HPV in the genesis of PPP.
