Cervical neoplasia and the HIV-infected patient. HPV infection and cervical dysplasia occur more frequently in HIV-infected women. All HIV-infected women should be screened at least annually for cervical cancer with cervical cytology. All patients with any abnormality in the Pap smear should be referred for colposcopic evaluation. Patients with documented high-grade dysplasia should be treated. All patients must be observed closely after treatment for recurrence. Treatment with agents such as imiquimod or 5-FU may help to decrease recurrence rates. Patients who are diagnosed with cervical cancer should be treated with surgery or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation as determined by extent of disease and health status. It appears that HAART may have a positive impact on cervical dysplasia and cancer. Thus, all HIV-infected patients should be managed optimally on HAART. Hopefully, as patients live longer and healthier on HAART, they will be more compliant with cervical cancer screening, and cervical cancer will become an increasingly rare disease.
