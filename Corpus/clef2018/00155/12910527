Obesity as a potential risk factor for adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Hormonal factors may play a more prominent role in cervical adenocarcinoma than squamous cell carcinoma. The authors evaluated whether obesity, which can influence hormone levels, was associated with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.This case-control study included 124 patients with adenocarcinoma, 139 matched patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and 307 matched community control participants. All participants completed interviews and provided cervicovaginal samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Polytomous logistic regression-generated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for self-reported height and weight, body mass index (BMI kg/m(2)), and measured waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) for both histologic types were adjusted and stratified for HPV and other confounders.Height, weight, BMI, and WHR were positively associated with adenocarcinoma. BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2) (vs. BMI < 25 kg/m(2) OR, 2.1 and 95% CI, 1.1-3.8) and WHR in the highest tertile (vs. the lowest tertileObesity and body fat distribution were associated more strongly with adenocarcinoma than with squamous cell carcinoma. Although questions about screening remain, obesity may have a particular influence on the risk of glandular cervical carcinoma.
