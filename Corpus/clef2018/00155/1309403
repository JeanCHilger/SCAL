Evaluation and follow-up of abnormal Pap smears. An estimated 13,500 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 6,000 related deaths occur each year in the United States. These numbers can be significantly reduced if all women are regularly screened with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and undergo colposcopy when abnormalities are detected. Screening with Pap smears should begin at age 18 or at the age of first sexual intercourse and should be repeated every one to three years, depending on individual risk factors, until age 65. Screening may be discontinued in women over age 65 who have had normal findings on two consecutive Pap smears. Risk factors for cervical cancer include sexual intercourse before age 20, more than two sexual partners in a lifetime, cigarette smoking and genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Use of a spatula and Cytobrush for cervical sampling will improve the chances of collecting an adequate sample containing endocervical cells. Family physicians must know the significance of various cervical abnormalities reported by the laboratory. In women with cervical or genital HPV infection and persistent inflammatory cervical changes unresponsive to appropriate therapy, colposcopy is necessary to screen for underlying dysplasia.
