The E5 gene from human papillomavirus type 16 is an oncogene which enhances growth factor-mediated signal transduction to the nucleus. Although human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is believed to be a major etiological agent in the development of cervical cancer, the biological function of several of its early genes remains to be established. In the present study, we have defined some of the biological properties of the E5 gene from HPV-16. Expression of the HPV-16 E5 gene in 3T3-A31 cells induced transformation to anchorage-independent growth (colony formation in soft agar). Addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the soft-agar medium caused the E5-expressing cells to form larger colonies than those formed in the absence of EGF. Parental 3T3-A31 cells did not form colonies in soft agar either in the presence or in the absence of EGF. Analysis of clones expressing high levels of E5 mRNA revealed that these cells also expressed higher levels of c-fos mRNA in response to serum, EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) than did the parental 3T3-A31 cells. Cells expressing the E5 gene were also capable of accelerated growth in low serum and were more tumorigenic in nude mice than were control cells. We conclude that the E5 gene from HPV-16 is an oncogene which transforms cells in part through enhancing signal transduction from growth factors to the nucleus.
