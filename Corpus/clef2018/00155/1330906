Detection of human papillomavirus DNA without amplification: prospects for clinical utility. Certain HPV types are major risk factors for the development of cervical and other human cancers. This chapter describes some of the problems which have precluded accurate diagnosis of HPV-related conditions in many studies. Despite the confusion, a multitude of reports demonstrate that HPV DNA testing has clinical utility, and future investigations should be directed at more accurately delineating its role in human health care.
