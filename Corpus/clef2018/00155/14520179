Cervical human papillomavirus infection in the female population in Barcelona, Spain. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major cause of invasive cervical cancer. Identification of HPV determinants might allow for targeting of high-risk groups for cervical cancer.The goal was to estimate the HPV prevalence and its determinants among women from the general population of Barcelona.We studied a random sample of female residents in metropolitan Barcelona, Spain (n = 973). Information was obtained through personal interviews and laboratory testing of cervical exfoliated cells. HPV was detected using a GP5+/6+ polymerase chain reaction assay.The average age of participants was 43 years (standard deviation = 16.1 y) and the percentage of lifetime monogamy was 79%. The age-adjusted HPV prevalence was 3.0%. Independent HPV determinants were being born overseas (odds ratio [OR], 8.1 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-33.5), being divorced (OR, 6.7The study confirms a low overall HPV prevalence in a largely monogamous population. The protection observed with condom use needs further evaluation.
