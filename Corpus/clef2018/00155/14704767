Prevention of cervical cancer through papillomavirus vaccination. A subset of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) promote anogenital malignancy, including cervical cancer, and prevention and treatment strategies that reflect the causal role of HPV are being developed. Vaccines based on HPV virus-like particles induce genotype-specific virus-neutralizing antibody and prevent infection with HPV. Persistent papillomavirus infection is required for the development of papillomavirus-associated cancer and, therefore, therapeutic vaccines are being developed to eliminate established papillomavirus infection. Such vaccines test principles for the growing field of tumour-antigen-specific immunotherapy. This article reviews progress in the field and draws conclusions for the development of future prophylactic and therapeutic viral vaccines.
