Human papillomavirus DNA status after loop excision for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III - A prospective study. The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA status and recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after loop excision (LEEP/LLETZ). Women (n=161) who underwent loop excision for CIN III and who were followed up prospectively for at least 4 years were the study cohort. Cervical smear cytology and testing for HPV DNA was performed at 3, 6 and 12 months prospectively and thereafter at intervals of 6-12 months, using the PCR method with a consensus primer targeting the L1 region. There has been no recurrence in 141 (81.6%) out of 161 subjects, while squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SIL) of low or high grade on cytology and CIN grade I-III on histology have been detected in 20 subjects. Prior to loop excision, HPV DNA was detected in 17 subjects who developed recurrence (9 had type 16, 2 each had types 18 and 52, and 1 each had types 31, 51, 58, and unknown). Within 3 months postoperatively, 12 (70.7%) subjects became negative for HPV, but 2 remained positive for the same type (1 each had types 16, 18), along with high-grade SIL on cytology, and CIN III on histology within 6 months, so repeat loop excision was performed. On the other hand, cytological findings were normalized in all transiently infected subjects within 18-36 months. Our results suggest that loop excision has improved HPV infection in many cases of CIN III and the persistent infection with a high-risk type of HPV is a predictor of the recurrence of CIN grade III.
