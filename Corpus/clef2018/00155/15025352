Detection of HPV DNA in cervical carcinomas by PCR and hybrid capture assay. HPV DNA was detected in exfoliated cervical cells of 73% (85/116) cervical cancer patients by PCR using HPV consensus primers and by hybrid capture assay (HC II) (Digene Corp., USA) in 77 of the 85 cases found HPV positive by PCR. Presence of HPV 16/18 DNA were investigated in the 79 cases by PCR using type specific primers. HPV 16 was detected in 31 (39%) patients, HPV 18 in 7 (8.8%), both HPV 16 and 18 in 19 (24%) and HPVs other than 16/18 in 22 (27.8%) cases. Age and clinical stages had no significant effect on HPV prevalence. Double infection of HPV 16 and 18 was significantly (p<0.05) high in the older patients (56 years or more) compared to younger group. Results indicated that cervical cancers in India are strongly associated with high-risk type HPV infection. HC II assays and PCR results for detection of HPV in cervical smears were comparable.
