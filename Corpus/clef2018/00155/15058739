Detection of human papillomavirus from liquid-based cytology specimens by in-house PCR: a pilot study. The Papanicolaou smear remains the most common method for the detection of precancerous changes in cervical cytology. However, the introduction of a liquid-based cytology (LBC) technique expands the possibility of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) diagnosis, and permits detection of precancerous changes and human papillomavirus (HPV) simultaneously. In the pilot study reported here, using an in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, high-grade HPV was detected in 32% of a cohort of 38 patients. This conventional PCR method could be developed for use on a real-time PCR platform or in a microtitre-well format and subsequently automated.
