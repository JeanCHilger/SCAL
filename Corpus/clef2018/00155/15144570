IL-10 promoter nt -1082A/G polymorphism and human papillomavirus infection in cytologic abnormalities of the uterine cervix. The role of A/G polymorphism at nucleotide -1082 in the interleukin-10 (IL-10) promoter was assessed by following the disease course of 253 patients who had had a routine diagnostic Hybrid Capture human papillomavirus (HPV) test because of cytologic or colposcopic abnormalities of the uterine cervix. At baseline, 97 (78%) of the 125 high-risk HPV-positive and 83 (65%) of the 128 HPV-negative patients had equivocal cytologic atypia classified as P3 by the Papanicolaou classification, and the rest of the patients had mild colposcopic atypia with cytologic results of no oncogenic significance. In the high-risk HPV-infected patients, the frequency distribution of the nt -1082 genotypes (A/A: 28% A/G: 52%
