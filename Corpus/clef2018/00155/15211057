Pathology of the Cervix. Introduction to the focal topic "Pathology of the cervix - future developments". The incidence of cervical cancer has decreased distinctly. Since the causal connection between HPV infection and cervical cancer was proved, new diagnostic and therapeutic methods have become available. New diagnostic possibilities, in certain situations the determination of HPV, a new vaccination as well as molecular-bio-logical tests will shape the future. However, it must not be forgotten that the number of participants in cervical cancer screening has a bigger impact on the decreasing incidence of cervical cancer than any special diagnostic methods.
