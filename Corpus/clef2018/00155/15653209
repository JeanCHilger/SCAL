Role of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in the follow-up of patients after treatment for cervical precancerous lesions. To evaluate the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in post-treatment follow-up of patients after therapeutic excision of the cervix due to positive screening tests.A hospital-based retrospective analysis was performed with prospective collection of patient data of women screened for cervical cancer at a Gynecologic Outpatient Clinic. Patients after therapeutic excision due to positive screening results were identified and followed up with HPV testing and serial cytology.After 61 treatment for cervicalis intraepithelialis neoplasia (CIN), high-risk HPV infection was detected during the post-treatment follow-up at 18 cases (29.5%), 10 of them had persisting cytological atypia (positive predictive value (PPV): 56%), 5 developed CIN (PPV: 28%). When the HPV test was negative (43 patients) in the post-treatment period, neither CIN nor persisting cytological atypia developed (negative predictive value (NPV): 100%) during 1201 patient months (median 26 months).A negative HPV test eliminates the risk of recurrent disease after treatment for CIN.
