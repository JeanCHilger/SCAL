Operative treatment of cervical premalignant lesions and the presence of high-risk human papilloma virus as etiologic agent. The conization as an excisional method is used as an operative treatment of high-risk premalignant cervical lesions. Early detection and removal may stop the developing process that leads to invasive carcinoma. The study presents a group of 100 women, operated with "cold knife" conization during the year 2002 at the 1st Operative Oncologic Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrician Clinic - Medical Faculty, Skopje. The operative material showed CIN 2 in 2 and CIN 3 in 31 women. In 7 of them, CIN 3 lesions were removed by punch biopsy or ECC, thus the cone showed only CIN 2. In two women out of the total of 67 with the preoperative diagnosis of CIS, CIN 3 lesions were postoperatively diagnosed. This is the result of the adequate punch biopsy during the diagnostic procedure. Three cones showed Ca microinvasivum and other 3 displayed Ca invasivum which then needed other surgical treatment. In 93 % of the women the conization had a therapeutic effect and in 7 % it was only of diagnostic value. HPV testing was made in 55 out of the operatively treated women. The most common type HPV 16 was identified in 27 % of the women. The second was HPV 31 in 25.5 %, then HPV 66 in 14.5 %, HPV 18 in 11%, HPV CP 8304 and HPV 38 in 5.5 %, HPV 58 as well as MM9 in 2 (3.6 %). The dichotomic presence of HPV 31+18 and HPV 6+16 was identified in two women. (Tab. 3, Ref: 10.)
