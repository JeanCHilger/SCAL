Increased frequency of genital human papillomavirus infection in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive Taiwanese women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with increased incidence and severity of HPV-related cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This study examined the incidence of genital HPV infection in HIV-infected Taiwanese women and its relationship with cervical neoplasia.This hospital-based, case-control study enrolled 31 consecutive HIV-seropositive women and 124 age-matched women who were free from HIV infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to distinguish high-risk (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 52 and 58) and low-risk HPV (types 6 and 11). The occurrence of genital HPV infection was compared between women with and without HIV infection. In addition, CD4 lymphocyte counts were determined by flow cytometry and Papanicolaou test was done in women with HIV infection.HPV and Papanicolaou test were done soon after the diagnosis of HIV infection. HIV seropositive women had a significantly greater high-risk HPV infection rate (48.4% 15/31) than women without HIV infection (20.2%The risk of genital HPV infection was significantly increased in HIV-infected women. Due to the association between high-risk HPV infection and the development of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer, regular follow-up of Papanicolaou test is necessary in these women.
