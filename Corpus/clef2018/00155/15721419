Glutathione-S-transferase and p53 polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis. To investigate the clinical significance of glutathione-S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1 and p53 codon 72 polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis.GSTM1, GSTT1 and p53 codon 72 polymorphisms together with human papillomavirus (HPV) types were examined in a total of 198 cervical smear samples using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques.Forty-two patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) had higher frequency of high-risk HPV and null GSTT1 genotype than 102 with low-grade SIL (LSIL) and 54 controls. Thirty-one patients with HSIL had also statistically higher frequency of null GSTT1 genotype than 28 with LSIL among 69 patients with high-risk HPV. There was no statistical difference in p53 Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro genotypes between SILs and controls with or without high-risk HPV.GSTT1 null genotype in cervical cell samples may be associated with more severe precancerous lesions of the cervix in a Japanese population. The p53 codon 72 polymorphism is unlikely to be related to HPV status and the onset of cervical cancer.
