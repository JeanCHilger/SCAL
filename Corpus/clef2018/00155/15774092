Combination of antisense human telomerase RNA and antisense human telomerase catalytic subunit inhibits cervical cancer Hela cells growth. To investigate the inhibitory effect of combination of antisense human telomerase RNA (anti-hTR) and antisense human telomerase catalytic subunit (anti-hTERT) on proliferation of cervical cancer Hela cell line cultured in vitro.Cervical cancer Hela cells were transfected by anti-hTR, anti-hTERT, anti-hTR + anti-hTERT, sense-hTR, sense-hTERT with Oligofectamin reagent. The proliferation activity of cervical cancer Hela cells was determined using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). The activity of telomerase was tested by polymerase chain reaction-telomeric repeat amplification protocol-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-TRAP-ELISA). Cell morphologies were observed under fluorescence microscope with acridine orange staining. Apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometer method (FCM).The inhibitory rates on proliferation and apoptotic rates of Hela cells transfected by antisense oligonucleotides were significantly higher compared with those of control, sense oligonucleotides and Oligofectamin (all P < 0.01). Meanwhile, the inhibitory rates on proliferation and apoptotic rates of Hela cells transfected by anti-hTR + anti-hTERT were significantly higher compared with those transfected by anti-hTR or anti-hTERT alone (P < 0.01) telomerase activity was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Transfected by antisense oligonucleotides at 0.2 micromol/L for 3 d, inhibitory rates on proliferation, telomerase activity (relative to control), apoptotic rate of Hela cells was 69.3%, 19.6%, 28.6% respectively (Q = 0.867, 0.919, 1.075). Percentages of G(0)/G(1) phase cells were increased.Telomerase anti-hTR and anti-hTERT inhibit Hela cell growth probably through suppressing telomerase activity, inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle. Combination of anti-hTR and anti-hTERT has synergistic action on cervical cancer Hela cells.
