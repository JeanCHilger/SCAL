Psychosocial factors and the course of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia: a prospective study. To investigate the influence of psychosocial factors on the course of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN).A group of 93 patients with CIN 1 or 2 was followed for 2.25 years by half-yearly colposcopy and cytology. Negatively-rated life events, social support, and coping style were studied in relation to distress during follow-up and in relation to time till progression and regression of CIN. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was controlled for as well as sick role bias caused by suspicion of having cervical cancer and distress due to the abnormal cervical smear.During follow-up, progression was found in 20 patients (22%), stable disease in 22 patients (24%), and regression in 51 patients (55%). Negatively-rated life events and lack of social support predicted distress longitudinally. No association was found between progression or regression of CIN and negatively-rated life events, lack of social support, coping style, and distress.We found no evidence that psychosocial factors influence the course of CIN.
