Human papillomavirus genotype distribution in low-grade cervical lesions: comparison by geographic region and with cervical cancer. Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) associated with certain human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes may preferentially progress to cervical cancer. HPV genotyping may thus have the potential to improve the effectiveness of screening programs and to reduce overtreatment. LSIL cases (n = 8,308) from 55 published studies were included in a meta-analysis. HPV genotype distribution was assessed by geographic region and in comparison with published data on cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). HPV detection in LSIL was 80% in North America but less than 70% in other regions, most likely reflecting regional differences in LSIL diagnosis. Among 5,910 HPV-positive LSILs, HPV16 was the most common genotype (26.3%) followed by HPV31 (11.5%), HPV51 (10.6%), and HPV53 (10.2%). HPV-positive LSILs from Africa were 2-fold less likely to be infected with HPV16 than those in Europe, and HPV-positive LSILs from North America were more likely to be infected with HPV18 than those from Europe or South/Central America. Interpretation for rarer genotypes was hampered by variation in HPV testing methodology. SCC/LSIL prevalence ratios indicated that HPV16 was 2-fold and HPV18 was 1.5-fold more common in SCC than in HPV-positive LSIL, thus appearing more likely to progress than other high-risk genotypes (SCC/LSIL prevalence ratios between 0.05 and 0.85). HPV53 and HPV66 showed SCC/LSIL ratios of 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. HPV genotype distribution in LSIL differs from that in cervical cancer, highlighting the importance of HPV genotype in the risk of progression from LSIL to malignancy. Some regional differences in the relative importance of HPV genotypes in LSIL were noted.
