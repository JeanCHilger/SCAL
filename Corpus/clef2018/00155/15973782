Mobilization for cervical cancer screening: lessons from a poor-urban Yoruba community in Nigeria. Cervical cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and it remains one of the commonest malignancies in Nigeria. Screening remains the most effective tool for the detection of pre-invasive stages of cervical cancer, giving the opportunity for prompt and effective treatment before the emergence of invasive disease. In Nigeria, as in most developing countries, the concept of screening for cancer and its pre-emptive treatment is underdeveloped. The fact that the facilities and logistics for cervical cancer screening are generally located in the hospital setting, a place where one goes when ill, according to local beliefs, makes acceptance more difficult. That Nigeria urgently needs to set up or develop cervical screening programmes that will reach women outside the hospital setting in a culturally acceptable milieu is not in doubt. A community cervical screening survey for the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and HPV infection was initiated in Idikan, a poor-urban inner core area of Ibadan. The challenges and experiences encountered in the execution of the project which could serve as useful knowledge to those undertaking similar exercises, requiring mass mobilization for cancer screening of an uninformed group, are highlighted. Our experience in the course of this study is important as it brought out the probable influences of community dynamics and social organization in illness decisions and prescriptions for health operative in this particular population group. Cervical cancer screening programmes should therefore make provisions to accommodate the occasional outcomes as we had encountered. In addition, screening programmes in developing societies would require sensitive designs that should address the cultural attitudes, personal conflicts, expectations of treatment and overall context of preventive care.
