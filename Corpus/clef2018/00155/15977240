The impact of high risk human papillomavirus testing in an inner London colposcopy clinic. This is an audit of a new technique to improve the colposcopy service. Samples were tested for high risk HPV DNA using Digene Hybrid Capture II. Sixty-four percent of the sampled women under 30 had detectable high risk HPV DNA, decreasing to 44% in 30--39 year olds and to 27% in women over 40. High risk HPV prevalence increased with severity of cytology, although 22% with normal colposcopy had detectable high risk HPV. Of those women treated for cervical dysplasia, 83% had detectable high risk HPV prior to treatment, compared to only 32% afterwards. The audit has shown that high risk HPV testing has considerable discriminatory value. It has been integrated successfully into the service, particularly to manage low grade cervical abnormalities and to add valuable information following treatment for cervical dysplasia. Results need to be interpreted alongside colposcopy, cytology, and histology, and care must be taken in the interpretation of a single high risk HPV result.
