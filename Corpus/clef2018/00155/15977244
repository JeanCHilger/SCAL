Cervical squamous intra-epithelial changes and human papillomavirus infection in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus in Pune, India. In view of the dual burden of HIV infection and cervical cancers in India, this study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of Pap smear abnormalities and human papillomavirus infection among HIV-infected women. Consecutive HIV-infected women attending voluntary counseling testing clinics were enrolled. Written informed consent, demographic information, Pap smears, cervical swabs for HPV typing and a blood sample for CD4+ cell count were collected. Treatment for opportunistic and sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract infections was provided. Women with Pap smear abnormality were referred for further intervention. Between January 2003 and May 2004, 287 HIV-infected women were enrolled. Pap smear abnormalities were seen in 6.3% women and were more common among women aged 30 and above (P=0.042) and those who had suffered from opportunistic infections (P=0.004). In multivariate analysis, Pap smear abnormalities were associated independently with opportunistic infections (P=0.02, AOR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2--11.5). Of the 100 random cervical specimens screened for HPV 16 and 18 genotypes, 33% (95 CI 23.9--43.1) were positive for HPV 16/18. Of the 122 patients who returned for a follow-up visit, 5 patients (4.1%) who did not have Pap smear abnormality at baseline, had developed Pap smear abnormality. The incidence of Pap smear abnormalities was 5.5 per 100 person year of follow-up. In order to prevent thousands of deaths due to cervical cancer in India, there is a need for strengthening the Pap smear screening program and HPV vaccine development.
