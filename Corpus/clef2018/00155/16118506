Photodynamic therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We report the effectiveness of PDT in 105 cases of CIN.All patients received photofrin (PHE) 2 mg/kg intravenously and, 48-60 h later, phototherapy was performed using the Excimer dye laser or a YAG-OPO laser with an irradiation dose of 100 J/cm(2) using 630 nm wavelength.Mild photosensitivity occurred in 48% (50/105) of patients. The complete response (CR) rate was 90% (94/105) at 3 months following treatment. In the remaining 11 patients, 5 patients had CIN1, 2 patients had CIN2, and 4 patients had mild cytologic findings. However, in 9 of these 11 patients, CR was achieved 6 months after PDT. In 69 patients, human papilloma virus (HPV) typing was performed before and after PDT therapy. Pre-treatment, 64 of 69 patients (93%), were HPV-positive including 30 cases of high-risk HPV (43%). Testing performed 3, 6 and 12 months following PDT revealed no HPV-DNA in 75% (52/69), 74% (48/65) and 72% (41/57) of patients. At present, the median follow-up period is 636 days (90-2,232 days). In 3 patients, recurrence requiring surgical treatment was identified at 646, 717 and 895 days after PDT.PDT is an effective and minimally invasive treatment for CIN, which also appears to eradicate HPV infection.
