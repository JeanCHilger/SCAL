New statistical software for intralaboratory and interlaboratory quality control in clinical cytology. Validation in a simulation study on clinical samples. To design a statistical software package to provide automated calculations of normal and weighted and 3 indices.Prompted by the lack of commonly available software to compute weighted kappa and the nonproportionate workload needed to calculate our 3 variability indices manually, the new statistical software package was designed. To demonstrate the performance of the new CONQUISTADOR software, a simulation study (both intralaboratory and interlaboratory) was designed using 5,000 clinical samples randomly selected from a data file of > or = 200,000 conventional Pap smears and programmed to become "analyzed" by 12 cytologists in 5 imaginary laboratories.A representative set of both complete and partial outputs provided by the software, in Excel format (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, U.S.A.) are shown to illustrate the different functions of the program. In the interlaboratory mode, the software calculates accuracy indicators (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and their 95% CI), which are not common features of regular statistical packages kappa and weighted kappaThe CONQUISTADOR statistical package has properties that are useful in monitoring cytologic laboratory quality in both intralaboratory and interlaboratory settings. The software will be distributed by the National Institute of Health, Rome, for the delivery costs only.
