Mesonephric hyperplasia can cause abnormal cervical smears: report of three cases with review of literature. Hyperplastic mesonephric remnants are an incidental finding in occasional uterine or cervical surgical specimens. We describe three cases in which such remnants were postulated to be the source of abnormal glandular cells in cervical smears.In all three cases abnormal glandular cells were seen in cervical smears. Subsequent histology showed the presence of hyperplastic mesonephric remnants that communicated with the endocervical canal and were likely to be the source of the abnormal glandular cells. We believe that the key features of these cells, which may aid their distinction from other causes of glandular abnormalities, are their loose clustering, lack of significant anisocytosis and cuboidal outlines.We aim to document mesonephric hyperplasia as a possible source for abnormal glandular cells in cervical smears.
