The prevalence of HR-HPV DNA in ASC-US Pap smears: A military population study. To determine the prevalence of HR-HPV DNA in ASC-US Pap smears following implementation of the Bethesda 2001 classification system.A computer database of Pap smears obtained within Department of the Army medical facilities was queried for the study period August 2002 to June 2004. All ASC-US Pap smears that underwent reflex testing for HR-HPV DNA were included. Additional clinical and demographic data were obtained from facilities within the US northeast region to evaluate the differences in ASC-US and SIL rates between the current and former Bethesda classification systems.550,000 Pap smears were collected during the study period. The HR-HPV prevalence was 40.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 40.3 to 41.3) among 40,870 patients with ASC-US Pap smears. Within the northeast region, the HR-HPV prevalence in ASC-US Pap smears decreased from 61.2% (95% CI = 57.4 to 64.8%) in patients 18-22 years old to 24.9% (95% CI = 23.1 to 26.8%) in patients age 29 and older. When comparing the two classification systems, significant increases in both ASC-H and SIL and decreases in ASC-US were appreciated after the institution of Bethesda system 2001.In our large, diverse cohort, the implementation of the Bethesda II system has resulted in a decrease in ASC-US Pap smear results. Additionally, the prevalence of HR-HPV in the ASC-US population was 40.8%, significantly lower than the rate noted in the ALTS trial under the Bethesda I classification system.
