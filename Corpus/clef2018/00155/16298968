Expression of the high-risk human papillomavirus type 18 and 45 E7 oncoproteins in cervical carcinoma biopsies. E7 proteins are major oncoproteins of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which play a key role in cervical carcinogenesis. These proteins have been shown to immortalize primary human cells. Due to the absence of antibodies with suitable sensitivity and specificity, little is known about expression of the E7 oncoproteins in naturally infected tissues. Recently, high-level expression of the E7 protein of HPV-16, the most prevalent oncogenic HPV type, was demonstrated in cervical carcinomas by immunohistochemistry however, approximately 15 additional high-risk HPV types are known to be associated with cervical carcinoma. It is unknown whether the E7 oncoproteins of HPV-18 and -45, the second and third most prevalent HPV types, are expressed in cervical cancers. Using antibodies against HPV-18 and -45 E7 proteins, it is shown here for the first time that the HPV-18 and -45 E7 proteins can be detected in cervical carcinoma biopsies. Together with anti-HPV-16 E7 antibodies, this could create the possibility of detecting E7 oncoproteins in approximately 80 % of all cervical cancers.
