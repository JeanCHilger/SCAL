Assessment of human papilloma viral load of archival cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by real-time polymerase chain reaction in a Turkish population. The purpose of this study was to determine the existence, and viral load of human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes 16 and 18 in paraffinized cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Overall 94 women were included. Of these patients 47 (50%) had CIN I, 27 (28.8%) had CIN II, and 20 (21.2%) had CIN III. HPV positivity for these three groups were 4.2%, 14.8% and 45%, respectively. HPV positivity in CIN III patients was significantly higher than CIN I (OR = 18.41, 95% CI 3.00-145.73 p < 0.001), and CIN II patients (OR = 4.70, 95% CI 1.00-23.76
