Does pretreatment human papillomavirus (HPV) titers predict radiation response and survival outcomes in cancer cervix?--a pilot study. To evaluate if pretreatment HPV titers in cancer cervix could predict radiation response and survival outcomes.Twenty-one patients of cancer cervix were treated by radiotherapy (RT) alone. HPV titers were estimated using DNA Hybrid Capture II test. Loco-regional response at 1 month of RT--complete or partial response (CR and PR respectively) and survival outcomes--local disease-free (LDFS), disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survivals were evaluated against pre- and posttreatment HPV titers.Pretreatment HPV titers ranged from 0.81 to 3966.10 RLU/cut off (mean +/- SD: 1264.39 +/- 1148.22, median: 1129.98). Of the demographic features evaluated, mean HPV titers were significantly different only for patients achieving CR or PR at completion of RT (mean +/- SD for CR vs. PR: 1616.31 +/- 1146.86 vs. 384.57 +/- 538.80, P = 0.022). HPV titers at end of RT ranged from 0.12 to 487.42 RLU/cut off (mean +/- SD: 37.31 +/- 108.60, median: 2.33). Patients with higher pretreatment HPV titers (>1000 RLU/cutoff) had a higher CR (P = 0.022) and better survival compared to those with < or =1000 RLU/cutoff (LDFS, P = 0.004 DFS, P = 0.005Higher pretreatment HPV titers (>1000 RLU/cutoff) could be considered as a predictor of radiotherapy response and survival in cancer cervix. A reduction in these titers to 99.5% of their baseline values at end of radiotherapy is also associated with better survival outcomes.
