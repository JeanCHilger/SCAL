Assessment of human papillomavirus testing on liquid-based Cyto-screen system for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Effect of age. Analyse the performance of human papillomavirus testing with hybrid capture II on liquid-based CYTO-screen system for women diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance according to the age.Were included all women diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance for whom human papillomavirus testing was performed and cytological and histological procedures were available over a follow-up period of 6 to 18 months.Human papillomavirus testing was performed in 3,047 patients, and results were compared to cytological and histological follow-up diagnosis in 1,880 cases (61.7%). The sensitivity for diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was 93.3% in women less than 30 of age and 89.7% in women more than 30 of age. Specificity was 44.9% in women less than 30 of age and 64.4% in women more than 30 of age. Likelihood ratios confirmed these results as they show a low discriminatory power in case of positive result specifically in women less than 30 of age but an excellent performance in case of negative result.The use of human papillomavirus testing after a diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance with the residual material of Cyto-screen system is a possible triage procedure to identify patients needing a colposcopy. Its specificity is better for women over 30.
