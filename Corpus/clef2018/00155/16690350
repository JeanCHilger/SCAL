Evaluation of high-risk human papillomavirus types PCR detection in paired urine and cervical samples of women with abnormal cytology. During the last decade, increasing efforts have focused on HPV detection in self-obtained samples, to increase the overall proportion of patients participating in cervical cancer screening procedures.A clinical evaluation study of an optimized protocol for PCR detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types in urine compared with cervical samples in consecutive women referred to the colposcopy clinic with abnormal cervical cytology.Paired urine and cervical specimens were collected from 100 consecutive women referred to the colposcopy clinic with abnormal cervical cytology and normal urine parameters. In-house and a commercial PCR method for the detection of HPV types 16 and 18, and a commercial multiplex PCR for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33 were performed. All HPV cervix-positive/urine-negative paired urine samples were spiked with serial dilutions of cell lines infected with HPV 16 or 18 to test the sensitivity of HPV detection in these urine samples.In all but two cases HPV type 16 was detected. In cancer cases, the urine/cervix HPV detection sensitivity was 88.8% in cases with high-grade lesions it was 76.5%A higher urine/cervix HPV detection sensitivity in cancer and high-grade lesions suggests that urine testing could be used to detect HPV mainly when these lesions are present.
