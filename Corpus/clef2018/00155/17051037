Prospective evaluation of colposcopic features in predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: degree of acetowhite change most important. OBJECTIVE.: To prospectively evaluate the contribution of three colposcopic features-degree of acetowhite change, blood vessel pattern, and lesion margin-to the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: A total of 301 women, who participated in two randomized controlled trials and a cross-sectional study of human papillomavirus testing and who were referred to a regional colposcopy center, were studied. Women were examined by colposcopists, who prospectively scored all abnormal transformation zones using three features. The site with the highest score (the most abnormal site) was biopsied and histology reviewed by two pathologists. RESULTS.: In multivariate analysis, degree of acetowhite change was the only feature significantly associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS.: Grading lesion severity using degree of acetowhite change alone gave comparable results to grading using the three combined features.
