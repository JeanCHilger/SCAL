The agreement between cervical abnormalities identified by cytology and detection of high-risk types of human papillomavirus. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally associated with cervical cancer. Using the Digene Hybrid Capture 2 high-risk HPV test (HC2), we investigated the prevalence of high-risk HPV in cervical specimens, and compared results with those of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears taken concurrently.Cervical specimens were obtained from women attending hospitals / community health centres in the Western Cape province of South Africa. They were participating in a case-control study of the association of hormonal contraceptives and invasive cervical cancer.Of 1 491 women tested, 254 (17%) were HPV DNA positive. The age-specific prevalence of HPV was 36/97 (37.1%) in those aged < 30 years, 78/369 (21.1%) in those aged 30 - 39 years, 78/603 (12.9%) in those aged 40 - 49 years and 62/422 (14.7%) in those aged 50 - 59 years. In women with normal cytology the prevalence of HPV was 10.9% (138/1 264) in those with abnormal squamous cells of unknown significance (AS-CUS) it was 30.8% (36/117)HC2 detected a high prevalence of HPV (17%) in this population. Most women with HSIL (83%) were positive, indicating that HPV testing of AS-CUS women may aid in management. When costs decrease, HC2 could be introduced as an adjunct to Pap smears in identifying women at risk for high-grade cervical disease and could be useful in the maintenance of cervical health in those who remain Pap smear negative.
