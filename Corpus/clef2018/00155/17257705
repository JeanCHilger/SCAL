Prevalence and distribution of single and multiple HPV infections in cytologically abnormal cervical samples from Italian women. The prevalence of single and multiple HPV infections was assessed over a cohort of 213 women with cytological abnormalities and its association with cervical neoplasia established. Roche linear array HPV genotyping test was used to identify HPV genotypes. The most prevalent HPV genotypes in cervical cancer samples were HPV16 (61.2%), HPV52 (16.1%), HPV18 (12.9%) and HPV 31 (9.6%). Multiple HR and LR HPV infections, comprising between two and 5+ HPV types, were identified in 49.7% of samples, with a significantly lower number in severe dysplasia and cervical cancer samples (p<0.05). These results seem to indicate that detection of multiple HPV infection with HR-HPV types is not significantly better as a predictor of cervical cancer than single HR-HPV infection, though further longitudinal studies are needed to better clarify the relevance of these infections to the progression of cervical neoplasia.
