PAP smear screening among married women living in Osamangazi University ALPU training area. An inquiry including questions about socio-demographic and fecundity properties and covering the knowledge and attitudes of women about Pap smears was applied to 585 women living in Alpu district of Eskisehir, Turkey. Smear specimens were taken from 513 women and colpography was performed before and after acetic acid application with a digital camera. The women who had cervical lesions and/or aceto-white epithelium during the gynecological examination and/or had pathological findings in the smear and/or had suspicious findings at the colpography were invited (n=125, 24.4%) to the Department of Gynecology for colposcopic evaluation. Colposcopy was performed to 77 and biopsies were taken from 40 of the women during colposcopic examination. Of the biopsy specimens, 31 were accepted as benign while 9 were reported as pathology positive, one being high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) and 8 low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL).
