Experimental studies of using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and RT-PCR to detect E6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 16 in cervical carcinoma cell lines. To establish a method of using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and RT-PCR to detect the E6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16).Plasmids containing HPV-16 E6 or E7 were used to generate absolute standard curves. Three cervical carcinoma cell lines CaSki, SiHa and HeLa were tested by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and RT-PCR analyses for the expressions of HPV-16 E6 and E7.The correlation coefficients of standard curves were larger than 0. 99, and the PCR efficiency was more than 90%. The relative levels of HPV-16 E6 and E7 DNA and RNA were CaSki>SiHa>HeLa cell.HPV-16 E6 and E7 quantum by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and RT-PCR analyses may serve as a reliable and sensitive tool. This study provides the possibility of further researches on the relationship between HPV-16 E6 or E7 copy number and cervical carcinoma.
