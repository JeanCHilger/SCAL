Proposal of cervical cancer early detection programme in Croatia. Opportunistic screening by Pap smear was introduced in Croatia in 1950s, with a consequent decrease of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Since 1990s, no further decrease has been observed, and there are still about 370 new cases and 100 deaths of cervical cancer yearly in Croatia. In scope of the proposed early detection programme, all Croatian women aged 25-64 years should be screened. In the first phase of the programme, the target population would be tested by Pap-smear every third year. In the second phase, HPV-testing would also be introduced for women over 30 years. Organization of the programme at county level is proposed, while the evaluation and monitoring would be performed both at county level and centrally. Regarding the present costs of treatment and sick-leave of cervical cancer patients, it is estimated that the introduction of cervical cancer screening programme in Croatia would be cost-effective already after the first decade.
