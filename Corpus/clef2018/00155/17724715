The impact of new technologies in cervical cancer screening: results of the recruitment phase of a large randomised controlled trial from a public health perspective. The decision to introduce liquid-based cytology (LBC) and HPV as screening tests involves criteria based on resource consumption. We used cross-sectional data at recruitment from the NTCC trial [ISRCTN81678807] on 28,000 women aged 35-60, randomised to receive a conventional Pap test or LBC plus HPV. We computed the resources employed to detect a CIN2+ with different screening strategies. In order to result in the same overall cost per CIN2+ detected as screening by conventional cytology, the unit cost of LBC used alone should be less than that of a conventional Pap while its unit cost may be up to 20% higher if HPV-triage for Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance is applied together. With the same criterion the unit cost of HPV used alone may be about 20% higher than that of a Pap-test using a 1 pg/ml cut-off and over 40% higher using a 10 pg/ml cut-off. If HPV testing is applied with cytology-triage, a single HPV test may cost 20-30% more than a conventional Pap to result in the same overall cost per CIN2+ detected.
