Frequency of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and infectious agents for vaginitis in menstrual cycle phase. The study objective was to verify differences in the diagnosis of infectious agents and CIN in cytological smears in the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle.A retrospective study was carried out at the Federal University of "Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro". Presence of Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, clue cells, Doderlein bacilli, cytolytic flora, coccoid bacillus, CIN and HPV were collected from the vaginal cytology tests, cervical and endocervical in healthy women of reproductive age from 1994 to 2004 (about 14,000 in total). The cytologies were divided into two groups: proliferative and secretory phase. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis with the significance level set at less than 0.05.The frequency of cytolysis and candidiasis was higher in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (p < 0.0001). When the presence of CIN associated with vulvovaginitis was evaluated, there was no significant difference in cytologies with CIN between the first and the second phases of the menstrual cycle.Frequency of the cytolytic flora and Candida albicans is influenced by the phase of the menstrual cycle, but CIN is not.
