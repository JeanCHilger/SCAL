Diagnostic value of p16INK4a in squamous intraepithelial lesion in gynecologic cytology. To study the diagnostic value of p16(INK4a) in squamous intraepithelial lesion in gynecologic cytology and its relationship with types of human papillomavirus (HPV).88 liquid-based gynecologic cytology cases with histologic correlation, including 20 cases of cervicitis, 18 cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 34 cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 16 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), were enrolled into the study. Immunocytochemistry for p16(INK4a) protein and polymerase chain reaction-based HPV DNA testing (for HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68, as well as HPV types 6, 11, 42, 43 and 44) were performed.The rate of expression of p16(INK4a) protein was 0, 27.8%, 100% and 100% in the cervicitis group, LSIL group, HSIL group and SCC group, respectively. The expression was significantly higher in the latter 3 groups than that in the cervicitis group (P < 0.01). Besides, the expression was significantly higher in cases associated with high-risk HPV genotypes (96.4%) than in cases associated with low-risk HPV genotypes (7.7%).p16(INK4a) is a valuable biomarker for detection of HPV-related dysplastic squamous cells, with high sensitivity and specificity.
