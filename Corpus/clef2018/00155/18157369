Association between high risk HPV viral load, p16ink4a expression and intra-epithelial cervical lesions. To determine the (HR-HPV) high risk HPV viral load in squamous intra-epithelial lesions and association with p16INK4a expression.A series of 109 cervical biopsies were studied (57 normal tissue, 26 low grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions [LSIL] and 26 high grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions [HSIL]). Detection of high risk HPV and viral load in cervical cells was made by molecular biology using hybrid capture 2nd generation collected before the biopsy. The p16INK4a was identified by immunohistochemistry using the p16INK4a kit (clone E6H4).High risk HPV was positive in 57.8% of all cases (29.8% in normal tissue, 80.8% in LSIL and 96.1% in HSIL). Protein p16INK4a was expressed in 23.8% of squamous intra-epithelial lesions (15.4% in LSIL and 84.6% in HSIL). In normal tissue all cases were negative to p16INK4a. The viral load was higher in p16 positive cases than in negative cases (positive p16INK4a mean of 669.9 RLU/PCB [9.47-2814.9] and negative p16INK4a mean of 253.94 RLU/PCB [1.07-1882.21] (p<0.05). However when studying just the HSIL cases differences were not significant.In this study although the HR-HPV viral load had shown a significant difference between p16 positive and negative cases, in HSIL cases this finding was not confirmed. New studies with a larger number of cases are necessary for consistent conclusions.
