What's new in gynecology and obstetrics?. Among the improvements in gynecology reported in 2007, we highlight those in the field of cervical cancer. A randomized trial showed that HPV testing has higher sensitivity compared to the screening based on Papanicolaou smears. The recent availability of a HPV vaccine is also an important event. In obstetrics, the results of several trials evaluating the administration of progesterone to prevent preterm birth were published. The benefit of the administration of progesterone is still controversial. Prevention of early onset groupe B Streptococcus sepsis might be improved by rapid PCR testing during labor.
