A retrospective clinical study of the treatment of high-grade anal dysplasia by infrared coagulation in a population of HIV-positive men who have sex with men. HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of developing human papillomavirus-associated anal squamous cell cancer. Similar to the management of cervical dysplasia, clinicians are treating high-grade anal dysplasia to prevent progression to cancer. Initial treatments such as cold scalpel excision and electrofulguration have shown limited efficacy in a HIV-positive population. Infrared coagulation (IRC) is an outpatient treatment for high-grade anal dysplasia. This retrospective clinical study reports on 68 HIV-positive MSM with 78 biopsy proven high-grade anal lesions. Each lesion was treated with the IRC with re-biopsy of the treatment site a mean of 140 days later. Of the 74 evaluable lesions 39 had anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 1, 20 had AIN 2, seven had AIN 3, and eight had normal epithelium. The IRC showed 64% efficacy per treated lesion and shows promise as a treatment modality for high-grade anal dysplasia in this population.
