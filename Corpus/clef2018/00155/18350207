'Look and Lletz'--a Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital experience. An audit was undertaken of a 'colposcopy and treatment' clinic between April 2003 and December 2006, to determine: (i) the frequency of overtreatment with Papanicolaou smear on its own, colposcopy on its own or a combination of the two methods (ii) differences in overtreatment between patients who are HIV positive and those who are HIV negativeAn analysis of the data from the colposcopy clinic database of patients, who were referred according to national guidelines.Patients who are referred to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.Normal histology was found in 1.3% of patients, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1 or human papillomavirus (HPV) in 8.4%. The overall complication rate was 3%.The high loss to follow-up and the low early complication rate together with an acceptable overtreatment rate make this a justifiable approach in our situation. HIV-negative women were more likely to be overtreated than HIV-positive patients(p=0.03).
