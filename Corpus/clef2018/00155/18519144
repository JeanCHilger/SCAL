The E6E7 oncoproteins of cutaneous human papillomavirus type 38 interfere with the interferon pathway. Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most frequent malignancy in Caucasian populations. Evidence suggests the involvement of cutaneous Human Papillomavirus (HPV) of the genus beta (beta) in this disease. The ability of E6 and E7 of mucosal HPV to promote cellular transformation and inhibit immune response-related pathways plays a key role in cervical carcinogenesis. beta HPV-38 E6 and E7 display transforming activities in in vitro and in vivo models, but their impact on immune surveillance is unknown. Here we show that HPV-38 E6 and E7 affect the IFN-induced up-regulation of MHC class I. Expression of the two viral proteins in HaCaT keratinocytes led to a decrease of MHC I levels. This down-regulation is associated with a reduction of expression of MHC I heavy chain, of the peptide chaperone TAP and of the STAT-1 downstream effector IRF-1. The down-regulation of these proteins is ultimately due to the inhibition of STAT-1 expression. Analysis of cells expressing either HPV-38 E6 or E7 suggests that these effects are primarily the result of E6 expression, although a contribution by E7 cannot be excluded. We conclude that HPV-38 encodes oncoproteins that potentially contribute to the evasion of host immune surveillance.
