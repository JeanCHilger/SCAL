Cost-effectiveness of conventional cytology and HPV DNA testing for cervical cancer screening in Colombia. To assess cost-effectiveness of conventional cytology and HPV DNA testing for cervical-cancer screening in Colombia.The National Cancer Institute of Colombia (NCIC) in 2007 developed a Markov model on the natural history of cervical cancer no screening, conventional cytology, and HPV DNA testing were compared. Only direct costs were used. Outcomes comprise cervical cancer mortality, years of life saved, and lifetime costs. Discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated and sensitivity analyses were conducted for key parameters.Depending on the screening strategy a 69-81% mortality reduction might be expected. The HPV DNA testing every five years is a cost-effective strategy (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER): USD$44/YLS) if the cost per test is under USD$31. The effectiveness was sensitive to coverage and primarily to follow-up.HPV DNA testing is a cost-effective alternative for screening in Colombia. Not only high coverage but high follow-up rates are critical for successful screening programs.
