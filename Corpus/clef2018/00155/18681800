Predictors of seropositivity to human papillomavirus type 53: one of the most prevalent high risk-related cervical human papillomaviruses. Persistent cervicovaginal infection with high-risk types of HPV is the major risk factor for subsequent cervical neoplasia. HPV53, part of the alpha 6 species group along with HPV types 30, 56, and 66, is one of the most prevalent high risk-related HPV types, yet little is known about the molecular basis of its benign behavior. We generated and utilized HPV53 virus-like particles (VLPs) to investigate risk factors for its seroprevalence in a population of young college women. Seropositivity to HPV53 VLPs was determined using a polymer-based ELISA to measure IgG reactive antibodies. Cervicovaginal cells were collected for HPV DNA detection and typing by MY09/11 PCR. A questionnaire queried for HPV risk factors to estimate odds ratios (ORs). Prevalence of cervicovaginal HPV DNA was 26% (n = 148) 3% of women (n = 17) had HPV53 DNA and 7% (n = 40) were seropositive to HPV53. Seroprevalence of IgG to HPV53 VLPs in women with cervicovaginal HPV53, HPV53-related types (HPV30, 55, and 66), other HPV types, and no HPV was 41%, 11%, 7%, and 6%, respectively (p(trend) < 0.001). Risk factors independently associated with HPV53 VLP seropositivity included use of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (OR: 4
