Persistence and clearance of human papillomavirus infection: a prospective cohort study. The objective of the study was to identify epidemiological correlates for persistence and clearance of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.Cervical smears collected in a prospective cohort study to perform Papanicoloau cytology and HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection at baseline and during the follow-up. Outcomes analyzed were: (1) persistence of HPV DNA (2) conversionAmong 501 women the incidence of HPV was 12.3%. Thirty-four women were persistently infected with HPV, which was associated with age below 21 years at first intercourse and 4 or more sexual partners during their lifetime. In a median of 19 months, 80.7% of women had clearance of HPV, which was associated with black race, coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis at baseline, and a history of previous Papanicoloau smear.Strategies for sexual orientation may modify the rates of HPV persistence. The association of HPV clearance with a history of previous Papanicolaou smear screening highlights the importance of improving cervical screening programs. Further studies on the association of gynecological infections with HPV clearance are needed.
