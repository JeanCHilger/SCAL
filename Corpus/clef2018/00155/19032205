Cervical cancer risk factors and predictors of cervical dysplasia among women in south-west Nigeria. This study identified predictors of cervical dysplasia and assessed the prevalence of risk factors for cervical cancer among women of different socioeconomic classes in Ogun State, Nigeria.In a two-phase study, self-reported information on cervical cancer awareness, risk factors and cervical cancer screening practices was obtained from 278 randomly selected working women. A random subset was screened for dysplasia using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA).Of the 278 women, 126 (45.3%) were semi-skilled while 152 (54.7%) were skilled and professional workers. Median age at first sexual intercourse was 19 years (range 13-29) and lower than the median age at first marriage (25 years). Gonorrhoea and genital warts were the commonest reported sexually transmitted infections. Only 12.2% of the women used male condoms as their primary method of birth control and 4.7% of the women had ever had a Papanicolaou smear, a practice that was significantly higher among the professional/skilled compared with semi-skilled workers (P = 0.031). Of the 125 screened, 20 (16%) had positive VIA. Young age at first sex (< or = 17 years) (OR = 3.7 (95% CI, 1.07-12.8)) and early first marriage (< 25 years) (3.3 (1.00-10.9)) were associated with a positive VIA. Women with lower parity (0-3) had borderline significantly increased risk of having a positive VIA (3.1 (0.9-10.6)). Women currently over 34 years and those without a history of sexually transmitted infections had lower risk of positive VIA (P > 0.05).Acceptable screening services and cervical cancer awareness campaigns that address modifiable risk factors are urgently needed in this community.
