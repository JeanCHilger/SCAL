Typing of human papillomavirus in women with cervical lesions: prevalence and distribution of different genotypes. Human papillomavirus (HPV) are distributed widely and persistent infection with high-risk (HR) HPV is recognized as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of different HR-HPV genotypes in 199 women with cervical pre-invasive lesions undergoing conservative treatment. A Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test was used to identify individual HPV genotypes in cervical samples. It was observed that the most prevalent HPV genotypes were HPV 16 (52.6%), HPV 51 (13.5%), and HPV 31 (10.9%) HPV 18 was found in 7.3% of the patients. Stratifying the different HPV genotypes according to the severity of the cervical lesion, a strong association between the increasing severity of the histological diagnosis and the detection of more carcinogenic HR-HPV type was found, and in all but one cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 3 the presence of at least one HR-HPV could be detected, with more than 70% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 3 patients bearing HPV 16. Multiple infections, comprising between 2 and 6 HPV types, were found in 43% of patients
