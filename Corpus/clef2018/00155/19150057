Prevalence of HPV infection by cervical cytologic status in Brazil. To assess the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection according to cervical cytologic status in northeastern Brazil identify other risk factors for low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs and HSILs)Two cervical smears were collected from 250 women referred for cancer screening, one for cytologic examination and the other to test for the presence of HPV by PCR with genotyping by dot blot hybridization.There were 110 healthy cervices, 82 LSILs, and 58 HSILs. The overall HPV prevalence was 48%, with higher rates for HSILs, and HPV-16 was the most prevalent type. Age, multiple sexual partners, type of HPV present, smoking, and early onset of sexual activity were risk factors for cervical lesions.Age, multiple sexual partners, and infection with HPV-16 increased the risk of having LSILs or HSILs. Early onset of sexual activity and smoking only increased the risk of having HSILs.
