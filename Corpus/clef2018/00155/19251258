HPV infection among women in a representative rural and suburban population of the USA. To study the prevalence of low-risk and high-risk HPV genotypes in a largely suburban, non-Hispanic, white female population of the USA, and to determine the positive predictive value of one-occasion HPV detection and genotyping using high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology as the endpoint for clinical evaluation.HPV DNA present in liquid-based cytology specimens collected by gynecologists in private practice was amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction. HPV DNA was validated by signature DNA sequencing for accurate genotyping.Of 2633 specimens, 278 were positive for HPV DNA of any genotype. Among 255 single HPV infections, the most prevalent genotype was HPV-16 (n=50 19.6%), followed by HPV-52 (n=24DNA sequencing is a useful method for increasing the specificity of HPV genotyping as an aid to follow persistent high-risk HPV infections to reduce excessive colposcopies in populations with low cancer prevalence.
