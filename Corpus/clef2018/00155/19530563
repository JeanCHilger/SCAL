Uterine cervical cancer screening in Japan: today and future. Despite the proven effectiveness of cytological uterine cervical cancer screening, the consultation rate for cancer screening in Japan is markedly low in comparison with other developed countries. Although the mortality of this cancer has been steadily decreasing, it has been on the rise in the recent several years. It is evident that human papillomavirus (HPV) is involved in the occurrence of uterine cervical cancer, and, because of changes in sexual awareness and the diversification of sexual behavior, the increase in the incidence of uterine cervical cancer, especially among young adults, has become a major social problem. There is a false negative rate of about 10% in cytological uterine cervical cancer screening, seen mostly in cervical adenocarcinoma cases. As there is a limit to the effectiveness of cancer screening by cytology alone, there is a movement in Japan to increase the accuracy of cytological screening by using liquid-based cytology (LBC) and adopting HPV testing. There are various problems in cytological cancer screening, but the national and local governments, medical institutions, companies, and educational institutions must have an accurate understanding of the current situation and take an assertive approach in order to decrease the mortality rate of uterine cervical cancer.
