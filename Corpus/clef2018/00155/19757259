Urine HPV-DNA detection for cervical cancer screening: prospects and prejudices. Oncogenic types of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) have been established to be the causative agents for cervical cancers and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). The clinical application of molecular tests for HPV detection for screening purposes has been of considerable interest. DNA amplification methods allow the use of self-collected samples (including urine) from material collected away from the original disease site. For screening of cervical pathology, detection of HPV-DNA in urine would be useful only if it represents cervical HPV infection and/or HPV-related cervical pathology. We conducted a review of the literature in order to ascertain: (1) if urine is an adequate sample for HPV-detection (2) whether sensitive techniques are available for HPV-detection in urine and (3) if detection of HPV in urine truly represents cervical infection/pathology. The review process consisted of assembling facts and analysing the published literature on the following facts: anatomical considerations of the lower genital and the lower urinary tract, biological behaviour of HPV and its shedding behaviour, technical issues regarding sample collection, processing and HPV-DNA assay systems, concordance rates of HPV-DNA detection and their type specificity in the paired samples (urine and cervical scrapes) obtained in different clinico-epidemiological settings and comparative detection rates of HSILs in the paired samples.
