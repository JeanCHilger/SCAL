Outcomes from a mass media campaign to promote cervical screening in NSW, Australia. Despite the decline in the incidence of cervical cancer in Australia as a result of population screening, a substantial proportion of women in NSW screen less regularly than the recommended two-yearly interval or do not screen. With higher rates of cervical cancer in unscreened and underscreened women, and despite the introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccine, there remains a need to continue to remind women to screen. The mass media has been shown to be effective at improving participation in cervical screening. A 2007 television advertising campaign to promote cervical screening in New South Wales (NSW) was examined.Data from the NSW Papanicolaou (Pap) Test Register were used to compare weekly numbers of Pap tests for NSW overall and in metropolitan local government areas with low screening rates by age group and by time since the last Pap test. Time series regression analysis incorporating seasonal effects was used to estimate the strength of the association between screening and the media campaign.Overall during the advertising campaign, 15% more screens (16 700) occurred than expected for 2007 without the advertising campaign. Increases were evident among unscreened and underscreened women, with little overscreening occurring. Women living in low screening areas also showed a significant increase in mean weekly screens of 21% (388) over that expected in the absence of the media campaign.Despite the ecological nature of this study, the mass media campaign appears to have been successful in increasing screening in unscreened and underscreened women in NSW.
