Assessing the acceptability of self-sampling for HPV among Haitian immigrant women: CBPR in action. To determine whether pairing self-sampling for HPV with community health workers (CHWs) is a culturally acceptable method for cervical cancer screening among Haitian immigrant women residing in Little Haiti, the predominately Haitian neighborhood in Miami, FL.As part of a larger, ongoing community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative in Little Haiti, Haitian CHWs recruited 246 eligible women to this study. Participants provided self-collected cervical specimens for HPV testing and answered a series of questions about their experience with self-sampling for HPV.The vast majority of women (97.6%) was comfortable using the self-sampler at home, would recommend this screening method to their friends and/or family members (98.4%), and described the sampler as easy to use (95.1%). Additionally, 97% of all self-collected specimens were deemed adequate for HPV testing.When paired with CHWs, who are of Haitian descent and well respected in Little Haiti, self-sampling is a highly acceptable method of cervical screening for Haitian women in this ethnic enclave. This approach addresses critical access barriers, including poverty, language difficulties, and sociocultural concerns about modesty, that may similarly affect Pap smear utilization among other immigrant or medically underserved population sub-groups. Coupled with generally positive reviews of the device, the low rate of insufficient specimens for testing suggests that this device is promising for use in non-clinical settings.
