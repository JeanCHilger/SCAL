Papillary squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix: human papillomavirus-dependent changes in cell cycle expression and cytologic features. Most human papillomavirus-associated squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix are flat some have papillary architecture that shows a spectrum of differentiation from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. For this subset of lesions, there are few data relating human papillomavirus type to cytology and cell cycle activity. Here, we collected 24 cases of papillary squamous intraepithelial lesions with either low-risk (15 cases) or high-risk (9 cases) human papillomavirus infection. We described their morphology and performed immunohistochemical staining with cell cycle-related markers Ki-67, p53, pRb, and P16INK4a. The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly lower in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (P < .001). A cut point of less than 50% labeling index detected all but one low-risk group case. Degradation of p53 and pRb was less evident in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group (p53, P < .001
