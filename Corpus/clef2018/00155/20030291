Diagnostic-therapeutic guidelines for men whose partners have HPV genital infection. Human papilloma virus infection is the most frequent sexually transmitted disease. HPV infections are connected with different diseases such as benign warts, condylomata acuminata, malignant cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile and anal carcinoma. Peniscopy with HPV detection is a specific diagnostic method for diagnosis of subclinical HPV genital infection in asymptomatic men. Taking the samples for HPV detection from asymptomatic men with curette is more qualitative way of getting enough samples then taking swab with wooden stick or (tongue) depressor. Early diagnosis and treatment of HPV infections in men is of potential benefit because their eradication can reduce the viral reservoir and as the result of that the incidence of CIN, carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical carcinoma can be reduced. For the correct diagnosis and for choosing the adequate therapeutical technique, we suggest diagnostic-therapeutic guidelines for HPV genital infection in men.
