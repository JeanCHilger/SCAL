Women's knowledge of HPV and their perceptions of physician educational efforts regarding HPV and cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) was one of the most common sexually transmitted infections in women of child-bearing age in the US. It was estimated that nearly three out of every four American women between the ages of 15 and 49 would be infected with genital HPV over the course of their lifetime. Human papillomavirus was present in almost 100% of cervical cancers. Despite this growing epidemic, there was little knowledge and awareness of HPV among the general public. HPV was most often detected in abnormal Pap test results. However, women undergoing Pap tests lacked basic knowledge about HPV testing, abnormal results, and follow-up procedures. The purpose of this study was to determine women's knowledge of HPV and their perceptions of the education they received from their physician regarding the reason for a Pap test, explanation of Pap test results, and how effectively the physician explained associations between HPV and cell abnormalities, cervical cancer, risk factors, and preventive measures. A survey containing 33 questions was completed by 109 primarily professional women. Based on the data collected in this study it seems that physicians were not routinely providing HPV information to their female patients. Women reported their physicians were not educating them on testing for HPV and cervical cancer, risk factors associated with contracting HPV, and preventive measures associated with HPV. Younger physicians were more likely to discuss these topics with women than older physicians. Single women also reported more discussion with their physician on these topics than married women.
