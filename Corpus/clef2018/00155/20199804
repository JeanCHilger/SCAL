Prevalence and distribution of human papillomavirus types in cervical cancer, squamous intraepithelial lesions, and with no intraepithelial lesions in women from Southern Mexico. This study was to establish the frequency of HPV infection and which HPV types are circulating in women with cervical cancer (CC), with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), and with no intraepithelial lesion (non-IL) from the State of Guerrero in Southern Mexico. Additionally, we investigated the frequency and distribution of HPV 16 intratypic variants found in this population.This cross-sectional study was conducted in 4150 women who attended five public health centers seeking cytological screening or for gynecological complaints. Pap smears or biopsies, as appropriate, were obtained for cytological and/or histological diagnosis. HPV detection was done by MY09/11 and GP5+/GP6+ PCR systems and typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism or DNA sequencing. HPV 16 variants were also analyzed.HPV was found in 100% of CC, 83.5% in HSIL, 94.5% in LSIL, and 40.9% in non-IL. HR-HPV was the most frequent in all groups. HPV 16 was the most commonly identified HPV genotype in CC and HSIL. HPV 33 was the most frequent in LSIL and non-IL. The highest HPV prevalence was found in the youngest women, HR-HPV and HPV 16 were more frequent in women less than 25 years and more than 55 years of age. The HPV 16 variants E, AA-a and AA-c were found, AA-c was found only in CC.This study contributes to the knowledge of regional prevalence of HPV types in the whole spectrum of disease, which can be useful in the application of prophylactic vaccines against HPV and in the viral screening methods.
