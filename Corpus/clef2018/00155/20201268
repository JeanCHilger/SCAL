Cross-sectional epidemiological research on genital and breast cancers in the North-East region of Romania. The genitals and breast cancers takes an important place in the women's pathology, either through the increase numbers of cases and also through the mortality induced by these cases.The descriptive evaluation of the genitals and breast cancers and there risk factors to women from North-Eastern region of Romania.We have been included in the study 105 women (age range 23-77 years, mean 53,77) diagnosed with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and cervical cancer at the hospital admission, residency in the "Cuza Vodă" Iaşi Hospital--Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic (I, II, and IV Gynecologic Clinics) and "Elena Doamna" Iaşi Hospital--Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic (III Gynecologic Clinics) within 11 months.

The following parameters were assessed: marital status, educational level, age at menarche, age at the first sexual contact, age at first birth, parity, spontaneous abortions, period of breast-feeding, menopausal status, age at menopause, family history of cancers, personal history of gynecologic diseases, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy use, environmental exposures, Pap test. After data collection, these have been codified and included in a MS Excel Database, in order to be processed with SPSS 13 and EpiInfo 3.4.3. (2007) softwares.The following cases' repartition on diagnostic types was observed: breast cancer (41 cases), cervical cancer (24 cases), endometrial cancer (12 cases) and ovarian cancer (7 cases). The cases mean of age was 56.22 years for breast cancer, 46.29 for cervical cancer, 59.75 for endometrial cancer and 54.86 for ovarian cancer. In our study, the most affected range of age was 50-59 years for breast cancer (p = 0,00033), 40-49 years for cervical cancer (p = 0,00257), 60-69 years for endometrial cancer (p = 0,211) and 50-59 years for ovarian cancer (p = 0.032). A significant correlation was observed between types of neoplasia and obesity (division by 2 = 25.277, p = 0.046), HPV infection (chi2 = 47.49, p = 0,022), stage (chi = 88.27, p = 0,010) and between age and diagnostic (chi2 = 252.15, p = 0.00017). From 84 cases, 10 have presented ASCUS lesions, 7 HGSIL, 4 carcinoma, 3 LGSIL and 1 AGCUS lesions.The diagnostic, educational level, age at first birth over 30 years was directly correlated with histological types. In our study, the mains factors correlated with types of neoplasia were obesity, HPV infections, stage and age.
