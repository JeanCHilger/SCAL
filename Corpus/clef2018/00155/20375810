The frequency of human papillomavirus infection in polish patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. Vulvar cancer is a rare condition representing about 4% of all female genital tract tumors. In contrast to the established relationship of virtually all cervical cancer cases with the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the reported HPV positivity in vulvar carcinoma ranges widely.Using the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test, we investigated the HPV incidence in a group of 46 Polish patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (age range, 37-93 years median age, 70.2 years) in clinical stages T1-2, N0-2, and M0.The presence of HPV DNA was confirmed in 7 of 46 (15%) primary tumor samples. HPV 16 was found in 5 tumors (71%). HPVs 6 and 58 were detected in the remaining 2 cases of virus-associated tumors.We conclude that a fraction of cancers of vulva associated with HPV is insignificant, given the HPV prevalence of 8.6% in the Polish population aged 55 to 59 years (the oldest cohort of Polish women studied to date).
