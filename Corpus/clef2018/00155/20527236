Epidemiological modelling of risk factors of human papilloma virus in women with positive cytology in the county of Csongr√°d. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and risk factors of genital HPV infection in women diagnosed with non-negative cytology in Southeastern Hungary. Cervical samples were collected for cytology and HPV testing from women seen at gynaecological outpatient clinics and diagnosed with non-negative cytology. The observed overall average HPV infection rate was found to be 61%. A smoking habit was the only risk factor in the logistic regression analysis that related significantly to exposure to HPV infection. Thus, prevention strategies should focus on the regular clinical cytological screening of HPV-infected patients and on the reduction of smoking.
