MDM2 SNP 309 human papillomavirus infection in cervical carcinogenesis. To investigate the biological significance of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at murine double-minute 2 homolog (MDM2) promoter 309 in cervical carcinogenesis.SNP at MDM2 promoter 309 (T/G) together with human papillomavirus (HPV) types was examined in a total of 195 cervical smear samples and 8 human cervical squamous carcinoma cell lines using two independent PCR assays and PCR-RFLP techniques.Forty-one patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) had higher frequency of high-risk HPV than 102 with low-grade SIL (LSIL) and 52 controls. There was an increased OR (8.88 CI=2.34-33.63MDM2-SNP309 (T/G) and high-risk HPV infection may be closely associated with cervical carcinogenesis in a Japanese population.
