The impact of precancerous cervical lesions on functioning at work and work productivity. To assess the work performance and productivity impact of human papillomavirus (HPV).A cross-sectional study compared 94 employed women with clinically significant HPV-related cervical lesions with 118 healthy controls. Data were collected by self-administered web-based questionnaire. At-work performance limitations and productivity loss (presenteeism) and absenteeism were measured. Univariate and multivariate case-control group and clinical subgroup differences were tested.Based on adjusted mean scores, the HPV group had significantly more at-work limitations and productivity loss than controls (P = 0.009), higher absence rates (P = 0.002), and significantly more productivity loss because of absences (P = 0.007). At-work limitations varied in association with martial status (P = 0.025) at-work productivity loss was associated with years of education (P = 0.039).HPV is costly for working women, their employers, and the economy.
