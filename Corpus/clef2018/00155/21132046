Survey among female university students on HPV infection epidemiology and prevention. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. The vaccine has the maximum benefit when given before starting sexual activity and its efficacy is proved also in sexually active women in which the incidence of the infection is higher. In 2010 a questionnaire on HPV was administered to 299 female students of University of Rome Tor Vergata. The results compared with those obtained in a similar 2007-08 survey, and with international data, showed that knowledge about HPV is still low, with a negative impact on the acceptance of specific preventive measures.
