Type-specific human papillomavirus distribution in invasive cervical cancer in Korea, 1958-2004. To describe the HPV genotype distribution and to investigate the underlying secular trend in the relative contribution of HPV types 16-18 in invasive cervical cancer (ICC) over a period of 47 years (1958-2004) in South Korea.Paraffin embedded ICC samples were obtained from historical archives of two hospitals in Korea. HPV detection and genotyping was performed by SPF10 PCR, DEIA and LiPA25 assays (version 1).Of 874 ICC cases, 742 were considered suitable for HPV DNA testing after histological evaluation. Squamous cell carcinoma was the major histological type (93.0%). HPV was detected in 674 of the 742 specimens (90.8%). The five most common types identified as single types among HPV-positive cases were HPV16 (63.1%), HPV18 (8.5%), HPV33 (4.5%), HPV58 (3.9%) and HPV31 (3.0%). Multiple infections were detected in 5%. HPV16-18 together accounted for 72% of all HPV-positive cervical cancers with no statistically significant differences by time at diagnosis (adjusted model-p>0.05).This present study confirmed the role of HPV infection as the main factor in cervical cancer in Korea. HPV16-18 accounted for more than 70% in cervical cancer and there was no statistically significant secular trend for the past 50 years.
