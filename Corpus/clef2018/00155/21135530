Comparison of self-collected and clinician-collected materials for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus genotyping: analysis by linear array assay. This study compared the usefulness of self-collected (SC) and clinician-collected (CC) materials for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping.Fifty women with previous positive cytology and who were undergoing regular checkups were included in the study. CC samples were collected using a Cervex-Brush Combi with liquid-based cytology. One month later, SC material was acquired using the Rovers Viba-brush vaginal sampler, and fixed at home. Thin-layer specimens were prepared from both samples and HPV status was analyzed using a linear array.A total of 37/50 CC (74%) and 41/50 SC (82%) cases were positive for HPV. Pap tests identified high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 11 (22%) and seven (14%) patients, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 19 (38%) and 16 (32%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance in 2 (4%) and 0 patients, and NILM (negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy) in 18 (36%) and 27 (54%) patients in the CC and SC groups, respectively.SC material had a lower positive cytology rate, but a higher HPV-positive rate than CC material. These results suggest that a combination of Pap and HPV tests on SC material may provide a diagnostic strategy with high sensitivity and specificity.
