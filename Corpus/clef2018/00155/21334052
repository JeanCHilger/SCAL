HPV-18 is a poor prognostic factor, unlike the HPV viral load, in patients with stage IB-IIA cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy. This study was conducted to determine the prognostic significance of the human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype using the HPV DNA chip (HDC) test and the HPV viral load by the hybrid capture II assay (HC2) in FIGO stage IB-IIA cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy.Between January 2001 and December 2005, 204 consecutive patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB1-IIA cervical cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for covariates were used for analyses and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the HPV viral load in predicting disease progression.Of the 204 cases, the HDC was positive in 195 (95.6%) and the HC2 was positive in 192 (94.1%). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 78.4%. On multivariate analysis, HPV-18 positivity was an independent prognostic factor predictive for disease progression. The risk of recurrence was higher for HPV-18 positivity (hazard ratio=2.664 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.437-4.938The HPV-18 genotype is a reliable prognostic factor of early-stage cervical cancer however, the HPV viral load may not be helpful in predicting disease prognosis.
