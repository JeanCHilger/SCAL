HPV vaccine acceptability among women in the Philippines. To examine attitudes toward and acceptability of HPV vaccination among a community-based sample of women in the Philippines.Self-administered surveys were completed by 435 adult women. Intent to receive the HPV vaccine was assessed at low, moderate, and high vaccine price through responses on Likert scale items. The theory-grounded survey assessed attitudinal correlates, as well as sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related characteristics.Over half of the sample (54%) was accepting of HPV vaccination at the low price, but only 30% and 31% were accepting at the moderate and high price, respectively. Negative intent to receive the vaccine was significantly associated with women's indication that their mothers or partners were influential in their vaccination decisions. Perceived social support, access to transportation, perceived benefits of vaccination, perceived susceptibility to HPV, history of pap testing, and having been exposed to vaccine-promoting media were among factors independently associated with positive intent to receive the vaccine.HPV vaccine acceptance among Filipina women is contingent on affordable pricing. A successful vaccine initiative in the region must minimize structural barriers, foster familial and social support for vaccination, incorporate HPV education, and work within cultural norms.
