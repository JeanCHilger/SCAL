HPV and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions: clinicopathological study. The aim of our study is to determine the evidence of HPV infection, by either HPV-DNA test or histopathological examination, in patients with abnormal PAP-smear, for further clinical management. In 6-month period, we retrospectively selected a number of 103 patients in 16-54 years range of age that were investigated by complex diagnostic techniques supporting the evidence of HPV infection. Initially, these patients were evaluated cytological using the Bethesda system for PAP-smear interpretation along with colposcopic examination. A number of these patients were orientated to HPV testing (PCR) or to biopsy with histopathological diagnostic intent. The net predominance of LSIL over HSIL cytodiagnostic class parallels with that of condyloma and CIN1 over CIN2 and CIN3 histodiagnostic and suggests that progression to high-grade intraepithelial squamous lesion is rare and the HPV infection remain mainly transitory. On the other side, the incidence and distribution of HPV types in cervical infections are high variable and may change over time, the cytological screening of sexual active female population remaining the most practical tool in detection of genital HPV infection.
