Markers of human T lymphotropic virus type I in patients with cancer of uterine cervix in Amazon, Brazil. Human T lymphotropic virus type I(HTLV-I) has been implicated in various human diseases. Serum samples of 390 Brazilian Amazonians with cancer of various types were tested for HTLV-I antibodies by Gelatin particle agglutination test, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. Of 134 sera from patients with cancer of uterine cervix, 4 were positive by all the methods. Three of these were from non-transfused patients. DNA was extracted from 2 of 4 seropositive sera that gave strong reactions and were analyzed by PCR-SSCP for HTLV-I sequences. One was positive for all HTLV-I genes tested while the other one was positive for LTR and tax and negative for gag. In view of a possible pathway of the virus by sexual contact, the involvement of HTLV-I in cervical cancer warrants further studies.
