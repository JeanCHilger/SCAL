Detection of la-1 oncogene in paraffin-embedded cervical-cancer tissues by polymerase chain-reaction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology was used to identify the LA-1 oncogene in cervical cancer cell lines and paraffin embedded tissues. In addition to the products of anticipated size, a 400 bp fragment homologous to the LA-1 oncogene was amplified from 44% of low grade SIL and 60% of invasive cancer tissue. The 400 bp fragment was not amplified from tissues diagnosed as chronic cervicitis, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection or erythema multiforme. It is suggested that PCR with LA-1 oncogene primers may be a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for the detection of the SIL patient at high risk of developing cervical cancer.
