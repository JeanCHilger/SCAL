Relationship between nitric oxide in cervical microenvironment and different HPV types and effect on cervical cancer cells. To study the relationship between nitric oxide within cervical microenvironment and different HPV types as well as the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide donor, on the proliferation and apoptosis of cervical cancer cell lines.HPV typing test was assessed from 115 women by using high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) 21 typing test and the release of cervical nitric oxide (NO) was assessed as nitrate, nitrite in cervical fluid. Cervical NO was then compared between women showing different HPV types. Proliferation of Caski and HeLa cervical cells was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry after 24 hours treated by different final concentration of SNP (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mmol/L, respectively). The expressions of HPV E6, E7 gene mRNA and p53 protein were detected by SYBR Green I quantitative real-time PCR and western blot.(1) The cervical NO release of women with HR-HPV was higher compared to that in HPV negative women [(47.6±1.4) µmol/L vs (22.8±0.3) µmol/L P<0.05]The presence of HR-HPV is associated with an increased release of NO in the human uterine cervix NO could inhibit the growth and proliferation and enhance the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells, inhibit the expression of HPV18 E6, E7 mRNA in HeLa cells and activate the expression of p53 protein, the mechanism may be due to higher sensitivity of HeLa cells (cervical adenocarcinoma cell) to SNP. The increasing release of NO may play a role in regulating the elimination of HPV in cervical microenvironment, which is a part of mucous membrane immunity.
