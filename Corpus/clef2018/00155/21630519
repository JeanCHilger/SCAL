The role of human papillomavirus typization and cytology in early detection of relapse of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Female patients who underwent ceratin treatment forms of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are at five times greater risk for disease relapse in comparison to the rest of female population. The aim of the study was to investigate validity of human papillomavirus (HPV) typization and cytology in detection of relapse. METHODS The prospective clinical investigation included 35 patients with relapse and 30 ones without it after adequate treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV typization using PCR methods and cytological test (conventional Pap smear) were performed in all the patients. Validation of tests applied was performed by determining their sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value.More severe degrees of CIN relapse occur significantly more often in patients which remain HPV positive despite of the treatment. The patients which remain positive on HPV type 18 or, on both HPV types 18 and 16, have more often CIN relapses of more severe degree in relation to those just positive on HPV type 16. HPV typization has higher predictive value for diagnosis of the rezidual disease in older patients. Sensitivity of HPV typization for diagnosis all CIN relapse degrees is 68.57%, for more severe degrees (HSIL and MIC) 90.47%, specificity is 93.33%, while positive and negative predictive values are 90.47% and 93.53%, respectively. Sensitivity of cytology for diagnosis of more severe CIN relapses is 80.95%. HPV typization used along with cytology ofters the highest sensitivity (95.23%).Both tests, HPV typization and Pap smear, offer satisfactory sensitivity and high specificity in detection of relapse, parcticularly those with more severe degree. The highest sensitivity in detection of CIN relapse is obtained by using both tests.
