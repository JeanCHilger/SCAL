PCR study of a series of ASCUS cases HPV-positive by HCII. Most guidelines currently recommend the testing of human papillomavirus (HPV) in ASCUS cases. The most used method for this purpose is Hybrid Capture II (HCII), but PCR techniques with GP5+/6+ primers can be also applied. Furthermore, the HCII high-risk probe test for detection of HPV shows cross-reactivity with low-risk HPV. Although this cross-reactivity has been studied in screening populations, it has received little attention in ASCUS cases. To compare the performance of the HCII high-risk probe test and PCR for the detection of HPV in ASCUS cases. We randomly selected 83 ASCUS cases that were positive for high-risk HPV by HCII and applied the PCR test using MYO9-11 and GP5+/6+ primers to samples from these cases. Our results show cross-reactivity with low-risk HPV in 25.3% (21/83) of the HCII+ PCR+ cases. Regarding the follow-up our results emphasize the importance of HPV typing, especially for HPV 16 infection. We propose the use of PCR techniques using GP5+/6+ consensus primers for the screening of HPV in ASCUS.
