Performance of the New INNO-LiPA HPV extra to genotype human papillomavirus in cervical cell specimens. It was our aim to compare the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra (LiPA Innogenetics) versus the Linear Array test (LAOne hundred cervical samples were selected, obtained from a cancer prevention center. All samples were human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA positive by Hybrid Capture 2 HPV test and genotyped by LA HPV genotyping test. All data were analyzed using Cohen's κ tests. κ values ranged from poor, fair, moderate and good to very good agreement strength.Detection of multiple infection and HPV genotypes per sample was higher by LA than by LiPA (61.5 vs. 52.1 and 2.2 vs. 1.7%, respectively). There were concordant results in 65 samples and compatible results in 33 samples. Only 2 samples were considered as discordant. In 21 samples, additional types were detected by LA, and in 13 samples, additional types were detected by LiPA. Analyzing the κ values, we have found very good agreement for 14 genotypes (6, 16, 26, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, 53, 58, 66, 68 and 70).We considered that the new LiPA is highly comparable with other methods and suitable for clinical and epidemiological studies.
