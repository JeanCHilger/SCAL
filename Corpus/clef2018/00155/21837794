High prevalence of BK polyomavirus sequences in human papillomavirus-16-positive precancerous cervical lesions. High- and low-grade cervical lesions were analyzed for the presence of polyomavirus (PYV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences. In precancerous cervical lesions, the overall prevalence of PYV sequences was 44% (41/93). Specifically, among the PYV-positive samples, 83% (34/41) tested positive for BK polyomavirus (BKV) sequences, whereas 17% (7/41) were positive for JC-virus. None of the samples were positive for simian virus 40. The presence of BKV DNA in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was confirmed by in situ PCR. BKV sequences were detected more frequently in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, together with the genotype HPV-16. The association of BKV with precancerous cervical lesions suggests that this polyomavirus participates with HPV-16 in the cell transformation process. Alternatively, BKV might multiply better in HPV-16-positive cells from precancerous cervical lesions than in HPV-16-negative cells.
