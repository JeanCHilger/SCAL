Study for association between high risk human papillomavirus and cervical lesions in the samples from opportunistic screening. To investigate the association between HPV genotypes and cervical lesion in Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV test positive samples.602 cervical samples randomly obtained detected as HPV positive by the HC2 high-risk probe cocktail were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-reverse dot blot (RDB), among them 344 participated Thinprep Cytology test.569 (94.5%) samples were successfully amplified. The most common HPV genotypes were HPV16 (31.6%), 52 (16.7%), 58 (15.1%), 56 (8.1%), 39 (7.9%) HPV16 or HPV16/18 infection was significantly related to ASCUS, LSIL and HSILThe most common HPV genotypes in random screening were HPV16, 52 and HPV58 Our data demonstrated the pseudo-positivity of HC2 test was 4.0%
