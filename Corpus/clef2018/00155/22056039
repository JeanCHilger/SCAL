Florid reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (lymphoma-like lesion) of the uterine cervix. Lymphoma-like lesion (LLL) of the female genital tract is an older term in the literature that describes a florid reactive lymphoid proliferation that can be misinterpreted as lymphoma. Multiple causes of LLL have been suggested but most cases remain unexplained. We describe the clinicopathologic features of 6 patients with LLL involving the uterine cervix. Five patients presented with abnormal Papanicolaou test (Pap smear), and 3 patients had a biopsy procedure performed prior to detection of LLL in a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). In each specimen, surface epithelial erosion was associated with a superficial, polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate with numerous scattered large cells, without cellular necrosis or sclerosis. Squamous dysplasia was present in 4 patients. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a mixed population of B- and T-lymphoid cells. T-cells were more numerous but B-cells and formed aggregates or sheets in areas. The large cells were predominantly B-cells positive for CD20 and negative for CD3 in all cases. CD30 was positive 3 cases, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA was positive in 3 cases. Assessment for clonality in 1 patient using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods revealed monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements. At last clinical follow-up there was no evidence of progressive or systemic disease. We conclude that LLL of the cervix has a number of etiologies and that a prior surgical procedure, present in 3 patients in this study, is another possible etiology. As has been reported by others, monoclonal IgH gene rearrangements can be detected in this entity which has a benign clinical course.
