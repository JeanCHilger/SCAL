Combined p16INK4a and human papillomavirus testing improves the prediction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II-III) in Thai patients with low-grade cytological abnormalities. Thailand is in the process of developing a national cervical screening program. This study examined p16INK4a staining and HPV prevalence in abnormal cervical samples with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), to evaluate the efficacy of combined HPV and p16INK4a detection to predict CIN II-III. Totals of 125 ASCUS and 87 LSIL cases were re-evaluated by Pap test and cervical cells of ASCUS and LSIL cases were prepared on slides for p16INK4a detection by immunocytochemistry. HPV genotyping of DNA extracts was performed by GP5+/6+ PCR and reverse line blot hybridization. Histopathologic tests were performed to identify cervical lesion. Total of 212 cases were diagnosed to normal (20), ASCUS (112), LSIL (78) and HSIL (2). HPV was detected in ASCUS (49/112, 43.8%), LSIL (60/78, 76.9%) and HSIL (2/2, 100%) cases. The majority of HPV positive samples typed for high-risk HPV. 55.7% (107/192) of abnormal cases (ASCUS, LSIL and HSIL) were positive p16INK4a. For the 111 HPV DNA positive cases, 34 of 49 (69.4%) ASCUS cases and 49 of 60 (81.7%) LSIL cases were p16INK4a positive. 140 biopsies were taken and histological classified: CIN negative (65 cases), CIN I (56 cases) and CIN II-III (19 cases). HPV DNA detection predicted CIN II-III with sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 49%, whereas p16INK4a staining showed higher sensitivity (89.5%) and specificity (56.2%). The prediction of CIN II-III was significantly better by combination of positive HPV DNA and p16INK4a with 93.8% sensitivity and 59.2% specificity. Detection of HPV DNA combined with p16INK4a in cervical cells can predict CIN II-III and may improve the screening diagnosis of Thai women at risk for CIN II-III or cancer.
