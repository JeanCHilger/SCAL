Methylation status of the E2 binding sites of HPV16 in cervical lesions determined with the Luminex® xMAP™ system. Cervical carcinogenesis is driven by deregulated E6/E7 expression in dividing cells. A potential deregulating mechanism is methylation of E2 binding sites in the viral long control region, thereby prohibiting HPVE2-mediated transcription regulation. Here the frequency of HPV16E2BS methylation in cervical lesions (SCC, n=29 CIN3, n=17) and scrapes (controls, n=17
