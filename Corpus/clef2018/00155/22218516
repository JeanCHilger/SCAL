Chlamydia trachomatis as a probable cofactor in human papillomavirus infection in aboriginal women from northeastern Argentina. High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are strongly associated with cervical cancer (CC), and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), the most frequent sexually transmitted bacterial infection (STBI) worldwide, seems to be a risk factor for HPV infection and for CC. It is also known that both agents are more prevalent in vulnerable communities where lack of adequate primary health care is a cause for concern. The aim of this work was to determine the impact of CT and HPV infections in women belonging to an isolated aboriginal population (Pilaga community) from a poor region in Northern Argentina (province of Formosa). For this purpose, a cross-sectional study was performed in all sexually active Pilaga women, who attended a local community-based gynecological health screening project. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method on a cervical brush specimen was used to detect both agents.A total of 227 women (20% of the total female population of the Pilaga community) were studied and the overall prevalence was 26.4% for CT, 46.7% for HPV and 16.3% for concurrent infection. CT infection was higher in HPV DNA positive (34.2%) than in HPV DNA negative women (19% OR: 2.22/95% CI = 1.16-4.28 / p = 0.009) and the most prevalent HPV types were HPV-16 (19.4%), 6 and 18 (5.3%), 58 (3.5%) and 33 (3.1%).The prevalence of CT and HPV observed in Pilaga women are among the worst registered in Latin America. Also, data collected suggest that chlamydial infection may play an important role in the natural history of HPV infection. On this respect, we propose that the association between these two agents seems to be more related to a mutual potentiation than to the fact that they share a common route of transmission.
