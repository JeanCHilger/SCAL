Evaluation of HPV DNA HR assay in females as a marker of recurrent disease following treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The basic assumption of the prevention of cervical cancer is to early detect and treat CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) as well as to prevent recurrence of neoplasia after therapy This study involved comparison of the cytology test value and determination of HPV (human papilloma virus) DNA in women treated for CIN so as to find a sensitive and specific marker of disease recurrence.A group of 107 females after CIN treatment underwent 14-month follow-up and regular cytological and molecular evaluations.Based on the follow-up data the recurrence of CIN was found in 9 females who despite effective therapy for the entire follow-up period were HPV positive. Evaluation of value of HR (high risk)--HPV DNA assay used to detect CIN showed its 100% sensitivityThe HR-HPV DNA assay is likely to be a valuable diagnostic tool facilitating more precise detection of recurrent neoplasia risk than cytological test alone.
