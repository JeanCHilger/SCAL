Urothelial carcinoma with prominent squamous differentiation in the setting of neurogenic bladder: role of human papillomavirus infection. Squamous cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder are rare in the Western world the majority of cases are reported in countries endemic to Schistosoma parasitic infections. Unlike squamous tumors of the uterine cervix or oropharynx, the human papillomavirus (HPV) is not commonly associated with bladder squamous cell carcinomas. We report on two cases of HPV-positive urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder with extensive squamous differentiation showing the typical basaloid, poorly differentiated morphology of HPV-associated tumors. These occurred in patients with neurogenic bladders who had long-standing histories of self-catheterization with tumors that tested positive for HPV by in situ hybridization. A retrospective review of our institutional database revealed four additional patients with bladder tumors showing squamous differentiation arising in the setting of neurogenic bladder. Review of these cases showed the more common well-differentiated keratinizing appearance of squamous cell carcinomas of the bladder. These tumors showed only patchy positivity for p16 immunohistochemical stain (not the diffuse strong staining seen in HPV-positive tumors), and the one tested case was negative for HPV by in situ hybridization. HPV infection and neurogenic bladder have been independently associated with increased risk of developing carcinoma in the urinary bladder
