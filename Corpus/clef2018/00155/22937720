Cytokine status of cervical mucus in women with transitory and persistent course of papillomavirus infection. Study the levels of cytokines in cervical mucus of women with transitory and persistent course of papillomavirus infection (PVI).Material from 122 women was studied: 32 patients in control group, 68 patients with transitory course of PVI and 52 women with persistent course of PVI. The presence or absence of high risk HPV DNA was confirmed by real time PCR. High risk HPV DNA was determined in scrapes of epithelial cells of cervical canal. Quantitative determination of cytokines (IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, receptor antagonist IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-10, TNFalpha in cervical mucus was performed by enzyme immunoassay.Transitory course of PVI was characterized by an increase of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, persistent course of PIV--by a decrease of IFN-alpha, IL-2 level was increased in both groups of patients with PVI.The outcome of PVI is controlled by interferon component of the immunity. Because of this during observation of patients with PVI the determination of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma content in cervical mucus is an appropriate diagnostic procedure in clinical practice for the prognosis of risk of development of high risk PIV persistency.
