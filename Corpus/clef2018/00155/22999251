Distribution of human papillomavirus genotype and cervical neoplasia among women with abnormal cytology in Beijing, China. To understand the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution and cervical neoplasia among women with abnormal cytology in Beijing.In a study in Beijing, China, participants underwent a gynecologic examination between September 2006 and December 2009. Those with abnormal cytology underwent colposcopy, biopsy, and HPV testing. HPV was typed by flow-through hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.Among 6339 women examined, 533 with abnormal cytology underwent HPV testing. The prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) subtypes was 29.8%. HPV-16 was the most common genotype (12.8%), followed by HPV-33, HPV-58, HPV-66, HPV-18, and HPV-52. The cytologic and histopathologic grade clearly increased with a higher prevalence of HR-HPV infection. Both HPV-16 and HPV-33 were significantly associated with grade CIN2+ lesions (P<0.05). By contrast, HPV-18 and HPV-66 were not associated with cervical lesion severity. HR-HPV infection was most common among women aged 30-34 years (35.0%).HPV-16, HPV-58, HPV-33, HPV-66, HPV-18, and HPV-52 were the most common genotypes in Beijing. HPV-16 and HPV-33 might be associated with CIN2+ lesions. HPV-18 and HPV-66 were not associated with high-grade cervical lesions. The present results might help to improve HPV vaccination and cervical cancer prevention programs in Beijing.
