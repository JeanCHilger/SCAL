XPD and XRCC1 gene polymorphism in patients with normal and abnormal cervical cytology by pap smear. The purpose of the present study was to identify the role of abnormalities in DNA repair pathways by measuring the XPD and XRCC1 gene polymorphisms.Thirty-five patients with abnormal cervical cytology (study group) and 10 women with normal cytology (control group) were included in the study. The polymorphisms of XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XPD Lys751Gln genes were investigated from the blood samples.There was no statistically significant difference in allele frequencies of XPD gene among the groups (p = 0.097), while XRCC1R399Q gene polymorphism was strikingly more frequent in the study group than that of control cases (p = 0.029). The prevalence of XRCC1R194W gene polymorphism on the other hand, was similar between the groups (p = 0.579).Patients with abnormal and normal cervical cytology have similar XPD gene polymorphism. However, the frequency of gene polymorphism in XRCC1 Arg 399 Gln codon was significantly higher in abnormal cervical cytology group.
