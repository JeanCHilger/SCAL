Simultaneous detection, genotyping, and quantification of human papillomaviruses by multicolor real-time PCR and melting curve analysis. Long-term infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer, while infection with low-risk HPV is the major reason for condylomata acuminata. An accurate, rapid, and convenient assay that is able to simultaneously detect, genotype, and quantify HPV would be of great clinical value yet remains to be achieved. We developed a three-color real-time PCR assay that is able to analyze 30 predominant HPV types in three reactions. The amplification curves indicated the presence of HPV, melting curve analysis identified the HPV genotype, and the quantification cycle value determined the quantity. We applied this assay to 647 cervical swab samples, and the results were compared with those obtained with a commercial genotyping system. The proposed assay had a limit of detection of 5 to 50 copies per reaction and a dynamic range of 5 × 10(1) to 5 × 10(6) copies per reaction. A comparison study showed that the overall sample concordance with the comparison method was 91.6% and the type agreement was greater than 98.7%. The quantification study demonstrated that the loads of HPV type 16 in 30 samples with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III) lesions were significantly higher than those in samples with CIN I lesions or CIN II lesions, and the results were concordant with those of the comparison method. The increased information content, high throughput, and low cost would facilitate the use of this real-time PCR-based assay in a variety of clinical settings.
