Research of the relationship between cervical cytology and HPV test and lesions in the cervical tissue. Discussion of the relationship between cervical cytology and high-risk HPV test and lesions in the cervical tissue.The 254 infertile patients were graded into 4 groups based on the results of cervical cytology and high-risk HPV test. The patients in group A were the cervical cytology -positive and HPV-positive. The cervical cytology -positive and HPV-negative patients were in group B. The cervical cytology -negative and HPV-positive patients were in group C and cervical cytology -negative and HPV-negative in group D. Retrospective analysis was used in the relationship between the results and lesions in the cervical tissue.The incidence of CIN II and higher grade than CIN II was significant higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.01). The incidence of CIN I was no difference among A, B and C group (P > 0.05). The sensitivity was 100.0% and the specificity was 46.74% when cervical cytology was used to test the CIN II grade. But the sensitivity changed to 97.22% and the specificity 87.16% when both of the cervical cytology and HPV test were used.The cervical cytology is the first choice in cervical examination. And the accuracy will significant higher when the HPV test is used simultaneously.
