The role of human papillomavirus in the malignant transformation of cervix epithelial cells and the importance of vaccination against this virus. Human papillomavirus (HPV) belongs to the diverse group of sexually transmitted viruses that manifest affinity to the squamous epithelia of the skin and mucous membranes. Over 100 types of HPV have been described and identified in human tissues, and it has been proved that persistent infection with high-risk types of the virus (types 16 and 18 in particular) could lead to cervical cancer. High-risk HPV types have been found in approximately 70% of all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. The aim of this study was to describe the role of HPV in the process of neoplastic transformation in epithelial cells and to emphasize the prophylactic significance of vaccinations against the virus.
