HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms in high grade and invasive cervico-vaginal cancer. Besides HPV infection, the progression to cervical cancer also depends on the host immune response. HLA-G molecules are involved in the inhibition of cell-mediated immune responses and may permit the development of an infection in the female cervical tract. The aim of this study was to explore the possible influence of the two HLA-G polymorphisms located on the 3'UTR on the susceptibility to cervical cancer and risk factors in Brazilian patients. Polymorphism analysis (14 bp In/Del and +3142C/G) was performed by PCR. A total of 105 cervical samples were tested, 50 without lesions and 55 with lesions 22 with high grade (HSIL) and 33 with invasive cancer (ICC). The polymorphisms (∗)Del/Del was associated with a decreased risk of developing ICC in smokers and (∗)In and (∗)In/In were associated with an increased risk of HSIL and a higher risk of ICC in smokers. The genotype (∗)In/Del was associated with the increased risk of HSIL only among women with a family history of cancer. The haplotypes (∗)In/G and (∗)Del/G were associated with increased and decreased risk of HSIL and cervical cancer, respectively. In conclusion, the 3'UTR of HLA-G is associated with an increased risk of developing cervical cancer, especially in smokers.
