Prevalence of HPV types in cervical specimens from an integrated healthcare delivery system: baseline assessment to measure HPV vaccine impact. Two human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are available to prevent cervical cancer. One early measure of HPV vaccine impact would be a reduction in vaccine-related HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18, or HPV 16, 18) in cervical samples from young women. We aimed to assess feasibility of specimen collection and baseline HPV prevalence in an integrated healthcare delivery system.Residual cervical specimens collected during routine cervical cancer screening (2006-2008) were retained consecutively from eligible females aged 11-29 years, stratified by age group. Specimens were evaluated for 37 HPV genotypes using the Roche Linear Array assay.Of 10,124 specimens submitted, 10,103 (99 %) were adequate for HPV testing. Prevalence of HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 genotype was 11.4 % overall and was the highest in the youngest age group (18.1 % in the 11-19-year-olds, 12.5 % in the 20-24-year-olds, and 7.0 % in the 25-29-year-olds).HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 prevalence could be measured over time to assess early HPV vaccine impact using residual specimens from an integrated healthcare delivery system, particularly if sampling focused on young women.
