HPV at the time of vaccine: has screening reached its goal? The human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence recognized a geographic distribution of genotypes but, in the last years, the change of sexual behaviours, the increase number of sex partners, and the reduction of geographic distances have changed its prevalence and distribution.To determine the prevalence of HPV types among females in the Molise region and its evolution in 24 months.The authors, from February to August 2008, used a representative sample of a female population (n = 299) aged 17 to 64 years who were interviewed and submitted cervico-vaginal swab specimens. Swabs were analyzed for cytologic screening and HPV detection and typing. The patients with a positive cytology were submitted to colposcopy and eventually biopsy. Cytological and colposcopic follow up was performed in 24 months.The overall HPV prevalence was 30.1% and the prevalence of high- and low-risk HPV types was 22.41% and 18.06%, respectively. The prevalence of HPV vaccine types was relatively low for HPV-6-11-18. Only HPV-16 is well-represented in Molise, but recognizes a strictly geographic distribution.This study is one of the largest assessments of HPV genotypes to date in Italy. It is clear that several HPV-types are involved in cervical lesions, therefore the vaccine is profitable but limited by great number of types implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and by their dishomogeneous distribution. Currently, a good campaign of screening is still necessary. In the future, second generation polyvalent HPV vaccines my be proposed for a wider and complete vaccine coverage.
