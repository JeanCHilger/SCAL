Factors associated with human papillomavirus infection among women in the Northwest Territories. In some regions, Aboriginal women have higher rates of cervical cancer compared to other Canadian women. However, little data are available regarding the co-factors of HPV infection in the Aboriginal population of Canada. We examined factors associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in a population of women (both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal) in the Northwest Territories (NWT).We used a cross-sectional design using a convenience sample of all women aged 14 years or older presenting for Papanicolaou (Pap) testing across all regions of the NWT from March 2009 to March 2010. Women answered a questionnaire on demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, and gynaecological and obstetrical events. We used multiple regression analysis to explore factors associated with HR-HPV infection according to age and cultural background. HPV typing was done using the Luminex assay.Of the total 1,279 participants, 178 had missing HPV results. We obtained data on 1,101 women and overall HR-HPV prevalence was 14.2%. Younger age, single marital status, Aboriginal background, current smoking, lifetime deliveries, use of hormonal contraceptives, and the numbers of sexual partners in the last year were associated with prevalent HR-HPV.Our findings tend to indicate that Aboriginal women have different predictors of HR-HPV than non-Aboriginal women that may affect HPV progression to cervical cancer. These findings can help to better target public health practices for the women at higher risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer.
