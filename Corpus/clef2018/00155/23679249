Scoring system and management algorithm assessing the role of survivin expression in predicting progressivity of HPV infections in precancerous cervical lesions. To identify the risk factors and assess the role of survivin in predicting progessivity precancerous cervical lesions.This case-control study was conducted from October 2009 until May 2010. We obtained 74 samples, classified according to the degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN): 19 samples for CIN 1, 18 samples for CIN 2, 18 samples for CIN 3, and 19 samples as controls. Demographic profiles and risk factors assesment, histopathologic examination, HPV DNA tests, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for survivin expression were performed on all samples. Data was analyzed with bivariate and multivariate analysis.Multivariate analysis revealed significant risk factors for developing precancerous cervical lesions are age <41 years, women with ≥2 sexual partners, course of education ≥13 years, use of oral contraceptives, positive high-risk HPV DNA, and high survivin expression by ICC or IHC staining. These factors were fit to a prediction model and we obtained a scoring system to predict the progressivity of CIN lesions.Determination of survivin expression by immunocytochemistry staining, along with other significant risk factors, can be used in a scoring system to predict the progressivity of CIN lesions. Application of this scoring system may be beneficial in determining the action of therapy towards the patient.
