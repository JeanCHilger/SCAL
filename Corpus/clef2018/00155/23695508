Perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To investigate the perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).The women in this retrospective case-control study were recruited from Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital from August 1, 2007 to February 28, 2010. All the cases were 13-32 gestational weeks, who were diagnosed by colposcopy conducted cervical biopsy. A total of 108 cases were followed-up to the day of delivery.(1) Complications of colposcopy conducted cervical biopsy: there were two cases of pregnant women, who suffered cervical local compression after undergoing colposcopy conducted cervical biopsy, as the bleeding could not be stopped, the wound was treated by local suture. The incidence of such event was 1.8% (2/108), without any colposcopy and biopsy-related adverse event. (2) Cesarean section rate was 63.6% (56/88) in CIN, which was higher than 30.0% (6/20) in cervicitis, and the cesarean section rate increased as CIN grades elevated, and gestational weeks of delivery advanced.(P < 0.05). (3) We did not detect significant difference for the incidence of polyhydramnios, premature rupture of fetal membranes, placental abruption, cervical laceration and postpartum hemorrhage, low birth weight infants, amniotic fluid II-III degree, neonatal deformity and neonatal asphyxia between pregnant women with CIN and cervicitis (P > 0.05) however, the incidence of oligohydramnios and premature infants in pregnant women with CIN group were higher than that in cervicitis group (P = 0.007Pregnant women with CIN can be diagnosed by colposcopy conducted cervical biopsy, and they should be carefully monitored oligohydramnios and preterm during pregnancy. Pregnant women with CIN during pregnancy, excluding other obstetric operation indications may choose vaginal delivery first.
