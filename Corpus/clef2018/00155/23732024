Human papillomavirus vaccination: current indications and future directions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections affecting both men and women worldwide. The development of the prophylactic HPV vaccines is a significant pharmaceutical innovation with potential to reduce HPV-related morbidity. However, barriers to the universal use and acceptability of the HPV vaccines continue to exist in both economically privileged and disadvantaged countries. It may be decades before the impact of preventive vaccines on HPV-related diseases caused by the considerable burden of HPV infections will be seen. Collaborative efforts must continue to promote vaccine implementation.
