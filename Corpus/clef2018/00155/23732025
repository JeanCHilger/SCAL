The modern cytology laboratory: moving beyond the Pap test. New recommendations for screening intervals across different age groups is leading to a diminished role for the cytology laboratory and an increased role for the human papillomavirus (HPV) testing laboratory. With the introduction of the liquid-based Papanicolaou test, high-risk HPV testing, and computer-assisted screening, the cytology laboratory is at the forefront of efforts to improve screening for the provision of better patient care. Cytology laboratories are ideally positioned to facilitate important basic and applied research involving cervical cancer.
