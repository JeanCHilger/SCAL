New cervical cancer screening guidelines, again. Guidelines for cervical cancer screening have continued to evolve as we have accumulated new information about the pathogenesis of cervical cancer and the role of the human papilloma virus. Most recently, the American Cancer Society, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and the American Society for Clinical Pathology issued revised joint recommendations for the prevention and early detection of cervical cancer. In addition, the US Preventative Services Task Force revised its guidelines, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists updated its practice bulletin.
