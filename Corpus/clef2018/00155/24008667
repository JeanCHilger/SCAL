hr-HPV testing in the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy. The follow-up after abnormal Pap smear and negative colposcopy is not clearly defined. This study aimed at investigating the role of hr-HPV testing in the management of abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). methods: The study enrolled 1029 women with abnormal screening cytology (years 2006-2010) and negative colposcopy for CIN2+, which subsequently performed a hr-HPV test. Incident CIN2+ lesions were identified through linkage with cancer registry, hospital discharge records, neoplastic pathology reports and the archive of screening programme (2006-2011).During the follow-up, the cohort developed 133 CIN2+ lesions only one among hr-HPV-negative women. The probability of developing CIN2+ on follow-up time was 0.44% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-3.1) and 41.8% (95% CI 31.8-53.5) for hr-HPV-negative women and hr-HPV-positive women, respectively. A woman with a positive hr-HPV test had about 105 times higher probability of developing a CIN2+ lesion than a woman with a negative hr-HPV test (hazard ratio (HR)=104.5, 95% CI 14.5-755.1), adjusted for index Pap test result, age and cervix squamocolumnar junction visualisation.Our results confirm that hr-HPV testing is able to select the real group of women at risk of developing CIN2+ lesions in the follow-up of abnormal cytology and first negative colposcopy.
