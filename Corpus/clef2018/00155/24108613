Comparison of careHPV and hybrid capture 2 assays for detection of high-risk human Papillomavirus DNA in cervical samples from HIV-1-infected African women. The careHPV and HC2 assays were compared for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA detection in cervical samples from 149 HIV-1-infected African women. The HR-HPV DNA detection rates were 37.6% and 34.9% for careHPV and HC2, respectively. Agreement between the two tests was 94.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.7% to 97.7%) with a kappa value of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.96), indicating an excellent agreement. careHPV may be considered as suitable as HC2 for cervical cancer screening among HIV-infected African women.
