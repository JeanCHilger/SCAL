Cervical neoplasia-related factors and decreased prevalence of uterine fibroids among a cohort of African American women. To investigate whether the previously reported inverse association between cervical neoplasia and uterine fibroids is corroborated.Cross-sectional analysis of enrollment data from an ongoing prospective study of fibroid development.Not applicable.Self-reported data on abnormal Pap smear, colposcopy, and cervical treatment were obtained from 1,008 African American women ages 23-34 with no previous fibroid diagnosis and no reported history of human papillomavirus vaccination. Presence of fibroids was assessed at a standardized ultrasound examination.None.The association between the three cervical neoplasia-related variables and the presence of fibroids was evaluated with logistic regression to estimate age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (aORs).Of the analysis sample, 46%, 29%, and 14% reported a prior abnormal Pap smear, colposcopy, and cervical treatment, respectively. Twenty-five percent had fibroids at ultrasound. Those reporting cervical treatment had a 39% (aOR, 0.61 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.38-0.96]) reduction in fibroid risk. Weak nonsignificant associations were found for abnormal Pap smear and colposcopy.Although a protective-type association of cervical neoplasia with uterine fibroids seems counterintuitive, a causal pathway is possible, and the findings are consistent with two prior studies. Further investigation is needed on the relationship between fibroids and cervical neoplasia and human papillomavirus-related mechanisms.
