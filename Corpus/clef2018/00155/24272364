Evaluation of cytology and visual triage of human papillomavirus-positive women in cervical cancer prevention in India. Although virtually all cervical cancers and most cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, only a small proportion of HPV-positive women have or will develop CIN. Triaging HPV-positive women has been suggested to reduce the false-positive rate and proportion of women referred for CIN confirmation and/or treatment. In two cross-sectional studies and one randomized trial in India, we evaluated the impact of using cytology or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) to triage HPV-positive women on the proportion of women who would be referred for CIN confirmation and on the detection rates of high-grade CIN. We present the numbers of HPV test-positive women found and the CIN detected among them. We further assess the proportions that would be referred for CIN confirmation with colposcopy/biopsy and CIN that would be detected if cytology triage or VIA triage were used. Using cytology triage at atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance threshold or VIA triage reduced referrals for colposcopy by about 62% and 59%, respectively (p-value = 0.012), but missed around 16% and 18%, respectively, of the high-grade CIN (p-value = 0.539) indicating similar performance of both triaging approaches. The choice of a triage test in different low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) would depend on the availability and affordability in the particular setting. Cytology triage may be considered in settings where adequate infrastructure exists, whereas VIA triage may be suitable in settings with limited or no cytology infrastructure.
