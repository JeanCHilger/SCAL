Association between maternal preventive care utilization and adolescent vaccination: it's not just about Pap testing. To examine the association between maternal preventive care utilization and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake by their adolescent daughters.A cross-sectional study using immunization records from administrative claims and the state health department's immunization information system from June 2006 through May 2011.Commercially-insured Michigan females aged 13-17 in May 2011 and their mothers. Mothers were identified using relationship information on the insurance contract.Using logistic regression, we investigated whether initiating and/or completing the HPV vaccine series were associated with maternal preventive care utilization (Papaniculou testing, mammograms, primary care office visits) independently and using a combined maternal preventive care utilization index.Among 38,604 mother-daughter pairs, 36% of daughters initiated and 22% completed the HPV vaccine series. Maternal utilization of each recommended service was modestly associated with both daughter's initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine. Effect estimates for receipt of Papaniculou test on vaccine initiation (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.06-1.08) were not any higher than for mammograms (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.08-1.11) or primary care office visits (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.06-1.09). Using a maternal preventive care utilization index, vaccine uptake increased with an increasing number of received services.Maternal receipt of recommended preventive care, which may reflect general attitudes toward prevention, is as or more predictive of daughter's vaccination status than cervical cancer screening alone. Engaging women in broad routine preventive care practices may have additional positive effects on adolescent HPV vaccination beyond those achieved through cervical cancer prevention efforts alone.
