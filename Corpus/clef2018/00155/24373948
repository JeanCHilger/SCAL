HPV testing with cytology triage for cervical cancer screening in routine practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Viral Testing Alone with Pap (Papanicolaou) Triage for Screening Cervical Cancer in Routine Practice (VASCAR) in a publicly funded university-affiliated hospital in Montreal, Canada.Women who are 30-65 years old are screened with the Hybrid Capture-2 assay. Women with negative results are retested at 3-year intervals women with positive results are triaged with conventional cytologic methods. Women with Papanicolaou positive test results (â‰¥atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) are referred to colposcopyVASCAR included 23,739 eligible women, among whom 1646 women (6.9%) tested positive for the human papillomavirus (HPV). Because of the need for subsequent sampling for cytologic testing, follow-up evaluation for cytologic triage was relatively poor only 46% and 24% of HPV-positive women were Papanicolaou-triaged and underwent biopsy, respectively. Protocol violations occurred mainly in the early phases of implementation (12%). Detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia increased nearly 3-fold (rate ratio, 2.78VASCAR is feasible however, it requires cosampling for HPV and cytology and for continuous education of healthcare providers of the HPV-Papanicolaou triage protocol. Efficacy in disease detection and reduction in time to colposcopy referrals compared with the historic cytology era is encouraging but should be considered preliminary because of the small number of patients who were tested.
