A retrospective study of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as a prognostic factor in cancer of the uterine cervix. Hypoxia occurs during the development of uterine cervical cancer and is considered to correlate with its invasion. Hypoxia promotes both the invasiveness and the metastasis of cancer cells through urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between uPAR mRNA level and clinical prognostic factors of uterine cervical cancer.We performed a retrospective review of 59 patients with cervical cancer and 9 subjects with normal cervical tissues. Total RNA was isolated from tissues of the uterine cervix surgically removed from patients. The mRNA of uPAR could be measured by real time PCR (RT-PCR). Histopathological factors such as histopathological type, cervical stromal, parametrial, lymphovascular, and uterine corpus invasions, metastasis to the pelvic lymph nodes, and pTNM stage were confirmed by two pathologists. The examined prognostic factors alongside the histopathological ones were FIGO clinical stage, hemoglobin level, serum level of SCC, and the effect on clinical outcomes. These factors were statistically evaluated by Fisher's exact test, log-rank test, and ROC analysis. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-uPAR monoclonal antibody was also performed.In uterine cervical cancer, overexpression of uPAR mRNA was significantly related to shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.0396). However, the other clinical prognostic and histopathological factors were not related to uPAR mRNA expression level. Immunohistochemical staining showed that positive staining for uPAR was histologically localized on the membrane of carcinoma cells. However, the staining was not very intense.Overexpression of uPAR mRNA may be a prognostic factor in cancer of the uterine cervix.
