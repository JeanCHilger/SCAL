MTHFR/p53 polymorphisms as genetic factors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer in HPV-infected Mexican women. We performed a case-control association study to evaluate the association between common polymorphisms in MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) and the Arg72Pro polymorphism in the p53 gene and the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in Mexican HPV-infected women. We included 131 women with diagnosis of CIN grade I-II and 78 with CIN III or ICC as controls we also included 274 women with normal Pap smear and negative HPV test. Genotyping for MTHFR and p53 polymorphisms was performed by PCR-RFPLs. HPV was tested by Hybrid Capture II. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Genotype frequencies for the 3 studied polymorphisms were distributed according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The A1298C-MTHFR polymorphism showed significant differences for the heterozygous AC genotype and the C allele, whereas the AA genotype and A allele resulted to be genetic risk factors for CIN or ICC (p<0.03). The Arg72Pro-p53 polymorphism showed for the genotypes Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro, and for the Pro allele, a significant association only to the risk for CIN (p<0.03). The MTHFR/p53 interaction showed that the genotype combinations AA/ArgArg and AA/ArgPro were associated, respectively, to the risk of ICC and CIN (p<0.05). This study suggests that the A1298C-MTHFR polymorphism contributes to the genetic risk for both CIN and ICC, whereas the Arg72Pro-p53 polymorphism only contributes to the risk for CIN. The MTHFR/p53 genetic combinations AA/ArgArg and AA/ArgPro are associated genetic risk factors for ICC and CIN in Mexican HPV-infected women.
