Antiproliferative and antiviral activity of three libraries of adamantane derivatives. Three libraries of adamantane derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antiviral and antiproliferative activities against a broad variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Whereas none of the compounds exhibit antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations, antiproliferative activity was found against murine leukemia cells (L1210), human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), and cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa) for 4, 8, and 10.
