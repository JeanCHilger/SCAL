Cervical cancer in developing countries: effective screening and preventive strategies with an application in Rwanda. In this article we explore literature regarding cervical cancer screening methods available in developing countries. Cervical cancer is a preventable and curable disease, but it continues to threaten the lives of many women. Eighty-five percent of cases and the majority of deaths occur in developing countries. Cytology via Papinicolaou (Pap) smear is not generally a suitable method of screening in low-resource regions. Alternative methods include visual inspection by acetic acid (VIA), human papillomavirus-deoxyribonucleic acid (HPV-DNA), and careHPV-DNA. Education is needed for health care providers and women about preventive immunization and screening. A Rwandan project is described to demonstrate effective program planning and implementation.
