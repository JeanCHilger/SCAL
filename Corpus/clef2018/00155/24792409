Distribution of various types of low-risk human papillomavirus according to cervical cytology and histology in northern Chinese women. To describe the distribution of specific types of low-risk (LR) human papillomavirus (HPV) among a general population of northern Chinese women.Between 2007 and 2012, 118 096 women were tested with the HPV Geno-Array Test Kit (HybriBio) at China Medical University's Shengjing Affiliated Hospital, Shenyang, China. Among these women, 80 418 underwent cervical cytology and colposcopic examination, and 30 961 of these had a cervical biopsy. The prevalence of HPV infection among the women was analyzed according to age, and cytologic and histologic findings.CP8304 was the most common type of LR-HPV overall, and was most prevalent in the youngest age group. The overall prevalence of LR-HPV (averaged across all types) was 1.7% in women with normal cytology, 8.8% in those with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 8.0% in those with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 5.8% in those with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). LR-HPV alone, without any high-risk (HR)-HPV, was most common among women with ASCUS and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) not otherwise specified (CINNOS) together. Co-infections of LR-HPV and HR-HPV were most common among women with LSIL and CIN1.These data will facilitate modeling of the cost-effectiveness of a prophylactic LR-HPV vaccination in China.
