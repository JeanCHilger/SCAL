Local cervical immunity in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and immune responses after abrasion. Minor trauma to the uterine cervix is supposed to induce local immunity to prevent cervical lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study aimed to investigate the local cervical immunity in women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and effects of abrasion after cryosurgery or Pap smear. One hundred women with LSIL and known results of HPV detection were recruited. HPV positive women were randomly divided according to abrasion into cryotherapy and Pap smear observation groups. Cervical tissues and cervico-vaginal lavage (CVL) were collected at 6 and 12 months after allocation. The levels of cytokines at first recruitment were compared with cytokine levels at 6 months after abrasions. The mRNA of IFN-γ , TNF-α and IL-10 in cervical tissues and these cytokines secreted in CVL were determined using real time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Anti-HPV16 IgG and IgA antibodies in CVL were assessed by western blotting. At first recruitment of women with LSIL (100 cases), IL-10 mRNA and cytokine in HPV positive group (60 cases) was significantly higher than negative group (40 cases). IFN-γ and TNF-α mRNA level in both groups were comparable but their secretions in CVL were significantly increased in HPV negative group. After abrasion for 6 months in HPV-positive women, all mRNA and secreted cytokines were changed, but no significant difference was observed between cryotherapy and observation groups. When individuals were compared between first recruitment and after abrasion for 6 months, IFN-γ mRNA and anti-HPV16 L1 IgA antibodies were significantly increased in the cryotherapy group. The results suggest that modulation of local cervical immunities by abrasion might promote different effects in clearance of HPV-related cytological abnormalities.
