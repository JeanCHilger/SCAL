Nucleic acid-based assays for the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus: a technical review. Nucleic acid-based high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is essential to contemporary cervical cancer screening. The numbers of commercially available assays approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for HPV nucleic acid detection have increased, each offering various approaches to analysis. An understanding of the methodologies associated with HPV testing is important to the practice of laboratory medicine. An overview of instruments, chemistries, laboratory workflows, and test limitations associated with current US Food and Drug Administration-approved assays is provided.
