A study of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in pregnancy. To find the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in pregnant women and compare Pap smear with the HPV DNA test in detecting HPV infection.Hundred antenatal women, irrespective of gestational age, were enrolled as subjects in this prospective pilot study for blood investigations, wet mount examination of cervical discharge, Pap smear, and high-risk HPV DNA detection of cervical scrape by PCR. Women showing abnormality in Pap smear and/or those who were high-risk HPV DNA positive were subjected to colposcopy.The incidence of HPV-positive pregnant women was 18Â %. Koilocytosis on Pap smear was observed in six women. Three high-risk HPV DNA-positive women showed changes consistent with CIN 1 on colposcopy.The HPV DNA test is the most sensitive and reliable in detecting HPV infection as compared to Pap smear, but considering the cost of PCR, Pap smear screening of all antenatal women was recommended.
