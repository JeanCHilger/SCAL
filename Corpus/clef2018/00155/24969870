Concordance in cervical HPV detection between hybrid capture 2 and HPV GenoArray tests. HPV type-specific detection may promote cervical screening program and vaccination development worldwide. We conduct a study comparing HPV Hybrid capture II (HC II) Test and Hybribio GenoArray test, a newly developed HPV type-specific assay, in patients with cervical epithelial neoplasm. Results showed a good concordance in cervical HPV detection between two tests (kappa value 0.80, p<0.05, McNemar test). Our study may promote utilization of type-specific HPV detection that is helpful for cervical cancer screening and vaccination.
