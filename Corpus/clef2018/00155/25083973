Prevalence and genotypes of HPV in female renal transplant recipients in North India. Estimation of the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in female renal transplant recipients is important for formulating strategies for prevention and screening of cervical cancer in the susceptible group. Data from developing countries are very limited. The study was prospective, cross-sectional, and hospital-based. Female renal transplant recipients, who had received the graft at least 6 mo earlier, were enrolled. Women who visited the outpatient unit for varied complaints and who underwent a normal cervical examination were recruited as controls. A pap smear was obtained in all women. HPV genotyping array kit was utilized for identifying 21 HPV genotypes. Forty renal transplant recipient women and 80 controls were enrolled. The median age of cases and controls was 40 yr (range, 24-69 yr) and 38 yr (range, 23-72 yr), respectively. The mean duration since transplant was 53Â±42.6 mo (range, 6-168 mo). There was no evidence of cervical dysplasia in any pap smear. High-risk HPV was detected in 32.5% (13/40) and 17.5% (14/80) of cases and controls, respectively (P=0.18). Of the 21 genotypes screened, 7 subtypes were detected. HPV 16 and 31 were the most common (5/13 38.5%) subtypes observed in the cases, followed by HPV 18 (30.7%). HPV 16 was the most common subtype in controls (10/14
