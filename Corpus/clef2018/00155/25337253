Wnt5A expression is associated with the tumor metastasis and clinical survival in cervical cancer. To identify the clinical significance of Wnt5A expression in the development and progression of cervical cancer.Real-time PCR was performed in 8 pairs of surgically resected cervical cancer and adjacent normal cervical tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine Wnt5A expression in 94 paraffin-embedded cervical cancer samples. Associations of Wnt5A expression with clinicopathological factors and clinical survival were analyzed.Wnt5A expression was overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal cervix. Wnt5A expression tended to be positively correlated with lymph nodes metastasis (P = 0.028) and recurrence (P = 0.009). Moreover, patients with higher Wnt5A expression in cancer tissues had better overall (P = 0.004) and recurrent-free survival (P = 0.012) than those with lower Wnt5A expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that Wnt5A was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.026) for predicting overall survival of cervical cancer patients.Upregulation of Wnt5A was associated with metastasis and progression of cervical cancer. The results of our study unravel the significance of Wnt/Ca2+ signaling in cervical cancer.
