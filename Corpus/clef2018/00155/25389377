Cervical dysplasia and high-risk human papillomavirus infections among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adolescent females in South Africa. HIV-infected adolescents may be at higher risk for high-grade cervical lesions than HIV-uninfected adolescents. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections and Pap smear abnormalities between these two groups.In this cross-sectional study, we compared the HPV DNA and Pap smear results between 35 HIV-infected and 50 HIV-uninfected adolescents in order to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV genotypes and cervical cytological abnormalities. Comparisons were made using Pearson Ï‡ (2) and independent-samples t-tests analyses, and associations between demographic and behavioral characteristics and HPV infections were examined.HIV-infected participants were more likely to be infected with any HPV (88.6% versus 48.0% P < 0.001) and with at least one HR-HPV (60.0% versus 24.0%HIV-infected adolescents have an increased risk of infection with HR-HPV and of Pap test abnormalities. The majority of HR-HPV infections among our participants would not be prevented by the currently available vaccinations against HPV.
