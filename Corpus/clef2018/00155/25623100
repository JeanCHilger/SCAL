Analysis of factors associated with recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after loop electrosurgical excision procedure. To explore the factors associated with recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).A total of 236 patients with CIN owing to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection underwent LEEP and followed up with thinprep cytologic test (TCT), HPV genotype test and biopsy histology.Among them, 22 patients (9.3%) developed recurrent disease at 12 months post-LEEP. And the persistent infection rate of high-risk HPV was 10.6% (25/236). The odds ratio for recurrent CIN in patients with persistent infection of high-risk HPV was 38.9 (P < 0.01). Recurrent rate was associated with HPV DNA load pre-LEEP (P < 0.05), HPV16 infection (P < 0.01) and positive margin (P < 0.05).HPV DNA load >1 000 RLU/CO, HPV 16 infection and positive margin are risk factors for recurrence. And persistent infection of high-risk HPV is a significant predictor of recurrent CIN.
