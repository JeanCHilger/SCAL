P16 Cervical cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in females worldwide, accounting for 10-15% of cancer-related mortalities. Cytological screening and DNA testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types have markedly decreased the rates of cervical cancer in developed countries, however, for vulnerable populations without access to health care, cervical cancer remains a considerable problem. Chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin (DDP) are considered as first-line treatment for cervical carcinoma. Although initially patients often exhibit high responsiveness, the majority eventually develop DDP resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Furthermore, patients with metastatic cancer and those exhibiting persistent or recurrent disease after platinum-based chemoradiotherapy have limited options and thus, non-platinum combination chemotherapy has been proposed as a strategy to circumvent platinum resistance, however, novel therapeutic strategies are required. In the present study, P16 expression was analyzed by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis in SiHa and SiHa-DDP cells and the interaction between P16 and CDK4 was detected via co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, the proliferation and apoptosis rates of P16 knockdown SiHa-DDP cells were measured by MTT assay and Annexin V flow cytometry and the subsequent changes in cyclin D1 and pRb expression were analyzed by western blot analysis. In this study, a high level of P16
