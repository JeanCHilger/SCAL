The association between HPV, intraepithelial lesions and HIV-1 shedding in anogenital specimens in two contrasting populations: Senegalese women and American MSM. In light of observational evidence showing an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV acquisition risk, the potential of HPV vaccination as a HIV prevention strategy is being considered. However, the relationship between HPV and HIV infectiousness is unclear. In this analysis, the relationship between HPV and anogenital HIV shedding (a proxy for transmissibility) was assessed in two diverse populations: HIV-infected Senegalese women and American men who have sex with men (MSM). Data from two longitudinal studies with similar protocols were analysed. In both studies, anogenital specimens underwent cytologic, HPV DNA, and HIV-1 RNA testing. Analyses utilised multivariable generalised estimating equations that controlled for age, hormonal contraceptive use (women only), plasma viral load, CD4 count and treatment status. Among Senegalese women, cervical lesions were significantly associated with the detection of HIV RNA (aRR = 1.16 [1.05, 1.28]) and log10 cervicovaginal fluids viral load (adjusted β = 0.56 [0.12, 1.01]). No association was detected between HPV (of any type) and cervicovaginal HIV shedding (aRRDetection = 0.90 [0.77, 1.06] βQuantity = -0.31 [-0.78, 0.16]). Among MSM, having multiple HPV infections (versus no HPV infection) was associated with anal HIV shedding (aRRDetection = 1.05 [1.01, 1.09]
