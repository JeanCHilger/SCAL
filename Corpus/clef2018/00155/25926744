DNA ploidy of cervical epithelial cells should be a cure criterion of high-risk HPV infection in Xinjiang Uygur women. The Uygur women have the highest incidence of cervical cancer in all Chinese ethnic groups. The research was conducted to explore whether DNA ploidy could be the prognostic indicator of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Xinjiang Uygur women.Case data and cervical exfoliated cell samples from 326 Uygur women. The DNA ploidy was analyzed by flow cytometry. The flow-through hybridization and gene chip (FHGC) for HPV type test then divided the cases into negative HPV group, non high-risk HPV infection group, single high-risk HPV infection group, and multiple high-risk HPV infection group. Lastly, 113 cases from 273 HPV infection cases were followed up.The 16-type HPV had the highest rate in all genotypes infection 16/18-type HPV mixed infection was the most common type in multiple high-risk HPV infection group. Abnormal DNA ploidy happened along with the seriousness of HPV infection. Compared with the HPV negative group, DNA heteroploid appeared 12.750 times and 22.705 times, respectively, in single high-risk HPV and multiple high-risk HPV infection groups. Followed up 1 year later, the DNA index, S-phase cells' peak percentage and heteroploid of cervical exfoliated cells significantly reduced in single and multiple high-risk HPV infection patients, but in nine patients negative HPV infection and DNA heteroploid still existed.The finally cure criterion of high-risk HPV infection should include the negative HPV test and normal DNA ploidy analysis. It was useful to prevent and cure cervical lesions in Xinjiang Uygur women through high-risk HPV test and DNA ploidy analysis. The transient infection and persistent infection in Xinjiang Uygur women should be taken as further research.
