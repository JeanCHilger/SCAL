Evaluation of the human papillomavirus mRNA test for the detection of cervical lesions in Japan. For the screening of cervical abnormalities, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is widely used along with Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. Although the sensitivity of the HPV DNA testing is good, its specificity is relatively low. In the present study, the authors evaluated the use of the Gen-Probe APTIMA HPV Assay for the detection of HPV mRNA and compared it with HPV DNA testing.Liquid cervical Pap specimens collected from 410 women were assessed using the APTIMA test, the Qiagen Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA (HC2) Test, and the AMPLICOR HPV Test.The sensitivity and specificity for the detection of high-risk HPV were 85.6% and 99.2% for the APTIMA test, 94.1% and 98.4% for the HC2 test, and 90.2% and 95.7% for the AMPLICOR test, respectively. As the severity of the cervical lesion progressed, the positive rate of the three tests indicated a similar increase. The clinical sensitivity and specificity for the detection of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) were 91.2% and 84.2% for the APTIMA test, 94.5% and 80.4% for the HC2 test, and 87.9% and 78.2% for the AMPLICOR test, respectively.The APTIMA is sensitive and specific for the detection of high-risk HPV. In the specimens with SIL, the APTIMA test is more specific than the HC2 and the AMPLICOR tests. This indicates that the APTIMA test may improve patient management and reduce the cost of screening.
