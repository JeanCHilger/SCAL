Prevalence and genotype distribution of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) among women in urban Tianjin, China. To investigate the prevalence and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among women in urban Tianjin, China. A cervical cancer screening program for 2,000 women aged 21-65 years old was performed in urban Tianjin from April to October in 2013. The program included ThinPrep cytologic tests (TCT), HPV DNA detection and genotyping using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with Pyrosequencing technology. Colposcopy examination and biopsy were needed if TCT reported greater or equal atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). One thousand nine hundred seventy-eight women were enrolled in the final study, 14.71% (291/1,978) of women were tested HPV positive. Of HPV-positive specimens, 248 (85.22%) and 43 (14.78%) were infected with high- and low-risk HPV genotypes, respectively. Twenty-eight types of HPV were detected in all, the most frequently detected types were HPV16, 58, 18, and 66 orderly. The single infection rate was 92.28% among HPV-positive samples while the multiple infection rate was 7.72%. Among multiple infection models, HPV16 was the most common type co-infection with other types. This study is, to our knowledge, the first population-based survey to provide data on HPV infection and genotype distribution among women in urban Tianjin, China. There was a high prevalence of HPV infection in this area, and HPV16, 58, 18, 66 were the most frequently detected genotypes. Our study provide important information regarding the necessity of early cervical cancer screenings and prophylactic HPV vaccinations, and the knowledge of HPV distribution can also inform us about the HPV ecological change after the vaccination.
