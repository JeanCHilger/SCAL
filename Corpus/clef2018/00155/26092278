Human Papillomavirus Test for Triage of Japanese Women With Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions. We evaluated high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA testing for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions by cobas HPV test and diagnostic HPV16/18 genotyping in Japanese women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Of 357 patients, HR-HPV positivity prevalence was 75.6%, and 21.3% had grade 2 or higher CIN lesions (CIN2+), with the highest prevalence at 30 to 34 years. Negative predictive values of HR-HPV for CIN2+ in our patients were 93.1% (any age) and 94.9% (40-50 years). Absolute risk for CIN2+ in HR-HPV positive and HPV16/18 positive individuals was 25.9 and 35.1, respectively. Relative risk for CIN2+ lesions was 5.1 for HPV16/18 positive versus HR-HPV negative, and 3.8 for HR-HPV positive versus HR-HPV negative women. Predictive values of CIN2+ positive were higher for HPV16/18 positive women (any age) than 12 other HPV positive-genotypes, and highest (50%) at 40-50 years. The HPV16/18 genotyping might prevent women (>40 years) at risk of high-grade CIN lesions from undergoing unnecessary colposcopy/overtreatment of nonprogressive lesions.
