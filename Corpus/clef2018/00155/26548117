Household survey on Human Papilloma Virus vaccine awareness among women of reproductive age in Ibadan, Nigeria. Cervical cancer is the commonest female genital tract malignancy associated with high mortality in sub-Saharan Africa due to poor prevention plan. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer, and the infection is vaccine preventable. Since the introduction of HPV vaccine, robust community surveys on awareness of the vaccine that capture end-users perspective is scarce. The aim of this study is to determine HPV vaccine awareness among women of reproductive age group.This was a household survey that used multi-stage random sampling conducted amongst 1002 women aged 18-49 years from August to September 2012 in Mokola area, Ibadan, south western Nigeria. A self-administered pre-tested questionnaire was used for data collection. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed, and statistical significance was set at 95% confidence level.The mean age was 29.8 +/- 8.2 years and 49.9% had female children. Only 4.6% had heard of HPV vaccine. A significantly higher odds of HPV vaccine awareness was found among highly skilled women, those initiating sexual intercourse at older ages women with multiple sexual partners and those aware that cervical cancer is preventable.The awareness of HPV vaccine is low. Policies and programs that will improve awareness utilising culturally sensitive messages are imperative.
