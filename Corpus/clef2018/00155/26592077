Outcome of Nonpersonalized Human Papillomavirus Vaccinations During Postconization Follow-up: A Report of Two Cases. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was conceived to prevent new HPV infections among uninfected young women. From the initial intentions, its use has been extended to older women and also tested as a therapeutic tool. We report two HPV vaccination outcomes during postconization follow-up.Two young women, with different clinical histories, were subjected to HPV vaccine after a loop electrosurgical excision procedure for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and persisting low-grade CIN. During follow-up both women experienced a worsening of cervical lesions, which resulted in invasive cervical cancer and severe dysplasia, respectively.Limited to our experience, a nonpersonalized HPV vaccine administration during postconization follow-up was expensive and unnecessary.
