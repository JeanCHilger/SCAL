Management of low-grade CIN: follow-up or treatment? To examine whether low-grade cervical dysplasia carries a higher risk of progression when associated with the cancer-related human papillomavirus types 16, 18, 31 or 33.Retrospective, with PCR-based HPV diagnosis on the original cervical biopsies from 71 patients with CIN I and II. CIN III developed in 34 lesions, and 37 showed complete regression during non-invasive follow-up.Progression occurred in 15/41 CIN I and in 19/30 CIN II lesions (P = 0.03). HPV DNA was detected in 43 specimens. CIN III developed in 25% of HPV-negative lesions, in 48% of HPV-positive CIN I lesions, and in 77% of HPV-positive CIN II lesions.Low-grade lesions are at higher risk of progression when associated with HPV types 16, 18, 31 or 33 (P = 0.002). HPV diagnosis can be useful in the triage of patients with low-grade CIN.
