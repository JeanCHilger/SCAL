Evaluation of seroreactivity to human papillomavirus type 16 virus-like particles in an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia. An ELISA to detect serum IgG antibody response to human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 virus-like particles (VLPs) was evaluated in a case-control study of cervical neoplasia, nested within a prospective cohort study. Subjects included 688 controls with continued normal cytology and 152 cases with confirmed incident squamous intraepithelial lesions who were tested for DNA for a broad spectrum of HPV types at cohort and follow-up of controls, 16.6% were seropositive compared with 30.8% and 52.4% of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively. Of HPV-16 DNA-negative subjects, 16.5% were seropositive. Seropositivity increased from 22.2% in subjects who were HPV-16 DNA-positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment or follow-up) to 83.3% in those who were HPV-16 DNA-positive at both time points. These data imply that serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator of persisting cervical HPV-16 infection.
