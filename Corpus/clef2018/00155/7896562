Cytological analysis for human papillomavirus DNAs in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by in situ hybridization. Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 DNAs are reported to be associated with uterine cervical cancer. In order to investigate the relationship between the presence of HPV DNA and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), we attempted the cytological detection of HPV DNAs in uterine cervical smear samples. The samples included those of severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIS). They were analysed by DNA-DNA in situ hybridization using biotinylated HPV DNA probes. The results of in situ hybridization analysis revealed that HPV sequences were present in the nuclei of cells with koilocytotic atypia. When probed for HPV type 6, 11, 16 and 18, the nuclei of dysplastic cells and cancer cells were positive for HPV type 16 and 18 DNA. Out of 26 CIN cases, 17 contained HPV type 16 DNA and 5 contained HPV type 18 DNA. We suggest that cytological analysis for HPV sequences by the in situ hybridization technique might provide a molecular diagnosis for assessment in uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
