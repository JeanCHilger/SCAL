Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions: cytologic predictors of biopsy confirmation. One hundred and seven smears demonstrating a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) were analyzed for features predicting subsequent biopsy confirmation. Twelve (29%) of 41 smears showing few LSIL cells were biopsy confirmed compared to 33 (60%) of 55 containing an intermediate number of LSIL cells and 9 (82%) of 11 displaying many LSIL cells (P < 0.002). Thirty-seven (47%) of 78 smears showing mainly condylomatous atypia (CA), 7 (54%) of 13 revealing predominantly cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN 1), and 10 (63%) of 16 displaying both CA and CIN 1 were histologically confirmed (N.S.). Biopsy confirmation was obtained in 35 (65%) of 54 women whose repeat smears obtained at colposcopy demonstrated SIL compared to four (15%) of 26 patients whose repeat smears were normal or contained atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (P < 0.001). These results suggest that the number of diagnostic cells in an LSIL smear predicts biopsy confirmation and affirm the validity of combining CA and CIN 1 under the category of LSIL in the Bethesda System.
