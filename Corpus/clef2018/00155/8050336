Prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 DNA sequences in CIN III lesions of adults and adolescents. Adolescents may be more susceptible to cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and may have more rapid progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplastic (CIN) lesions than adults. We evaluated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and cervical tissue specimens from a consecutive series of 25 adolescent (age 15-20 yr) and 17 adult (age 35-40 yr) patients with a histologic diagnosis of CIN III. The study patients were all Detroit residents enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO) affiliated with Henry Ford Hospital. The cervical tissue specimens were evaluated for HPV 6b/11, HPV 16, and HPV 18 using agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification. While the small sample size precluded testing for statistical significance, HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 DNA was detected in specimens from 21/25 (84%) adolescents compared to 12/17 (71%) adults (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-9.74). The relationship between adolescence and HPV infections appears to be stronger for HPV 18 and mixed HPV 16/18 infections (OR = 5.6
