Detection of human papillomavirus by nonradioactive hybridization. The presence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequence in cervical smears of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was investigated through dot blot using a nonradioactive method based on the principle of enhanced chemiluminiscence. From 154 samples examined, 59 (38.3%) had HPV-related sequences determined by dot-blot hybridization among these, 18 samples (11.68%) reacted either to HPV 6/11 or to HPV 16/18 probes, 20 (12.98%) reacted to only HPV 16/18, and 21 (13.63%) reacted exclusively to HPV 6/11. The relative sensitivity of the method was controlled comparing the results of both tests with those obtained by Southern blot in 32 samples. The risk of HPV positivity was increased in women who first had intercourse at an early age and in patients with CIN II or III. Both associations were significant at the 95% confidence interval (CI). An increased risk of HPV positivity was also associated with patient's age at diagnosis, education levels, number of sexual partners, and use of oral contraceptives, but none of these factors were significant at 95% CI. Other risk factors for cervical cancer, such as the number of pregnancies or cigarette smoking, were not found to be associated with HPV infection and indicate that the association of these factors with cervical cancer probably is independent of HPV infection. Even if HPV is the major risk factor for CIN, this also supports a multifactorial model of cervical cancer etiology with an increased risk of HPV infection.
