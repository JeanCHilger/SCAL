Cervical human papilloma virus infection of women attending social hygiene clinics in Hong Kong. To find the prevalence of HPV infection in women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Hong Kong.Cervical HPV infection was identified by cervical cytology and DNA filter in-situ-hybridization (Virapap) techniques in 207 women attending a social hygiene clinic. Other risk factors for cervical cancer were assessed and any association with HPV infection was sought. Statistical analysis was carried out using the chi 2-test.The prevalence of HPV infection in the 207 Chinese women was 8.2% by cervical smear and 12.6% by DNA filter in-situ-hybridization. Risk factors for cervical cancer were not significantly associated with HPV infection in this group, 95% of whom were prostitutes.The prevalence of HPV infection in this group at high risk for cervical cancer is higher than in low-risk pregnant women, however the prevalence of HPV infection in Hong Kong is at the low end of the range of figures quoted for Caucasians. The cause of such a low prevalence is yet to be determined.
