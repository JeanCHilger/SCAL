Intraepithelial lesions of the cervix uteri and human papillomaviruses: comparative study of histological data and in situ hybridization. Apropos of a series of 77 cervical biopsies. Seventy seven biopsy samples of cervical mucosa were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. From the 38 samples identified as condyloma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 31 were positive after in situ hybridization and 14 after immunochemical analysis. HPV 6 was found exclusively in condyloma acuminata (2 samples) whereas the HPV 16 probe essentially hybridized with high grade intraepithelial lesions (CIN II, CIN III). Low grade intraepithelial lesions (flat condyloma, CIN I) demonstrated a larger diversity of HPV types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33). A close correlation was demonstrated between the histologic features of lesions and their HPV 6 or HPV 31 content but not for other HPV types. HPV 31 containing lesions showed a peculiar architecture with numerous, elongated papillae resulting in a spiked appearance.
