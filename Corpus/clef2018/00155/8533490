Interferon-alpha controls HPV infection in cervix epithelium. Decreased immune response is necessary for a prolonged HPV-infection and allows HPV to be virulent as an oncogene. This study shows that HPV-infection in cervical epithelium is determined by the immune system and IFN-alpha can be shown to be a prognostic parameter for the HPV-infection. The cytokines (IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were measured using monoclonal IFN-antibodies and ELISA test. To detect HPV-16, PCR (e6 and e7 areas) was used, followed by southern-blot of the PCR-products. In all of our patients (n = 139) no cytological change was observed in the cervical epithelium over a period of 3 years. Comparison was made between 3 groups: 1: controls (n = 89, HPV-pos. n = 6) 2: registered prostitutes without drug abuse (n = 30, HPV-pos. n = 6) and 3: HIV-infected, previous drug users (CDC II, n = 20, HPV-pos. n = 2).The stimulated IFN-alpha values are highest in the control collective (169 +/- 35 U/ml) and are significantly lower in the prostitutes (98 +/- 26 U/ml, p < 0.05) and in the HIV-infected group (49 +/- 15 U/ml, p < 0.01). The difference between the latter groups being significant as well (p < 0.05). Dividing the controls into HPV-16 positive and HPV-16 negative subgroups, the IFN-alpha values are significantly higher in HPV-16 negative group (193 +/- 48 U/ml) compared to HPV-16 positive group (38 +/- 3 U/ml, p < 0.05). Also in the collective of prostitutes and HIV infected patients there is a similar significant difference between the HPV-16 positive and HPV-16 negative patients (Prostitutes: HPV-16 negative = 94 +/- 21 U/ml, HPV-16 positive = 36 +/- 7 U/ml, p < 0.05 HIV-infected: HPV-16 negative = 35 +/- 13 U/ml, HPV-16 positive = 13 +/- 3 U/ml).
