Type-specific prevalence of human papillomavirus DNA among Jamaican colposcopy patients. Human papillomavirus (HPV) types differ in their association with cervical cancer. Therefore, the types of HPV in precancerous lesions are important. In many regions with high cancer incidence, the HPV types in precancerous lesions have not been well studied. In Jamaica, a country that has high cervical cancer incidence, 174 colposcopy patients were tested for HPV DNA using polymerase chain reaction. HPV DNA detection was strongly related to presence and grade of cervical neoplasia (P<.001). Furthermore, severe neoplastic change was most highly associated with HPV DNA types also considered high-risk for severe neoplasia in other populations. HPV-45 DNA, a high-risk type uncommon in most previously tested countries, was detected in 12% of patients who had neoplasia. Thus, cervical neoplasia in Jamaica, as elsewhere, is linked to HPV. The high prevalence of HPV-45 was notable, and its relation to high cervical cancer incidence in Jamaica must be assessed.
