Proliferative T cell responses to human papillomavirus type 16 L1 peptides in patients with cervical dysplasia. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) can cause genital warts, cervical dysplasias and carcinoma of the cervix. Cell-mediated immunity is thought to be important in protection against the virus and in its elimination, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. In a cross-sectional study we have demonstrated proliferative T cell responses to peptides representing the HPV-16 L1 capsid protein (aa 199-409) in the peripheral blood of 63% of patients (n = 41) with histological evidence of cervical dysplasia and in 45% of healthy age-matched controls (n = 11). This was achieved by generating short-term T cell lines (STLs) from each individual in vitro against a beta-galactosidase-HPV- 16 L1 (aa 199-409) fusion protein for 2 weeks, and then identifying the HPV epitopes they recognized with overlapping synthetic peptides (15-mers) spanning this region in 3 day specificity assays. Histological grading and HPV typing by PCR were performed on patients' cervical biopsies taken at the same clinical visit as the peripheral blood samples. An immunogenic region was identified between aa 311-345 in 73% of patients (18% in controls) who responded to HPV-16 L1 (aa 199-409). The number of responders to this region was significantly higher in patients with HPV-16-positive biopsies when compared to those with HPV-16-negative biopsies (P = 0.006), as was the number of responders to individual peptides 311-325 (NLASSNYFPTPSGSM p = 0.04) and 321-335 (PSGSMVTSDAQIFNK
