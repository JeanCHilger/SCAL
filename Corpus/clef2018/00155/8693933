HPV-types, cytological and histopathological findings in three groups of women with possible HPV-related disease. The aim of this investigation was to study three groups of women presenting with possible HPV-infection with regard to HPV-types and cervical dysplasia.Eighty women were included. Eighteen of them were present partners to men with condylomas, 20 had clinical vulvar HPV-lesions and 42 were referred due to an abnormal PAP-smear. Samples for HPV-analysis by PCR-technique were taken from the vulva, the portio and the cervical canal. A universal HPV-primer as well as specific primers for HPV 6/11, 16, 18, 31, and 33 were utilized. PAP-smears were taken as well as biopsies from cervix/portio.Seventy-eight percent had HPV-DNA identified. Sixty-seven percent of those with HPV 16 and/or 18 had dysplasia verified by histopathology and 50% of those with 31 and/or 33. Twenty of 21 women with dysplasia had HPV 16, 18, 31 and/or 33 identified. One woman with dysplasia was HPV-negative. Histopathologically verified CIN were diagnosed in all groups investigated. Women referred for suspicion of CIN significantly more often had HPV detected at the cervix/portio. HPV 6/11 was mostly found in women with condylomas. Apart from this the occurrence of the different HPV types were alike in the three groups.Infection with HPV is a process and the usefulness of different diagnostic methods seems to depend on when during the course of the disease they are used. HPV-findings in women with dysplasia were all associated with oncogenic virus-types. High-risk virus was often found simultaneously with low-risk virus indicating a covariation in the acquisition of the different HPV-types.
