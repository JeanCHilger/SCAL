HPV 16 DNA sequences in different grades of cervical lesions. A simple rapid method for isolation of genomic DNA from cervical scrape cells has been standardized. Sufficient amount of good quality genomic DNA was isolated from each cervical scrape specimen. Total 120 cervical scrape specimens from wide spectrum of cervical lesions were analysed for the presence of HPV 16 DNA by Southern hybridization using 32P labelled HPV 16 DNA as probe under stringent conditions. Viral DNA sequences were detected in 78 of the specimens. About 36% (5 out of 14) of normal cervical smears and 59% (46 out of 78) of inflammatory cervical smears had the viral DNA sequences. Except a lone sample, the rest 27 samples of different grades of dysplasia specimens and squamous cell carcinoma samples had viral DNA sequences. Due to development of sensitive Southern hybridization method, the presence of HPV 16 DNA could be detected in high percentage of specimens belonging to the inflammatory cervical specimens.
