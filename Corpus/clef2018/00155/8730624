Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus. To investigate the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN).A prospective study to determine the prevalence of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in 111 HIV-positive women.In total, 111 HIV + women were enrolled and underwent cervical biopsy and CD4 T-lymphocyte determination. Of the 111 women, 26 (23.4%) had CIN and another 26 (23.4%) had histologic evidence of cervicitis.No significant difference was found between transmission group, CDC stage of disease, CD4 T-lymphocyte count and pregnancy. There was a significant association with concomitant human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (P < 0.001).Public health measures are needed to provide Papanicolaou smear screening and appropriate clinical follow-up and treatment of women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
