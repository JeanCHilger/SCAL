Retrospective study of cervical papillomavirus lesions: early Herpes simplex virus proteins as markers of risk for progression. Specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are currently implicated as etiologic agent of benign and malignant lesions of the genital tract. Previous studies highlighted the presence of early proteins (ICSP 11/12) of Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) mainly in HPV infected lesions of the cervix. This paper reports a retrospective study on the clinical course of benign cervical alterations in a 70 women population followed-up for 24 months. HPV and HSV-2 (late and early) antigens were detected by immunoperoxidase HPV 6/11 and 16/18 were identified by in situ hybridization. All CIN III, vs only one CIN I progressed. The majority of regressions (55%) was CIN I, and 61% was characterized by the negativization of viral markers. There was a cyclic and/or chronic expression of viral antigens in progressed and persistent cases (67% and 53%, respectively). Furthermore, a significant correlation between progression and the presence of ICSP 11/12 protein has been found (89% of cases). The simultaneous detection of ICSP 11/12 and HPV 16/18 in 78% of progressed, and in 13% of persistent lesions was noteworthy. This association (ICSP 11/12 and HPV DNA 16/18) may be considered as a risk factor for progression of the lesions, and supports the hypothesis of a synergism of both viruses in the natural history of cervical cancer: the continuous expression of ICSP 11/12 during herpetic recurrences might act as a mutagenic factor in HPV infected tissues.
