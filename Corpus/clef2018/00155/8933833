Association of risk factors for cervical cancer and human papilloma viruses in invasive cervical cancer. Our study was carried out on 70 patients with invasive squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix (CC) or invasive adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix at all stages, admitted to the University Department of Gynecology and/or to the Institute of Oncology in Ljubljana. The patients were not selected by age. A questionnaire on known risk factors in CC was filled in for each of the 70 patients, and two tumor smears were taken for the determination of human papilloma viruses (HPV) 16 and 18 by means of in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Each patient also had the serum level of vitamin A determined. The results of our study revealed a correlation between HPV 16 or 18 infection (60:40) and CC. When analysing some already known risk factors, no statistically significant difference could be established for any of the factors studied, except for the age at first birth.
