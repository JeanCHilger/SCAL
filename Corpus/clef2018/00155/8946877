Papillary squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix: report of a case with HPV 16 DNA and brief review. Papillary squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) of the uterine cervix is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). It is characterized by a papillary architecture and markedly atypical epithelium. Invasion and metastasis have been reported. We report a case of PSCC in a 72-year-old woman who subsequently tested positive for HPV 16. To our knowledge, this is the first report of HPV typing in a case of PSCC. Our finding of a high-risk HPV type in PSCC may help explain why PSCC has been reported to have a clinical course similar to that of nonpapillary SCC.
