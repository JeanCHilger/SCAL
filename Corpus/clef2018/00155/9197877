Simultaneous effects of aneuploidy and oncogenic human papillomavirus on histological grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To investigate whether ploidy and oncogenic human papillomavirus types can be correlated with the histological grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in the same tissue sections.Histological data were obtained from 292 dysplastic lesions of the cervix and classified according to the CIN and the Bethesda terminologies. The samples were analysed using Feulgen-stained image analysis cytometry for ploidy and Human papillomaviruses DNA typing by in situ hybridisation, respectively.Colposcopy Clinic at Alfred Fournier Institute, Paris.Three hundred and forty women referred for an abnormal cervical smear.The ploidy data strongly segregate high grade from low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (aneuploidy 78% versus 21% P < 0.0001). There was a significant association between aneuploidy and the severity of the lesions (94% for CIN 3, 55% for CIN 2 and 14% for CIN 1High risk human papillomavirus types do not exert and an independent effect on the histological grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
