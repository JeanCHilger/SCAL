Association of infections with human immunodeficiency virus and human papillomavirus in Honduras. The etiologic role of the oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of cervical cancer has been widely proven. Since this cancer occurs more frequently in immunosuppressed individuals, we sought to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-noninfected prostitutes in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Cervical scrapes were collected from 23 HIV-seropositive and 28 HIV-seronegative prostitutes for HPV DNA detection by the polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-six percent of the HIV-seropositive women and only 18% of the seronegative women were HPV DNA positive (odds ratio = 6.0). In addition, there was a significant association between seropositivity for HIV with a history of sexually transmitted diseases (P < 0.01). Our data confirm the association between infections with HIV and HPV.Numerous studies have revealed a higher prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)--etiologically linked to the development of cervical cancer--in women infected with HIV.  This study investigated the association of HPV and HIV among 51 prostitutes in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.  23 were HIV-positive.  All participants were in their early thirties, had had at least one pregnancy, and experienced their first pregnancy at a mean age of 16 years.  Polymerase chain reaction identified HPV DNA in cervical scrapes from 13 (56.5%) HIV-positive women compared with only 5 (18%) HIV-negative prostitutes (odds ratio, 6.0 95% confidence interval, 1.5-26.7).  In addition, there was a significant association between HIV and a history of other sexually transmitted diseases (p  0.01).  Since the progression to invasive cervical disease is more aggressive in HIV-infected women, prostitutes and other women at risk of both these infections should receive frequent cytologic screening and counseling.
