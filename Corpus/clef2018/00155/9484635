Squamous intraepithelial lesions in cervical smears of human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive adolescents. Various authors have reported a high rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related neoplasias in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive women. On the other hand, young women are most susceptible to cervical infection because of immaturity of the cervix, as it appears that HPV has more access to the basal cells of the differentiating epithelium. The purpose of the present work was to study cervical smears of 82 adolescent HIV-seropositive women (13-21 years of age) to search for cytological evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias. Twenty-one cases showed characteristic features of HPV infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL 25.6%). Sixteen cases aged from 17 to 21 years (mean age 19.5 years) had low-grade SIL (LSIL
