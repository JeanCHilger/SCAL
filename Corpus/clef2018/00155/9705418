Low false-negative rate of PCR analysis for detecting human papillomavirus-related cervical lesions. Although PCR analysis is a sensitive test for detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the cervix, the proportion of cases of cervical dysplasia missed, or the false-negative rate, has been unknown. We determined the accuracy of PCR analysis for HPV DNA as a predictor of HPV-related cervical lesions in a cross-sectional study of sexually active women, aged 18 to 50 years, from the University of Michigan Family Medicine HPV study. Of 133 eligible participants, 41 underwent colposcopy because of a positive result for HPV of the cervix by the PCR method and 92 underwent screening colposcopy with biopsy prior to knowing the HPV PCR results. Twenty-four of those screened were subsequently found to also be HPV DNA positive. In those found to be HPV positive, histological studies revealed the presence of condyloma or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in 16 women (24.6%) and changes suggestive of condyloma in 5 (7.6%). No HPV-negative woman had an abnormal biopsy or cytology report (P = 0. 000001). The false-negative rate (1 - sensitivity) for HPV PCR analysis for detection of the presence of a cervical HPV-related lesion was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.047), and the specificity was 60.7%. In summary, PCR analysis for HPV DNA had a very low false-negative rate for predicting HPV-related lesions of the cervix in a community-based population. This supports the validity of using the absence of HPV at the cervix, as determined by PCR testing, as an inclusion criterion for patients in control groups in studies dealing with low-grade cervical lesions.
