Evaluation of the detection of human papillomavirus genotypes in cervical specimens by hybrid capture as screening for precancerous lesions in HIV-positive women. Given the frequency and persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and associated cytological alterations in HIV-1-positive women, the incidence of uterine cervix neoplasm is likely to increase along with patient survival. More appropriate screening programs, which, in addition to Pap smears (PS), also include tests to detect and type HPV, are needed for the early identification of precancerous cervical lesions. This prospective study involved 168 HIV-positive (group A) and 100 HIV-negative women (group B). Cervicovaginal samples were collected for a PS and HPV DNA search. The detected virus was typed as high-intermediate oncogenic risk HPV (HR-HPV) and low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) using hybrid capture (HC) (Murex-Digene) and in-house PCR tests. The HC-detected prevalence of HPV was 111/168 (66%:HR 75.6%) in group A and 15/100 (15%:HR 42.9%) in group B (P < 0.0001). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive in 91% and 48%, respectively. No significant difference was observed between drug addicts and heterosexual HIV-1-positive women (P = 0.09). HPV was detected in 94% of the 57 HIV-positive women with cytological alterations. HR-HPV was found in 41/49 women with low-grade and 7/8 with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL, respectively). In women with a negative PS, HPV was detected in 57/111 cases (HR 63%) of group A and in 13/98 of group B (6 cases of HR). Of the 54 group A women who underwent biopsy, histology revealed that 41 had LSIL (18 with negative PS, 19 with LSIL, and 4 with HSIL HR-HPV in 73% and LR-HPV in 17%), nine had HSIL (5 LSIL and 4 HSIL on cytology
