Virological and biological characteristics of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I with marked koilocytotic atypia. The aim of this study was to evaluate virologic and biological significance of marked koilocytotic atypia observed in some cases of grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I). Thirty-one CIN I cervical biopsy specimens with marked koilocytotic atypia, defined by the presence of meganuclei in the superficial epithelial layers, were compared to 37 CIN I biopsy specimens with usual koilocytes for (1) the human papillomavirus (HPV) type and signal pattern as detected by nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) (2) the proliferation index assessed by Ki 67 immunostaining and (3) the p53 labeling pattern. Interobserver agreement for meganuclei was excellent (k = 0.9). Twenty-five out of 68 biopsies (37%) were positive by ISH for the 6 of 11 HPV probe, 30 (44%) for the 16-18 probe, and 7 (10%) for the 31/33 HPV probe, 6 (9%) were negative for ISH. The presence of meganuclei was strongly related to high and intermediate risk HPV type (P = 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of meganuclei for the detection of high or intermediate risk HPV in CINI were 73 and 87%, respectively. Loss of p53 immunostaining in the lower third of the epithelium was also related to the presence of meganuclei (P < .05), but the MIB-1 index and ISH labeling pattern were not. In conclusion, marked koilocytotic atypia in CIN I is a reliable and sensitive marker for infection by high or intermediate-risk HPV, and might be a guide to therapy.
