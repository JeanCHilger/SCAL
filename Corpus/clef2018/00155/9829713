Human leukocyte antigen class I/II alleles and development of human papillomavirus-related cervical neoplasia: results from a case-control study conducted in the United States. The host immune response to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is believed to be an important determinant of progression of HPV-associated cervical neoplasia. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are important in the presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system. Previous studies have suggested a possible association between HLA and cervical neoplasia, but the specific alleles found to be associated with disease have varied between studies. To further evaluate this issue, we conducted a nested case-control study within a 24,000-woman cohort study in the United States. A total of 711 women were selected for the study: 141 women diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) of the cervix 202 women diagnosed with low-grade SILs (LSILs)
