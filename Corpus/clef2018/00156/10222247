Balance of IgG subclasses toward human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L1-capsids is a possible predictor for the regression of HPV16-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is known to be a major causative agent of cervical cancer. To test the hypothesis that an enhanced Th1 response favors the natural course of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), we measured IgG subclasses toward HPV16 L1-capsids because IgG1/IgG2 balance reflects Th2 and Th1 responses, respectively. We examined IgG2/IgG1 ratios in sera from 67 anti-HPV16 L1-positive women 18 were cytologically normal women, 29 were CIN patients, and 20 were cervical cancer patients. The IgG2 dominance (IgG2/IgG1 ratio >1) was observed in 94, 48, and 5%, respectively (p < 0.001). The regression rate of CIN lesions was significantly different between patients with and without IgG2 dominance: 83.3% (5/6) versus 16.7% (1/6), respectively (p < 0.05). These findings raise the possibility that IgG2 dominance toward HPV16 L1-capsids, i.e., Th1 dominance, may be a useful marker to predict viral clearance or the regression of HPV16-positive CIN.
