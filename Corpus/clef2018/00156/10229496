"ASCUS, rule out HSIL": cytologic features, histologic correlates, and human papillomavirus detection. Risk factors, cytologic and histopathologic features, and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection associated with 75 cervical smears classified as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASCUS, rule out HSIL) were reviewed. Cases were identified in a pathology panel review of material collected from 1953 women participating in a 5-year prospective study of HPV infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions at Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Initial abnormal smears diagnosed as ASCUS, rule out HSIL by one panelist or diagnosed as ASCUS by one pathologist and as HSIL by another were included. The 75 ASCUS, rule out HSIL smears identified were examined again by two pathologists after the study. These cases were compared with cases of ASCUS, not otherwise specified (ASCUS, NOS) and HSIL identified in the same group of 1953 women. Findings in ASCUS, rule out HSIL included tissue fragments (21%) atypical immature metaplasia (17%)
