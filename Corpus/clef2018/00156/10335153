Abnormal Papanicolaou smears, genital tract infections, and contraception. Cervical cancer ranks second among all cancers in women world-wide, and the rate of invasive cervical cancer among women under 50 is rising in the United States. Risk factors for abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and invasive cervical cancer include genital tract infections. This study was designed to compare the rates of genital tract infections and the contraceptive choices of a random sample of 800 women, using an ex post facto design. The Pap positive women had a significantly higher rate of genital tract infections than did the Pap negative women but did not differ significantly in use of contraceptive methods. Findings support those of other researchers suggesting genital tract infections as risk factors for abnormal Pap smears and are consistent with the literature in suggesting a role for oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in acquisition of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Caregivers can help empower women to reduce their risks through informed choices about protection and sexual behaviors.
