Prevalence of serum antibodies to LA-1 oncoprotein, herpes simplex virus type-2 glycoprotein and human papillomavirus type 16 transactivator (E2) protein among Indian women with cervical neoplasia. Prevalence of serum antibodies to synthetic peptide to oncoprotein of LA-1 known as oncogene of herpes simplex virus type-2, herpes simplex virus type-2 glycoprotein-D as an determinant of viral pathogenicity and human papillomavirus type 16 transactivator E2 protein was studied among 46 Indian women with cervical neoplasia using immunoblot assay for HSV-2 gD glycoprotein and LA-1 antibodies as well as peptide ELISA assay to detect HPV16 E2 antibodies. The seropositivity to LA-1 oncoprotein was found to be high (61%) among patients with invasive cervical carcinoma as compared to 35% in various grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 36% in normal control women. In contrast to this, a uniformly high frequency of antibody to HPV 16 E2 was observed among women with CIN (68%), normal healthy controls (50%) and invasive cervical carcinoma (43%). However, a low frequency of seropositivity (13%) to recombinant vaccinia virus HSV-2 gD protein was found among 15 tested sera each from group of women with various grades of CIN as well as invasive cervical carcinoma as compared to 28% among seven normal healthy control. A negative correlation of LA-1 and HPV16 E2 seropositivity on patient by patient comparison among CIN and invasive cervical carcinoma group was observed which is statistically significant (P = 0.019 for CIN P = 0.038 for invasive cervical carcinoma). However, a positive correlation (P = 0.144) was found among normal control women. The study has shown a desirable serological marker of cervical neoplasia. This serological marker could be employed as a screening tool in conjunction with cytopathological screening to diagnose women harbouring LA-1 oncogene associated cervical lesions.
