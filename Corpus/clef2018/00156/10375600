Suppression of tumorigenicity in cervical carcinoma HeLa cells by an episomal form of adeno-associated virus. To compare the oncosuppressive activity of integrated and episomal adeno-associated virus (AAV), two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) derived episomal form vectors, p205 and p220, were used to generate plasmids containing episomal AAV. HeLa cells transfected with p205, p220, and the plasmids with forward (pA205-1, pA220-1) and reverse (pA205-1, pA220-2) orientation of inserted AAV DNA were designated H205, H220, HA205-1, HA220-1, HA205-1, and Ha220-2, respectively. The respective average copy numbers of pA205 and pA220 per cell are 4.9-6.9 and 4.3. The AAV-transfected HeLa cells displayed growth inhibition when compared to parental and the vector-transfected HeLa cells. Nude mice assay showed that the tumor size from HA205-1 and HA205-2 cells were 11.3 and 22.6%, and those from HA220-1 and HA220-2 cells were 54.8 and 57.3%, respectively, when compared to parental HeLa cells. HA205-1 cells containing forward AAV insert exerted more oncosuppressive effect than HA205-2 cells containing reverse AAV insert. Our data indicate that the episomal AAV can exert oncosuppressive activity as compared to the integrated AAV in HeLa cells.
