Human papillomavirus infection in adolescents. The recent gain in knowledge of the genomic function of HPV has led to a greater understanding of the natural history of HPV infection in women, starting from infection to the development of invasive cancer. LSIL is reflective of a benign process associated with HPV replication, and in the majority of women, HPV is eradicated or put into some type of immunologic control so that it remains undetected. In contrast, in the minority of women who have persistent infection, HSIL and invasive cancer are more likely to occur. These findings can be translated clinically to suggest that LSIL can be followed up for a defined period of time and that HPV testing in older women may be useful to identify persistent HPV infections and subsequent risk for invasive cancers.
