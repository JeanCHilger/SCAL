High-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid as an adjunct marker in cervical cytology. This study was designed to determine whether screening for high-risk human papillomaviruses testing could improve the detection of cervical dysplasia and cancer in assistance with conventional Papanicoloau (Pap) smears.The study was based on 114 patients with abnormal Pap smears referred for colposcopy from Feb. 1997 to Dec. 1997. The presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was determined with the Hybrid Capture method (including HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). Cytologic examination by Papanicolaou smear was based on the Bethesda system and cervical biopsy was done via colposcopy.Cytologic examination demonstrated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) in 24 patients with HPV positive (75%), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) in 38 with 61% HPV positive, and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) in 52 with 37% HPV positive. Among patients with a cytologic diagnosis of borderline abnormalities (ASCUS or LSIL), those with who were HPV positive were significantly more likely to have cervical dysplasia (both p < 0.05). The sensitivity of combined HPV assay and/or cytology for detection of noninvasive precursor (91%) was significantly greater than those of cytology (68%) or HPV assay (81%) alone.The addition of the hybrid capture high-risk HPV DNA assay to cytologic examination of cervical smears appears to increase the sensitivity of cervical screening. Our findings suggest that HPV DNA may be a useful adjunct marker for early detection of cervical dysplasia in women with minimally abnormal Pap smears (ASCUS/low-grade SIL).
