Cidofovir, a new approach for the treatment of cervix intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III). Cervix intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III) is an intraepithelial proliferative process with different levels of severity depending on both the extension of the proliferation in the epithelium and the presence of cellular atypia. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly associated with such lesions. The results of a preliminary study are described on the local application of cidofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate derivative with broad-spectrum anti-DNA virus activity for the treatment of CIN III. Cidofovir 1% in gel was applied three times, every other day, on the cervix of each of 15 women with biopsy proven CIN III. Within 1 month after the start of treatment, the cervix was removed surgically. Histology and human papillomavirus polymerase chain reaction (HPV-PCR) were carried out. In 7 of the 15 patients the histology showed a complete response, whereas 5 patients had a partial response characterized by the persistence of CIN II-III lesions, 1 patient had a dysplasia of lower grade (CIN I), and 2 patients did not show differences in the histology. Complete response was confirmed by PCR in 4 of the 7 patients, with complete response histologically. Cidofovir was not toxic to the normal epithelium. Cidofovir 1% gel was able to inhibit partially or completely cervical dysplasia lesions after only three applications (every other day). This effect was specific and tissue other than the dysplastic epithelium was not affected by the treatment.
