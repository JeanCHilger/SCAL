High-risk HPV DNA detection by Hybrid Capture II. An adjunctive test for mildly abnormal cytologic smears in women > or = 50 years of age. To determine whether high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing could improve the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer in older women (> or = 50 years old) with mildly abnormal results on conventional cytology.The study was based on 119 patients aged over 50 (median, 62 range, 50-78) referred for colposcopy with Pap smears reported as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) from February 1997 to September 1998. The presence of high-risk HPV DNA (including HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) was determined with the Hybrid Capture II (Digene, Inc., Silver Spring, Maryland) microplate method. Cytologic examination by Pap smear was based on the Bethesda System and, cervical biopsy was done via colposcopy.High-risk HPV DNA was demonstrated in 75.6% (34/45) of patients with LSIL and 52.7% (39/74) with ASCUS. Those who were HPV positive were significantly more likely to have CIN or cancer (odds ratio, 33.40 95% confidence interval, 11.89-93.97The addition of a high-risk HPV DNA assay to cytologic examination appears to provide excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value for early detection of high grade CIN or cancer in older women with minimally abnormal Pap smears.
