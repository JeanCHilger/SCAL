Detection of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in human neoplastic endometrium: lack of correlation with established prognostic factors. HPV (types 16 and 18) DNA sequences are present in the majority of precancerous and cancerous lesions of the human uterine cervix. However, data concerning the involvement of HPVs infection in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer are controversial. In the current study we investigated the frequency of the HPV types 16 and 18, detected by PCR amplification using the type 16- and 18-specific primers within the E7 Open Reading Frame (ORF) sequence, in 54 human endometrial carcinomas obtained from women of Polish origin. Moreover, we assessed the possible association of the HPV with the clinicopathological features of the cancer, patients' outcome as well as with the K-ras codon 12 gene point mutations. HPV type 16 was present in eleven out of 54 (20%) endometrial tumors, while HPV type 18 was detected only in three out of 54 (4%) neoplasms analyzed. HPV infection was not related either to the patients' age (r=0.11 p=0.428, Spearman correlation test) or to the clinicopathological parameters and patients' prognosis. A higher incidence of HPV 16/18 was detected in well (G1) differentiated than in moderately (G2) and poorly (G3) differentiated endometrial adenocarcinomas, but the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, none of HPV-positive endometrial carcinomas harbored K-ras codon 12 gene point mutations. Our results suggest that some of the endometrial carcinomas are associated with HPV infection but the presence of the human papillamovirus types 16/18 is not related to the clinicopathological or prognostical features of the neoplasm.
