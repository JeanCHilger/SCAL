Medullary thyroid carcinoma: an accurate pre-operative diagnosis by reverse transcription-PCR. To study the expression of calcitonin (CT) and thyroglobulin mRNA in samples of leftover cells in needles used for fine-needle aspiration biopsy either from thyroid tumours or cervical lymph nodes.Specimens were analysed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 12 samples from 11 patients were included and molecular diagnosis was compared with cytological or histological diagnosis and serum CT measurements.Transcripts of the CT gene were detected in all six patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) but in none of the other patients.Present data reinforce this technique as a reliable and alternative tool to establish the pre-operative diagnosis of MTC, especially when cytological examination is not conclusive or when cytological information is not in agreement with clinical data. Furthermore, it may be clinically useful to identify those conditions in which increased serum CT in the presence of a thyroid nodule is not due to MTC.
