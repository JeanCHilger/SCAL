High risk HPV and p53 protein expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical intraepithelial lesions due to HPV infection are common in Brazil. An understanding of the mechanisms of the interaction between HPV and host factors is still incomplete. In spite of the high incidence of cervical cancer in Brazil, such studies with Brazilian patients are scarce. The purpose of this study was to correlate the presence of high-risk types of HPV and expression of p53 protein, grade of cervical lesion, age, high-risk sexual behaviors and smoking. It was also intended to establish whether p53 expression might be useful as a marker for CIN progression.HPV detection was performed on paraffin sections using biotin-labeled probes by in situ hybridization. p53 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.Seventy-eight patients with cervical dysplasia were included in the study. CIN 1 was diagnosed in 38 cases, and CIN 2+3 in 40 cases. High-risk HPV was detected in 42 patients. No correlation was found between the grade of cervical lesion or the presence of HPV and smoking, and high-risk sexual behavior. Expression of p53 was significantly higher in CIN 1, as compared with CIN 2+3, but did not correlate with HPV status.Higher expression of p53 protein in early lesions supports the hypothesis of a partially protective role of the wild-type p53 in early stages of cervical lesions.
