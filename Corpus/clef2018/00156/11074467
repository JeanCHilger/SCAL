Presence of human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus in the cervix of women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was sought in cervical scrapings from 110 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women to evaluate the role of these viruses as risk factors for squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. By using PCR, presence of HPV-DNA and EBV-DNA was found in 60.9% (67/110) and in 10% (11/110) of clinical samples, respectively. Identification of oncogenic group of HPV by hybrid capture (HC II, Murex-Digene) indicated the presence of low-risk HPV in 13 (19.4%) patients, high-risk HPV in 28 (41.8%), and both types of HPV in 26 (38.8%) patients. Squamous intraepithelial lesions were present in 59 cases, being low-grade (n = 52) and high-grade (n = 7) lesions. HPV was detected in 84.7% of patients with lesions, in association with low-grade (43/52) and high-grade lesions (7/7), and in 33% of patients without lesions. EBV-DNA was detected in 8 patients with low-grade lesions and in 3 patients without lesions. Concurrent genital HPV and EBV infection was observed in 9 cases. HPV was associated with detection of squamous intraepithelial lesions [OR = 3.55 95% CI = (1.96
