Significance of high-risk human papillomavirus detection by polymerase chain reaction in primary cervical cancer screening. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to assess its diagnostic usefulness in primary cervical screening. PCR testing for HPV type 16, 18, 31 and 33 was performed on 1305 specimens obtained during routine cervical cancer screening. We analysed the concurrent cervical smears and biopsy, and correlated them with the HPV infection status. We also evaluated histologically-proven cases with ASCUS smears according to HPV infection. HPV DNA was identified in eight (0.7%) of 1144 cytologically normal patients nine (10.5%) of 86 ASCUS
