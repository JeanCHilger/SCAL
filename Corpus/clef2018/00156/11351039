Typing of human papillomavirus by pyrosequencing. The possibility of using a new bioluminometric DNA sequencing technique, called pyrosequencing, for typing of human papillomaviruses (HPV) was investigated. A blinded pyrosequencing test was performed on an HPV test panel of 67 GP5+/GP6+ PCR-derived amplification products. The 67 clinical DNA samples were sequenced up to 25 bases and sequences were searched using BLAST. All of the samples were correctly genotyped by pyrosequencing and the results were unequivocally in accordance with the results obtained from conventional DNA sequencing. Pyrosequencing was found to be a fast and efficient tool for identifying individual HPV types. Furthermore, pyrosequencing has the capability of determining novel HPV types as well as HPV sequence variants harboring mutation(s). The method is robust and well suited for large-scale programs.
