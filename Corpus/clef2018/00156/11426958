High prevalence of oncogenic human papillomavirus in the genital tract of women with human immunodeficiency virus. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Mexico.Cases included women who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and accepted to participate. There were two control groups in this study: group A, heterosexual partners of HIV+ men group B, commercial sex workers. Gynecologic examination was performed in all participants. Also, a cervical smear with colposcopy and a sample for detection of HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained in all subjects, as were CD4+ counts. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence interval were calculated.Eighty-five HIV+ women agreed to participate in this study the route of HIV infection was heterosexual in 78.8%We observed a high prevalence of oncogenic HPV types in HIV-positive women. These women should be screened regularly for early diagnosis of premalignant lesions and prevention of cervical cancer.
