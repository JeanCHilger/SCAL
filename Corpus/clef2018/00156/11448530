Analysis of E6 variants of human papillomavirus type 33, 52 and 58 in Japanese women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia/cervical cancer in relation to their oncogenic potential. The variation of the E6 region of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is associated with a high risk for cervical carcinogenesis. To see whether the same is the case with HPV33, 52 and 58, known to have high homology with HPV16, we analyzed the E6 sequence variation of these HPVs in 107 Japanese women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical cancer (ICC): 20 HPV33-positive, 46 HPV52-positive and 41 HPV58-positive cases. HPV33 variants were more frequently observed in CINs I/II than in CIN III/ICCs (71% (5/7) versus 15% (2/13), P=0.02). In HPV52-positive cases, a single E6 variant was detected in 98% of the cases, whereas the prototype accounted for 98% of HPV58-positive cases. In summary, the distribution of E6 variants is different among HPV types tested, suggesting a link between E6 variation and oncogenic potential being type-specific.
