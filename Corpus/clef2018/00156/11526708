HPV infection. Clinical features and treatment. The aspecific and exiguous symptoms and the lacking information are among the reasons of the diffusion of the vulvo-vaginal papillomatosis. We carried out the present study between 1995 and 1999 in the outpatient clinic of cervico-vaginal pathology of the Second University of Naples. 680 patients (aged between 18 and 56 years) underwent vulvoscopic and colposcopic examination. The did not show any relevant symptoms specific for HPV infection. Among the viral strains, HPV-16 and HPV 18 are able to induce a cervical cancer. To eliminate the pathology the primary prevention is necessary: it consist of both an adequate information about the micro-condilomatosis, the role of the activator agent, the modality of the infection, and the annual screening examinations such as pap-test and colposcopy. As first line treatment during secondary prevention, we utilize Roferon A, and perform diathermocoagulation according with the local diffusion and the degree of the disease (mild, moderate, severe). At the end of the therapy with Roferon A we observed that the infective focus was eliminated in about 60% of the cases and, only for moderate and severe micro-condilomatosis a diathermocoagulation was necessary.
