Asian-American variants of human papillomavirus 16 and risk for cervical cancer: a case-control study. Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) has a number of variants, each with a different geographic distribution and some that are associated more often with invasive neoplasias. We investigated whether the high incidence of cervical cancer in Mexico (50 cases per 100 000 women) may be associated with a high prevalence of oncogenic HPV16 variants.Cervical samples were collected from 181 case patients with cervical cancer and from 181 age-matched control subjects, all from Mexico City. HPV16 was detected with an E6/E7 gene-specific polymerase chain reaction, and variant HPV classes and subclasses were identified by sequencing regions of the E6 and L1/MY genes. Clinical data and data on tumor characteristics were also collected. All statistical tests were two-sided.HPV16 was detected in cervical scrapes from 50.8% (92 of 181) of case patients and from 11% (20 of 181) of control subjects. All HPV16-positive samples, except one, contained European (E) or Asian-American (AA) variants. AA and E variants were found statistically significantly more often in case patients (AA = 23.2% [42 of 181] E = 27.1% [49 of 181]) than in control subjects (AA = 1.1% [two of 181]The high frequency of HPV16 AA variants, which appear to be more oncogenic than E variants, might contribute to the high incidence of cervical cancer in Mexico.
