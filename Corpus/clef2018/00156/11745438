Adeno-associated virus seropositivity and HPV-induced cervical cancer in Spain and Colombia. Extensive experimental and limited epidemiologic data suggest that adeno-associated viruses (AAV) can have antioncogenic activity and may be protective factors for the development of cervical cancer. To examine the association between AAV-2 IgG antibodies and cervical neoplasia in Spain and Colombia, we tested for AAV-2 antibodies using an ELISA assay for 109 women with invasive cervical cancer, 100 population-based controls age-matched to the invasive cases, 77 women with carcinoma in situ (CIN III) and 100 clinic-based controls age-matched to the CIN III cases. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was detected in cervical exfoliated cells by polymerase chain reaction using HPV-L1 and GP5+/6+ consensus primers. The prevalence of AAV-2 antibody titers >100 was significantly lower in invasive cervical cancer cases than control participants. When comparing women with invasive cancer with controls or with CIN III cases, a pattern of decreasing cervical cancer risk with increasing AAV-2 titers was observed. Elevated AAV antibody titers (>100) were inversely associated with invasive cervical cancer (OR 0.3 95% CI 0.1-0.7), although results were not statistically significant after controlling for HPV (OR 0.4
