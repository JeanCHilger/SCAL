Population-based type-specific prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in middle-aged Swedish women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing can be used to identify women at risk of the development of cervical cancer. The cost-effectiveness of HPV screening is dependent on the type-specific HPV prevalence in the general population. The present study describes the prevalence and spectrum of high-risk HPV types found in a large real-life population-based HPV screening trial undertaken entirely within the cervical screening program offered to middle-aged Swedish women. Cervical brush samples from 6,123 women aged 32-38 years were analyzed using a general HPV primer (GP5+/6+) polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) combined with reverse dot-blot hybridization for confirmation and HPV typing by a single assay. In this study, 6.8% (95% CI 6.2-7.5) (417/6,123) were confirmed as high-risk HPV positive. Infections with 13 different high-risk HPV types were detected, of which HPV 16 was the most prevalent type (2.1% 128/6,123), followed by HPV 31 (1.1%
