A pathological study on the correlation of HPV infection with precancerous cervical lesions. To study the correlation of cervical condyloma and cancerous lesions with HPV infection.Cervical biopsies and histopathological examinations were performed on 179 cases which had abnormal cervical cytological smears. PCR was used to study the HPV-DNA of 128 cases and in situ hybridization (ISH) was used to study 10 cases.1. Morphologic observations. Most cervical condyloma cases were of the morphologically flat type (97.7%). Two koilocyte types were observed, the classical, or so called diagnostic koilocyte type (39.7%) and the atypical type (60.3%). Cervical condyloma often occurred together with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN, 42.5%). 2. PCR HPV DNA subtype analysis. Of the 58 cervical flat condyloma, 5 were PHV6/11 positive (8.6%) and 28 were HPV16/18 positive (48.3%). 86.1% of those with atypical koilocyte and 9.1% of those with diagnostic koilocyte had HPV16/18 infection. 66.7% of the lesions in which condyloma coexisted with CIN(2-3) had HPV16/18 infection.Most cervical condyloma lesions were of the flat type. The appearance of atypical koilocyte is correlated to HPV16/18 infection, which in turn is correlated to the degree of CIN malignancy.
