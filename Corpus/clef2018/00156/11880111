Detection of human papillomavirus DNA by PCR/microfluorometry for screening of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening is conducted by a cytological Papanicolaou (Pap) test. For screening, it is becoming increasingly important to introduce a more objective result, based on human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test. We describe here a practical method allowing the mass detection of HPV-DNA by PCR followed by fluorogenic DNA intercalation.Samples used were cervical scrapes or biopsy specimens obtained from women who had undergone cytological testing for cervical cancer. Crude DNAs were extracted by a simplified proteinase K-boil method. Common and type-specific primers were newly designed for major types of high-risk HPVs. A fluorogenic DNA intercalator, SYBR Green I was directly added to the specific PCR products. The resultant fluorescence was measured by a conventional fluorometric microplate reader.The proposed PCR/microfluorometry (MFL) allowed a simple, rapid and economical detection of HPV-DNA without any use of labeling primers or probes. HPV-DNAs were found in 48.2% (123/255) of the cervical scrapes. The detection rate of HPV in cervical cancer biopsy specimen was 92.4% (61/66).PCR/MFL detection of HPV-DNA, followed by combined type-specific PCR, is expected to be an extremely useful tool in cervical cancer screening.
