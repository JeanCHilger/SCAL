P53 expression as a predictor of recurrence in cervical squamous cell carcinoma. P53 protein function is frequently down-regulated in cervical cancer by complexing with human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein, leading to degradation of p53, genomic instability, and mutations. Results are controversial, however, on the prognostic value of p53 protein expression in cervical cancer. In this study, a cohort of 220 Brazilian women with FIGO stage IB-III cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), followed for 5 years, was analyzed for p53 protein expression using immunohistochemistry. The disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse rate were analyzed using univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariable (Cox's proportional hazards model) survival analyses. P53 protein expression was detected in 35% of the patients, including 21% in stage I, 28% in stage II and 51% in stage III of disease. Of 220 women, only 116 completed one of the treatment options standardized by FIGO within 120 days. There was a higher risk of relapse in stage II and III disease, that was not modified by p53 positivity HR 3.0 (1.3-6.5) to stage II and HR 4.0 (1.9-8.5) to stage III. The multivariate analysis evidenced that p53 expression is not an independent factor exceeding the power of FIGO stage as the single most important determinant of the hazards for disease relapse.
