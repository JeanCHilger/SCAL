Telomerase assay and HPV 16/18 typing as adjunct to conventional cytological cervical cancer screening. This study aims at exploring the potential use of telomerase activity assay and typing of human papillomaviruses (HPV) 16 and 18 in improving the identification of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).From 86 women with normal cervical smears and from 114 patients with abnormal cervical smears cervical scrapings were collected. The telomerase activity was assayed using the Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol, and HPV was detected using consensus primers and specific primers for HPV 16 and HPV 18.HPV 16 in cervical scrapes was significantly associated with high-grade squamous epithelial lesions on cytology and with high-grade CIN, i.e., CIN 2/3 on biopsy. The detection of HPV 18 or telomerase activity had no significant association with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or high-grade CIN.The use of the telomerase activity assay in cervical scrapes, unlike HPV 16 typing, did not improve the detection of high-grade CIN.
