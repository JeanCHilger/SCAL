Association between the HLA DQB1*0301 gene and human papillomavirus infection in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This study describes the distribution of DQB1genes in Norwegian women treated for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 170 biopsy specimens with diagnoses of CIN II (n = 54) or CIN III (n = 116) were DQB1-typed using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. The follow-up period for cases was 13 to 15 years. The control material comprised blood samples and endocervical brushes from 213 women without CIN. Both cases and controls had previously been human papillomavirus (HPV)-typed. The DQB1*0301 allele was overrepresented among cases compared with controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8). Presence of CIN was related to HPV infection, and HPV 16 positivity was significantly associated with the presence of DQB1*0301 (OR 1.8). The DQBI*0301 allele was significantly more prevalent in CIN III than in CIN II cases. The lesions in two women recurred in the follow-up period, one of whom was carrying the DQB1*0301 allele. Women carrying the HLA-DQB1*0301 allele have an increased risk of developing CIN when infected by HPV 16, although there was not an increased frequency of recurrent disease among women carrying this allele.
