The use of nested polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism for the detection and typing of mucosal human papillomaviruses in samples containing low copy numbers of viral DNA. Mucosal human papillomaviruses (HPVs) that infect the genital area have also been shown to infect the oral cavity. In this study a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was developed on a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product to identify ten high risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, 58 and 59 as well as the low risk HPV 11. HPV DNA was detected in 23/31 (74%) of buccal specimens using a sensitive nested PCR employing degenerate consensus primers (Williamson and Rybicki, 1991). Consensus PCR using the PGMy09/11 primers. was able to detect HPV in only 29% of the specimens that had tested positive using the nested HPV PCR primers. HPV 11 type specific primers detected HPV 11 DNA in only 66% of the specimens showing HPV 11 DNA by means of nested PCR and RFLP. A Genbank search revealed that the PCR primers could detect a wide range of mucosal HPV types including types HPV 70, 72 and 73 which have all been isolated from immunocompromised patients. Of the 23 buccal specimens that were positive for HPV DNA, 13 were single infections, five were dual infections and three were triple infections. The HPV types identified by RFLP were: HPV 11 (18/23), HPV 18 (8/23), HPV 16 (3/23), and HPV 33 (1/23). HPV 13 (2/23) was identified by direct sequencing of the inner amplicon of the PCR product.
