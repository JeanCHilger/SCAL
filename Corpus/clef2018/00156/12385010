The role of genotype-specific human papillomavirus detection in diagnosing residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. We assessed prospectively whether residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after treatment for high-grade CIN can be predicted by genotype-specific high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) detection in follow-up cervical scrapes. A broad spectrum, highly sensitive SPF(10)-LiPA-PCR HPV detection technique was used on cervical scrapes before large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), on the LLETZ biopsy and on follow-up scrapes of 90 patients treated for high-grade CIN. HR-HPV was detected in the biopsies of 93% (n = 84) of the patients and in the follow-up scrapes of 48% (n = 43) of the patients. In 12 patients, genotype-specific HR-HPV persistence was detected in both follow-up scrapes. In 10 patients, residual CIN was detected. In 5 of these patients (including all patients with residual CIN 3), the follow-up scrapes showed genotype-specific HR-HPV persistence. In 2 patients, a different HR-HPV was detected, and 3 patients had HR-HPV-negative follow-up scrapes. Conventional cytologic follow-up was abnormal in 13 patients including all 10 patients with residual CIN. The negative predictive value (NPV) of HR-HPV detection on follow-up scrapes was high (94%). Repeat detection of genotype-specific HR-HPV showed a lower sensitivity and NPV than repeat detection of any HR-HPV, but its specificity was higher. Repeat conventional cytologic follow-up showed the highest sensitivity and NPV. In conclusion, the presence of HR-HPV in cervical scrapes after LLETZ for high-grade CIN is a risk factor for the presence of residual CIN. HR-HPV genotype-specific persistence is specifically present in patients with residual CIN 3. However, HR-HPV detection cannot predict or exclude the presence of residual CIN in the individual patient and additional procedures remain necessary.
