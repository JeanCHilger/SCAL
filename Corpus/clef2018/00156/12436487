Human papillomavirus DNA detection in the management of women with twice mildly abnormal cytological smears. This study was undertaken to investigate the value of HPV testing in women referred with two abnormal smears that were graded as mild dyskaryosis or less who attended for at least three follow-up visits. One hundred forty-nine women were included in the study and a total of 39 high-grade lesions including one cancer were detected. All of these were found to be associated with the persistent presence of one or more of 13 high-risk human papillomavirus types (HPV) as detected by a multiplex type specific PCR technique. Two high-grade lesions were initially missed by cytology. In contrast, no cytological or histological evidence of high-grade lesions was found during a follow-up period of up to 8 years in 62 women with no high-risk HPV infection or in 38 women with only transient high-risk HPV infection. The utility of high-risk HPV detection in the management of women presenting with mild cytological abnormalities is discussed.
