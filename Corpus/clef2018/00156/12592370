Thin-layer liquid-based cervical cytology and PCR for detecting and typing human papillomavirus DNA in Flemish women. The objective of this study was to document the occurrence and to correlate the prevalence of different human papillomavirus (HPV) types with the cytological results on simultaneously performed thin-layer preparations in a large population of Flemish women. During 1 year, 69 290 thin-layer preparations were interpreted using the Bethesda classification system. Using an algorithm for HPV testing based on consensus primers and type-specific PCRs in combination with liquid-based cytology, we determined the occurrence and distribution of 14 different oncogenic HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68). Reflex HPV testing was performed on cytologically abnormal samples and on an age matched randomly selected control group with normal cervical cytology (n=1351). Correlation between cytology, age and prevalence for the 14 different high-risk HPV types is given. There is a significant increase in predominance of high-risk HPV types, with increasing abnormal cytology. Coinfection with multiple HPV types also increased with cytological abnormalities, and was highest in HSIL (16.7%). In Flanders, HSIL was most often associated with HPV types 16, 33, 35, 31, 18 and 51. Using thin-layer liquid-based cytology and PCR to detect HPV, it is feasible to screen large numbers of women.
