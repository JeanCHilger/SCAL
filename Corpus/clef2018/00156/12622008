Wait-and-see policy versus loop excision after two consecutive Pap-2 cervical smears: over time less surgery and an equivalent outcome no substantial contribution to be expected from the detection of high risk human papillomavirus. To determine the number interventions and outcomes in patients referred with two consecutive Pap 2 cervical smear results who were managed either by a wait-and-see policy or aggressively, and to determine whether triage with high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) detection, resulting in the referral of only hr-HPV positive patients, would lead to the detection of all patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Retrospective comparison and retrospective cohort study.282 patients referred in 1997/'99 with 2 consecutive Pap 2 cervical smears in the screening program were included. Patients referred to the UMC St Radboud Hospital (n = 140 mean age: 45 years) underwent a colposcopy during which only lesions suggestive for CIN 3 were treated. All other colposcopic lesions (CIN 2 or less) were not treated but followed prospectively. Patients referred to the Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital (CWZ) (n = 142With the wait-and-see approach, statistically significantly fewer diathermic loop excisions were done: 13 versus 124. After the follow-up period there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients with persisting Pap 2: 16 (11%) versus 12 (8%). Triage with hr-HPV detection would identify all patients with CIN 3, 50% of the patients with CIN 2, and none of the patients with CIN 1 of the 48 hr-HPV-positive women, 1 had a CIN 3 lesion and 3 had a CIN 2 lesionThe wait-and-see approach led to fewer interventions, while the number of women with persisting Pap 2 smears was not higher than with the aggressive approach. Triage with hr-HPV may reduce the number of referrals and colposcopies, but follow-up remains necessary in all women regardless of hr-HPV status.
