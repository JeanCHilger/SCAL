Inactivation of RAS association domain family 1A gene in cervical carcinomas and the role of human papillomavirus infection. Recently, we have identified a new putative tumor suppressor gene, RASSF1A (Ras association domain family 1A gene), located at human chromosome 3p21.3, the segment that is often lost in many types of human cancers. The RASSF1A promoter was shown to be frequently hypermethylated in various epithelial tumors, including small cell lung, breast, bladder, prostate, gastric, and renal cell carcinomas. In this study, we have analyzed the methylation status of the RASSF1A gene in primary human cervical cancers and in eight cervical cancer cell lines. The RASSF1A promoter is hypermethylated in 4 of 42 (= 10%) of squamous cell carcinomas, in 4 of 19 (= 21%) of adenosquamous carcinomas, and in 8 of 34 (= 24%) of cervical adenocarcinomas. Although in adenocarcinomas, methylation of RASSF1A and presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 or 18 sometimes coexisted, not a single case of HPV-16/18-positive squamous cell carcinomas had RASSF1A methylation. Similarly, in all eight analyzed cervical cell lines, RASSF1A inactivation and HPV infection were mutually exclusive (Fisher's exact test P = 0.0357): two HPV-negative cervical cancer cell lines had a methylated and silenced RASSF1A promoter (C-33A and HT-3), whereas the other six HPV-positive lines expressed RASSF1A mRNA (ME 180, MS751, SiHa, C-4I, HeLa, and CaSki). For cervical tumors and cell lines combined, the Pearson's chi(2) test (chi(2) = 3.99
