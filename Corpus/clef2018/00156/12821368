Cervical schistosomiasis, human papilloma virus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): a dangerous coexistence or coincidence? Female genitourinary schistosomiasis (FGS) is widespread in endemic areas causing significant morbidity and mortality. Recent data suggest that FGS of the cervix not only is considered a risk factor for contracting different sexually transmitted diseases (STD), but also plays a significant role in modifying the natural history and immunological response to those infections, in particular HIV and HPV.A 32-year-old female from Zambia, who was recently diagnosed with HIV and high-grade dysplasia with koilocytosis on cervical Pap smear, underwent cervical conization which confirmed moderate cervical dysplasia and also revealed the presence of viable and nonviable schistosoma eggs in cervical stroma. Four different HPV types were isolated by PCR, including one "low-risk" (type 6) and three "high-risk" types (types 45,56, and 58).The presence of HPV, HIV infection, and cervical schistosomiasis in our patient is likely more than coexistence of multiple agents in the same milieu as cervical schistosomiasis increase susceptibility for other STDs including HIV and HPV. Therefore, in patients with schistosomiasis, immediate treatment for schistosomiasis and additional testing for HIV and HPV is warranted.
