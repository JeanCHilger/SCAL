Cross-sectional study of patient- and physician-collected cervical cytology and human papillomavirus. To compare the performance of patient- and physician-obtained cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.A cross-sectional study was performed involving 334 women seen at three colposcopy clinics (Tucson, Arizona Hermosillo, MexicoThe sensitivity of patient-collected cytology was significantly lower (55.0%) and specificity was significantly better (84.1%) than those of physician-directed sampling (85.2% and 73.4%, respectively). Patient-collected HPV had significantly lower sensitivity (49.0%) than physician sampling (82.2%), although specificity did not significantly differ.Patient collection is a feasible although inferior alternative to physician-collected cervical cytology and HPV testing.
