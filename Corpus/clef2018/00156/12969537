Evaluation of cold knife conization (CKC) on diagnosis and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cold knife conization (CKC) is a classic diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The authors analyzed pathological features of 62 cone specimens and determined the effectiveness of CKC on diagnosis and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Comparative analysis on pathological findings of cone specimens and multiple biopsies (MB) of 62 CIN patients was performed.There were close similarities in pathology between CKC and MB in 44 cases (71%). Eighteen cases (29%) showed histological difference between CKC and MB among them, 4 cases that were given a diagnosis of CIN2 or CIN3 by MB were classified into CIN3 or microinvasive carcinoma by CKC. All 62 cases were squamous epithelial lesionsCKC is significantly effective and cannot be replaced by MB. Squamous metaplasia and CIN development are intrinsically correlated with each other.
