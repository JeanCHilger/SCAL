Colposcopy staging and treatment of papillomavirus infection of the cervix. The specificity of colposcopy findings in HPV infections allows the colposcopic differentiation of these lesions. In all of these colposcopically selected cases, additional tests included cytology with immunoperoxidase reaction (IPR), and, recently, virus typing with the use of ViraPap HPV DNA Detection test and ViraType HPV DNA Typing test became also available. When needed, histological examination of the specimen was carried out. In 202 detected and treated cases of HPV infections in females, and in 5 in males, four groups of lesions have been colposcopically distinguished. Group I contains early and fully developed, unsuspected typical papillomas Group II--atypical papillomas which are usually colposcopically suspected of CIN and/or cancer
