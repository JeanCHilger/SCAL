Viral and/or intraepithelial lesions of the lower female genital tract: diagnostic and prognostic value of in situ molecular hybridization. Fourteen patients (mean age 37 years) suffering from viral and/or intraepithelial cervico-vagino-vulvar pathologies underwent colposcopic and cyto-histological tests and molecular hybridization. The following types of HPV were assayed: 6/11-16/18-31/35/51 in cytological tissues (exocervical scraping) and biopsy material immersed in paraffin and fixed in formalin buffered with 10% PBS. The aim of the study was to identify different types of HPV using molecular hybridisation in situ. The paper reports the results and correlations with colposcopic, cytological and histological diagnosis, and then discuss the clinico-biological and prognostic aspects of this method.
