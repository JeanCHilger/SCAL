Detection of human papillomavirus DNA sequences in cervical lesions by in situ hybridization using biotinylated DNA probes. Ninety-six biopsy specimens were collected for studying the association of specific sequences of HPV DNA with genital warts, precancerous lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Using DNA probes labeled with biotin, 17 of the 22 (77.27%) specimens showing condyloma and 1 of the 14 (7.14%) specimens displaying subclinical papillomavirus infection (SPI) of cervix were found to be positive for HPV 6/11 4 of 23 (17.39%) specimens of squamous epithelial cervical cancer and 2 of the 23 (8.70%) specimens of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were positive for HPV 16/18. All the 14 specimens of cervicitis were negative for both probes. The HPV 6/11 positive hybridization products were present mainly in the superficial and intermediate epithelium of condyloma and SPI. In invasive cancer, HPV 16/18 were shown more often in cancer cells of infiltrative nests and were focally distributed.
