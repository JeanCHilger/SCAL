Human papillomavirus types and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions that recur after cold-knife conization. The purpose of this study was to analyze the HPV types and histological margins of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) treated by cold-knife conization and to correlate this with recurrent disease. Of 203 cone biopsies done for SILs primarily because the entire lesion could not be visualized at colposcopy, follow-up information was available for 85 cases. Of these 85 cases, biopsy-proven recurrences were documented for 10 (12%) women. In the SILs which recurred after conization, the lesion was noted on the surgical margin in 7/10 (70%) cases. In contrast, SILs that did not recur after cold-knife conization were detected on the surgical margin in only 12% of cases. In 7 of the recurrences, the HPV type detected in the pretreatment SIL was the same as that detected in the SIL that occurred after conization. In the other 3 recurrences, one of either the primary or recurrent SILs was HPV positive and the other corresponding lesion HPV negative. It is concluded that detection of a SIL on the surgical margin is a marker for recurrent disease and that recurrences are often associated with the same HPV type as that noted in the pretreatment SIL.
