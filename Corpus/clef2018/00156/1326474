Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: HPV 16 and DNA ploidy as predictors of survival. In this study, the hypothesis that DNA ploidy and the presence of HPV 16 and HPV 18 DNA affects survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix was tested. Archival paraffin blocks from biopsy and surgical specimens were obtained from 127 women diagnosed in 1977-1984. Determination of DNA ploidy was by flow cytometry and HPV 16 and HPV 18 DNA status by polymerase chain reaction with subsequent dot-blot hybridization. For each patient, age, stage, treatment modality, and 5-year survival were correlated with ploidy and HPV status. HPV 16 DNA was present in 53% of the tumors. HPV 18 was not detected in this population. HPV 16 DNA was found twice as often in Stages IB and IIA than in advanced-stage disease (III and IV). These advanced-stage tumors were more commonly aneuploid. Neither HPV status nor DNA ploidy were predictive of survival for any stage of disease or therapeutic modality.
