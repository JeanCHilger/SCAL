Relationship of human papillomavirus type to grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. OBJECTIVE--To determine the relationship of human papillomavirus (HPV) type to grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in a large series of cases. DESIGN--A survey of HPV types in CIN lesions detected using a new, highly accurate method for typing HPV that is based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplimers produced during polymerase chain amplification of the conserved L1 region of HPV using consensus primers. SETTING--Private gynecologists' offices and inner-city colposcopy clinics. PATIENTS--A convenience sample of 276 HPV DNA-positive cervical biopsy specimens or samples from patients undergoing colposcopy for abnormal Papanicolaou smears. INTERVENTION--None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)--Human papillomavirus type(s). RESULTS--Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 lesions were relatively heterogeneous with regard to associated HPV types. Nineteen percent of CIN 1 lesions were associated with HPV types 6 or 11 29% contained HPV types 16, 18, or 33
