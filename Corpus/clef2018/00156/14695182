Notch1 can contribute to viral-induced transformation of primary human keratinocytes. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most significant causative agent in the development of cervical cancer. Despite its presence in almost all cervical cancers, HPV by itself is unable to transform a normal cell to a cancerous one. Instead, additional cellular mutations are required to supplement the HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7. Activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway has been proposed as one of the cellular changes that cooperate with the E6 and E7 proteins to cause cervical cancers. This proposition is based on: (a) the detection of active Notch1 in high-grade cervical lesions and cancers (b) the synergism between Notch1 and E6 and E7 to transform immortalized cells
