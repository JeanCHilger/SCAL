Liquid-based cytology findings of glassy cell carcinoma of the cervix. Report of a case with histologic correlation and molecular analysis. Glassy cell carcinoma is a rare form of poorly differentiated carcinoma of the cervix with no obvious squamous or glandular differentiation. Its liquid-based cytology findings have not been described before.A 46-year-old Filipina presented with vaginal bleeding due to a bulky cervical tumor. The liquid-based cytology preparation was of moderate cellularity and contained small clusters of polygonal to elongated tumor cells admixed with amphophilic, granular, necrotic debris. The malignant cells possessed round to oval nuclei a thin nuclear membraneGlassy cell carcinoma of the cervix may show distinct, though subtle, cytomorphologic features in liquid-based preparations. The findings, however, are slightly different from those in conventional cervical smears. Awareness of this rare entity is important, as glassy cell carcinoma is often associated with more aggressive clinical behavior.
