Associated risk factors of human papillomavirus cervical infection among human immunodificiency virus-seropositive women at Siriraj Hospital. This cross sectional type sub-study was established to assess the potential risk factor associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical infection in Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive women. The series of 178 HIV-seropositive women was enrolled in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Siriraj Hospital. Demographic, obstetrical and behavioral risk factors were interviewed. Laboratory results were recorded. Clinical gynecologic examination was performed including Pap smear. The patients were assigned into two groups, HPV and non-HPV group. The comparison of the potential risk factors between the groups was calculated statistically. It was found that the prevalence of HPV infection was reported in 17 patients (9.6%). HIV-seropositive women, who were infected with HPV, had a significantly more probability to have a single partner in their lifetime than those who were not infected. It could be that HPV cervical infection and HIV-seropositive women share common potential risk factors, as well as, the recognition of sexual intercourse as the important route of HPV transmission.
