Comparison of human papillomavirus genotypes in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and invasive cervical carcinoma: evidence for differences in biologic potential of precursor lesions. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix are heterogeneous in their invasive potential. Comparison of human papillomavirus types between invasive cervical carcinoma and high-grade squamous dysplasia may provide insight into this biological variability. Liquid-based Pap specimens from 55 high-grade intraepithelial lesions and 47 invasive cervical carcinomas were analyzed by reverse line blot for 27 human papillomavirus types designated high, intermediate, or low risk. Human papillomavirus DNA was present in all high-grade intraepithelial lesions (23 different types) and in 94% (13 types) of invasive carcinomas. High-risk types were present in 81% of invasive carcinomas compared to 58% of high-grade intraepithelial lesions. Severe dysplasias harbored more (79%) high-risk human papillomaviruses as compared to moderate dysplasias (37%). In 40% of high-grade dysplasia cases (59% of moderate dysplasias 21% of severe) and 13% of invasive carcinomas, intermediate-risk genotypes were identified in the absence of high-risk HPV types. Human papillomavirus 16 was the most common type in all categories, including 47% of high-grade squamous dysplasias (26% moderate
