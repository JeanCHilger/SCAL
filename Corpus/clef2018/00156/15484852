Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in cervical smear samples with determined HPV. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) causes infertility, ectopyc pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and conjunctivitis. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is a virus with broad spectrum effects. This particularly refers to HPV of high oncogenic potential (HPV - HR) because of its participation in cervical oncogenesis. The authors wanted to determine correlation between cervical HPV infection and detection of CT taken from female patient's smear of different levels of cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN I - III) and ASCUS (Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance) modifications.Cytological analysis was used for 94 cervical samples--Papanicolaou method. The samples were presented in accordance with valid Bethesda Classification. The samples were treated by HPV DNA assay (Digene Hybrid Capture II).Out of 64 HPV positive samples, detected CT was found in 24 (37.5%) samples. Out of 50 HPV positive group samples with high degree risk ( HPV - HR), 18 (36%) contained CT. Frequency of CT was registered in ASCUS modifications in 55.6%, CIN I 16.7%, CIN II 16.7% and CIN III 11.0% samples. We found 3 (10.0%) of detected CT in HPV negative control group.Research results showed correlation between HPV cervical infection and CT. The higher the level of cell dedifferentiation (ASCUS CIN I - III) is, the higher number of cervical infections with CT is.
