Human papillomavirus genotyping and p16INK4a expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of adolescents. Adolescents have high rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and persistent high-risk HPV infection can lead to the development of cervical cancer. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16(INK4a) is overexpressed in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), probably due to a persistent and integrated HPV infection. This study investigated p16(INK4a) expression, grades of CIN, and high-risk HPV infection in adolescent cervical biopsies. Biopsies were immunohistochemically stained for p16(INK4a). The presence of wide-spectrum, low-risk, or high-risk HPV was determined by amplifying DNA extracted from the cervical biopsies. Biopsies were classified as cervicitis, 15 cases CIN 1, 48 cases
