Triage with human papillomavirus testing of women with cytologic abnormalities prompting referral for colposcopy assessment. The current study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of triaging for colposcopy using human papillomavirus (HPV) testing.HPV tests were performed in a consecutive series of women who were referred for colposcopy for persistent atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)-favor reactive (n = 35 women), ASCUS-favor squamous epithelial lesion (n = 164 women), atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (n = 74 women), low-grade squamous epithelial lesion (n = 161 women), or high-grade squamous epithelial lesion (n = 78 women). The cost effectiveness of triaging women with ASCUS results using HPV testing was determined compared with the current protocol.The sensitivity of HPV testing for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia > Grade 2 was very high. Cost analysis showed a moderate increase in cost with the addition of HPV triage.Because HPV testing is highly sensitive, it may be useful as an alternative to the current policy of 6-month repeat cytology for women with ASCUS.
