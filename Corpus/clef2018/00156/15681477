Facile, comprehensive, high-throughput genotyping of human genital papillomaviruses using spectrally addressable liquid bead microarrays. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the worldwide cause of carcinoma of the uterine cervix, a cancer that is the second most common neoplasm in women, resulting in nearly 250,000 deaths a year. The magnitude of the risk of cancer after HPV infection, however, is virus type-specific. Over 40 HPV types can infect the genital tract. Comprehensive, high-throughput typing assays for HPV, however, are not currently available. Blending multiplex PCR and multiplex hybridization using spectrally addressable liquid bead microarrays we have developed a high-throughput, fast, single-tube-typing assay capable of simultaneously typing 45 HPV. The overall incidence of HPV in 429 women tested using this new assay was 72.2% for those with squamous intraepithelial lesions, 51.5% for those with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and 15.4% for women with normal cytology, respectively. This compared well with the incidence of HPV detected by a parallel non-typing generic high-risk assay. The new assay detected a wide spectrum of HPV types and a high incidence of mixed infections. We believe our assay may find widespread applications in areas requiring virus type-specific information, such as in epidemiological studies, cancer screening programs, monitoring therapeutic interventions, and evaluating the efficacy of HPV vaccine trials.
