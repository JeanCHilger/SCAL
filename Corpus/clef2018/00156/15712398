Spectrum of human papillomavirus-related dysplasia and carcinoma of the anus in HIV-infected patients. The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related anal squamous cell carcinoma is increasing. It is likely that long-standing HIV-related immunosuppression plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of anal carcinoma however, a direct HIV-HPV interaction has also been implicated. Using cervical cancer prevention as a paradigm, anal Pap smear screening as part of routine HIV preventive care has been proposed to detect and treat precancerous anal lesions in the hope of decreasing anal cancer rates. All HIV-positive patients with invasive cancer of the anal canal, particularly those with CD4+ cell counts greater than 200/microL and those receiving HAART, should be managed in the same manner as their HIV-negative counterparts.
