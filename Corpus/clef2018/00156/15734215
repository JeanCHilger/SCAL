The relative distribution of oncogenic types of human papillomavirus in benign, pre-malignant and malignant cervical biopsies. A study with human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequence analysis. The aim of the present investigation was to define the spectrum of oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) present in benign, pre-malignant (low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, LSIL and HSIL) and malignant cervical lesions. The study comprises 215 HPV-positive biopsies, analysed with PCR, followed by sequence analyses of the HPV DNA. Fifeteen oncogenic types of HPV were identified. In 170 benign or pre-maligant alterations, the most common being HPV 16 (51%), HPV 31 (8%), HPV 18 (7%) and HPV 45 (6%). HPV 33, 35, 51, 56, 58, 66, and 70 occurred in about 1-4%. The prevalence of HPV 39, 52, 56, 59 and 73 was <1%. All the observed types of HPV, except 39 and 52, occurred in SIL lesions. The most common oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18), occurring in 45 invasive squamous carcinomas, comprised 76 per cent of the tumours, whereas less frequent HPV types (31, 33, 52, 56, 67, 70 and 73) were each found in about 2-4%. Double HPV infections were not observed. In conclusion, a total of 15 different oncogenic HPV types were identified, of which 13 types were present in pre-malignant cervical lesions and 9 in malignant lesions. This information may have some relevance when HPV analyses are considered as an adjunct to the organised screening of cervical cancer and for those working with the development of HPV vaccines for the prevention of cervical cancer.
