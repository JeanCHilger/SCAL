New cervical cancer screening strategy: combined Pap and HPV testing. Our strategy for cervical cancer screeing is being revolutionized by our new understanding of how human papillomavirus (HPV) contributes to carcinogenesis and the natural history of cervical cancer. The American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommend combined HPV and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing for cervical cancer screening in women age 30 or older. However, although incorporation of HPV DNA testing into primary screening provides clear benefits, it also raises new questions.
