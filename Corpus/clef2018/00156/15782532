Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins 2, 4 and 6 (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6) in cervical-uterine cells of intraepithelial neoplasia: a preliminary report. The purpose of this work was to determine the expression of type Th1 cytokines: IL-2 and IFNgamma, and Th2: IL-4 and IL-6, as well as TNF-alpha in patients with precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix and their relationship with the human papiloma virus (HPV). 30 patients with precancerous lesions (NIC 1: 70%, NIC 2: 16.7% and NIC 3: 1.3%) and 9 normal controls were studied. A clinical history, gynecological evaluation, cytology and an uterine biopsy were carried out in each patient and control. PCR was used for the diagnosis of HPV. IFN-gamma expression (positive cells/field) was increased in patients with NIC (5.06 +/- 4.7 vs 0 in the control group p < 0.05). TNFa was a little higher in pathologycal tissues than in the controls (5.23 +/- 3.63 vs 1.55 +/- 2.65
