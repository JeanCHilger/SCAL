Men's perceptions and knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer. The authors assessed young men's knowledge and perceptions of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to identify factors that predict intention to make positive behavioral changes. Male university students aged 18 to 25 years completed a self-report instrument to assess knowledge and perceptions of genital HPV infection. If diagnosed with HPV, most men (95%) reported that they would use condoms with new partners. The intention to reduce number of sex partners was associated with an understanding that HPV may have severe consequences for women, whereas intention to encourage female sex partners to undergo Pap smear screening was associated with increased general knowledge of HPV infection. The authors concluded that it is important to include men in HPV education and prevention efforts, especially within the context that HPV may lead to cervical cancer in female partners.
