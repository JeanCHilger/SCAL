Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-4 is expressed in cervical cancer patients. Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs) play a critical role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which is involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Elevated TIMP levels are reported in association with cancer progression. In particular, it has been shown that TIMP-1 and -2 levels are increased in cervical cancer patients. We analyzed, for the first time, TIMP-4 expression in cervical tumor samples.Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed in 26 tumor and 6 normal cervical samples.The study included 32 samples, 7 IB samples, 9 IIB samples, 10 IIIB samples and a control group (n =6) of normal cervical squamous epithelial tissues. Whereas none of the control samples expressed TIMP-4, 24 (88%) of the 26 cervical cancer samples expressed the inhibitor. Higher TIMP-4 levels were found in advanced stage disease (p=0.016, Chi-square test).TIMP-4 is expressed de novo in cervical cancer. Higher inhibitor expression levels were found in stages II and III.
