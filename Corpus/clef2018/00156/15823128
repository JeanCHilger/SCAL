A case with multiple gynecological malignancies. A patient with cervical non-Hodgkin lymphoma was treated with chemotherapy. Fourteen months after the diagnosis of the lymphoma, an endometrial adenocarcinoma was detected as a secondary malignant tumor. The patient was treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy. Approximately 7 years after the diagnosis of endometrial cancer, vaginal invasive squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed as the third primary malignancy, and a second-line palliative radiotherapy was applied. Seven months after the last radiotherapy, postradiational sarcoma in the vagina was diagnosed. Congenital and acquired immune system disorders, viral oncogenes, and various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types were investigated. Total blood count and lymphocyte subset analysis were performed, and CD4+ lymphopenia was detected. Serologic tests were carried out for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus infection. Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen IgG was found positive. Low-risk human papillomavirus panel was detected by Hybrid Capture method in the cervical smear. The HLA investigation revealed HLA-A2, HLA-A3, HLA-B57, HLA-B35, HLA-B4, HLA-B6, HLA-DR3, HLA-DR1, HLA-DR51, HLA-DR52, HLA-DQ6(1), and HLA-DQ7(3). The patient died because of the disease.
