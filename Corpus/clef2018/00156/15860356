Association between the stages of cervical cancer and chromosome 1 aneusomy. The high-risk human papillomavirus is known to play a pivotal role in cervical carcinogenesis. Numerical and structural aberrations are known to be related to different behaviors of malignant cervical lesions. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the number of cervical cells with chromosome 1 aneusomy (monosomy, trisomy, and tetrasomy) in 20 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and invasive cancer) and three women without CIN by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), (2) to determine the heterogeneity of aneusomy among women within each of the five groups studied, (3) to determine the association between the four progressive stages of cervical cancer and the number of cells with and without aneusomy, (4) to determine the association between number of cells with and without aneusomy and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, and (5) to determine its usefulness as a biomarker of cancer risk. A hospital-based unmatched case-control study in a sample of 23 women grouped by disease stage and selected by histology from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Mexico was conducted in 2002. Numerical aberrations of chromosome 1 in cervical smears were detected with FISH. HPV was detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and typing was performed with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLPs). Analysis of chromosome 1 aneusomy revealed (1) homogeneity among women within each one of the five groups, (2) a positive linear trend between the aneusomy frequency and grade of lesion, and (3) an association between aneusomy and high-risk HPV infection. These findings suggest the usefulness of the number of cervical cells with chromosome 1 aneusomy as a biomarker. In order to validate this biomarker we suggest a larger prospective study of cytological samples of patients with a longer follow-up.
