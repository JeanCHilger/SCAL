G-308A TNF-alpha polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of invasive cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is initiated by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV-16 and HPV-18), but an effective immune response may control the progression of this disease. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, that has been implicated in several cancers. In a case-control study, we evaluated the association between the G-308A TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism and the risk for invasive cervical cancer (ICC). TNF-alpha polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP and confirmed by sequencing. DNA was obtained from blood samples of 439 individuals, including 195 patients with ICC and 244 normal healthy controls. According to our results, women carrying the A allele present a twofold increased risk of developing ICC (p=0.006 OR=1.88
