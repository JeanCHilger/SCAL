What do women think about abnormal smear test results? A qualitative interview study. The aim of the study is a report of Dutch women's views on abnormal cervical smear test results and the consequences thereof. Twenty-seven women with recent PAP III in their history were interviewed in the context of this qualitative study. GPs often do not inform patients beforehand about the ways in which abnormal cervical smear test results are communicated, and how such information should be interpreted. Women do not anticipate abnormal test results and are taken by surprise. This frequently results in fears of cancer, disappointment in their own bodies, worries about reproduction, and sexual anxiety. Stress, predisposition, and sexuality form the most frequently mentioned causes. The cervix comes to symbolize reproduction and femininity. We conclude that a PAP III result affects women's lives in an extremely negative manner. Physicians should be aware of the influence of personal characteristics of patients which determine their responses and behaviours. The benefits and disadvantages of preventive screenings should be carefully considered.
