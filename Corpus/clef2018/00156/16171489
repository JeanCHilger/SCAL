Human papilloma virus is detectable by the Hybrid Capture 2 test in cervical smear samples from women over 40 years of age with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. To establish that in Canterbury, New Zealand, women over the age of 40 with biopsy confirmed high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) have human papilloma virus (HPV) detectable by the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test. Fifty-two women with abnormal cytology under going colposcopy had HC2 performed. HPV status, cytology and histology were compared. HC2 was positive in 30/31 with grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2) or worse, 5/6 with HPV changes or CIN1, and 10/15 with no demonstrated abnormality.
