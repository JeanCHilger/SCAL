A comparison of a prototype PCR assay and hybrid capture 2 for detection of carcinogenic human papillomavirus DNA in women with equivocal or mildly abnormal papanicolaou smears. We evaluated Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for paired specimens collected at 19,187 visits from 5,026 of 5,060 women participating in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS). We examined the test agreement between HC2 and PCR detection for any of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus types targeted by HC2 and compared clinical performance of the 2 tests for detecting concurrent and follow-up cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer. The k value for the 2 assays was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.66), with 82.7% crude agreement. HC2 was more sensitive (93.6% vs 89.3% P < .0005) but less specific (41.2% vs 48.5%
