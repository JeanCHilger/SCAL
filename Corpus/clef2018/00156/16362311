A study of abnormal cervical cytology in pregnant women. During the 4 year routine study of smears in 2,919 pregnant women, 33 cases of abnormals of the uterine cervix were detected (1.13%). The patients were followed with uterine cervical cytology and colposcopy and in case of need, sometimes punch biopsies were performed. The results of the cytologies, 33 cases with abnormalities were detected. There were 26 cases classified as class IIIa, 7 cases were class IIIb. All the cases underwent colposcopy. For the 17 cases that showed lesions by colposcopy, and punch biopsies were performed. The results of histologic examination were wide variety, five chronic cervicitis, one condyloma, one mild dysplasia, three moderate dysplasia, three severe dysplasia, three carcinoma in situ, and one microinvasive carcinoma. Only two cases were treated during pregnancy one with condyloma underwent Laser vaporization and another with microinvasive carcinoma underwent LEEP conization. Other cases were given conservative treatment during pregnancy. Excluding one case for persistence smear class IIIa of histology condyloma, all the cases showed regression of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ with treatment after delivery. We conclude that lesions up to carcinoma in situ do not require intervention during pregnancy but microinvasive carcinoma is suspected, diagnostic LEEP conization is necessary, even during pregnancy.
