IgG antibodies to HPV16, 52, 58 and 6 L1-capsids and spontaneous regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To identify the predictive markers for spontaneous regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), we examined whether IgG antibody responses to common human papillomavirus (HPV) L1-capsids correlate with CIN regression. In a cohort study, a total of 116 Japanese women with CIN grade I/II were tested for cervical HPV DNA and serum IgG antibodies to HPV16/52/58/6 L1-capsids. Our data suggest that baseline IgG reactivities to HPV L1-capsids do not serve as a predictive marker of CIN regression, in contrast to histological CIN grades and HPV DNA status.
