Results of longterm hospital based cytological screening in asymptomatic women. Routine cytological screening has been carried out in 27,062 asymptomatic women attending Gynaec and Family Planning O.P.D. of Queen Mary's Hospital, Lucknow, India (April 1971-December 2004). Incidence of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) was found to be 5.9% in the series, while cervical malignancy was seen in 0.6% of cases. The study highlighted the immense utility of cytological screening in minimizing the incidence of carcinoma cervix in the segment of the urban population screened, as the incidence dropped down to 0.5% in the second half from 1.1% noticed in the first half of the screening period. The study also emphasized the utility of clinically downstaging the cervical cancer as 7,316 women showing clinical lesions of cervix were found to harbor SIL in 15.3% and carcinoma cervix in 1.3% of cases as against the incidence of 2.5% for SIL and 0.6% for frank cancer in women with normal cervix. The investigation into different risk factors involved in cervical carcinogenesis revealed that the incidence of SIL and cancer cervix showed a rise with increasing age and parity and prolonged sexual period. The incidences of both cervical cytopathologies were also higher in women of low socio-economic status while religion was found to have no bearing on the occurrence of the disease. Among the four sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosed in the cervical smears, Trichomonas vaginalis was found to be more prevalent (2.6%), while human papillomavirus (HPV) and Herpes simplex was seen in 0.4 and 0.2% of cases, respectively Herpes simplex was found to have strong affinity with both SIL and carcinoma cervix, while only SIL incidence was high with HPV infection. The study emphasizes need of proper education to women of low socio-economic class for creating awareness regarding hazards and risk factors of cervical cancer as well as management and cure of the disease.
