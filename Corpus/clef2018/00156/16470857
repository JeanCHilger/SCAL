High-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing: a marker for atypical glandular cells. Cervical/endocervical cytology screening has decreased morbidity and mortality, and implementing adjunctive human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance has improved the specificity for detecting premalignant squamous lesions. Currently, there are no guidelines to perform HPV DNA testing on cervical/endocervical ThinPreps with atypical glandular cells (AGC). To assess the potential role of HPV DNA testing on AGC cases, Hybrid Capture 2 (Digene Corp.) testing was performed on 144 cervical/endocervical AGC specimens. One hundred three of 144 cases had follow-up 60/103 (58.3%) were high-risk HPV negative and 43/103 (42.3%) were high-risk HPV positive. Of 43 HPV-positive patients, 37 had adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), or cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, while only one patient without high-risk HPV had a squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Furthermore, most high-risk HPV positive AGC cases harbored high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) rather than AIS. Our data support HPV DNA testing of all AGC specimens to detect cervical, especially squamous, neoplasia.
