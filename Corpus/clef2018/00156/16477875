Why do we go on screening? As healthcare rules are becoming better organized and as vaccination against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections is arising, the conditions of cytological screening for cervical carcinoma may have to be modified in the near future. After reminding the Quality Control constraints of the Pap test and the technical and epidemiological conditions for the HPV detection as a precursor of cervical carcinoma, the present paper wishes to discuss the possible role of vaccine on the screening strategy.
