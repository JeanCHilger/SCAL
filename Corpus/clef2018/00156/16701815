Preferences for sources of information about abnormal Pap tests and HPV in women tested for HPV. Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is important because of its association with cervical cancer. There has been a recent upsurge of coverage in the media concerning HPV, but little research exists on women's preferences and opinions regarding sources of information and education on HPV and abnormal Pap tests. The purpose of this paper is to describe women's preferences and opinions about various sources/channels of information on abnormal Pap test results and HPV.Forty-four in-depth, in-person interviews were conducted with low-income, high-risk HPV positive women. Women responded to open-ended questions addressing their preferences for sources of health and medical information related to HPV and abnormal Pap tests. The audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were analyzed for content themes related to provision of information and education.Women preferred sources that were trustworthy, accessible, and convenient, could be viewed in a private location, and were written in easily understood language. Women also preferred obtaining information from other women with HPV. The most trusted source was face-to-face interaction with the health care provider however, the nature of this interaction had both strengths and weaknesses.Regardless of channel, women want information that they can understand about abnormal Pap tests and HPV.
