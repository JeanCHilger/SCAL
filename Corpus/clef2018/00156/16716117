Antitumor therapeutic effects of e7 subunit and DNA vaccines in an animal cervical cancer model: antitumor efficacy of e7 therapeutic vaccines is dependent on tumor sizes, vaccine doses, and vaccine delivery routes. We previously reported that E7 subunit and DNA vaccines are both capable of inducing antitumor protection through induction of antigen-specific CTL. In this study, we investigated their ability to control established tumors according to tumor size, vaccine doses, and vaccine delivery routes. Antitumor therapeutic efficacy of both vaccine types was dependent on tumor burden. However, E7 subunit vaccines induced a higher level of antitumor therapeutic activities at the tested dose compared to DNA vaccines. This was concomitant with induction of antibody, CTL, and IFN-gamma responses, as well as histologic changes (heavy infiltration of lymphocytes and presence of apoptotic bodies). In vaccine dose titration assays, 50 and 100 microg of DNA vaccines exhibited an equivalent antitumor efficacy to 0.5 and 1 microg of E7 subunit vaccines, respectively, i.e., a 100-fold difference in E7 dosage, suggesting the importance of vaccine doses for achieving antitumor immunity. Furthermore, tumors of a larger size were controlled by intratumoral injection with E7 subunit vaccines, underscoring the importance of vaccine delivery routes for antitumor therapeutic efficacy. Thus, these data suggest that antitumor therapeutic efficacy of E7 therapeutic vaccines is determined by vaccine doses, vaccine delivery routes, and tumor sizes, and that these vaccines could be another addition to conventional therapy modalities against cervical cancer.
