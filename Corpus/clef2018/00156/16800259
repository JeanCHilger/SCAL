Amerindian women of the Brazilian Amazon and STD. Papanicolaou tests, PCR for HPV, C. trachomatis, HSV-1/2 and N. gonorrhoea, and Hybrid Capture II were performed for high- and low-risk HPV groups during screening for cervical cancer in 49 women of the Parakana tribe. Cytological diagnoses of HPV were suggested in three samples: PCR showed 12 (22.4%) cases of DNA positive HPV, 16 (1), 18 (2), 58 (3), 39 (1), 61 (1), 33 (1), 35 (1), unknown (2), and HCII analyzed 48 samples: 19 positive (39.58%) for the high-risk group and four (18.33%) for the low-risk group. The prevalence of HPV was 42.85% (p = 0.001) by molecular biology methods. The largest viral load was 1588.11 pg/ml for HPV 39 in a 16-year-old. PCR was positive for C. trachomatis and negative for HSV-1/2 and N. gonorrhoea. Parakana women present a high risk for the development of cervical cancer.
