New paradigm for prevention of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an event responsible for the development of cervical cancer and its premalignant dysplasia. Prophylactic vaccines based on virus-like particles (VLPs) have been successfully tested in clinical trials. They are safe, close to 100% effective in preventing persistent infection and premalignant disease, and are now being introduced onto the market. Vaccination should be offered primarily to young girls and adolescents 9-15 years of age. Vaccine introduction faces particular problems due to a bias towards sexually transmitted diseases and financing, especially in developing countries. However, it represents the first vaccine that has the potential to eradicate 70% of cervical cancer world wide.
