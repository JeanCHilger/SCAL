Expression of p16(INK4a) in relation to histopathology and viral load of 'high-risk' HPV types in cervical neoplastic lesions. A total of 91 cervical archival biopsy series were analysed for the presence and viral load of 'high-risk' types of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), and p16(INK4a) expression. The women had various degrees of CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). HPV 16 was the most prevalent type found, at 47% frequency. The frequency of HPV 16 increased with increasing immunoreactivity to p16(INK4a), from 39% to 44% at cases scored low to medium, to 65% at high reactivity. Thirty (33%) of the samples had negative p16(INK4a) analysis results, but were positive for HR-HPV. There was no significant correlation between viral load and the level of p16(INK4a) expression, while the grade of CIN correlated to such expressions. Thus, p16(INK4a) expression analysis yielded information which is consistent with results from the histopathology and might complement the HPV analysis in a clinical prognostic procedure in order to find women at risk for cervical cancer.
