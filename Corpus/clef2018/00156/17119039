Reproductive factors, oral contraceptive use, and human papillomavirus infection: pooled analysis of the IARC HPV prevalence surveys. High parity, early age at first full-term pregnancy (FTP), and long-term oral contraceptive (OC) use increase cervical cancer risk, but it is unclear whether these variables are also associated with increased risk of acquisition and persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the main cause of cervical cancer. Information on reproductive and menstrual characteristics and OC use were collected from 14 areas worldwide, among population-based, age-stratified random samples of women aged 15 years or older. HPV testing was done using PCR-based enzyme immunoassay. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of being HPV-positive according to reproductive and menstrual factors and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). When more than two groups were compared, floating CIs (FCI) were estimated. A total of 15,145 women (mean age, 40.9 years) were analyzed. Women with >or=5 FTPs (OR, 0.90 95% FCI, 0.76-1.06) showed a similar risk of being HPV-positive compared with women with only one FTP (OR, 1.00
