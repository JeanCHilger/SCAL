Markers of human papillomavirus infection and their correlation with cervical dysplasia in human immunodeficiency virus-positive women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes and HPV DNA load were analysed in cervical smears from 76 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and 54 HIV-negative women. The prevalence of genotypes was similar for all women, with the exception of HPV62, which was over-represented in HIV-positive samples. HIV-positive women showed a higher prevalence of multiple genotypes that correlated neither with CD4(+) T-cell counts nor with cervical dysplasia. No significant differences were observed in terms of total or single-type HPV DNA load. The HPV DNA load in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women was significantly higher in squamous intra-epithelial lesions than in negative Pap smears.
