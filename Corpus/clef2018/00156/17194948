Patient knowledge about human papillomavirus and relationship to history of abnormal Papanicolaou test results. To assess patient knowledge about human papillomavirus (HPV) and determine if self-report of a previous abnormal Papanicolaou test result improves knowledge.A survey was designed and administered to patients at three obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Milwaukee, WI. The anonymous surveys assessed demographics, history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal Papanicolaou test results, and knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer. The chi and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons.Three hundred sixty-three surveys were collected, representing a diverse patient population. Forty-two percent of patients had heard of HPV. Women who reported a history of abnormal Papanicolaou test results were not more likely to have heard of HPV or to know that it causes cervical cancer than those who did not report abnormal Papanicolaou test results.There is no significant difference in knowledge about HPV between patients who reported a history of abnormal Papanicolaou tests and those who did not.
