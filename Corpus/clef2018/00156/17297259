Clinical efficacy of human papillomavirus DNA detection in urine from patients with various cervical lesions. A considerable number of adult Korean women avoid a Pap smear due to fear and discomfort of the pelvic examination. A reliable but noninvasive and comfortable screening method would considerably increase the participation rate. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of urine-based human papillomavirus (HPV) detection by oligonucleotide microarray, the results of HPV test from matched cervical swab specimens were compared. HPV DNA was detected in 70 of 100 cervical samples. HPV 16 was the most prevalent type (38/70), followed by types 18, 58, 52, 33, 35, 31, and 51. HPV DNA was identified in 47 of 90 urine samples. HPV 16 was the most prevalent type (30/45), followed by types 18, 52, 35, 51, 58, 33, and 56. The HPV detection rates of the cervical swabs increased in accordance with the severity of the cytologic and histologic diagnosis. The type specific agreement of HPV DNA tests between cervical swabs and urine was good in HPV 16 (kappa index=0.64 [95% CI: 0.50-0.79]), 18, 52, and 58 and fair in HPV 33 and 35. We propose that a urine HPV test is a valuable adjunctive method for a conventional Pap smear and can be used in population screening for cervical cancer in countries where it is difficult to obtain colposcopic specimens for cultural or religious reasons.
