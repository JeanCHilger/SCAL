Comparative detection of high-risk HPV (16, 18, 33) in cervical bioptic material of county hospital of Tg. Mures. The purpose of this study was to collect data about the incidence of high-risk HPV (16, 18, 33) types in paraffin embedded cervical bioptic material, including LSIL, HSIL and cervical cancers using immunohistochemistry and nested PCR methods. In our study were included randomly selected 10 LSIL, 18 HSIL and 30 cervical cancer cases. We analyzed the expression of HPV in this specimens with immunohistochemistry used DAKO K1H8 antibody and CHEMICON Mab HPV 16, 16 antibody using LSAB method and Tiramin amplification method, and nested PCR for HPV 16, 18 and 33. In LSIL cases three, in HSIL cases eight and in carcinoma 20 cases were positive for HPV 16 or 18 for immunohistochemistry or PCR. Although this proportion in lower than those reported in the literature, our work signals the existence of the infection in our country and presents a relatively cheap diagnostic method.
