Vitamin B12 status of Thai women with neoplasia of the cervix uteri. The vitamin B12 statuses of Thai women with high- and low-grade cervical dysplasia were studied and compared with women with normal cytological smears. Serum vitamin B12 and vitamin B12 intakes were assessed, as well as demographic characteristics, sexual behavior, reproductive and menstrual history, exogenous hormone use, personal and familial medical history, smoking habit, and other risk factors. The presence or absence of genital HPV DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum vitamin B12 levels in women with normal cytological smears were significantly higher than those with both high- and low-grade cervical dysplasia (p<0.001). Low vitamin B12 serum levels were significantly statistically associated with increased low-grade (OR = 4.08 95% CI = 1.41-11.79
