Expression, purification, and antibody binding activity of human papillomavirus 16 L1 protein fused to maltose binding protein. Genetic human papillomavirus type 16 L1 (HPV16 L1) has been widely studied for cervical cancer vaccine development. For the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening of these vaccines, HPV16 L1 protein, which is required as a coating protein, has previously been expressed from costly and laborious recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. For a novel HPV16 L1 expression system characterized by a high yield of soluble form with simple purification steps, we have cloned and expressed two different types of HPV16 L1, both fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) or glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli. The yield of soluble HPV16 L1 was influenced by the cultivation temperature. The yield of soluble form in the total MBP-fused HPV16 L1 protein (MBP-HPV16 L1) was 35% at 37 degrees C, but increased to 85% at 22 degrees C. Among the fusion partners, MBP provided higher yields of total and soluble HPV16 L1 than did GST. MBP-HPV16 L1 showed a 4.9-fold higher yield of the soluble form over insoluble inclusion bodies under optimized culture conditions. The soluble form of MBP-HPV16 L1 was purified via MBP affinity chromatography in a recovery yield of 9.7%. After fusion with MBP, HPV16 L1 showed binding activity to HPV16 L1-specific monoclonal antibody comparable to HPV16 L1 from the insect cells in ELISA tests. These results demonstrate that the use of MBP as a fusion partner may generate a high yield of soluble HPV16 L1 under optimized temperature conditions, and that MBP-fused HPV16 L1 might be applied further in evaluations of the immune responses of HPV16 L1-based cervical cancer vaccines.
