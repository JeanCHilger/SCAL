Combined analysis of HPV DNA and p16INK4a expression to predict prognosis in ASCUS and LSIL pap smears. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to play an important etiological role in the genesis of cervical cancer, but only a very small proportion of infected women develop invasive cervical cancer. The purpose of cervical cancer prevention is early diagnosis of its precursors. The molecular detection of HPV DNA as a diagnostic test to cervical carcinogenesis gave a low positive predictive value as compared to the use of biomarkers. p16INK4a has been proposed as putative surrogate biomarkers that would allow identification of dysplastic cervical epithelia. Serial consecutive cervical smears were test for high-risk HPV stained with immunocytochemistry for p16INK4a and followed-up for 36 months. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of pl6INK4a as a marker of progression risk in low-grade dysplastic lesions of the cervix uteri. In the present series, significant pl6 overexpression was observed in the group that progressed from low to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion when compared with the group that did not progress. In conclusion, overexpression of p16INK4a acts as potential biomarkers for cervical cancer progression from premalignant lesions.
