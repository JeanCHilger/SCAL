Limitations of colposcopy in early invasive cervical cancer detection. Colposcopy is a key element in the diagnostic chain required to reduce cervical cancer mortality but it has limitations in the diagnosis of malignant disease. In the Republic of Croatia the Croatian Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology started constructing guidelines for early detection, therapy and follow-up of patients with early invasive cervical cancer in order to achieve the best possible results in diagnosis, therapy and follow-up. From 2001 to 2006 Croatian society for colposcopy and cervical pathology organised six courses "Role of colposcopy in early diagnosis and prevention of premalignant lesions of the uterine cervix" in cooperation with Medical faculty, University of Zagreb and the Croatian medical chamber. Leading presentations were focused on the epidemiology of cervical cancer, cytologic, colposcopic and pathohistologic classification, HPV testing and role of male partner. After the theoretical part, a series of colposcopic pictures were presented as a practical part of the course where attendees participated in colposcopic images description and estimation of what could be the underlying pathological process. Such, courses are needed for continued medical education and quality practice of colposcopy.
