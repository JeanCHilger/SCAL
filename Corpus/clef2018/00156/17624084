Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: risk factors for persistence and recurrence in adolescents. One of the most common sexually transmitted infections in adolescents is human papillomavirus. These infections can occur in one or multiple areas of the female genitalia but the vulva is usually the initial site of implantation for HPV. We carried out a long-term follow-up study of adolescents to evaluate the incidence of single or multiple lesions in the lower genital tract, the correlation between sexual behaviour and their localisation and behavioural risk factors for persistence and recurrence of HPV lesions and cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN). We interviewed 268 women aged 12-21 years who had previously had cytology and/or physical examination suspicious for HPV infection. We asked them information about their lifestyle, sexual behaviour, work, personal or family history of genital warts and school attendance. Those who smoked more than five cigarettes a day were considered "smokers". We have no specific data about oral contraception although we know that none of the patients had used oral contraceptives for more than two years. Two hundred and thirty-four young women between the ages of 12 and 21 years were included in the study. The diagnostic schedule for a complete evaluation included exo- and endocervical cytology, colposcopy and directed biopsy. We found that in 126 out of 234 (53.8%) adolescents using contraceptives, only 85 (36.3%) had used a condom. The sites most frequently affected by lesions were the vulva, perianus and perineum (194/234 82.9%), and the cervix (125/234
