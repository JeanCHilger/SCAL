The role of HPV DNA in the evaluation and follow-up of asymptomatic male sexual partners of females with CIN3. To determine whether and how asymptomatic sexual partners of females with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) lesions should be examined.Sexual partners of females with CIN3 were evaluated for HPV-related lesions by scraping samples for high-risk HPV DNA and androscopy (colposcopic inspection of the penis, scrotum and peri-anal area). Abnormal androscopically detected lesions were sampled for cytology by Pap smears.74 partners of 87 females were studied and underwent androscopy, and 17 (22.9%) had abnormal findings: 11/74 had clinical genital condyloma acuminata and 6/74 had aceto-white lesions on the penile shaft or scrotum. Cytology of the 17 abnormal androscopies showed that six smears were normal and 11 had atypia and koilocytosis. Positive high-risk HPV DNA indicated that 13/74 (17.5 %) were infected with HPV. Two partners (2/74, 2.8%) had concomitant HPV DNA 16.Male sexual partners of females with CIN3 should undergo androscopy and cytology of colposcopically detected abnormal areas.
