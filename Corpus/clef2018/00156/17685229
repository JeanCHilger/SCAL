Transcriptional inhibition of human papilloma virus in cervical carcinoma cells reactivates functions of the tumor suppressor p53. Inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 accompanies the majority of malignant diseases in humans. Restoration of p53 functions in tumor results in death of cancer cells, which can be used in cancer therapy. In cervical cancer a product of E6 gene of the human papilloma virus promotes accelerated degradation of p53 in proteasome system. Therefore, one of the approaches to reactivation of p53 in cervical carcinoma cells could be the use of small molecules that inhibit functions of viral proteins. By using as a test system human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa cell line bearing human papilloma virus type 18, HPV-18) with introduced reporter construct that expresses beta-galactosidase under control of a p53-dependent promoter we carried out screening of a library of small molecules to select small molecules capable of reactivating transcriptional activity of p53. We then characterized the effects of two most active compounds in cell lines that differ in the status of p53-dependent signaling pathway. Both of the compounds caused specific activation of p53 in the cell lines expressing HPV-18, to a lesser extent--HPV-16, and do not cause any effect in control p53 negative cells, or in the cells with undisrupted p53 pathway. Activation of p53 in cervical carcinoma cells was accompanied by the induction of the p53-dependent gene CDKN1 (p21), by inhibition of proliferation, and by the induction of apoptosis. Both of the compounds were capable of deep inhibition of transcription from the HPV genome, which apparently was the cause for p53 reactivation in response to decreased expression of the E6 protein. The observed low toxicity for normal cells allows considering these chemical compounds as prototypes for future anticancer drugs.
