Predisposition to HPV16/18-related cervical cancer because of proline homozygosity at codon 72 of p53 among Indian women is influenced by HLA-B*07 and homozygosity of HLA-DQB1*03. This study was undertaken to examine whether predisposition to human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18-related cervical cancer (CaCx) because of p53 proline homozygosity (Pro72Pro) among Indian women was mediated singly or jointly with immunogenetic risk factors such as HLA-B*07 or homozygosity of HLA-DQB1*03. Molecular detection of all three genetic factors was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism using DNA from (i) 114 CaCx samples (78 HPV16/18 positive) and (ii) 195 cytologically normal cervical scrapes (116 HPV-negative and 79 HPV16/18-positive samples). Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine independent effects of the three factors and to determine age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] and P-values. HLA-B*07 was observed to be significantly associated with HPV16/18 infection in asymptomatic controls (OR(age-adjusted) = 4.73 95% CI: 1.55-14.45
