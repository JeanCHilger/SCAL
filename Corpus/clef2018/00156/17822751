The New Technologies for Cervical Cancer Screening randomised controlled trial. An overview of results during the first phase of recruitment. To study the impact of different cervical cancer screening strategies including HPV testing.A randomised controlled trial with a conventional arm (conventional cytology) and an experimental arm following two phases (first HPV testing+conventional cytology, second HPV testing alone). In phase one, different protocols were applied to different age groups (25-34 and 35-60). Published data on test accuracy during the phase one of recruitment are summarised.45,307 women were recruited in phase one (about 95,000 overall). In the age group 35-60, HPV testing (by Hybrid Capture 2) alone at 2 RLU cut-off increased sensitivity vs. conventional cytology (relative sensitivity 1.41 95% CI: 0.98-1.02) with a small loss in Positive Predictive Value (PPVHPV testing, if used as screening test, should be applied alone, with cytology triage essential in younger women but preferable at all ages. Follow-up data will allow analysis of the safety of prolonging screening intervals and the relative persistence of lesions detected with different methods.
