The impact of cervical cancer on quality of life--the components and means for management. To review how cervical cancer patients are affected on a psychological, psychosocial, and sexual level, resulting in an overall decrease in quality of life (QoL).This article reviews influential studies on QoL in women with cervical cancer, as well as the effects on patients' partners. Based on the decreased QoL, we present three suggestions on how clinicians can better patients' QoL after an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test or diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer.Fear, self-blame, distress, and anxiety about cervical cancer are common in women who receive abnormal Pap test results or positive human papillomavirus DNA tests. Such results impact body image, self-esteem, relationships with partners, and sexual and reproductive issues, while adding to an overall decrease of QoL in women with cervical cancer.In order to minimize the deleterious effects, the impact of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions on QoL should be managed as part of a complete healthcare plan. To improve QoL, cervical cancer patients should seek supportive counseling and education about self-care and adherence to treatment and follow-up plans, continue cervical cancer screening, and receive vaccination against prevalent oncogenic virus types.
