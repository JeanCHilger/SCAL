Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and Trichomonas vaginalis infection as revealed by polymerase chain reaction. The impact of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) on the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) has been increasingly recognized over the last 25 years. The role of bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the focus of several current investigations, not only in the genesis of CIN but also in the development of other gynecological and obstetric complications. Out of 150 women with vaginitis, 46 were diagnosed as T. vaginalis infection by different methods: wet mount, In-Pouch TV culture and PCR. Pap smear showed that 10 smears had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 2 smears had atypical squamous cells of high grade (ASC-H), 8 smears had squamous intraepithelial lesions of low-grade (SIL-L) in the form of mild dysplasia, 4 smears showed squamous intraepithelial lesions of high-grade (SIL-H) in the form of moderate to severe dysplasia and carcinoma in-situ. So, the early detection and treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic trichomoniasis minimize the complications of cervical neoplasia.
