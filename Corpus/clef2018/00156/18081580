Estimates for cervical abnormalities in Vanuatu. To use the Pap smear to establish a recent prevalence of cervical abnormalities within a select population in Vanuatu, a developing country.Cervical smears (n=907) were collected from Ni-Vanuatu women from both urban and rural islands within Vanuatu between August 2001 and September 2005.The prevalence of low-grade epithelial abnormalities for the total population was 2.9% and the prevalence of the high-grade epithelial abnormalities/cancer was 2.0%. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) in prevalence of high-grade epithelial abnormalities/cancer between the urban and rural populations sampled, with a higher prevalence in the urban population.The prevalence of pre-cancer and cancer in Vanuatu is high compared with Victorian (Australian) statistics yet comparable with other developing countries with no cervical screening programs available.This study will hopefully assist in future planning of women's health programs and relevant preventive strategies to combat cervical cancer in Vanuatu.
