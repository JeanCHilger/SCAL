HPV knowledge among HPV+ women. To assess knowledge and information seeking among women recently receiving an HPV+ diagnosis.A 2-phase mixed methods design was used. In both phase I (qualitative) and phase II (quantitative), women with scheduled gynecological exams and Pap smears at clinic sites were approached to participate.Women expressed confusion about HPV, and most could not correctly articulate the meaning of their diagnosis. Women do engage in further information seeking, especially through the Internet.Identifying gaps in knowledge among HPV+ women who need clear messages to facilitate their comprehension of the diagnosis is an important public health activity.
