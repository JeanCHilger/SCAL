Predicting high-risk human papillomavirus infection, progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and prognosis of cervical cancer with a panel of 13 biomarkers tested in multivariate modeling. Comprehensive multivariate models were used to disclose whether any of our previously analyzed 13 markers would be independent predictors of intermediate end point markers in cervical carcinogenesis. The expression of the following biomarkers, E-cadherin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, 67-kd laminin receptor (LR67), matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, nuclear factor-kappaB, nm23-H1, p16, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, survivin, human telomerase reverse transcriptase, topoisomerase 2alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) C in 150 cervical cancer (CC) and 152 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions were determined immunohistochemically. Multivariate models were constructed to test predictive power of the markers for 3 outcomes: (1) high-grade CIN, (2) high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), and (3) CC survival. Performance indicators were calculated and compared by the areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Three marker panels were identified consisting of 5 independent predictors of CIN2 (E-cadherin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1, LR67, topoisomerase 2alpha, and VEGF-C), 3 predictors of HR-HPV (survivin, p16, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase), and 2 predictors of CC survival (nm23-H1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2). In predicting CIN2, the best balance between sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) was obtained by combining the 2 most powerful predictors in panel 1 (VEGF-C and LR67), giving the area under ROC curve, 0.897 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.847-0.947) odds ratio, 86.27 (95% CI, 19.71-377.47)
