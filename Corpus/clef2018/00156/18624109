Assesment of real optoelectronic method in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Biophysics is becoming an important factor in prevention of cervical cancer. One of the most promising concepts of biophysical program for the prevention of cervical cancer is the optoelectronic method--Truscreen.The objective of the work was to determine the usefulness of the real optoelectronic device in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasiaFrom August 2006 till September 2007, 147 patients were examined in the Laboratory of Pathophysiology of Uterine Cervix in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Hospital of Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences. The study reports prospective, blind trial. The following diagnostic examinations were carried out: examination with the use of optoelectronic method, DNA HPV HIGH RISK test, colposcopy examination and histopatologic biopsy.The specificity of the optoelectronic method for positive diagnoses amounted to 84%. The sensitivity for intraephitelial changes (CIN 1, CIN 2) was estimated at 53%, and for severe grades (CIN 3, Carcinoma planoepitheliale) at 80%.Optoelectronic diagnostics is useful in the detection of cervical neoplastic changes. The optoelectronic method may prove to be a significant diagnostic device at the basic and advanced level of cervical screening. The advantage of the optoelectronic method over prevention based on cytodiagnostics and colposcopy, includes the immediate result of the examination and its automation as well as standardization.
