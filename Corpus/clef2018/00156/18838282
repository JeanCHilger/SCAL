Prevalence of human papillomavirus type 16 and its variants in abnormal squamous cervical cells in Northeast Thailand. To investigate the prevalence of HPV, HPV16, and HPV16 variants in scraped cervical cells cytologically diagnosed as normal cervical cell and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II-III and squamous cervical carcinoma in Northeast Thailand.All samples were subjected to PCR using consensus GP5+/GP6+ primers. HPV16 was genotyped by Southern blot hybridization and reverse line blot hybridization. The HPV16 E6 gene was amplified and sequenced.HPV infections were found in 33.8% of normal cervical cells, 97.3% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II-III, and 100% of squamous cervical carcinomas. The prevalence of HPV16 increased significantly with histological grade (normal cervical cell, 16.7% cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II-III, 38.9%Our study demonstrates that HPV16, in particular the As variant, was the major causative agent associated with cervical cancer in Northeast Thailand, and our study suggests that some mutations of the E6 gene in this variant, which leads to amino acid changes, may be more carcinogenic.
