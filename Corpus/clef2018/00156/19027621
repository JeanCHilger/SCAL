Cervical cancer: the sub-Saharan African perspective. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and the leading cause of cancer deaths in developing countries. While incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer have fallen significantly in developed countries, 83% of all new cases that occur annually and 85% of all deaths from the disease occur in developing countries. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in sub-Saharan Africa. The incidence is on the increase in some countries. Knowledge and awareness of this disease on the continent are very poor and mortality still very high. Facilities for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer are still very inadequate in many countries in the region. Governments in sub-Saharan Africa must recognise cervical cancer as a major public health concern and allocate appropriate resources for its prevention and treatment, and for research. Indeed, cervical cancer in this region must be accorded the same priority as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis and childhood immunisations.
