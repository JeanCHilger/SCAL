Cervical cancer screening with liquid cytology in women with developmental disabilities. To evaluate the use of liquid cytology in Pap smears in women with developmental disabilities (DD) for endocervical cell yield and abnormalities, via speculum examination or blind technique.We used retrospective chart review of gynecological visits by women with DD from October 2002 to November 2005. Cervical cytology screening included speculum examination or blind technique. Endocervical cell yield was analyzed via Pearson's chi-square test.Of 240 attempted liquid cytology Pap smears, 199 (82.9%) were completed. Of these, 193 met inclusion criteria for the study, and 120 (62.2%) contained endocervical cells. The endocervical cell yield with liquid cytology/speculum was 80.0% and was 43.6% with liquid cytology/blind (p < 0.001). Two blind smears (1.0%) were abnormal both revealed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) with subsequent negative human papillomavirus (HPV) typing.Cervical screening with liquid cytology in women with DD provides an overall rate of endocervical cells of approximately 44%-80% depending on the technique used. Although this is much lower than in the general population, this compares favorably with slide Pap smear in women with DD. The 44% yield of endocervical cells and the finding of abnormal Pap smears with the blind technique suggest this is a reasonable alternative for obtaining Pap smears in women with difficult pelvic examinations who otherwise would not receive cervical screening.
