Prevention of cervical cancer: where immunology meets diagnostics. Based on the insight that cervical cancer is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types, two new directions of cervical cancer prevention have emerged: primary prevention by prophylactic vaccination against hrHPV types 16 and 18, and secondary prevention by cervical screening with HPV DNA testing. These "current views" elaborate on both prevention modes in the context of public health. It is argued that within the next decades using current vaccines the most effective way of prevention and control of cervical cancer requires an integrated vaccination-screening approach, including routine prophylactic vaccination to pre-pubertal women and adapted cervical screening for older women.
