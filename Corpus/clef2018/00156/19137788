Cell protein p16INK4a hyperexpression in epithelial malignancies induced by human papillomaviruses. Protein p 16INK4a is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk4/6. It is encoded by the genome INK4a tumors unassociated with human papillomavirus (HPV) frequently inactivates at the same type p16INK4a is commonly absent in the cells. In cancer of the cervix uteri (CCU) induced by HPV, INK4a hyperexpresses at the level of m-RNA and protein. Therefore p16INK4a is recommended for early diagnosis of CCU. Attention to p16INK4a additionally increases as there is increasing evidence for the implication of HPV in the etiology of some other cancers. The review considers the mechanisms of hyperexpression of p16INK4a in HPV-induced cancers. There is new evidence for the diagnostic value of a positive test for p16INK4a. Moot points of interpreting the results of immunohisto-/cytochemical detection of p16INK4a are discussed.
