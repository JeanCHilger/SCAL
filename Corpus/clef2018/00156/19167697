Posttreatment human papillomavirus testing for recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a systematic review. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the characteristics of human papillomavirus testing, particularly Hybrid Capture 2, in follow-up evaluations after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia for the detection of residual or recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade >/= 2.Medline was searched for relevant studies that were published between 1992 and September 2007. Of the 1107 citations that were identified, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria.Studies that used polymerase chain reaction testing were too heterogeneous to combine. We identified 5 studies that performed both Hybrid Capture 2 and colposcopy. Pooled sensitivity for Hybrid Capture 2 was 90.7% (95% CI, 75.4-96.9%), and pooled specificity was 74.6% (95% CI, 60.4-85.0%). Pooled sensitivity for cervical cytologic testing was 76.6% (95% CI, 62.0-86.8%), and pooled specificity was 89.7% (95% CI, 22.7-99.6%).Hybrid Capture 2 testing can identify approximately 91% of women with residual or recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade >/= 2 however, approximately 30% of women would undergo colposcopy in follow-up evaluation.
