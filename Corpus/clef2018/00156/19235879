Molecular detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus in cervical carcinoma biopsies in an area of high incidence of cancer from Moroccan women. Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in developing countries, and the human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked etiologically to cervical cancer. Eighty nine cervical carcinoma biopsies collected from women visiting the Oncologic Center in Casablanca (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Ibn Rochd, Morocco) for cervical cancer symptoms, were screened for HPV DNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification with subsequent typing by hybridization with specific oligonucleotides for HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, and 59. Using very high stringency hybridization the HPV types could be easily distinguished. After preliminary clinical sorting, 92% (82/89) of the samples were found to be HPV-positive. Among the samples infected by a single HPV, type 16 was the most frequent 36.6% (30/82) of the positive samples, followed by HPV 18 19.5% (16/82). Double or even multiple infections by the different HPV types were also detected (35.5% of the positive samples)
