Distribution of human papillomavirus genotypes in women with cervical cancer in Slovenia. The purpose of the present study was to establish the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in a representative population of women with cervical cancer in Slovenia in order to contribute to the lacking data on HPV in cervical cancer and to assess the potential local benefit of future prophylactic HPV vaccination.A total of 284 samples of cervical cancer were analyzed including archival samples, cervical scrapes and fresh tissue samples. Polymerase chain reaction with GP5+/GP6+ primers was performed in all samples for HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection. All GP5+/GP6+ negative samples were additionally tested using CPI/CPIIg primers and INNO-LiPA HPV genotyping assay.After exclusion of 6 samples with unsuccessful amplification of beta-globin gene, 262 of 278 cervical cancer samples (94.2%) were HPV DNA positive. HPV genotypes found in the decreasing order of frequency were: HPV 16 (64.9%), HPV 18 (12.2%), HPV 33 (4.7%), HPV 45 (4.1%), followed by HPV 31, 51, 58, 59, 35, 52, 73 and 82 (3.5-0.2%). HPV positive samples were more frequent among squamous cell carcinomas than among adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas (95.8% versus 85.5% P=0.003). HPV 16 was more frequently found in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas (69.9% versus 37.5%Prophylactic HPV vaccination with currently available vaccines could prevent up to 77.1% of cervical cancer in Slovenia, which is caused by HPV 16 or HPV 18.
