High-risk HPV detection and concurrent HPV 16 and 18 typing with Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV test. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of cervical cancer. Among the high-risk types, infection with HPV 16 and 18 is associated with significantly higher risk of disease progression, and consequently these two types together cause approximately 70% of invasive cervical cancer worldwide. Identification of HPV 16 and HPV 18 can provide valuable information for risk stratification and clinical management of patients infected with these two types in both ASC-US triage and primary screening in women over age 30. It may also be valuable in the assessment of HPV vaccine efficacy. Abbott RealTime High Risk (HR) HPV is a recently developed test for the detection of 14 high-risk HPV types with the ability to concurrently identify HPV 16 and 18.To evaluate the clinical performance of Abbott RealTime HR HPV test.Abbott RealTime HR HPV was evaluated with 253 cervical specimens obtained from patients with CIN 3 and 340 specimens from patients with cervical cancer to determine clinical sensitivity of the test and the prevalence of types 16 and 18. Additionally, 757 cervical specimens obtained from women 30 years of age or older with normal cytology in a general screening population were tested to determine high-risk HPV positivity rate.The Abbott RealTime HR HPV test detected 97.2% (246/253) of CIN 3 specimens and 98.5% (335/340) of cancer specimens. HPV 16 was the most prevalent type in both CIN 3 (72.8%) and cancer specimens (64.5%). HPV 16 and 18 combined were detected in 78.9% of high-risk HPV positive CIN 3 and 84.8% of high-risk HPV positive cancer specimens. In specimens from women 30 years of age or older with normal cytology in a screening population, the HPV positivity rate was 6.5% (49/757).Abbott RealTime HR HPV is a highly sensitive test for detection of high-grade cervical disease and cancer. The HPV 16 and HPV 18 typing capability of the test offers the advantage of stratifying patients at greater risk of progression and may thus aid in better patient care and management.
