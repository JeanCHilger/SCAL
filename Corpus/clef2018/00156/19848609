Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and type 18 DNA Loads at Baseline and Persistence of Type-Specific Infection during a 2-year follow-up. Studies of viral load-associated persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are rare, with inconsistent results reported.The study subjects were 741 and 289 women who were positive for HPV type 16 (HPV-16) and HPV type 18 (HPV-18), respectively, at the time of enrollment into in the ASCUS-LSIL (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance-Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) Triage Study and who returned 1 or more times for HPV testing during a biannual 2-year follow-up. The numbers of HPV-16 and HPV-18 copies per nanogram of cellular DNA at baseline were measured by use of real-time polymerase chain reaction.Women with, compared with women without, persistent infection at month 6 of follow-up had a higher viral load at enrollment (P< .001, for HPV-16 P=.01, for HPV-18). The association of each 1-log(10) increase in viral load with persistence of HPV-16 or HPV-18 during the first 6 months of the study was statistically significant among women with multiple HPV types at enrollment (for HPV-16: odds ratio [OR], 1.53 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.29-1.82]Prevalent infection with a higher viral load of HPV-16 or HPV-18 was associated with short- but not long-term persistence.
