Human papillomavirus types in invasive cervical cancer specimens from Turkey. The main aim of the study is to describe the human papillomavirus (HPV) type-specific distribution in invasive cervical cancer (ICC) specimens from Turkey. Paraffin-embedded ICC specimens were identified from the histopathologic archives of the Hacettepe University Medical School in Turkey. HPV detection was carried out through amplification of HPV DNA by a SPF-10 broad-spectrum primer polymerase chain reaction and subsequently followed by DNA enzyme immunoassay and genotyping by LiPA25 (version 1). Two hundred seventy-seven ICC cases diagnosed between 1993 and 2004 were retrieved. After histologic evaluation and human beta-globin gene analysis for sample quality, 248 cases were considered suitable for HPV/DNA testing. HPV prevalence was 93.5% (232/248 95% confidence interval: 90.5%-96.6%). The five most common HPV types identified as single types among HPV-positive cases were HPV16 (64.7%), HPV18 (9.9%), HPV45 (9.9%), HPV31 (3.0%), and HPV33 (2.2%). The study shows that in Turkey, HPV16/HPV18 accounted for 75.4% (95% confidence interval: 69.9%-81.0%) of HPV-positive ICC cases. This information is essential to evaluate the potential impact of the HPV vaccines in the country.
