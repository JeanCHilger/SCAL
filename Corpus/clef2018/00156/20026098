HER2 codon 655 polymorphism is associated with advanced uterine cervical carcinoma. It has been suggested that overexpression of HER2 in advanced cervical tumors can be considered an independent predictor of poor patient outcome.Employing PCR-RFLPs, we examined the distribution of HER2 Ile655Val (rs 1136201) genotypes and alleles in patients with advanced cervical cancer (n=109) and controls (n=220).Odds ratio (OR) for patients with advanced cervical cancer with the HER2 Val/Val homozygous or Val/Ile heterozygous state was 1.778 (95% CI=1.117-2.830, p=0.0176). We also observed an association of the HER2 Val/Val genotype with advanced cervical cancer in the patient group OR=3.706 (95% CI=1.061-12.950, p=0.0459). However, we did not find a significant association between the distribution of genotypes or alleles and cancer characteristics for the HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism.Our results indicate that the HER2 655Val variant may be associated with the incidence of advanced cervical cancer.
