Diagnosing cervical cancer and high-grade precursors by HPV16 transcription patterns. Infections with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), mainly HPV type 16, can cause malignant transformation of the human cervical epithelium and the development of cervical cancer (CxCa). A rapid and precise diagnosis of the precancerous lesions by conventional cytology or HPV DNA tests remains difficult and often leads to overtreatment. We quantitatively analyzed the HPV16 transcriptome of 80 HPV16 DNA-positive cervical scrapes classified as mild cytologic grade, including no intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NIL/M normal, n=25) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL
