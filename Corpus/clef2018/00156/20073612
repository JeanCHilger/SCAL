Clinical utility of adjunctive high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing in women with Papanicolaou test findings of atypical glandular cells. Atypical glandular cell (AGC) Papanicolaou (Pap) test interpretations are challenging. Most biopsy findings are benign, but AGC results may also reflect highly significant noninvasive neoplastic and malignant histologic outcomes. High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) test use with AGC Pap test results is evolving.To further evaluate the utility and limitations of hrHPV testing with AGC Pap tests.Hospital records were searched for AGC Pap tests results from June 1, 2005, to August 31, 2007. Cases of AGC with hrHPV tests and histopathologic follow-up were included.Of the 662 women with AGC Pap test results and follow-up analyzed, hrHPV results were available for 309 (46.7%) and were positive in 75 cases (24.3%). Among the 75 cases with hrHPV+ AGC results, 13 (17.3%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2/3, 10 (13.3%) had adenocarcinoma in situ, and 3 (4.0%) had cervical invasive adenocarcinoma, whereas for 234 women with hrHPV(-) results, 1 (0.4%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2/3, 1 (0.4%) had adenocarcinoma in situ, 1 each (0.4%) had cervical adenocarcinoma and ovarian carcinoma, and 8 (3.4%) had endometrial carcinoma.Positive hrHPV AGC results were most strongly associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2/3 and adenocarcinoma in situ in women younger than 50 years. Positive hrHPV AGC results were also present in all 3 cases of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma in women younger than 50 years. Of note, hrHPV(-) AGC results were present in 10 of 13 carcinomas (76.9%) detected after AGC Pap tests, all in women 40 years or older with endometrial adenocarcinomas (n = 8), ovarian carcinoma (n = 1), and cervical adenosquamous carcinoma in a woman (n = 1) in her 50s. Testing for hrHPV after AGC Pap testing was most helpful in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2/3, adenocarcinoma in situ, and invasive cervical adenocarcinomas in women younger than 50 years.
