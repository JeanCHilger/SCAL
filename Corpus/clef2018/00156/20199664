The usefulness of immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of Human Papillomavirus negative adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. The origin of adenocarcinomas presenting on the cervix uteri may be doubtful, i.e. whether it is of cervical or endometrial origin, due to the overlapping morphological features. In HPV negative samples, further tests may be needed to ascertain the nature of the tumours. We aimed to explore the use of immunohistochemistry profiles in tissue microarrays in archived samples of adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the cervix from Uganda that tested negative for HPV DNA.Five commercially available antibodies were tested in tissue array sections immunostained utilizing the avidin-biotin (AB) technique. In 26 ADC samples, HPV was detected in 13, p16 in 15 (8 in HPV positive and 7 in HPV negative), CEA in 12, vimentin in 6, ER in 0, and PR in 2. Among the 13/25 HPV negative ADC samples, five were positive for CEA suggesting endocervical origin, and three were vimentin positive (one had a mucinous endocervical histological pattern and two were ADC, not otherwise specified, most likely of endometrial origin).The immunoprofiles of ADC with the antibodies studied are rather nonspecific. By using immunohistochemistry in 13 HPV negative ADC, endocervical tumour origin was suspected in five CEA positive cases while two out of three vimentin positive samples were probably of endometrial origin, suggesting that CEA and vimentin may be valuable in distinguishing HPV negative cervical adenocarcinomas from endometrial adenocarcinomas.
