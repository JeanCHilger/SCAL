Evaluation of cervical screening results in a population at normal risk. To evaluate the frequency of dysplasia and other cervical conditions in a population at normal risk, and compare demographic characteristics of the women with normal and abnormal results.Characteristics such as gravidity, parity, age at marriage, and smoking status were obtained from a questionnaire completed from January 2004 through July 2005 at Denizli State Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, by the 19639 participants before they were screened. The results were analyzed.The dysplasias detected in 107 smears (0.54%) included ASCUS (0.31%), LSIL (0.15%), and HSIL (0.07%) there were also 1 case of AGUS and 1 of squamous cell carcinoma. Age, age at marriage, number of pregnancies, number of deliveries, and smoking habit were similar for participants with and without dysplasia (P>0.05). Bacterial vaginosis was seen in 1633 smears (8.3%), candidiasis in 1346 (6.9%), Actinomyces sp. in 648 (3.3%), and Trichomonas vaginalis in 143 (0.7%).Cytologic abnormalities in a cervical smear can point to precancerous or cancerous processes or to other conditions. The prevalence of dysplasia was lower for our participants than in Western populations, which could be explained by a conservative lifestyle and a lower prevalence of HPV in Turkey.
