Diagnostic methods and techniques in preventing cervical carcinoma. Part I: Conventional cytology and new cytological methods. Cancer of the cervix is one of the most predictable and preventable types of cancer, however, it is still one of the most common malignancies. Due to a lack of information available to women about the causes of the disease, accessibility of screening programs, and limitations to the existing screening techniques, cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Detection and follow-up of pre-cancer stages of the disease are based on the Pap test, which is now well established as a basic method of secondary prevention. Relative low sensitivity of the Pap test has initiated the development of additional technologies and methods towards enhanced screening quality and error elimination not only in the process of sample taking and analysis but also in screening and interpretation. Immunocytochemical methods and liquid based cytology are the new diagnostics possibilities in secondary prevention. In order to decrease morbidity, thus mortality too, it is necessary that the primary prevention (vaccination) be also implemented.
