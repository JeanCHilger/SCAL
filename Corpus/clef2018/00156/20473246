Determinants of human papillomavirus infection among Inuit women of northern Quebec, Canada. We investigated risk factors for prevalent high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) in Inuit women from Quebec. Younger age and having 10 or more lifetime sexual partners were associated with HR-HPV. Findings suggest that for older women, markers of recent sexual activity are more predictive of HR-HPV status than markers of lifetime sexual history.
