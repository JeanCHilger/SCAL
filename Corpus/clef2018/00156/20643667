Abnormal immunoexpression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the immunoexpression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) E-cadherin, CD44s, and CD44v3 in cervical cancer and compare it with that in benign exo-endocervical tissue. In all, 81 cervical cancer biopsy specimens and 22 benign controls were included. Primary monoclonal antibodies NHC-38, F10-44-2, and 3G5 for E-cadherin, CD44s, and CD44v3 were used, respectively. Statistical significance was evaluated by the Ï‡(2) test. Antigen expression was significantly different in cervical cancer specimens compared with controls, showing marked decrease in membrane expression: E-cadherin, 6.5% and 77.3% (P < .000) CD44s, 3.9% and 81.8% (P < .000)
