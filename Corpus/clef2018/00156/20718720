Use of Cervista HPV HR assay for detection of human papillomavirus in samples with hybrid capture borderline negative results. We have evaluated Cervista HPV HR for papillomavirus detection in 65 samples previously borderline negative by the hybrid capture method (Digene), using InnoLipa and sequencing as confirmatory techniques. Nine samples were found to be positive by Cervista HPV HR, of which five (7.6%) were confirmed by InnoLipa. Four samples (6.1%) were false positive, of which three samples were reactive for A9 probes. The Cervista HPV HR assay can detect HPV-positive samples from those with hybrid capture borderline results but can produce false-positive results when tested for reactivity with A9 probes.
