High squamous intraepithelial lesion and cancer of lower genital tract in women with anogenital warts. The aim of this paper was to determine the incidence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cancer of lower genital tract in patients with anogenital warts and their treatment.Between 1 September 1988 and 30 June 1994, 221 consecutive women with anogenital warts were prospectively examined in the colposcopy outpatient clinic. In 2004, the same group of patients was re-examined.There were abnormal cytological findings in 111 (50.2%) patients 31 patients (14.0%) had HSIL, and 6 of them (2.7%) had cancer. There were abnormal colposcopic findings in 152 (68.8%) womenIn spite of the fact that anogenital warts are caused by HPV types of low oncogenic risk (6/11), there is an increased incidence of HSIL and cancer in these women. Therefore, women with anogenital warts belong to an increased risk group regarding the cancer of lower genital tract, especially if they are associated with HPV types of a high oncogenic risk.
