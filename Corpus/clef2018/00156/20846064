Economic analysis of human papillomavirus triage, repeat cytology, and immediate colposcopy in management of women with minor cytological abnormalities in Sweden. To assess the cost-effectiveness of using human papillomavirus testing (HPV triage) in the management of women with minor cytological abnormalities in Sweden.An economic analysis based on a clinical trial, complemented with data from published meta-analyses on accuracy of HPV triage. The study takes perspective of the Swedish healthcare system.The Swedish population-based cervical cancer screening program.A decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of HPV triage compared to repeat cytology and immediate colposcopy with biopsy, stratifying by index cytology (ASCUS = atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and LSIL = low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and age (23-60 years, <30 years and ≥30 years).Costs, incremental cost, incremental effectiveness and incremental cost per additional high-grade lesion (CIN2+) detected.For women with ASCUS ≥30 years, HPV triage is the least costly alternative, whereas immediate colposcopy with biopsy provides the most effective option at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SEK 2,056 per additional case of CIN2+ detected. For LSIL (all age groups) and ASCUS (23-60 years and <30 years), HPV triage is dominated by immediate colposcopy and biopsy. Model results were sensitive to HPV test cost changes.With improved HPV testing techniques at lower costs, HPV triage can become a cost-effective alternative for follow-up of minor cytological abnormalities. Today, immediate colposcopy with biopsy is a cost-effective alternative compared to HPV triage and repeat cytology.
