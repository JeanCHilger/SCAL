Comparison of the diagnostic utility from visual inspection with acetic acid and cervical cytology. In Mexico, cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death in women after breast cancer. The human papillomavirus is associated with intraepithelial lesions, detected up to 99.7% of cervical carcinomas. Despite being easy to detect is a condition that many women suffer.To determine the diagnostic utility of the visual inspection with acetic acid of the uterine cervix compared with the cervical cytology.Study of diagnostic tests. The study was realized in the Centro de Atención Materno Infantil y Planificación Familiar of the Instituto de Investigación Científica, Durango, Mexico, research of the Juárez University of the State of Durango, from August 23, 2005 to November 13, 2006. 1,521 participants were examined who went consecutively to opportune detection of cervical cancer. One doctor practiced the test of acetic acid and cervical cytology to them, and one digital photograph, which was evaluated by three inter-observers triple blind. Those that was positive to anyone of these tests, were remitted to colposcopy and/or biopsy also to 10% of selected negative population randomly was realized this procedure. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and exactitude were determined. For the agreement inter-observer index of Kappa was used.Sensitivity, specificity, values predictive positive, negative and exactitude for the visual inspection with acetic acid were 20, 97, 5 and 99%, respectively. For the cervical cytology were of 80, 99, 57 and 99%, respectively. The force of agreement between the interobservant was poor.In this study cervical cytology was more useful than visual inspection with acetic acid to detect dysplasias or cervical cancer opportunely, due to detect all the positive true cases confirmed by biopsy.
