HPV/cervical cancer vaccination: parental preferences on age, place and information needs. A vaccine against cervical cancer is available in New Zealand through school and primary care for girls aged 12-18 years. Factors that might increase or hinder widespread uptake by the target population need to be identified.To describe parents' preferences on where their daughter(s) receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, at what age, and their information needs.3123 questionnaires were distributed to parents recruited from 14 schools in 2008, prior to the start of the school-based vaccination programme. Outcome measures were: preferred age and place of vaccination, and information needs of parents and their daughters. Tests for significance were performed to determine whether parental preferences differed by ethnic group (Maori, Pacific, New Zealand European and 'Other').A 25% response rate was achieved (769/3123). Receipt of the HPV vaccine in a clinic setting was preferred by 40% of parents 25% preferred vaccination at school. Fifty percent preferred vaccination to occur at age 13 or olderWe suggest that a programme delivered jointly in primary care and school settings, that is appropriately resourced for follow-up and information-sharing, would increase vaccine coverage. The rationale for vaccination at age 12 needs to be made clear to parents and evidence-based information needs to be delivered appropriately to parents and girls.
