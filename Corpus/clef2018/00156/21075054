Performance of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing as a primary screen for cervical cancer: a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 17 population-based studies from China. Controversy remains over whether high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing should be used as a primary screen for cervical cancer. The aims of our study were to assess whether HPV DNA testing could be applied to cervical-cancer screening programmes in China, as well as other similar developing countries.We did a pooled analysis of population-based cervical cancer screening studies done in mainland China from 1999 to 2008 with concurrent HPV DNA testing (Hybrid Capture 2 assay Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), liquid-based cytology (LBC), and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Eligible women were sexually active, not pregnant, had an intact uterus, and had no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), cervical cancer, or pelvic irradiation. All women positive for any test were referred for colposcopy and biopsy. Cervical lesions were diagnosed by directed or random biopsy. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of HPV DNA testing for the detection of CIN grade 3 or greater.30,371 women from 17 cross-sectional, population-based studies in various parts of China were screened. 1523 women were subsequently excluded because of inadequate HPV DNA specimens or they did not have a biopsy taken, which included women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worseHPV DNA testing is highly sensitive and moderately specific for CIN grade 3 or worse, with consistent results across study sites and age groups-including women younger than 35 years. A rise in the cutoff point might be beneficial for future screening programmes in China, especially when screening women younger than 35 years.
