Analysis of high risk factors associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in married women aged 25 - 54 years in Beijing between 2007 - 2008. to investigate high risk factors associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in married women aged 25 to 54 years in Beijing.from Mar. 2007 to Sep. 2008, 6339 married women at age of 25 to 54 years were selected randomly by cross sectional survey in a total of 137 communities of 12 districts or counties in Beijing. The interview was carried out with unified questionnaires, gynecological examination. The cervical smear cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection of cervical secretion were detected. Women with abnormal cervical cytology underwent colposcopy and cervical biopsy. Odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of related high risk factors with CIN were studied by logistic regression analysis.among 6339 women, the prevalence rate of CIN including 4 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was 5.90% (374/6339). By multinomial regression analysis, HR-HPV infection (95%CI: 9.953 - 15.811), History of trichomonas vaginitis (95%CI: 1.046 - 2.104), oral contraceptives (95%CI: 1.087 - 1.806), age less than 45 years old (95%CI: 1.069 - 1.828) were related with CIN.infection rate of HR-HPV is an independent risk factor of CIN, however, the history of trichomonas vaginitis, oral contraceptives and age less than 45 years old are related risk factors of CIN.
