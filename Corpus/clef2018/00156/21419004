Evaluation of five screening methods for an early detection of cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions in Zhejiang province. To evaluate five screening methods of cervical cancer so as to popularize an effective screening strategy for cervical cancer in Zhejiang province.A total of 1005 women aged 25 - 65 years old were selected from Lishui where cervical cancer was highly prevalent. And 859 subjects were ultimately enrolled between June 2009 and December 2009. Each subject was subjected to five screening methods, including Pap smear, liquid-based cytology (LBC), human papillomavirus DNA with a second-generation hybridization assay (HC2), visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI). CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) 2+ on biopsy was used as the reference standard for disease positivity. Negative colposcopy was accepted as a negative outcome.The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) were 25%, 90%, 26.7% and 98.6% for Pap smear 81.3%, 97.3%, 35.1% and 99.6% for LBCLBC is associated with a better profile of sensitivity, specificity and predictive value for five screening methods. It has the potential of optimizing the effectiveness of primary cervical cancer screening. Due to a low cost and an easy operation, VIA screening is an effective method of screening cervical cancer in the underdeveloped areas.
