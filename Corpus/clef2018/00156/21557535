Equivocal and weakly positive hybrid capture 2 tests in women aged 50 and older. The performance of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test for human papilloma virus (HPV) detection depends on the prevalence of infection. However, the current HC2 manufacturer recommended interpretative algorithm is the same for all women. This test, which may be particularly useful in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women given the morphologic complexity of their Pap tests, could be affected by the overall lower prevalence of HPV infection in this age group. We investigated HC2 equivocal and weakly positive HPV tests in women 50 years and older and the detection of high-grade dysplasia (CIN2+) on their follow-up specimens. All HC2 test data from 1,067 consecutive specimens and 85 additional specimens from women ≥ 50-years-old with equivocal and weakly positive HC2 were analyzed. Follow-up specimens from women with HC2 tests within these ranges were reviewed. No CIN2+ was found on follow-up of 49 cases of women ≥ 50 with equivocal or weakly positive HC2 results. The current HC2 algorithm resulted in "positive" reports in 63% of specimens with initial equivocal HC2 due to retests mostly within the equivocal range. These results suggest that women 50 years and older may benefit from higher HC2 thresholds. The test could also be reported as HC2 values (RLU/CO) to be interpreted in view of risk factors.
