Cytopathic effects of human papillomavirus infection and the severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia : A frequency study. Cytopathic effects related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are more frequently found in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 however, there are indications that at least half the histological diagnoses of CIN2 and CIN3 include koilocytosis areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the cytological criteria suggestive of HPV infection in the cervical smears of women with a histological diagnosis of CIN. One hundred and sixty-two women with abnormal cervical smears and a diagnosis of CIN confirmed by histopathology were selected, including 46 cases of CIN 1, 42 of CIN 2 and 74 cases of CIN 3. Koilocytosis was found in 63% of the smears from women with a histopathological diagnosis of CIN 1. This sign was observed in 26.2% and 25.7% of smears of women with a diagnosis of CIN 2 and CIN 3, respectively. Cytomegaly also was frequent in cervical smears of women with histopathological diagnosis of CIN 1 (71.8%). On the other hand, spindle cells and atypical metaplasia were more frequent in women with CIN 2 and CIN 3. Atypical parakeratosis showed similar frequency in all grades of CIN diagnosis. Koilocytois and cytomegaly were inversely correlated with the diagnosis of CIN2 or CIN 3, with OR values respectively of 0.30 (95%CI 0.13-0.68) and 0.26 (95%CI 0.11-0.58). The others signs analyzed did not show any significant association. Koilocitosis and cytomegaly can provides good reassurance that a patient with atypical cervical smear have CIN 1.
