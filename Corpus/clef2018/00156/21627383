Life-style and genital human papillomavirus in a cross-sectional survey in Shanxi Province, China. To determine the age-stratified HPV prevalence rate and the risk factors of life-style associated with HPV infection among women in rural China.An age-stratified, cross-sectional survey of 941 women between 16-59 years old was conducted in rural China. Carcinogenic HPV infection was determined using Digene's Hybrid Capture II HPV DNA test and interviews of life-style were conducted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from the logistic regression models were used to determine the risk factors associated with HPV.Among 941 women, 745 who had sexual intercourse underwent a cervical examination. The prevalence rate of 13 carcinogenic HPV infections among women 20-59 years old was 15.97%. the rate of HPV prevalence in the 25-34 age group was statistically lower than that in 20-24 and 35-59 age groups (XÂ²=13.3, P=0.0013). The OR of bathing every 7-19 days, 20-180 days, less than once every 180 days vs. bathing at least once a week were 1.19, 1.83 and 2.29 respectively and they had a dose-response relationship (Trend Test: P=0.003). The OR of women aged 25-34 age group vs. 20-24 age group was 0.40 (0.16 - 0.97) and the OR of bathing once every 180 days or less vs. at least once weekly was 2.22 (1.14 - 4.33) adjusted for the other confounding factors,.The HPV prevalence rate was lowest among child bearing women aged 25-34 year. Also, personal hygiene is significantly associated with the HPV infection in this area, regardless of age.
