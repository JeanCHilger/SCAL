Application of human papillomavirus dectection in women with abnormal cervical cytology. To detect the human papillomavirus (HPV) infectious condition in women with abnormal cytology and evaluate its values in the screening of high grade cervical intraepithelial lesion.101 patients who underwent thinprep cell test(TCT) with abnormal cervical cytology were selected to undergo HPV test, all subjects also received tissue biopsy at the same time.(1) Among the 101 patients,the incidence rates of high risk HPV infection of those with ASCUS, LSIL, HSIL and squamous cell carcinoma were 84.2%, 88.6%, 100.0% and 2/2 respectively. (2) Among the patients with abnormal cytology,the number of patients with pathologically confirmed results of CIN I and CIN II or worse were 20 and 81, the incidence rates of high risk HPV infection of those with CIN I and CIN II or worse were 60.0% and 97.5% respectively. (3) In the ASCUS group, the incidence rates of CIN II or worse with high risk HPV infection were 87.5% and the incidence rates of CIN II or worse without high risk HPV infection were 16.7%. (4) The prevalence of high risk HPV types from highest to lowest order were follow: HPV16 (39.6%), 58 (17.8%), 52 (16.8%), 18 (9.9%), 33 (9.9%).The infection rate of high risk HPV was positively correlated with the levels of cervical lesions. HPV test is a good triage approach for the patients with ASCUS. HPV16, 58, 52, 18, 33 are the most common in the patients of cervical lesions.
