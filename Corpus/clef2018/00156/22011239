Minimally abnormal Pap testing and cervical histology in HIV-infected women. To assess the underlying histology of HIV-infected women with minimally abnormal Pap tests compared to HIV-uninfected women by evaluating their colposcopic and histologic outcomes.Retrospective analysis was performed to identify HIV-infected women who had at least one cervical Pap test from 2002 through 2008 at Boston Medical Center. We identified women who underwent colposcopy within 6 months of a minimally abnormal Pap test (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance with positive high-risk human papillomavirus testing [ASCUS/HPV+] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)). Our outcome was the proportion of HIV-infected women with histologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN2+). We then compared these outcomes to those of a cohort of HIV-uninfected women from the same institution.There were 655 HIV-infected women who had Pap testing in the study time frame, and 146 (22%) had a minimally abnormal Pap test (ASCUS/HPV+ or LSIL). Of the 90 HIV-infected women who had subsequent colposcopy within 6 months, colposcopy was negative for 20 (22%), CIN1 for 41 (46%), and CIN2+ for the remaining 29 (32%). During the same time period, there were 747 HIV-uninfected women who underwent colposcopy within 6 months of a minimally abnormal Pap test. Colposcopy was negative for 336 (45%), CIN1 for 254 (34%), and CIN2+ for 157 (21%). After adjusting for differences in age and race, the HIV-infected women were more likely to have CIN2+ after a minimally abnormal Pap test (p=0.002) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-3.62). There were no diagnosed cases of cervical cancer.HIV-infected women have higher rates of underlying CIN2+ for minimally abnormal Pap tests compared with HIV-uninfected women.
