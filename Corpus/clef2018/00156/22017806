Self-sampling of vaginal fluid and high-risk human papillomavirus testing in women aged 50 years or older not attending Papanicolaou smear screening. To study the value of self-sampling of vaginal fluid at home in combination with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in a cohort of older women not attending Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening.Women (n = 3618), aged 50-65 years, who had not attended screening for at least 6 years were offered self-sampling of vaginal fluid at home (study cohort). The collected material was analysed for the presence of high-risk HPV (using Hybrid capture 2 Hc2). Women with a positive HPV test were referred for colposcopy. These results were compared with the results of Pap smear screening in a corresponding age group of women (controls). The end point of the study was identification of a histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 2 (CIN2) and above (CIN2+).In all, 39.4% (n = 1426) women participated and 4.6% (n = 66) were high-risk HPV positive. Of the HPV-positive women 56 chose to attend a surgery (84.8%) after a mean time of 2.1 months and ten of these women (17.9%) showed CIN2+, corresponding to 0.70% of all participating women. In the controls, who participated in organised Pap smear screening, the prevalence of CIN2+ was 0.25% (15/6048). The odds ratio for identification of CIN2+ in women aged 50 years or older performing self-sampling and HPV test in comparison with Pap smear was: 2.84 (95% CI 1.14-6.77, P = 0.0174). In older women primary high-risk HPV testing (Hc2) and Pap smear screening showed equal specificity of around 96%.Self-sampling of vaginal fluid in combination with high-risk HPV testing appears to be an attractive method to improve screening coverage and decrease the prevalence of cervical cancer in women aged 50 years or older.
