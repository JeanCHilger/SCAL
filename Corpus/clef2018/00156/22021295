Salud es vida: development of a cervical cancer education curriculum for promotora outreach with Latina farmworkers in rural Southern Georgia. We developed and evaluated a lay health worker curriculum intended to educate Hispanic farmworker women on cervical cancer, human papillomavirus (HPV), and the HPV vaccine. We pilot tested the curriculum in 2010 with 7 volunteer promotoras for readability, attractiveness, content, comprehension, cultural appropriateness, persuasion, structure and organization of lessons, balance between didactic and participatory activities, and ease of diffusion to community members. Peer-led cervical cancer prevention education is a practical option for low-income, Hispanic farmworker women in newer immigrant-receiving areas of the United States with fewer Spanish-speaking health professionals.
