Adhesion the vaccination against HPV in ASL of L'Aquila. Sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are responsible for anogenital infections and tumours. Types 16 and 18 cause 70% of cervical carcinomas, the incidence of which is higher among young women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the propensity of mothers to have their 12-year-old daughters vaccinated against HPV and identify the variables that may influence their agreement, such as their kowledge of HPV and its relationship with cervical cancer. A 17-item questionnaire was anonymously administered to 312 mothers of girls born in 1997 who were invited to undergo vaccination by their local health authority. The results were analysed using the chi-squared test and STATA 9 statistical software. The analysis showed that 69% of the mothers had had their daughters vaccinated, that most of them know about HPV but only 20% clearly understood the relationship between HPV and cancer Acceptance of the vaccination seems to be associated more with a general predisposition to vaccinate than with a knowledge of HPV and its causal relationship with cervical carcinoma. This indicates a need for educational/ information programmes before and during the vaccination cycle.
