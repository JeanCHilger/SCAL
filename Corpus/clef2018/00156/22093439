HPV prophylactic vaccine coverage in France: Results of a survey among high school and university students in Marseilles' area. To assess HPV prophylactic vaccine coverage among French high school and university students as well as their level of education about this vaccine.An anonymous survey was conducted among 2500 high school and university students from the area of Marseilles, France, from December 2009 to April 2010.A total of 2018 questionnaires were collected (80.7% participation rate). Mean age of participants was 20 years (range, 15-45 years). Only 671 (35.4%) participants reported having been vaccinated against HPV, of whom 510 (73.4%) had completed the three injections scheme. Practice of cytological cervical cancer screening was not significantly influenced by vaccination status. Thus, 578 (45.2%) participants who had not been vaccinated already had had a cervical cytology performed, versus 295 (43.3%) vaccinated ones (P=0.445). Among those not being vaccinated, 671 (49.8%) fulfilled criteria for a catch-up vaccination, of whom only 325 (48.4%) agreed for such a catch-up. Main reasons given for refusal for a catch-up vaccination were the lack of information about HPV vaccine and fear of side effects. In total, 1722 (90%) considered themselves as educated about the HPV vaccine. Source of education was attributed to doctors and media by 54.4% and 53.7% of participants, respectively. Educational role attributed to school and university was poor (3.4%).Despite apparent satisfactory level of education, HPV prophylactic vaccine coverage among high school and university students appears to be insufficient.
