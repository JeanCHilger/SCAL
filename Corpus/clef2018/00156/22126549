Awareness of cervix cancer risk factors in educated youth: a cross-sectional, questionnaire based survey in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the awareness of cervix cancer risk factors among Educated Youth with respect to socio demographic factors.A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was carried out among 1268 female undergraduate students in Delhi, Mangalore (India), Pokhara (Nepal) and Kandy (Srilanka) between 25 April 2010 and 20 August 2010 using structured questionnaire containing details of awareness of cervix cancer risk factors and socio demographic details. Descriptive statistics and testing of hypothesis were used for the analysis. Data analyzed using EPI INFO and SPSS 16 software.In the 1,268 subjects, the mean age of Indian (528, 41.6%), Nepalese (480, 37.9%) and Srilankan (260, 20.5%) were 18.3 ± SD 0.7, 18.6 ± SD 0.8 and 18.0 ± SD 1.5 years, respectively. Distribution of students according to religion varied across the countries. Majority of the students were Hindus in India (61.4%) and Nepal (89.6%) while in Srilanka the majority (53.8%) were Buddhist. Relationships could be established between nationality and risk factors viz. awareness regarding cervix cancer (p= 0.024), sexual activity at an early age (before 16) can cause cervix cancer (p=0.0001), multiple sex partners can cause cervix cancer (p=0.001), condom/other birth control measures cant prevent HPV infection (p=0.0001), smoking as a risk factor(p=0.0001), hereditary risk factor (p=0.015), and first degree relative (p=0.0001).These results indicate that there is an urgent need for a reinvigorated and tailored approach to cervix cancer prevention among the educated youth in India, Nepal and Srilanka. Prevention efforts should be focused on improving social awareness, enforcing education strategies to reduce risk factors and improving the strength and quality of counselling.
