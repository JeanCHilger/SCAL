Human papillomavirus type-specific prevalence in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasm in Western China. Human papillomavirus (HPV) type-specific prevalence was studied in 600 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasm in western China by GenoArray test. HPV-16 and -58 were the most prevalent types, with prevalences of 37.8% and 21.8%, respectively. HPV-18 and -45 were uncommon types. The results show different type distributions from that of other regions, which is important evidence for the selection of future genotypes in HPV vaccines in western China.
