Outcome of SurePathâ„¢ cervical samples reported as borderline nuclear change by cytological subtype and high-risk HPV status. The average borderline rate in cervical cytology samples for English laboratories was 3.8% with the range being 2.0-6.8% at the time of the present study, which was undertaken in order to determine the association between different subtypes of borderline nuclear change (BNC), high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) status.Of 68,551 SurePath(TM) cervical samples reported in one laboratory over a period of 2 years, 2335 (3.4%) were reported as BNC. hrHPV status was known in 1112 cases (47.6%). The outcome was known only for women with hrHPV-positive BNC, who were recommended for colposcopy under the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme sentinel site protocol. Women with hrHPV-negative BNC were returned to 3-yearly recall. The cases were subdivided into BNC, high-grade dyskaryosis cannot be excluded (B-HG 105 cases)The study population age ranged from 23 to 65 years. Cases that tested positive for hrHPV by Qiagen HCII assay comprised 78.1%, 81.0%, 73.1% and 67.8% of B-HG, B-K, B-HPV and B-NOS categories, respectively. CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) was found in 64.6%, 10.0%, 19.7% and 20.1% of hrHPV-positive cases of B-HG, B-K, B-HPV and B-NOS, respectively, which was significantly higher in the B-HG category (P < 0.001) and lower in the B-K category compared with B-NOS (p < 0.001) and B-HPV (p = 0.006) respectively. CIN3+ comprised 55.6%, 6.3%, 26.3% and 19.1% of biopsies in the same categories, respectively.Subtyping BNC is useful, especially B-K and B-HG, which, respectively, had the lowest and highest rates of detection of both CIN2+ and CIN3+, confirming that koilocytosis is likely to be associated with transient HPV infection. Women with B-HG should be referred to colposcopy in the absence of HPV triage.
