Effectiveness and health economic analysis of strategies on cervical cancer screening and early diagnosis and treatment. To explore the appropriate strategies which are suitable for the areas with diverse health and economic resource settings in China by estimating the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of several cervical cancer screening strategies.Markov model was used to calculate the long-term effectiveness, utility, benefit and cost among screened and unscreened cohorts in rural and urban areas, and then analyses of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit were performed. The assessed screening strategies were acetic acid of visual inspection combined with Lugol's iodine staining (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap smear and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) in rural areas, and conventional Pap smear, simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), HPV DNA testing (HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC) alone or combined with HPV DNA testing (LBC+HC2) in urban areas. We estimated the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the above screening strategies at one-year, 3-year and 5-year intervals.All of the screening strategies were effective to decrease cervical cancer mortality and to increase life years, with a trend of shorter screening interval having better effectiveness. However, no matter in urban or rural areas, compared with careHPV testing at 5-year interval, the costs of other screening strategies were 1.28 - 13.86 folds, 1.31 - 14.14 folds, and 1.27 - 12.80 folds higher to avoid one death, to save a year of life, and a QALY, and the benefit per cost of other screening strategies was 9.9%-90.2%.careHPV testing at 5-year interval has the best cost-effectiveness performance and the highest benefit-cost ratio with the moderate life outcomes. It is the optimal cervical cancer screening strategy to be generalized in our country. careHPV testing at 3 years interval can be considered in more developed areas to achieve better effectiveness.
