The role of mRNA E6/E7 HPV high oncogenic risk expression in colposcopy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The aim of this paper is the evaluation of colposcopy and mRNA E6/E7 HPV detection--as the marker of persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in the triage of abnormal Pap smears and in the assessment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia progression risk. The clinical material consisted of 85 women, participating the national cervical cancer screening in the period of April 2010, and October 2010, reffered to the Outpatient Clinic of Gynecologic Oncology and Female Genital Tract Neoplasms Prophylaxy of the Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow, Poland. All subjects were offered gynecological evaluation, Pap smear, colposcopy, DNA HPV (Hybrid Capture2, Qiagen) and mRNA E6/E7 testing (NulciSens, Biomerieux). In case of positive tests colposcopically directed cervical biopsy with histopathologic evaluation were performed.The presence of mRNA E6/E7 HPV transcripts correlated with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, statistically significantly. There was statistically difference between colposcopic, histologic concordance comparing to mRNA E6/E7 HPV colposcopic histologic concordance (p < 0.001).The presence of mRNA E6/E7 HR HPV may be assumed as specific marker of high grade cervical lesions. The combination of mRNA E6/E7 HR HPV ewith colposcopic evaluation increases the colposcopy concordanece with final histologic findings.
