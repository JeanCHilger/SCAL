Decreased prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection is associated with obesity. Obesity is correlated with low education, low economic status, and lower rates of Pap smears, which are known as socio-demographic risk factors for cervical cancer. However, the association between obesity and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, the necessary cause of cervical cancer, and its related precursors, is not established.The authors examined the association between obesity and HR-HPV infection in 6,868 patients, who participated in annual health examinations at the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul, Korea, from January through December 2007.The prevalence of HR-HPV infection was 14.8%. Women infected with HR-HPV had a lower body mass index (BMI), when compared with non-infected women. After adjustment for alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and marital status, HR-HPV infection was found to be negatively associated with BMI. When the analysis was stratified according to BMI, the risk of HR-HPV infection was significantly lower among those who were overweight (OR = 0.817, 95% CI = 0.680-0.982), or obese (OR = 0.688, 95% CI = 0.556-0.851), when compared with women with normal weight.HR-HPV infection was associated with obesity defined by BMI, with a lower prevalence of infection observed in obese women.
