pAkt expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and in microinvasive cervical cancer. The study objective was an immunohistochemical evaluation of pAkt expression in 81 CIN and microinvasive cervical cancer tissue samples and 10 samples of relatively "normal" cervical epithelium of HPV-infected women. PAkt expression showed significant up-regulation in CIN2, CIN3 and microinvasive cancer in compare to CIN1 and "normal" epithelium. The rate of pAkt- positive cells increased progressively by cervical neoplasia grade advancement reaching 7 +/- 5% in CIN2, 15 +/- 13% in CIN3 and 17 +/- 15% in microinvasive cancer. The rate of pAkt-positive cases in general was 1,7-fold higher in CIN3 (41%) than in CIN2 (24%). pAkt expression in conjunction with other markers may be used in immunohistochemical studies for individual CIN outcome prognosis and prospectively in immunocytochemical tests for CIN grade diagnostics improvement before using invasive methods. To elaborate multicomponent system of markers with their indexation there is a need for further investigations with greater number of cases.
