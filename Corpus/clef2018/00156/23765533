Cervical screening test results associated with 265 histopathologic diagnoses of cervical glandular neoplasia. To document screening test histories of women with histopathologic cervical glandular neoplasia (CGN) in a large integrated health system using new methods of cervical screening.Cervical screening test results were reviewed for 265 patients with histopathologic diagnoses of CGN, including 168 adenocarcinoma in situ, 80 invasive cervical adenocarcinoma, and 17 invasive cervical adenosquamous carcinoma cases.Among 222 cases with known triggers of diagnostic studies, 211 (95%) had recent abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test results. Glandular cell abnormalities were the most common recent abnormal Pap test finding in 130 (61.6%) of 211 squamous cell abnormalities alone were documented in 81 (38.4%) of 211, reflecting coexisting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in 60% of CGN cases. Among 114 CGN cases with additional Pap tests more than 4 months to 3 years before CGN diagnosis, 70 (61.4%) had only earlier negative Pap test results. Among 72 CGN cases with recent human papillomavirus (HPV) test results, 70 (97.2%) tested HPV positive. Among 29 CGN cases with HPV test results more than 4 months to 3 years before CGN diagnosis, 25 (86.2%) tested HPV positive.Conservative cytologic screening practices and HPV cotesting can facilitate early diagnoses of CGN.
