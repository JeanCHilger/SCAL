Prospective evaluation of the Amplicor HPV test for predicting progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the Amplicor HPV test, which detects 13 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV), and to determine the association between consistent HR-HPV infection and progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 to CIN3.This multi-institutional prospective study enrolled 122 women diagnosed with CIN2 by central pathological review. Subjects were tested at study entry and every 6 months over a 24-month period by cytology, Amplicor HPV test and colposcopy. Central pathological review was performed at the end of the study or if CIN progression was suspected.Ninety-three of the 122 participants completed all tests in the study and were included in the analysis. HR-HPV was detected in 87/93 (93.5%) participants at study entry. Twenty-four of the 87 HR-HPV-positive participants progressed to ≥CIN3, compared with none of the six participants who were HR-HPV-negative at study entry. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of the Amplicor HPV test at study entry for predicting ≥CIN3 progression were 27.6%, 100%, 100% and 8.7%, respectively. Sixty-two participants were HR-HPV-positive from study entry through to study completion, 24 of whom progressed to ≥CIN3. None of 31 participants without continuous HR-HPV detection progressed to ≥CIN3. For continuous HR-HPV detection, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of the Amplicor HPV test were 38.7%, 100%, 100% and 44.9%, respectively.All participants who progressed to ≥CIN3 were continuously HR-HPV-positive. The Amplicor HPV test thus demonstrated a good performance for predicting CIN3 progression.
