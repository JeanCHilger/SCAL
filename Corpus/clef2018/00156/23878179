An evaluation of novel, lower-cost molecular screening tests for human papillomavirus in rural China. New, lower-cost tests that target high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) have been developed for cervical cancer screening in lower-resource settings but large, population-based screening studies are lacking. Women ages 25 to 65 years and living in rural China (n = 7,543) self-collected a cervicovaginal specimen, had 2 cervical specimens collected by a clinician, and underwent visual inspection after acetic acid (VIA). The self- and one clinician-collected specimens underwent HR-HPV DNA testing by careHPV (QIAGEN) and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2 QIAGEN) and the other clinician-collected specimen was tested for HPV16, 18, and 45 E6 using OncoE6 (Arbor Vita Corporation). Women who screened positive for any test and a random sample of those negative on all tests underwent colposcopic evaluation. The percent test positive was 1.8% for HPV E6 oncoprotein, between 14% and 18% for HR-HPV DNA testing, and 7.3% for VIA. The sensitivity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or more severe (CIN3(+)
