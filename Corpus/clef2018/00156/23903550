Evaluation of the clinical performance of the cobas 4800 HPV test in patients referred for colposcopy. The clinical performance of the cobas human papillomavirus (HPV) test for detection of high-grade disease in a colposcopy-referred population was compared with that of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2). The overall agreement between the tests was 92.3%. Clinical sensitivity and specificity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN2+) were 90.0% and 55.5% for cobas and 90.5% and 50.2% for HC2, respectively. In conclusion, both tests showed comparable performance for detection of CIN2+.
