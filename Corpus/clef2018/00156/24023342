E6/E7 mRNA expression of high-risk HPV types in 849 Greek women. The goal of this study was to investigate human papillomavirus (HPV) geno typing and high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA expression in 849 women.849 Cervical samples were obtained from patients attending an outpatient clinic to have their annual gynaecological check-up. All patients underwent a conventional Pap test. The patients were also offered HPV test with the knowledge that it is not part of the screening.Overall prevalence of HPV DNA was 41.3%, while E6/E7 mRNA expression was found in 20.7% of the patients. HPV DNA and E6/E7 mRNA expression were detected in 21.1% and 9.1% of normal cytological samples, respectively, 38.1% and 23.8% of atypical squamous cells of unknown significance, 84.8% and 40.7% of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 96.4% and 89.3% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, respectively. HPV 16 was the most frequent genotype identified.E6/E7mRNA detection might be useful as a screening marker for the early prediction of active infections and subsequent progression to severe dysplasia.
