Human papillomavirus genotype distribution in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 1 or worse among 4215 Chinese women in a population-based study. To estimate the burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical disease among sexually active women in a sample of Chinese women.A multicenter, population-based study was conducted between May 2006 and April 2007. A total of 4215 sexually active women aged 17-54 years were surveyed from five geographical sites representing both urban and rural areas: Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Henan and Xinjiang. Women were referred for colposcopy on the basis of results of Pap testing and HPV screening. HPV genotyping of the CIN1+ specimens was performed with INNO-LiPA. Attribution of HPV types to lesions was estimated using a fractional contribution approach.13.3% of the women (559/4215) were referred for colposcopy 4.3% (183/4215) of these were diagnosed with CIN1+. Of the latter, 88.5% (162/183) were typed and 94.4% (153/162) were HPV-positive. HPV16 was the most prevalent type in lesions in both urban and rural settings. Combined, HPV16 and 18 were attributable to 71.4% of HPV-positive CIN2+ lesions. In addition, HPV31, 33, 52 and 58 were prevalent in CIN1+ lesions, with HPV33, 52, and 58 combined accounting for 24.1% CIN2+ lesions. Though prevalent, HPV31 always occurred as a co-infection with another HPV type and therefore was attributed minimal causality.HPV16 and 18 are associated with the majority of cervical lesions in Chinese women from which this population-based sample was drawn. In addition, other HPV types, such as 33, 52, and 58, also play an important role in cervical disease.
