Performance of computer-assisted imaging system in detection of squamous intraepithelial lesion of uterine cervix. To evaluate the performance of computer-assisted imaging system in the detection of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion and quality-assurance.Manual PAP screening (n = 140 580) and image-assisted screening (n = 32 885) were compared for the detection rates of squamous cell abnormalities, the atypical squamous cells (ASC) to squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) ratio, the positive rates of high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) test in the case of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), and the correlation between cytopathology and histopathology.Compared with manual screening, computer-assisted imaging system showed increased overall positive detection by 0.32%, decreased detection of ASC by 0.21%, increased detection of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) by 0.22%, increased detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse (HSIL) by 0.31%, and decreased ASC to SIL ratio from 2.59 to 1.60. Computer-assisted imaging system did not change the HR-HPV positive rate of the patients who were ASC-US, or the coincidence rate between cytopathology and histopathology. Moreover, the productivity of the laboratory operation increased 58.33%.Computer-assisted imaging system significantly increases the overall positive detection rate of cervical SIL, improves accuracy and work efficiency of screening, decreases the ASC/SIL rate, and strengths the quality-assurance of laboratory testing.
