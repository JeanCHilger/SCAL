A Viable and Simple Self-Sampling Method for Human Papillomavirus Detection among South African Adolescents. Self-sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing may offer improved patient acceptability, decreased cost, and greater practicality than clinician collection of specimens. HPV testing among adolescents is necessary to conduct vaccine surveillance and may play a role in cervical cancer screening among some populations.A cross-sectional prevalence study was conducted to compare the results of self-collected and clinician-collected specimens for Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing among South African adolescent females. All participants provided self-sampled vaginal swabs and underwent clinician-collection of cervical swabs for HPV DNA analysis. The level of agreement between HPV DNA results from the two specimen collection methods was measured.The level of agreement between HPV DNA results from self-collected and clinician-collected specimens was high (Îº=86.7 p<0.001). A high prevalence of HPV overall was found by both specimen collection methods (57%There is a high level of agreement between the HPV DNA results from self-collected and clinician-collected specimens. Self-collection of specimens for HPV testing is a viable alternative among adolescents.
