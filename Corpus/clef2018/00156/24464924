Upregulation of SCC-S2 in immune cells and tumor tissues of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Studies have shown that SCC-S2 can be detected in cancer cells, but its relation with thyroid cancer remains uncertain. In the current study, we investigated SCC-S2 expression in thyroid cancer from the immune cell perspective and tumor tissue perspective. Levels of SCC-S2 in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, natural killer (NK) T cells, tumor tissues, and adjacent noncancerous thyroid tissues were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR and Western blot. Results revealed that mRNA and protein levels of SCC-S2 were significantly increased in peripheral CD4+ (mRNA, 1.90-fold protein, 1.55-fold) and CD8+ T cells (mRNA, 2.37-fold
