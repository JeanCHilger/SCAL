Distribution of Human Papillomavirus 52 and 58 Genotypes, and Their Expression of p16 and p53 in Cervical Neoplasia. This study investigates the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 52 and 58 genotypes among women residing in Busan, and the expression of p16 and p53 proteins in cervical neoplasia with HPV 52 and 58 infections.A total of three hundred fifteen cases were analyzed using the HPV DNA chip test for HPV genotypes, and of these, we retrospectively examined p16 and p53 expression in 62 cases of cervical tissues infected with HPV 52 and 58 using immunohistochemistry.HPV 52 and 58 genotypes were identified in 62 (54.9%) out of 113 high-risk, HPV-infected cases. Of the cases examined, there were 19 single HPV 52 infections (16.8%), 23 single HPV 58 infections (20.4%), 4 multiple HPV 52 infections (3.5%), and 16 multiple HPV-58 infections (14.2%). Immunoreactivity of p16 and p53 was observed in 41 (66.1%) and 23 (37.1%) of the 62 cases of cervical neoplasia infected with HPV 52 and 58 genotypes, respectively.This study demonstrates a high prevalence of HPV 52 and 58 genotypes, in addition to HPV 16, among high-risk strains of cervical neoplasia in Korea. These findings suggest that development of more vaccines would be beneficial for the prevention of the various HPV genotypes.
