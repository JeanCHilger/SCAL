Evaluation of a novel real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assay for high-risk human papilloma virus DNA genotypes in cytological cervical screening. It has been confirmed that detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV) DNA is useful in cervical cancer (CC) screening. Recently, a new real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed to detect HR HPV. This assay can synchronize nucleic acid amplification and testing using specific primers for 13 types of HR HPV genomes, combined with specific TaqMan fluorescent marker probe techniques through the fluorescence automatic PCR instrument. Furthermore, it uses TaqGoldâ„¢ DNA polymerase, which minimizes the amount of non-specific amplification and increases the sensitivity of the assay. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the real-time fluorescent PCR assay in CC screening, compared to the Qiagen Hybrid Capture
