Spontaneous regression of low-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions is positively improved by topical bovine colostrum preparations (GINEDIEÂ®). A multicentre, observational, italian pilot study. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causal agent of cervical cancer. The great majority of abnormal Pap test results - almost 90% - is referrable to either atypical squamous intraepithelial lesion or CIN1. For these lesions, worldwide agreement exists concerning the high rate - ranging from 40% to 70% - of spontaneous regression over a period of 1-5 years. Host's immune response is a key point influencing the natural history of these conditions. Bovine colostrum is a natural agent positively promoting several immune activities against bacterial and viral agents. The aim of this report was to evaluate the potential positive effect of bovine colostrum-containing vaginal tablets administered to CIN1 diagnosed patients in a prospective trial in regards to spontaneous regression rate.A series of 256 consecutive patients with histologically proven CIN1 recruited in a multicentre, observational, Italian study. Patients have been enrolled in a 24-weeks protocol of treatment and re-tested at the end of the study. Rates of regression have been recorded.Overall regression rate to a negative histology at the end of the 6 month follow up was 75.5%.Regression to normal histology was observed in a very high rate of cases in a very short period compared to the natural history of these lesions. CIN1 patients could benefit from bovine colostrum topical administration in terms of significantly shortening the regression time.
