Performance of self-sampled HPV test in comparison with liquid based cytology. Strong evidences shows that HPV testing is more sensitive than cytology in detecting high-grade CIN. HPV test can be performed on samples collected by women themselves by means of self-sampling devices. This study compares the results of self-sampled HPV tests with the results of liquid based cytology (LBC).Seven hundred women scheduled for cervical cytology self-collected a cervicovaginal sample for HPV testing and then underwent a clinician-collected LBC at the European Institute of Oncology. The HPV and LBC results were compared with the McNemar test.All HSIL (N=5) resulted hrHPV positive. LBC resulted LSIL or worse in 38 (5.4%) women (out of 700). Self-sampled HPV was positive in 96 women (13.7%). A LSIL or worse LBC result was found in 15 (2.5%) patients, out of the 604 hrHPV negative women and in 23 (24%) patients, out of the 96 hrHPV positive women. Positive cytology after a self-sampled HPV positive result had an Odds Ratio of 12.4 (95% CI: 5.8-26.6).Self-collected HPV testing identifies a group of women at high risk of positive LBC and high grade SIL.
