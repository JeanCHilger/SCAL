Human papillomavirus genotypes profile in cervical cancer patients at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. As in other developing countries, cervical cancer is the most frequent gynecologic malignancy in Indonesia. Persistent high risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) that infect the cervical tissue have been established as the etiology of cervical cancer. This study aimed to explore the profile of cervical cancer patients and the infected HPV genotypes at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital-Bandung.During the year 2010, 554 cervical cancer patients were registered. In a subset of the patients during July-November 2010, 40 randomized fresh biopsies were tested for HPV genotype after obtained informed consent. The distribution of HPV genotypes and the association to risk factors were analysed.The result showed that 62.5% of the tested biopsies were infected by multiple HPV infections, with HPV-16 found in most of the cervical cancer patients (90%). Marriage at age younger than 16 years old was statistically significant in relation to multiple HPV infection (p=0.003), but not parity more than three times (p=0.59).Although high paritiy in our study was not associated with multiple HPV infection, good family planning programs and reproductive health education need to be emphasized in Indonesia as high parity and marriage at young age might increase the chance of cervical cancer development.
