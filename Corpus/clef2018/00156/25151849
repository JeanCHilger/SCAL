Screening of human papillomavirus infection in women with systemic sclerosis. High risk human papilloma-viruses (HR HPV) are associated with risk of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma. The risk is increased in patients with immune deficiency or auto-immune disease as systemic lupus erythematosus. Currently, no data are available about the human papillomavirus status in women with systemic sclerosis (SSc).Thirty-one women with SSc were evaluated for cervical HPV infection and dysplasia, and compared to fifty age-matched control. Cervical swabs were tested by the INNO-LiPA assay®. Serum antibodies against HPV 16 and 18 were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the SSc group.The overall HPV frequency was comparable between SSc and controls (32% vs. 38%), as well as the HR HPV frequency (28% vs. 34%), but infection by ≥2 HPV was two times more frequent in the SSc group (50% vs. 26% of the HPV positive samples). The most prevalent genotype was 52 in the SSc group (12%), and 52/53 in the control group (8% for both). Pap smears were within the normal range. Seropositivity for HPV 16 and 18 was 13% and 6.5%, respectively. A diffuse systemic sclerosis and a younger age at first intercourse were more frequent in cases of overall HPV positivity. Current smoking and a higher number of sexual partners were only observed in cases of seropositivity.This is the first study to evaluate HPV status in women with SSc. HR HPV52 was the most common genotype with a greater multi-HPV infection rate. This result needs to be confirmed in a larger study.
