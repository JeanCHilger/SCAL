Validity of cervicovaginal cytology in a Brazilian State with high incidence rate of cervical cancer. To evaluate the validity of cervicovaginal cytology performed at LAPER, the main Laboratory of Pathology of the State of Roraima, Brazil, by interrater agreement (external monitoring) and agreement with histopathologic results.One hundred women were included, a population-based convenience sample. Their cervical cytological exams were evaluated by the laboratory staff and reviewed by expert medical pathologists, external to the laboratory. Cohen's Kappa index, sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. The study was approved by LAPER coordination and Federal University of Roraima Research Ethics Commitee.Regarding the prevalence of human papillomavirus-related atypical, there was no concordance between the results issued by LAPER and by the external pathologists (k=0.21). A low sensitivity (28.5%) and specificity (89,2%) was detected for the diagnostic performance of LAPER, with a high proportion of false positive and false negative results. The cytological reports of the external pathologists showed higher sensitivity and specificity (71.4 and 98.9%, respectively), ruling out the possibility that errors related to collection methods and staining would explain the low performance of the laboratory.A low diagnostic accuracy of cervicovaginal cytology can be a barrier against the control of cervical cancer in Roraima. We emphasize the need for professional training and internal and external monitoring in Brazilian states with a high incidence of cervical cancer.
