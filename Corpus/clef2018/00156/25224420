Screening of cervical HPV infection at the reproductive health centre of ariana. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in developing countries. Over 99 per cent of cases are linked to genital infection with Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs), which are the most common sexually-transmitted viruses worldwide and infect an estimated 660 million people. In light of the advances of the development of HPV vaccines in the world, the challenges to introducing and sustaining such vaccines in the public sector are faced by our countries, generating the need of understanding the local epidemiology of the disease. aim : This study aims to obtain some relevant data on local disease burden in a big health care centre of Tunis. method : In this study, 133 healthy Tunisian women are screened for HPV infection with detection of 37 genotypes. Samples are collected on dry cotton swabs and genotyping use PCR and linear array assay. results : 7,8 % of women were infected and HPV 16 was the only High-risk genotype encountered. 62,5% of infected women doesn't show any cytological abnormality on pap smears. Low and High grade epithelial lesions were associated with HPV 16. Conclusion : There is currently few and sparse data in Tunisia. This work represents to our knowledge the first HPV cervical infection screening study in Tunisia in a basic health centre. The most relevant data is the High frequency of High risk HPV infections related to HPV 16. More than a half of cervical smears in infected women does not show any cytological abnormality and thus, pap smear screening is not appropriated to detect this infection.
