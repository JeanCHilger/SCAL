Role of E6/E7 mRNA test in the diagnostic algorithm of HPV-positive patients showing ASCUS and LSIL: clinical and economic implications in a publicly financed healthcare system. Colposcopy is widely used to triage women with mild cervical abnormalities. However, this approach is associated with low specificity and predictive value. The efficacy of E6/E7 mRNA test for this purpose has been demonstrated, but studies estimating its cost-effectiveness are still lacking. Given the limited healthcare financial resources, such an evaluation is a priority.We analyzed the clinical history of 432 women referred to colposcopy and colposcopy-directed biopsy for persisting ASCUS and LSIL, and compared three alternative triage protocols: immediate colposcopy reflex HPV DNA testing and HPV DNA plus mRNA tests in sequence.Molecular tests in sequence significantly reduce colposcopy referral, cost for assessed women, and cost for CIN2 detected. On the other hand, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this protocol was the highest.Our preliminary data, providing an estimation of the economic burden deriving from the introduction of E6/E7 mRNA test in the triage algorithm of patients with mild cervical abnormalities, may be useful for future healthcare policy.
