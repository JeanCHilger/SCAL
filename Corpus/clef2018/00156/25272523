P16(INK4alpha)/Ki-67 immunocytochemical dual staining for detection of cervical lesions associated to papillomavirus infection. We aimed to explore the expression pattern of p16(INK4alpha)/Ki-67 immunocytochemical dual-staining and to establish the potential clinical utility for early detection of cervical lesions. Liquid-based cytologies of cervical specimens of cervical cancer screening were processed for p16(INK4alpha)/Ki-67 immunocytochemical dual-staining using the CINtec Plus Kit. HPV testing was performed with the INNO-LiPA HPV genotyping Extra Reverse Hybridization Line Probe Assay kit. One hundred and fifteen cervical cytologies were analyzed with the following results: 11(9.6%) were negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy (NILM) 32 (27.8%) presented atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)
