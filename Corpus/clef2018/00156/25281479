Distribution of human papillomavirus genotypes amongst HIV-negative and HIV-positive women diagnosed with ASC-US cytology. Preliminary data of a local retrospective study. Analysis of the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes amongst HIV-negative and HIV-positive women diagnosed with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US).We performed a retrospective study of HPV genotype distribution in 313 ASC-US Pap smears from women who consulted at the University Hospital of Nice between 2008 and 2012. HPV genotyping results, conducted on PapilloCheck(Â®) HPV DNA Chip, and information on the status of HIV patients were retrospectively collected. The odds ratio were calculated by logistic regression.In co-infected HIV/HPV women we observed a low prevalence of HPV16, a high prevalence of oncogenic HPV low risk and a high prevalence of HPV 68 compared to non-co-infected women. By grouping HPV HR based on their prevalence in cervical cancer of the uterus and their genetic proximity we observe that HPV 18, 45, 68 (the "alpha-7") are 7.4 times more represented (CI95 [2.48 to 22.35]) than HPV 16, 31, 33, 52, 58 (the "alpha-9") in the population of women co-infected with HIV.Given that HPV "alpha-7" are responsible for 46.3% of adenocarcinomas, the high prevalence of these HPV found in ASC-US Pap smears of co-infected women should be put in relation with the highest prevalence of glandular abnormalities found in this population. HPV genotyping could become an essential tool for gynecological care for HIV positive women.
