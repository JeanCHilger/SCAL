Cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus-16/18 genotyping in cervical cancer screening. There is limited understanding of the health economic implications of cervical screening with human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 genotyping.The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of cervical cancer primary screening with a HPV-16/18 genotyping test which simultaneously detects 12 other high-risk HPV types.A Markov cohort model compared four strategies: (1) cytology with reflex HPV testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (2) co-testing with cytology and HPV testingApplying a US$50,000/QALY threshold, strategy (4) dominated strategies (2) and (3) by reducing costs and cancer incidence and improving QALYs, and was cost effective versus strategy (1). Accounting for persistent ≥CIN 3 at 1 year, strategy (4) was cost effective versus all other strategies. Detecting HPV-16/18 resulted in earlier diagnosis of clinically relevant ≥CIN 3 at initial screening and efficient use of follow-up resources. Outcomes were most influenced by strategy performance.Incorporating HPV-16/18 genotyping is cost effective and may improve detection of CIN, thereby preventing cervical cancer.
