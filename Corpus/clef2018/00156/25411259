Lack of association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and cervical human papillomavirus infection in systemic lupus erythematosus. Our objective was to evaluate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in women with SLE. This is a cross-sectional study of 67 women with SLE. A structured questionnaire was administered to ascertain the possible risk factors associated with cervical HPV infection. A gynaecological evaluation and cervical cytology screening were made. HPV detection and genotyping was made by PCR and linear array assay. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels were quantified by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Mean age and disease duration were 44.8 ± 10.6 and 42.5 ± 11.8 years, respectively. Demographic characteristics were similar in patients with and without deficiency (<20 ng/ml and ≥20 ng/ml). There were 28.4% of women with cervical HPV infection and 68.4% had high-risk HPV infections. Patients with 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels <20 ng/ml had a higher prevalence of cervical HPV infection than those with levels ≥20 ng/ml (30.7% vs. 25.8% p = 0.72). We found no significant difference when high-risk HPV infection was evaluated (36.8% vs. 31.5%
