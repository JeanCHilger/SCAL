HPV and HPV vaccination: knowledge and consciousness of young women. The aim of the study was to explore the knowledge and the awareness of the young Turkish women regarding cervical cancer and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. The authors analyze a probable relationship between the overall knowledge level and a few socio-demographic parameters.The authors interviewed with students from Canakkale 18 March University and young women that did not continue with school in the same city from January to September 2011. All the students answered the questionnaire voluntarily and independently.The participants had low level of knowledge about the risk factors for cervical cancer. Smoking is the major risk factor that was known by the participants (65%). Proportion of the participants that were aware of pap smear test and HPV were 65% and 17% respectively. A small proportion of young women had knowledge regarding protection from HPV. Educational stream, educational level, family income, and family size had significant association knowledge level (p < 0.05).There has not been any improvement in HPV and risk factor of cervical cancer awareness in young women. Health members of the National Cancer Control Programme and delegates of the vaccine corporations have major work in order to increase the level of knowledge so that general public can easily take preventative measures.
