The role of ureaplasma urealyticum infection in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. To investigate the role of ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer and to study the correlation between UU and HPV infection in CIN/cervical cancer.A total of 233 research subjects were divided into the case group and the control group. UU and pathogenic load UU were detected in the case group and the control group by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, human papillomavirus (HPV) in case group by PCR + membrane hybridization method.There was statistically significant difference in the case group and control group with respect to the positive rate and pathogenic load of UU (p < 0.05). The positive rate of UU among CIN II group, CIN III group, and the cervical cancer group were not statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). There may be statistically significant difference in the result of testing UU coinfection with HPV (p = 0.002).Positive rate and the pathogenic load of UU infection may be related to the genesis of cervical cancer. Significant combined effect could strengthen the process of the disease and lead to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer between infection of HPV and UU.
