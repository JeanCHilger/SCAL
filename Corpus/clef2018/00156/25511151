Reliability of the Xpert HPV assay to detect high-risk human papillomavirus DNA in a colposcopy referral population. The Xpert HPV Assay (Xpert Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) was developed for the multianalytic GeneXpert platform.In a colposcopy referral population of 708 women living in the United States, two cervical specimens, A and B, were collected, and both were tested by the Xpert assay for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA, permitting an evaluation of its test reliability. Specimen B was also tested by Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2 Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and the cobas HPV Test (cobasThe Îº and percent agreement for any hrHPV for the two Xpert results were 0.88 and 94.5%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in testing positive on both specimens by Xpert (P = .62). The sensitivity for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) was 89.0% using specimen A and 90.4% using specimen B for Xpert, 90.4% for cobas, and 81.6% for hc2.The Xpert assay was sensitive and reliable for the detection of hrHPV and the identification of women with CIN2+.
