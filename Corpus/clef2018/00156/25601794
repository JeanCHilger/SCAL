Surface modification of tri-calcium phosphate nanoparticles by DOPE and/or anti-E6 antibody to enhance uptake of antisense of E6 mRNA. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the uptake of E6 mRNA antisense into cervical cancer cells, induced by human papilloma virus (HPV). In this study, the carrier of the antisense was tri-calcium phosphate nanoparticles (TCP NPs) conjugated with dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE) and/or anti-E6 antibody. At first, TCP NPs were synthesized, coated with carboxy-polyethylene glycol, and then conjugated with anti-E6 antibody and/or DOPE by carbodiimide cross-linker. Then, a single stranded DNA, which was complementary (antisense) of E6 mRNA, was attached to each one. Finally, the uptake of conjugated and unconjugated TCP NPs into HelaS3 cells was separately evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and fluorescent microscopy. Also, the cytotoxicity of these carriers was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Overall, 4 types of TCP NPs were used in this study, including 1) TCP NPs conjugated with DOPE (TCP NPs/DOPE), 2) TCP NPs conjugated with DOPE and antibody (TCP NPs/DOPE/Anti-E6 Ab), 3) TCP NPs conjugated with antibody (TCP NPs/Anti-E6 Ab), and 4) TCP NPs which not conjugated with DOPE and antibody (unconjugated TCP NPs). Uptake tests showed that although all types of TCP NPs could transfer antisense of E6 mRNA into HelaS3 cells, TCP NPs/DOPE and TCP NPs/DOPE/Anti-E6 Ab had more uptake than TCP NPs/Anti-E6 Ab and unconjugated TCP NPs. Moreover, MTT assay showed that TCP NPs/DOPE was more toxic than TCP NPs/DOPE/Anti-E6 Ab, TCP NPs/Anti-E6 Ab, and unconjugated TCP NPs. It can be concluded that TCP NPs/DOPE/Anti-E6 Ab is a good choice for oligonucleotide delivery, because of higher uptake and less toxicity, compared with other formulations.
