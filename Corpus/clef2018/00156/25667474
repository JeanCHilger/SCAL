Age influences the clinical significance of atypical glandular cells on cytology. To evaluate women with atypical glandular cells (AGC) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) on cytology.Population-based data of cervical smears taken between 2008-2012 were analyzed.Cancer was diagnosed in 107 out of 199 patients (54%) with AGC or AIS 30 with cervical adenocarcinoma and 77 with endometrial cancer. All women with endometrial cancer were 50 years or older. In women younger than 50 years, cervical pre-cancerous lesions were found in 44 (47%) and cervical adenocarcinoma in 24 out of 92 cases (26%). High-risk HPV infection was found in 62 out of 103 women (60%). The detection rate of high-risk HPV at finding histopathological AGC, AIS, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or cervical cancer was 98% (95% confidence interval=0.903-1.000) (54/55).AGC or AIS indicates endometrial neoplasia in women 50 years or older and pre-cancerous or invasive glandular cervical lesions in younger women. HPV testing seems to identify underlying cervical adenocarcinoma and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.
