Utilisation of co-testing â€¨(human papillomavirus DNA testing and cervical cytology) after treatment of CIN: - a survey of GPs' awareness and knowledge. Patients have an increased risk of persistent/recurrent cervical disease if they received treatment for a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Consequently, understanding whether co-testing (human papillomavirus [HPV] DNA testing and cervical cytology) is fully utilised by general practitioners (GPs) is paramount.After consultation with key stakeholders, an anonymous, self-completion questionnaire was developed and disseminated to GPs who had provided cervical cytology.Responses were received from 745 GPs (30.9% response rate). A significant number (34.3%) of GPs were unaware of the use of co-testing (HPV DNA testing and cervical cytology) for the management of patients after HSIL treatment. Additionally, the majority of GPs reported they did not 'always' receive a clear follow-up plan for patients after treatment of an HSIL.GPs require further support and education to ensure successful adoption of co-testing (HPV DNA testing and cervical cytology), specifically, for patients treated for an HSIL.
