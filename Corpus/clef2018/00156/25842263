Notch1 ligand signaling pathway activated in cervical cancer: poor prognosis with high-level JAG1/Notch1. Notch signalings are regulated multiple cellular processes during cancer progression. We aimed to investigate the significance and prognostic value of expression of Notch1 and JAG1 in cervical cancer to determine whether they could serve as prognostic predictors.The expression of Notch1/JAGD1 was investigated by real-time PCR, western blot assay and its association with overall survival of patients was analyzed by statistical analysis.Notch1 and JAGD1 expression level were significantly elevated in cervical cancer in comparison to normal specimens and other types of Notch receptors and ligands. It is also proved that Notch1 and JAGD1 expression were to be associated with cervical cancer invasion, lymph node metastasis, and FIGO system. In addition, survival analysis proved that elevated Notch1 and JAGD1 expression were associated with poor overall survival of patients (P = 0.01, P = 0.02 log-rank test), respectively.The present data proved the over-expression of Notch1/JAGD1 and its association with tumor progression in human cervical cancer, which might be a potential valuable biomarker for cervical cancer and further studies need.
