Expressions of survivin, P16(INK4a), COX-2, and Ki-67 in cervical cancer progression reveal the potential clinical application. To explore the significance of survivin, P16(INK4a), COX-2, and Ki-67 expressions for prediction of cervical cancer progression.A retrospective study was performed in 129 cases including 24 squamous carcinoma of the cervix (SCC), 70 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN), 15 cervical condyloma acuminatum (CCA), ten chronic cervicitis (CC), and ten normal cervix (NC). Protein expressions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry.Survivin, P16(INK4a) COX-2, and Ki-67 were highly expressed in SCC and CIN compared with others. Their expression rates were gradually increased in CIN I, CIN II, CIN III, and SCC groups, showing 72.00%, 88.00%, 90.00%, and 95.83% for P16(INK4a), 68.00%, 84.00%, 95.00% and 100.00% for COX-2, 76.00%, 96.00%, 100.00%, and 100.00 for Ki-67, respectively. There were significant correlations between survivin and P16(INK4a), COX-2, Ki-67, as well as P16(INK4a) and Ki-67.Survivin, P16(INK4a), COX-2 and Ki-67 play critical roles for development and progression of cervical cancer.
