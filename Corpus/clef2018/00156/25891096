Prospective evaluation of p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology for managing women with abnormal Papanicolaou cytology: PALMS study results. Testing for the presence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) is widely accepted for triaging Papanicolaou cytology results categorized as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). In contrast, HPV testing has limited use in triaging cytological low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) due to prevalence rates of typically >80%. In the current study, the authors assessed the diagnostic performance of p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology in triaging ASC-US and LSIL cases within the prospective, multicentric Primary ASC-US LSIL Marker Study (PALMS).A total of 575 ASC-US cases and 529 LSIL cases from a cohort of 27,349 women who were prospectively enrolled into the PALMS study in 5 European countries were tested with p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) HPV testing. Colposcopy-guided biopsy results of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were used as clinical endpoints.p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology demonstrated comparable (ASC-US: 94.4% for dual-stained cytology vs 100% for HC2 testing P =â€‰.317) or lower (LSIL: 85.7% for dual-stained cytology vs 98.4% for HC2 testingThe clinical usefulness and efficiency of triaging women with ASC-US or LSIL Papanicolaou cytology results by p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology testing has been confirmed in this prospective, pan-European study. The high positive predictive value of dual-stained cytology for the presence of high-grade CIN may help to reduce the number of unnecessary colposcopy referrals.
