Comparison of human papillomavirus infection and cervical cytology in women using copper-containing and levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine devices. To investigate whether there is a difference in cervical cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection clearance between levonorgestrel- and copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD) users.The electronic medical record system was searched by the appropriate procedural code for IUD insertion for all patients undergoing IUD placement during the study period (January 31, 2005 to January 31, 2012). Patients who received treatment for cervical dysplasia, had their IUDs removed, or conceived during the study period were excluded. High-risk HPV and cervical cytology results immediately preceding and after IUD placement were obtained.One hundred fifty patients had a copper-containing and 152 patients a levonorgestrel-containing IUD placed. The groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, duration of follow-up, and percentage of smokers. Sixty-six patients were high-risk HPV-positive before IUD insertion (30 in copper compared with 36 in the levonorgestrel IUD group, P=.4), and the groups had similar follow-up times (364.1±26.3 compared with 357.2±29.7 days, respectively, between the IUD placement and a repeat Pap test with high-risk HPV cotesting, P=.2). Of those, 21 (70% 95% confidence interval [CI] 53.6-86.4%) cleared the infection after copper-containing IUD placement compared with 15 (42%Our data suggest that levonorgestrel-containing IUD could be associated with decreased high-risk HPV infection clearance and possibly increased acquisition compared with the copper-containing IUD.II.
