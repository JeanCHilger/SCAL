A clinical study of cases diagnosed as being oropharyngeal carcinoma after cervical mass extirpation/biopsy. In the case of oropharyngeal carcinoma, patients may present with symptoms similar to cervical lymphadenopathy, and the primary lesion may only be diagnosed after cervical mass extirpation/biopsy. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course in 11 oropharyngeal carcinoma patients that were diagnosed after cervical mass extirpation/biopsy between 1998 and 2013. Before the diagnosis was made of oropharyngeal carcinoma, a cervical lymph node biopsy was performed in six patients the lymph node was extirpated due to an initial diagnosis of lateral cervical cyst in four patients
