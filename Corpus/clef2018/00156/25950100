The absence of human papillomavirus in amniotic fluid. The objective of this multicenter trial was to determine the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the amniotic fluid of pregnant patients.Fifty-three pregnant patients undergoing genetic counseling or amniocentesis for preterm labor were entered into the study. Cervical swabs and amniotic fluid samples were ob-tained at the time of entry. Demographical questionnaires were completed by all patients. All samples underwent HPV analysis using polymerase chain reaction.The incidence of cervical HPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in this population was 24% and 4%, respectively. The analysis of 49 amniotic fluid samples revealed the absence of HPV in each specimen.The absence of HPV in the amniotic fluid of patients with cervical colonization does not support a mechanism of prenatal transmission in the general population.
