A descriptive evaluation with follow-up of the clinical significance of atypical immature squamous metaplasia of the cervix. We set out to determine the clinical significance of atypical immature squamous metaplasia (AIM).We performed in a military, hospital-based colposcopy clinic a descriptive, retrospective review of patients who had a diagnosis of AIM. Patients were examined at 3- to 4-month intervals for at least 1 year after a diagnosis of AIM was established. A gynecological pathologist reviewed all histological and cytological specimens. Initial histological or cytological specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA using in situ hybridization.High-risk HPV DNA types 16 or 18 were detected in 3% of patients with AIM. Concurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) was noted in 3% of patients with AIM. One-third of patients with initially diagnosed AIM had complete resolution of this lesion after 1 year of follow-up.This descriptive, retrospective review shows that AIM does not appear to be associated with high-risk HPV DNA or with CIN3. In this limited study, a concurrent diagnosis of AIM likely does not influence the 1-year behavior of CIN. The degree of CIN should dictate treatment recommendations. A larger prospective trial is needed.
