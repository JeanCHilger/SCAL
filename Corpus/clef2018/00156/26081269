Distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes detected by routine pap smear in Uyghur-Muslim women from Karasay Township Hotan (Xinjiang, China). HPV infection is an important public health problem in developing countries. We investigated HPV genotypes in the Uyghur female population of Karasay Township, Hotan region. A population-based cervical cancer screening was conducted for 4,500 women in Karasay Township, Xinjiang Hotan, China. A total of 900 women were selected by systematic sampling with a 5:1 proportion (ages 20-69). The subjects completed a questionnaire and consented to HPV typing and Pap smear examination. Colposcopic biopsies were performed for patients with cytological abnormalities (≥ ASCUS). A total of 117 of the 900 women (13%) assessed were infected with HPV. The most common subtype was HPV-16, and other common high-risk types included HPV-58 and HPV-39. A total of 40 women (4.44%) were identified with abnormal cytology (≥ ASCUS) by Pap smear. A significant link was found between HPV prevalence and cytological diagnosis. The HPV infection rates for the patients with cervical inflammation, CIN, and cancer were 18.18%, 64.71%, and 100%, respectively. Significant differences in HPV infection rates were found among the patients with the three groups of pathological results. In Karasay, the HPV infection rate in Uyghur women is lower than previously reported however, the proportion infected with HR-HPV is higher. HPV-16, HPV-58, and HPV-39 are the most prevalent genotypes.
