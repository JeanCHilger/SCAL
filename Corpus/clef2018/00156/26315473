Simultaneous detection of human papillomavirus integration and c-MYC gene amplification in cervical lesions: an emerging marker for the risk to progression. The persistence of high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and its integration into the host genome are key steps in the induction of malignant alterations. c-MYC chromosome region is a frequent localization for HPV insertion that has been observed in chromosome band 8q24 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We report the HPV viral integration and amplification patterns of the c-MYC gene in cytological smears with FISH as a potential biomarker for the progression of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL).HPV detection and genotyping by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and FISH analysis by "Vysis Cervical FISH Probe" kit (ABBOTT Molecular Inc.) were performed in 37 cervical samples including 8 NILM, 7 ASC-US, 7 LSIL, 3 ASC-H, 7 HSIL and 5 SCC.The results show concordance between FISH and PCR techniques for HPV detection. The majority of the samples contained HR-HPV, the majority being -16 and -18 genotypes. HPV integration as determined by FISH was most frequent in high-risk lesions. The c-MYC gene amplification was found only in HPV-positive samples and was detected primarily in high-risk lesions and in cells with an integrated form of HPV.HPV integration and c-MYC gene amplification detected by FISH could be an important biomarker for use in clinical practice to determine SIL with a risk of progression.
