A human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 or HPV-18 genotype is a reliable predictor of residual disease in a subsequent hysterectomy following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3. This study was conducted using the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA chip test (HDC), in order to determine whether the HPV genotype is a predictor of residual disease in a subsequent hysterectomy following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3.Between January 2002 and February 2015, a total of 189 patients who underwent a hysterectomy within 6 months of LEEP caused by CIN 3 were included in this study. We analyzed their epidemiological data, pathological parameters, high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) load as measured by the hybrid capture II assay, and HR-HPV genotype as measured by the HDC. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between covariates and the probability of residual disease in subsequent hysterectomy specimens.Of the 189 patients, 92 (48.7%) had residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen, CIN 2 in seven patients, CIN 3 in 79 patients, IA1 cancer in five patients, and IA2 cancer in one patient. Using multivariate analysis, the results were as follows: cone margin positivity (odds ratio [OR], 2.43 95% CI, 1.18 to 5.29The HPV-16 or HPV-18 genotype is a reliable predictive factor of residual disease in a subsequent hysterectomy following a LEEP for CIN 3.
