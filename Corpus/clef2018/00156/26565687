Human Papillomavirus Genotyping to Predict the Risk of Cervical Precancerous Lesions or Cancer in Women with Minor Abnormal Cytology in China. To evaluate the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping in predicting the risk of cervical precancerous lesions or cancer in women with minor abnormal cytology.This study was conducted on 329 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and 77 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) out of a total of 4,215 participants in a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Liquid-based cytology and the Hybrid Capture 2 test (HC2) were used to screen eligible women, and a Linear Array HPV genotyping test was performed on women with positive HC2 results.The sensitivity and specificity for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) based on HPV 16/18 were 82% [95% confidence interval (CI): 52-95%] and 91% (95% CI: 87-94%) in women with ASC-US and 67% (95% CI: 35-88%) and 84% (95% CI: 73-91%) in women with LSIL. The women infected with HPV 16/18 had a significantly higher risk of developing CIN2+ than those infected with other high-risk HPV types in both the ASC-US (OR 9.93, 95% CI: 2.02-48.88) and LSIL (OR 7.45, 95% CI: 1.60-34.68) arms.Genotyping for HPV 16/18 greatly improves specificity, but at the expense of potential sensitivity in the triage of minor cytology abnormalities. The role of genotyping for HPV 16/18 in order to triage women with minor abnormal cytology should be further evaluated in future studies.
