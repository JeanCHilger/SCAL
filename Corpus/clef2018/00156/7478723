Role of HPV-DNA typing in women with cytological diagnosis of squamous atypia. The study was performed in 293 patients (mean age 36 years old). Pap tests, colposcopy and target biopsy were performed in all patients. Results showed 100 cases of cellular atypia, 53 cases of CIN (36 CIN I, 10 CIN II, 7 CIN III) and 140 normal cases. The last phase of the study consisted in the collection of exfoliated cervical cells which were then subjected to "Enzo Pathogen DNA Probe assay" using HPV-DNA 6/11, 16/18 and 31/33/51 probes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between HPV type and neoplastic evolution. The results were not sufficiently convincing to support proposing HPV/DNA typing as the sole diagnostic method in lesions of the last section of the female genital tract.
