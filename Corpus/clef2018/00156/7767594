Diagnosis of human papillomaviruses in the lower genital tract using the ViraPap/ViraType detection kit. The authors investigated a group of 195 patients from the Centre of Oncological Prevention for human papillomavirus (HPV) in the lower genital tract. The diagnostic set ViraPap/ViraType was used for detection. It is based on double hybridisation of viral DNA and on the use of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies with chemoluminiscent reaction. The test was totally positive in 23.1% of women. 5.1% tests were positive in the low-risk group of viruses (LR-HPV) and 19.5% in the high risk group (HR-HPV). Precancerous lesions (CIN I-III) or invasive cancer were found in 86.7% of positive tests. In patients with CIN III 37.1% were HPV positive and all patients with invasive cancer were positive. The results support an association between CIN and HPV infections. The possible role of HPV in cancerogenesis is discussed as well as the clinical importance of their detection.
