Human papillomaviruses and the diagnosis of genital microorganisms. Considerable evidence points to certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) as high risk factors in the malignant progression mechanism in lesions of the lower genital tract. Since infection of the genital mucosa by papillomaviruses includes a wide variety of viral types, it is essential to recognize the specific HPV type eventually present in a genital lesion to ensure an appropriate follow-up of the patient. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay which differentiates in a single amplification reaction the "malignant" HPV genital types from the "benign" ones. We report also the use of PCR for the detection of other frequent sexually transmitted agents, such as herpes simplex virus and Chlamydia trachomatis. We show that it is possible to design and use a PCR-based assay for the simultaneous detection of various genital agents from a single genital swab. This assay can be a model for the development of additional multidetection systems of microorganisms potentially involved in similar pathologies.
