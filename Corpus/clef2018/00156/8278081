Treatment of HPV-positive CIN1 and CIN2 with intralesion administration of human interferon from fibroblasts associated with DTC (diathermal coagulation) of the cervical portio. The aim of this study was to draw attention to the efficacy of the therapeutic association of intralesional beta-IFN-DTC of the portio in HPV-positive CIN1 and CIN2 in 25 women aged between 21 and 41 years of age. Control tests after the completion of treatment showed complete recovery from CIN and the disappearance of the virus. Side effects were minimal and in no instance did they affect patients' normal activities or lead to an interruption of therapy. No cases of recidivation or relapse were reported 12 months after the completion of therapy.
