PCR detection and typing of genital papillomavirus in a New Brunswick population. We have used a broad range of primers for HPV detection, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) so as to compare PCR typing of HPV with the results of cytological diagnosis in a New Brunswick population referred to the out-patient clinic of the Saint John Regional Hospital. The primers selected were found to be capable of amplification with high efficiency, therefore we did not perform further hybridization analysis for specific identification of HPV types. Amplification of selected fragments for detection of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33 was obtained from cervical swabs collected from 154 patients. Microscopic examination was performed in duplicate samples and the results compared with the DNA-typing analysis. HPV of any of the above types was detected in 43 out of 154 patients. Among these, 32 patients showed single or multiple infections with "high-risk" HPV strains 16, 18, 31 or 33. Cytologically normal or atypical samples with any of the HPV types tested amounted to 17%, but increased to 56% in patients with CIN I, and to 100% in patients with CIN II or III. Prevalence of "high-risk" types alone increased from 15% and 10%, for normal and atypical cases respectively, to 48% for CIN I, 75% for CIN II and 100% for CIN III. Our results indicate that HPV detection and typing by this simple procedure can be a valuable indicator of cancer progression and thus can help to identify individuals at high risk in pre-malignant stages of the disease.
