Human papillomavirus infection in cervical biopsies from Norwegian gynecological in-patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting were used to assess the prevalence of HPV in cervical biopsies of 100 women who were treated at the gynecology department of Telemark Central Hospital for non-cancerous conditions. Nine (9%) of the biopsies were HPV positive. Four (4%) were of HPV type 18, one (1%) was HPV11 positive, and four contained different unrecognized HPV types (HPVX). HPV16 was not detected.
