Comparative analysis of human papillomavirus detection by hybrid capture assay and routine cytologic screening to detect high-grade cervical lesions. A commercial HPV detection test, Hybrid Capture (HC), designed to detect 14 HPV types divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, has been evaluated. A total of 1064 scrapes from 1028 unselected women attending routine cytologic screening were tested and results were compared with those of classic cytologic screening and cervical biopsies. The reliability of the test was also evaluated on 38 fresh conization samples. HPV DNA was detected in 108 women (10.5%), including 90 infected by a high-risk HPV (8.8%) 25 high-grade lesions were detected histologically, and high-risk HPV was found in 16 of these 25 women (64%), and in 27 (71%) of the 38 conization samples. The overall sensitivity of HC in detecting high-grade SIL on cervical scrapes and conization samples was 71.2%, while its positive predictive value was 17.8%. Classic cytologic screening appeared to be the most sensitive method (84%) for detecting high-grade SIL, with a positive predictive value of 91.3%. The lower sensitivity of HC limits its use for screening high-grade lesions on a large scale, even though it may be useful for reducing cytologically false-negative results. Moreover, the quantitative approach provided by the HC assay for assessment of the viral load cannot clearly distinguish among cases with or without high-grade lesions.
