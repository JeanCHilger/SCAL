Terminology. International Academy of Cytology Task Force summary. Diagnostic Cytology Towards the 21st Century: An International Expert Conference and Tutorial. Differences in type, structure, quality of health care systems and availability of resources influence reporting systems. In most countries, individual systems have a long history of usage that might preclude adoption of a uniform terminology worldwide.It is desirable but unrealistic at this time to aim for a unified terminology worldwide. It should be the stated objective of the International Academy of Cytology to serve as an umbrella organization for various terminologies and enhance mutual understanding and cooperation. Translation tables of equivalent terms have been created to allow increased communication. Consensus has been achieved in defining essential elements required of any terminology system: (1) the report must be text based: numerical Papanicolaou class designations alone are inadequate (2) an assessment of the adequacy of the sample should be includedDespite the cited problems in adopting a uniform terminology worldwide, a single system would have many advantages in terms of communication and research and may be a long-term goal worth pursuing. Countries are invited to present their individual national terminology systems and participate in an ongoing dialogue, critically evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of all systems.
