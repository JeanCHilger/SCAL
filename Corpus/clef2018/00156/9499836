Condylomatous lesions of the uterine cervix: LLETZ conization. Eight cases are reported about women with the diagnosis of HPV related lesions a "dot-blot" hybridization technique with radioactive probes was done with each of them, also a conization with a diathermic loop (LLETZ) and a post operative follow-up with methods such as Pap smear, colposcopy and hybridization. We think the way we manage HPV related lesions has the advantage of an accurate diagnosis, with the exact envolved HPV type, and it discards the possibility of an infiltrating carcinoma, after studying the conization sample. Hybridization techniques are complementary to Pap smear in order to know the infective viral type and to exclude a possible occult infection in the post-operative period. LLETZ conization ended up as a quick and easy technique with no postoperative problems and with a proved efficiency, since neither recurrences were found (with citology) nor viral DNA was detected, the technique is not too complicated and takes about 30 minutes.
