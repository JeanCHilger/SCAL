Low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia associated with human papillomavirus infection. Long-term follow-up. To investigate the correlation between the development of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (LCIN) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cases with long-term follow-up.Forty-three cases of LCIN were followed for more than five years with cytology, colposcopy and Vira Pap. Coexistence of HPV infection was sought using a simplified HPV detection kit, the Vira Pap method (Dot Blot hybridization).Regressive disease was noted in 21 cases, and persistent and progressive disease was noted in 22 cases. HPV DNA was negative in 81% (17 of 21) of regressive disease and positive in 55% (12 of 22) persistent and progressive disease. LCIN had disappeared in 17 (63%) of 27 cases negative for HPV DNA and was persistent or progressive in 12 (75%) of 16 cases positive for HPV DNA.The clinical course of LCIN correlates well with HPV infection.
