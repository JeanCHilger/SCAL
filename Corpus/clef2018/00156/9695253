The morphological characteristics of a papillomavirus infection in the epithelial tissue of the cervix uteri in comparison with the data from the molecular biological identification of specific HPV DNA sequences. Summarized cytomorphologic, molecular-biological data and the analysis results of cervix uteri multilayer squamous epithelium cells mitotic regime in benign (104 observations) and dysplastic (101 observations) processes, including 6/11 and 16/18 types DNA HPV, are presented in the paper. It has been shown that the use of HPV-infection morphologic markers as compared with cell mitotic activity and with in situ hybridization results allows one to determine the obvious virus role in the induction of flat, acute and papillar condylomas, as well as of cervix uteri dysplastic processes. To ascertain the prognosis of development of dysplasia associated with HPV DNA of 6/11 and 6/18 types, the increase of mitosis pathological forms and of their arrangement zones in epithelium layer parallel with gravity increase of three-group, multipolar and K mitosis should be considered a reliable marker of high oncogenic risk.
