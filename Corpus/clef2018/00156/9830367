Cervical cancer: developments in screening and evaluation of the abnormal Pap smear. Of the more than 50 million Pap smears performed annually in the United States, about 5% of them are abnormal.

This review addresses new developments in cervical cancer screening and management strategies for when an abnormality is detected.
