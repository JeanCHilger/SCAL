Biological behavior and etiology of inflammatory cervical smears. Two hundred and fifty-seven consecutive women attending a major maternal and child health (MCH) center were studied clinically, colposcopically, cytologically, and microbiologically for different gynecologic infections. Out of 257 cases, 207 (80.5%) had inflammatory cervical smears, of which 183 (88.4%) were infected with one or more genital tract infections. Bacterial vaginosis (risk, 22.6-fold), chlamydia (risk, 21.6-fold), and human papillomavirus (HPV) (risk, 13.5-fold) were independently associated with inflammatory smears. In addition, significantly higher proportions of women with inflammatory smears had cervical ectopies (28.5% vs. 10.2%) and bleeding ectopies (30.9% vs. 4.1%) as compared to noninflammatory smears. Women infected with bacterial/parasitic genital infections were given specific treatment. These women were followed up at regular intervals to assess the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. During follow-up examination, only 26 women (12.6%) showed negative smears. Sixteen women developed squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) during follow-up, and 163 women had persistent inflammatory smears. Multivariate analysis revealed that persistent inflammatory smears were associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, as revealed through detection of IgA antibodies to HSV (risk, 11.5-fold). Progression of SIL was associated with HPV infection (risk, 17.6 fold). Thus, inflammatory smears are associated with different types of infection, most of which do not respond to antimicrobial therapy.
