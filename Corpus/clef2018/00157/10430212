Effect of antiretroviral therapy on recent trends in selected cancers among HIV-infected persons. Adult/Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project Group. We examined incidence trends in seven HIV-associated cancers (Kaposi's sarcoma [KS], invasive cervical cancer, immunoblastic lymphoma, primary brain lymphoma [PBL], Burkitt's lymphoma, other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Hodgkin's lymphoma) and the effects of antiretroviral therapy on these trends. Data were abstracted from medical records in 89 hospitals and clinics in nine U.S. cities from January 1994 through June 1997. The stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic was used to test for trend. There were 19,684 HIV-infected persons representing 26,638 years of follow-up. Decreases in incidence per 1000 person-years were observed for KS (January through June 1994, 49.9 January through June 1997, 25.7
