HPV infection of the genital system: new findings. The expansion of our knowledge in the field of pathology, epidemiology and molecular biology of human papillomaviruses (HPV) has defined them as the major and best understood class of human tumor viruses. The interaction of HPV with genome of host cells produces the majority of cytologic abnormalities responsible for neoplastic transformation and makes early cervical cancer screening possible. This review of the current knowledge of HPV infection biology, diagnosis and therapy facilitates understanding of the clinical significance of these viruses.
