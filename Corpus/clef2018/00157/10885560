Multiple mechanisms underlie HLA dysregulation in cervical cancer. The consistent dysregulation of HLA expression in cervical neoplasia is likely to influence the natural history of the disease and prospects for cell-mediated vaccine therapies. We have studied the underlying mechanisms in eight new cervical cancer cell lines derived from primary tumour biopsies. At least five independent mechanisms leading to changes in HLA expression were seen: HLA class I allelic transcription but no protein abnormal HLA class I allelic transcription
