Human papillomavirus and human cytomegalovirus DNAs presence in patients suspected of condylomatosis or papillomatosis. 17 samples of total cell DNA isolated from cervical smears from women suspected of condyloma or papilloma were analysed by PCR with appropriate primers, in order to establish the presence of viral DNAs (HPV and/or HCMV). HPV DNA was found in seven cases, and so was for HCMV DNA. Only in three cases a coinfection was present. The RFLP allowed to specify the involvement of HPV6 in 3 cases suspected of condyloma and in one suspected of papilloma the other three HPV positive samples had another genotype, which we could not determine by the methods used.
