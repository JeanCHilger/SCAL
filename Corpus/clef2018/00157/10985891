Evaluation of the possible protective role of adeno-associated virus type 2 infection in HPV-associated premalignant disease of the cervix. Our objective was to examine the prevalence of adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection in women with normal cervical smears and those with HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).HPV typing was performed on DNA from cervical smears of 211 women with CIN (CIN 1 = 83, CIN 3 = 128) and 433 healthy women who had a normal cervical smear. HPV typing was performed on all cases and controls using type-specific oligonucleotide primers (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33). AAV DNA was amplified by nested PCR from the same samples. The amplified DNA were separated on 2% agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized to AAV-2 DNA labeled by random priming with [alpha-(32)P]dCTP to confirm specificity of amplification.A total of 131 cases of CIN were positive for one of the HPV types either alone or in combination. HPV 16 was present in 120 (57%) cases, HPV 18 in 15 (7%), HPV 31 in 27 (13%), and HPV 33 in 15 (7%) and there were multiple HPV types detected in 34 (16%) cases. All of the controls were selected to be negative for HPV. A total of 6/433 (1.4%) control cervical smears and 4/211 (1.9%) of CIN (CIN1 = 2 CIN3 = 2) contained AAV DNA. No correlation between AAV and any clinical feature was observed.These results are different from some that have been previously published and suggest that AAV DNA is not frequently present in either normal control cervical samples or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This does not support the hypothesis that AAV may be protective against cervical cancer. Further research is necessary to understand the natural history of AAV infection and its role in human disease.
