HIV-positive women and cervical screening. To date the management of HIV-positive women regarding the prevention of cervical cancer remains controversial. There are different approaches to cervical screening in different health authorities in the UK and worldwide due to different funding and healthcare provision in general, the official disease prevalence and the attempt to tailor the screening programme according to a perceived risk for the population covered, but most of all in the diverse evidence provided to aid the development of a screening programme. The advent of high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may also have altered the natural history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) before it became sufficiently understood and future studies have to take this into account when investigating the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) and CIN on the risk of developing cervical cancer. This article aims to summarize the available evidence to date and provide a basis on which an effective and acceptable screening programme for HIV-positive women can be developed.
