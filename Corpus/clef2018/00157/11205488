High-risk and multiple human papillomavirus infections associated with cervical abnormalities in Japanese women. To estimate the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection for cervical malignancies, we conducted a case-control study in Japan. Abnormal cervical cell (366) and normal cell samples (1562) were tested for the presence of HPV DNA using a new PCR-based test (LCR-E7 PCR). When single HPV infections were considered, 26 different HPV types were identified in normal cervices and in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) whereas HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58 and -67 were detected in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, and HPV-16 and -18 were detected in cervical adenocarcinoma. HPV-6 and -11 were detected in condyloma acuminatum tissue. In HSIL and SCC, HPV-16 was the most prevalent type and HPV-51, -52, and -58 were the next most prevalent
