Adeno-associated virus is associated with a lower risk of high-grade cervical neoplasia. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a ubiquitous human helper-dependent parvovirus which may interact with human papillomaviruses (HPV) to modify a woman's risk of cervical neoplasia. This analysis was nested in a cohort study of low-income women receiving Pap smears as part of their family planning services. We selected cases (55 with high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 162 with low-grade LSIL) and controls (96 women with normal cervical cytology) and analyzed cervical DNA for AAV, using PCR amplification/dot blot hybridization, and HPV, using hybrid capture I. AAV positivity was associated with a significantly reduced risk of HSIL (age and HPV-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.32) yet not with LSIL (aOR = 0.78) 53.8% of HSIL, 66.9% of LSIL, and 70.7% of controls were AAV+. AAV appears to interact with HPV to reduce SIL risk
