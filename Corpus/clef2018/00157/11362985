A review of the Conference on HIV Infection in Women. Studies have shown that the differences between men and women with HIV have more to do with access to health care than to biological differences. HIV-positive women have a higher mortality rate than HIV-positive men because they are less likely to be treated with drugs such as AZT. Women are at a greater risk for developing toxoplasmosis, herpes, neuropathy, and wasting syndrome. HIV-positive women with human papillomavirus are four times more likely to develop premalignant conditions, and they have a higher rate of recurrence of cervical dysplasia. Pelvic inflammatory disease is more common and more severe in HIV-positive women. HIV screening should be offered to every woman presenting with pregnancy or any sexually-transmitted disease, and women with CD4 counts below 500 should have Pap smears every six months.
