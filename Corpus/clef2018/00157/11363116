HIV-positive women and their care. The medical care of HIV-positive women needs to be considered. After initial evaluation, HIV-positive women need to have a genealogical evaluation to determine if any conditions are present which may be difficult to treat or may have a more accelerated course. Pap smears should be done again after 6 months and then yearly. If CD4 counts fall below 250, pap smears should be done biannually. An abnormal pap smear could be a sign of a genital tract infection, which can cause cervical inflammation. Vaginal candidiasis, a yeast infection in the genital tract, occurs more frequently in women with lower CD4 counts. Some women may need chronic suppressive pill therapy for candidiasis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) also occurs more frequently in HIV-positive women. HPV infection can cause cervical dysplasia, which can only be diagnosed with a pap smear. Left untreated, certain kinds of HPV infections can lead to cervical cancer. Radical surgery and radiation therapy are the two treatments for cervical cancer. HIV-associated wasting may be related to the menstrual problems connected to HIV (i.e., irregular cycles and no menstruation), but this has not been proven. The treatment for female-specific conditions is not differentiated between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. There are two large-scale national studies following the course of sexually transmitted diseases in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.
