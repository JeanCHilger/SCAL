Study on the carcinogenic mechanism of human papillomavirus typel6 E7 protein in cervical carcinoma. To determine the relationship between HPVl6 E7-Rb protein binding (Rb protein was dissociated from pRb-E2F-l complex) and the occurrence of cervical carcinoma.HPV16 DNA infection rate was tested in cervical carcinoma and normal cervical tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Then using Western blot analysis to find the presence HPVl6E7 protein and pRb-E2F-1 complex in HPV16 DNA positive cervical carcinoma tissues. The normal cervical tissues were used as control.Out of 67 samples with cervical carcinomas, 34 samples were HPV16 DNA positive (50.7%), no HPVl6 DNA were detected in 10 samples of normal cervical tissues. In cervical carcinoma tissues, the HPV16E7-pRb complex, the free E2F-1 were detected by Western blot, but no complex of pRb-E2F-l was found.Our results seem to suggest that HPV 16 E7 protein could interact with pRb through separating the complex of pRb-E2F-1, release free E2F- 1, resulted in disordered cell cycle and cell malignant transformation.
