HLA class II DR-DQ and increased risk of cervical cancer among Senegalese women. To examine Senegalese women to confirm and extend associations between HLA class II types and cervical cancer previously observed among African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Japanese ethnic populations, 55 Senegalese women with invasive cervical carcinoma were compared with age-matched (human papillomavirus) HPV-positive (n = 83) and HPV-negative (n = 107) control women. PCR-based HPV and HLA typing methods were used. Data were analyzed using a global randomization test and conditional logistic regression. Although this study failed to confirm a previously reported association between cervical cancer and DQB1*03 alleles, the DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 haplotype was detected more frequently among cervical carcinoma cases than among controls (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6 95% confidence interval, 1.0-7.1). Furthermore, as reported by others, we observed a negative association of borderline statistical significance between DRB1*13 and cervical carcinoma (adjusted odds ratio, 0.5
