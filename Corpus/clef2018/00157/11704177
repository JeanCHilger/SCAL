Human papillomavirus testing and the outcome of treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To investigate whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing could be used in the follow-up after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).We performed a retrospective study of 41 women who developed subsequent CIN after LLETZ (group A) and 82 women without CIN for a minimum of 5 years after LLETZ (group B). The first post-treatment cervical smear was retrieved and examined for high-risk HPV deoxyribonucleic acid. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio of HPV testing, first post-treatment Papanicolaou test, and excision margins for the detection of treatment failure were calculated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was also done.The HPV test was positive in 38 of 41 women in group A and 13 of 82 in group B (P <.001). An abnormal cytologic result in the first post-treatment smear was found in 20 of 41 in group A and 11 of 82 in group B (P <.001). Sixteen women in group A and 18 in group B had involved margins (P =.046). Values for the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of the HPV test were 93%, 84%, 5.8, 0.08 for the Papanicolaou test they were 49%, 87%, 3.9, 0.586Women who postoperatively have positive HPV testing are at higher risk of treatment failure. This could be performed at the first post-treatment visit and further follow-up could be adjusted accordingly.
