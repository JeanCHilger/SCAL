Cervical-cancer screening beyond the year 2000. Evidence-based studies have shown that new techniques for cervical cancer screening have a higher diagnostic yield than conventional cervical cytology (Pap test). Automated screening devices that use liquid-based, thin-layer cytology and human papillomavirus DNA testing are likely to become the standard for routine primary screening for cervical cancer and its precursors in the 21st century. The increased initial expense of the new techniques will most certainly be absorbed by instituting longer intervals for safe primary screening, in both low-risk and high-risk populations. To make modern screening programmes even more effective, we must promote extensive public awareness campaigns about cervical cancer, a preventable disease.
