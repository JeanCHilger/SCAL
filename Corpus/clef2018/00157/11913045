High and low risk human papilloma virus infection in women with CIN. Differential characteristics. The objective of this study was to determine high risk human papillomavirus infection (HPV-RH) and factors with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia appears (CIN).From October 1998 to January 2000, a case-control study, was made women with benefit package from Mexican Institute of Social Security. The cases were of the colposcopic clinic of the department of the Hospital Obstetrics and Gynecology Luis Castelazo Ayala, women histologically diagnosed with colposcopy and CIN cervical biopsy, and controls patients with negative cervical uterine cytologic study of the Preventive Medicine Department, Unit of Familiar Medicine No. 8, of Mexico City. Trained personnel obtained information about socioeconomic and reproductive factors did the interview. A cytobrush was used to take the cervical sample for HPV-RH to determine HPV-RH utilizing Hybrid Capture II test. Both bivariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used for the adjustment of variables.We analyzed 102 cases and 192 controls, 79% (44/56) of the cases with CIN I and 89% (37/42) of CIN II-III as 21% of controls, respectively, were positive for HPV-RH. Global risk for HPV-RH association to CIN was OR = 40.6 (95% CI, = 17-96.8). Women age was determinative for HPV-RH association to CIN. We observed a high correlation between HPV positive magnitude and CIN degree.Frequency of RH-HPV in controls and CIN I is higher than other reports in the literature. HPV was identified as the most important agent associated with this neoplasia, other factors involved and age is an important modifier in HPV-RH and CIN.
