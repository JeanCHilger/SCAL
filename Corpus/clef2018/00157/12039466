TP53 polymorphism at exon 4 in caucasian women from eastern France: lack of correlation with HPV status and grade of cervical precancerous lesions. To investigate the codon 72 TP53 polymorphism in women from eastern France with normal or abnormal cervical cytology.We analyzed the TP53 allele distribution by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis assay and the human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection in 138 cervical smears: 50 normal, 20 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 40 low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 28 high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.The viral DNA prevalence increased with cytological abnormalities. The rates of arginine (Arg) and proline (Pro) homozygosity and Arg/Pro heterozygosity were 49, 0.72, and 51%, respectively. No association was found between HPV status and TP53 polymorphism. No differences were observed in the frequency of the TP53 genotypes according to cytology.The TP53 Arg/Arg genotype does not appear to represent a risk factor in the progression of HPV associated cervical lesions. We were not able to confirm that the TP53 genotype increases the susceptibility to be infected by HPV or to develop HGSIL, and a fortiori invasive carcinoma of the cervix.
