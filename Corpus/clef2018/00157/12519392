Definition of the HLA-A2 restricted peptides recognized by human CD8+ effector T cells by flow-assisted sorting of the CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cell subpopulation. In response to antigenic stimulation, naive MHC-class I restricted and antigen-specific CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28+ T cells undergo clonal expansion, differentiate into CD8+ CD45RO+ memory T cells and convert to CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cells displaying potent immune effector functions upon re-encounter with the nominal antigen. We show that the effector CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cell subset is expanded in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)+ cervical lesions as well as in PBL from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Flow-cytometric cell sorted CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- and CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cells were tested for recognition of HLA-A2 restricted peptides derived either from the human papillomavirus (HPV)16-E7 gene product, or from M. tuberculosis antigens. Mostly CD8+ CD45+ CD28- T cells define antigen/peptide-specific and MHC-restricted responses. These data were confirmed in PBL from patients with tuberculosis using HLA-A2 tetramer-complexes loaded with a peptide from the M. tuberculosis Ag85b antigen by flow cytometry. The sorting of this T cell subset enables to determine the fine specificity of CD8+ effector T cells without the need for in vitro manipulation.
