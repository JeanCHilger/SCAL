Detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in fine needle aspiration specimen from cervical lymphnodes with polymerase chain reaction. For the diagnosis of occult nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Epstein-Barr virus in 58 fine needle aspirations from cervical metastatic lymphnodes were detected with polymerase chain reaction.The positive reaction was found in 28/35 metastatic carcinoma samples from middle or upside neck. Negative reaction was found in 3 lymphomas, 4 metastatic carcinomas in clavicular superior lymphnodes and 15/16 inflammatory diseases of cervical lymphnodes. The sensibility of this method for the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 89.3%. The specificity was 86.7%.The detection of Epstein-Barr virus in metastatic carcinoma from cervical lymphnodes had some clinical values for the diagnosis of occult nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
