Translational approaches to improving cervical screening. Screening programmes for cervical cancer using the current test--the Pap smear--have markedly reduced the incidence of the disease. However, an individual Pap test is of limited sensitivity and is difficult and expensive to perform. Increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cervical cancer indicates that new approaches to screening might offer increased accuracy, affordability and the potential for automation. Such approaches exemplify how improved understanding of the biology of neoplasia might be translated into clinical benefit.
