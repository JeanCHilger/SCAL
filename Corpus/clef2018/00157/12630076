P16INK4A as an adjunct test in liquid-based cytology. To assess the utility of P16INK4A as an adjunct test in liquid-based cytology in cases with equivocal morphologic changes of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).P16INK4A immunoreactivity was investigated in residual ThinPrep material (Cytyc Corp., Boxborough, Massachusetts, U.S.A.) from 30 cases with equivocal diagnoses of HSIL that had corresponding follow-up biopsies. Two control ThinPrep cases were included: 1 HSIL with biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 and a negative specimen with a corresponding biopsy of squamous metaplasia. The expression of P16INK4A in ThinPrep specimens and corresponding biopsies was scored as previously described. A ThinPrep case was scored positive if it contained > 10 abnormal cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic immunocytochemical staining. Corresponding biopsies were scored as having negative, sporadic, focal or diffuse staining.The P16INK4A antibody assay was positive in 19 of 30 ThinPrep cases (63.3%). Seventeen of the 19 (89.4%) biopsies corresponding to the positively stained ThinPreps also were positive, with a score of at least focal positivity in the dysplastic regions (2 CIN 1, 4 CIN 2, 11 CIN 3 2 lesions lost in the tissue recut). The assay was negative in 11 ThinPreps (36.6%) and 10 biopsies (33.3%) with tissue confirmation of chronic cervicitis (5), squamous metaplasia (2), CIN 1 (3) and 1 lesion lost in the tissue recut. Seventeen of 18 (94.4%) ThinPreps confirmed as high grade lesions upon biopsy showed P16INK4A positivity. The control HSIL case with a CIN 3 biopsy was diffusely positive for P16INK4A, and the control negative case with biopsy diagnosis of squamous metaplasia was negative. Nondysplastic squamous and metaplastic epithelium in 7 biopsies and nondysplastic squamous or metaplastic cells in ThinPrep cases were negative. Sporadic staining of bacteria, inflammatory cells and endocervical cells was noted.ThinPrep cases in the equivocal cytologic category with the corresponding tissue biopsy assayed for P16INK4A expression showed that there was utility for this type of testing. A larger series comparing corresponding ThinPrep and tissue biopsies will be undertaken. The role of HPV infection in these cases will also be explored.
