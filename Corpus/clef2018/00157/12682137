Comparison of methods for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests and a liquid pap smear medium. Annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis infection is currently recommended for sexually active women 15 to 25 years old and for women older than 25 if they have a new or multiple sex partners and have not used condoms during the previous 3 months. Annual screening for cervical abnormalities using the Pap smear has achieved a substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer. Screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection has likely contributed significantly to the reduction in the rates of gonococcal infection. The introduction of liquid Pap smear methods using exfoliated cervical cells presents an opportunity to screen for these three conditions using one specimen. We evaluated the preservation of C. trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNAs from ThinPrep liquid media (PreservCyt Cytyc Corp., Boxborough, Mass.)
