Status of screening tests for cervical cancer and its precancerous lesion. Several screening methods for cervical cancer and its precancerous lesion are reviewed. Cervical cancer screening using visual inspection, colposcopy, oncogenic human papillomavirus DNA testing, liquid-based monolayers and automated Pap smear screening instruments are all potentially valuable when used alone or in combination. Newly developed techniques provide an opportunity to extend practical cervical cancer screening to large population in limited resource areas, and help do more cost-effectiveness of screening tests in high risk population.
