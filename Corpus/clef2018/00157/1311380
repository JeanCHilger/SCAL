Identifying human papillomavirus subtypes in cervical biopsies with in situ DNA hybridization with biotinylated probes. To test the utility of biotinylated DNA probes against various subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), we performed in situ DNA hybridization on routinely processed archival material from 30 patients with serial cervical biopsies including conization (group I) and a prospective group of 35 patients whose cervical biopsies showed various degrees of koilocytotic atypia and/or dysplasia (group II). Commercially available biotinylated probe cocktails against HPV types 6 and 11, 16 and 18, and 31, 35 and 51 were detected via the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase technique. Virus was found in 87% (26/30) of group I and 57% (20/35) of group II. Almost exclusively, viral types 16, 18, 31, 35 and 51 were detected in group I 54% (19/35) of group II stained for types 16, 18 or 31, 35 and 51
