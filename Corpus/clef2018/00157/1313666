Male genital examination: the usefulness of penis endoscopy and the acetic acid test for the detection of papillomavirus lesions. This study was based on 2,400 genital examinations performed by means of the acetic acid test looking for human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions in the male partners of women with HPV genital lesions. These peniscopies demonstrated HPV lesions in 56% of the men examined. In 109 cases, histological and virological examination revealed that 30% of them had areas of intraepithelial neoplasia of the penis, associated with potentially oncogenic papillomavirus infection. The value of this examination is to detect HPV lesions and, in particular, dysplastic lesions. The treatment of these lesions appears to allow a reduction in the incidence of recurrence of HPV lesions in women after treatment.
