Histological human papillomavirus induced lesions: typization by molecular hybridization techniques. The viral typization in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the lower female genital tract is relevant both from the epidemiological and the clinical point of view. We have tested DNA from specimens obtained by guided biopsies on neoplastic and benign lesions, using single probes of the different virus types (6, 11, 16 and 18) by Dot-blot and Southern blot analysis. According to previous studies HPV 16 and 18 have been detected in neoplastic lesions, while 6 and 11 were more frequently found associated to condylomata. Negative specimens and intermediate were 36% of the total. In our experience both methods have shown same sensibility.
