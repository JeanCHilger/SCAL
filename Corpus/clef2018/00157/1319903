Human papillomavirus infection of the female genital tract: correlation of HPV DNA with cytologic, colposcopic, and natural history findings. Although molecular biology evidence suggests a strong link between HPVs and anogenital neoplasias, evidence from clinical studies is still less convincing. Thus, the recognition of both overt and subclinical HPV infection has become increasingly important. We studied the correlation between HPV DNA and cytologic, colposcopic and natural history findings in a defined group of women. The study population consisted of 150 HPV DNA positive cases (mean age 25.7 years, SD 7.4) and 69 randomly selected HPV DNA negative controls (mean age 27.3 years, SD 7.9) enrolled in an ongoing study of the natural history of genital HPV infections. All cases and controls had normal cervicovaginal cytology at the enrollment. A commercial dot-blot technique hybridization test (Virapap and Viratype, Digene Diagnostics, USA) was used for HPV DNA testing of cervicovaginal scrapes. Five percent of the patients had HPV 16/18, 31% had HPV 31/33/35, 15% had more than one of the three HPV DNA groups ("mixed"), and 15% had untypable HPV DNA. Cases and controls were followed by repeat examinations every 4th month. The mean follow-up time was 12.2 months (SD 8.7) for the cases, and 12.8 months (SD 6.9) for the controls. The study endpoint was defined as the presence of cytologic changes consistent with CIN. The overall prevalence of atypical transformation zone (ATZ) findings was 45% in the controls and 56% in the cases, with no significant differences between the specific HPV DNA groups. Although vulvar or vaginal abnormalities (acetowhite epithelium, squamous papillomatosis, filaments, satellite lesions, fissures, papules or exophytic condylomas) were more commonly seen in the cases than in the controls, the difference was significant only for condylomas and fissures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
