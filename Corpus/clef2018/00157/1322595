Transformation by human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA but not HPV6b DNA is enhanced by addition of the human cytomegalovirus enhancer. Primary human cervical epithelial cells immortalized by human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA exhibit altered morphology and differentiation characteristic of transformation, but show a lack of transformed phenotype relative to HPV18 DNA immortalized cells in terms of anchorage-independent growth (Pecoraro, Lee, Morgan, and Defendi, 1991, Am. J. Pathol. 138, 1-8). This is completely corrected by inserting a strong heterologous enhancer derived from human cytomegalovirus DNA upstream from the HPV16 long control region. The cells immortalized by this DNA form colonies in agar comparable to those formed by HPV18 DNA immortalized cells. The enhanced transformation capability correlates with increased levels of HPV16 E6-E7 and E5 transcripts. The HPV16 DNA containing this strong enhancer also transforms C127 mouse cells with increased efficiency and strength relative to the natural HPV16 DNA, as measured by the numbers and size of the colonies in agar. The positive effects of this strong enhancer appear specific for HPVs associated with genital malignancies such as HPV16, since HPV6b DNA (primarily in benign tumors) with or without the strong cytomegalovirus enhancer is incapable of immortalizing primary human cervical epithelial cells or allowing efficient growth of C127 mouse cells in agar. These results suggest that the diminished oncogenic properties of HPV16 versus HPV18 DNA in cultured cells and in human malignancies may reside in the long control regions of these viruses and, additionally, may define another difference in the oncogenic properties of HPVs associated with benign or malignant genital neoplasia.
