Comparison of HPV detection in parallel biopsies and cervical scrapes by PCR. PCR was used to detect HPV DNA in cervical scrapes of 23 women with cervical cancer. Compared with PCR-assisted HPV DNA detection in parallel biopsies, the sensitivity was 81% and the specificity 100%. We conclude that cervical scrapes can be used for detection of HPV DNA in women with cervical cancer.
