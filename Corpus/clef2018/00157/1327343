Latent cervical virus infection as a possible cause of early abortion. Cervical smears of 50 women who had an abortion were examined by dot-blot hybridization for human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA. HPV DNA type 16 or 18 positivity was shown in 17.6% of the cases in the aborted material, however, it amounted to 30.8%. IgM-positive titres were present in a few cases. In cervical smears of intact pregnancies, positivity for HPV DNA types 6 and 11 was detected in 9.5% and for the HSV DNA types 1 and 2 and CMV DNA in 48.0% of the cases. In this group of patients mostly positive IgM and IgG titers were present.
