HPV genital infections and contraception. Human Papilloma Virus genital infections are, especially during fertile age, a very common finding in performing PAP smear and colposcopy. The interest in these infections arises from their frequent association with dysplasia and their possible role in the etiology of carcinoma of the lower genital tract. The natural history of HPV infections is not very well known and foreseen. Epidemiological studies indicate that the progression, regression or stability of induced HPV lesions are correlated with cofactors which are considered risk factors in carcinoma of the lower genital tract. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of estroprogestinic contraception and other methods on the evolution of the HPV genital infections.Human papilloma virus (HPV) genital infections are sexually transmitted and often found among young women.  While not much is known about the natural history of these infections, they are known to be frequently associated with dysplasia and may have a role in the etiology of carcinoma of the lower genital tract. This paper, therefore, presents findings of an evaluation of the influence of estroprogestinic contraception and other methods on the evolution of HPV genital infections.  108 women aged 18-51 were diagnosed with HPV in the lower genital tract 41 were using oral contraception with estroprogestinics and 67 were using other methods or none at all.  The evaluation considered the evolution of lesions as related to the following potential influencing factors:  patient's age, age at first sexual intercourse, number of pregnancies, lifetime number of partners, and smoking habits. Nothing could be concluded from this investigation, but it is suspected that estroprogestin use combined with smoking may increase the risk of HPV genital infections progressing to cervical cancer.
