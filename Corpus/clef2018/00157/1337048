Comparative DNA hybridization, cytology and histology of condylomatous and precancerous lesions of the cervix uteri. Cell scrapings from 552 consecutive women attending the colposcopy outpatient unit were examined by radioactive isotopic DNA hybridisation using the Dot-Blot technique, and by conventional Papanicolaou-smear cytology. In 315 out of these patients, punch biopsies were submitted for histological examination. HPV DNA-sequences were detected in 72% (n = 167) of 232 cytologically diagnosed CIN cases and in 77% (n = 97) out of 126 histological diagnoses of CIN. The proportion of HPV positive cases increased proportionally to the grade of CIN. The frequency of HPV type 6/11 decreased proportionally to the grade of the CIN, and HPV type 16/18 increased at the same time. The most frequent HPV type was 16/18 (26.3%), followed by the HPV types 31/33/35 (16.3%) and 6/11 (4.2%). Furthermore, HPV positivity was detected in 16.5% of patients with negative cytologic smears, in 21.7% of those with negative histology and in 8.9% of women with both negative histology and cytology. Histological and moreover cytological criteria of HPV infection decreased dramatically and proportionally inverse to the grade of the CIN. These changes were not followed entirely by HPV positivity. The discrepancy between HPV positivity (66.1%/67.6%) and morphological evidence of HPV infection (cytology 4.9%, histology 21.6%) was higher in CIN III than in lower grade CIN. Neither cytology nor histology is able to detect all HPV-related cervical lesions. Hybridisation techniques are helpful in the detection of latent HPV infections as well as of CIN lesions have been missed either by cytology or by histology or both. Thus both morphological methods are supplemented by HPV hybridisation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
