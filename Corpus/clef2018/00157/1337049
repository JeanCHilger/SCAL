Human papillomavirus infection of the uterine cervix in immune suppressed women after kidney transplantation. In 23 women, who had immunosuppressive therapy following renal transplantation, routine cytology and colposcopy were performed. Colposcopically directed punch biopsies were taken from the most suspect area. If no pathologic finding was evident during colposcopy a random sample was taken from the transformation zone. Histology revealed condylomatous lesions in seven cases. In two of the lesions, a CIN II was detected. To each woman with a renal allograft and therefore immunosuppressive therapy, two cases were matched for age, parity, and histological finding as a control group. Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection was performed by in-situ hybridisation. HPV infection rate in women with renal allografts was higher in biopsy specimens with condylomatous lesion (86%), as well as in tissue without condylomatous lesions (25%), compared to controls (56% and 9%). The high prevalence of cervical dysplasia and high HPV infection rate in women with immunosuppressive therapy, indicates the need for accurate and regular cytologic and colposcopic examinations in these patients.
