Cervical cancer screening. Past success and future challenge. Population screening for cervical cancer resulted in significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer. An increased understanding of the relationship of HPV infection with cervical cancer and the natural history of cervical cancer precursor lesions further solidifies and expands the biological basis for cervical cancer screening. Pap tests in asymptomatic women remain the cornerstone of cervical cancer screening. Clinicians should be cognizant of the significant false-negative rate of Pap smears. Meticulous attention to proper Pap smear technique is necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the test. Further research is needed to establish the role of cervicography and HPV DNA hybridization techniques in cervical cancer screening.
