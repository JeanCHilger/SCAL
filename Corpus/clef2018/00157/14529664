HPV testing can reduce the number of follow-up visits in women treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3. We evaluated high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing by Hybrid Capture II (HC II) in addition to cytology to predict recurrent/residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 and cervical cancer in women treated for CIN 3.Follow-up study of 108 women with histologically confirmed CIN 3.Pretreatment, in 96% (104/108) of the smears high-risk HPV DNA was present. Posttreatment, 71% (77/108) of the women had normal cytology and negative HC II test and none developed recurrent/residual disease during a median follow-up of 28.8 months with a range of 2.4-64.8 months. One of the 12% (13/108) of women with normal cytology and positive HC II test was diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma. One of the 7% (8/108) of women with abnormal cytology (borderline dyskaryosis or worse) and negative HC II test was diagnosed with CIN 2. Three of the 9% (10/108) of women with abnormal cytology and a positive HC II test were diagnosed with CIN 2/3. These results show an increased risk for recurrent/residual CIN 2/3 and cervical carcinoma when at least one posttreatment test is positive. The highest relative risk (72.9, 95% CI 25-210) was present in women with both tests positive.HPV testing with Hybrid Capture II in conjunction with cytology can be used as a tool to select women with an increased risk for recurrent/residual CIN 2/3 and cervical cancer. The standard policy in The Netherlands is cytology at 6, 12, and 24 months posttreatment. However, for women with both normal cytology and negative HC II test at 6 months the chance to develop recurrent/residual CIN 2/3 and cervical carcinoma is so low that retesting at 12 months can be omitted.
