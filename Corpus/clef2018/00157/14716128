Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: is it worthwhile to qualify them further? In Bethesda System of reporting cervico-vaginal smears, the equivocal epithelial cell abnormalities have been categorised as "atypical squamous and glandular cells of undetermined significance" (ASCUS and AGUS). These abnormalities may harbour minor lesions attributed to mere inflammatory changes to potentially serious high grade lesions. It is recommended to further qualify these lesions according to whether they favor a reactive or a neoplastic outcome.We undertook the present study to assess the significance of ASCUS qualifiers.A total of 12071 women were screened for early detection of cancer cervix. The women with ASCUS diagnosis were further qualified as ASCUS favor reactive and ASCUS favor SIL (Squamous intraepithelial lesion) according the Bethesda 1991 system of reporting. ASCUS-reactive cases were followed up by a repeat smear examination and persistent ASCUS cases were taken up for colposcopy and biopsy if indicated. All ASCUS-SIL cases were taken up for immediate colposcopy.The pick up rate of high grade lesions was not significantly different (P=0.47 Chi square test) on the follow up of ASCUS-reactive (2/222) and ASCUS-SIL (2/130) groups. The low grade lesions were picked up in 10/222 ASCUS-reactive and 58/130 in ASCUS-SIL, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001).The results of our study indicate that it is not worthwhile to qualify these lesions as majority of ASCUS-SIL also revealed only low grade epithelial which have a benign biological behaviour.
