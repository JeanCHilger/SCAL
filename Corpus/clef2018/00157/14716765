News media coverage of human papillomavirus. Now that human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is being incorporated into cervical cancer screening programs, salient and accurate media information about HPV will be crucial to inform women's screening choices and to manage psychosocial responses to HPV DNA test results.The authors conducted a content analysis of 111 news stories about HPV from the 10 most circulated newspapers and from 3 major television networks for the period from January 1995 through July 2002. Stories were assessed for predominant theme (STD, cancer, or new tests) information about symptoms, transmission, prevention, and cancer-causing properties of HPVThirty-six percent of stories primarily were about new tests for HPV or cervical cancer, 30% of stories focused on cervical cancer or its link to HPV, and 27% of stories emphasized sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or genital warts. Seventy-nine percent of stories mentioned that HPV is an STD, and 50% of stories reported that HPV is very common. Twenty-six percent of stories reported that most women with HPV will not develop cervical carcinoma. Of 81 stories that mentioned a screening test for HPV or cervical carcinoma, 38% reported the sensitivity of the test 30% mentioned wrong, uncertain, or unnecessary test resultsMedia coverage of HPV could better fulfill women's educational needs by including information about low-risk and high-risk types of HPV and their differing links to cervical cancer describing HPV prevention, transmission, and symptoms
