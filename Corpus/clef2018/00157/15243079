Detection and typing of human papillomavirus by e6 nested multiplex PCR. A nested multiplex PCR (NMPCR) assay that combines degenerate E6/E7 consensus primers and type-specific primers was evaluated for the detection and typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 6/11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68 using HPV DNA-containing plasmids and cervical scrapes (n = 1,525). The performance of the NMPCR assay relative to that of conventional PCR with MY09-MY11 and GP5+-GP6+ primers, and nested PCR with these two primer sets (MY/GP) was evaluated in 495 cervical scrapes with corresponding histologic and cytologic findings. HPV prevalence rates determined with the NMPCR assay were 34.7% (102 of 294) in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 0), 94.2% (113 of 120) in the presence of mild or moderate dysplasia (CIN I/II), and 97.8% (44 of 45) in the presence of severe dysplasia (CIN III). The combination of all four HPV detection methods applied in the study was taken as "gold standard": in all three morphological subgroups the NMPCR assay had significantly (P < 0.0001) higher sensitivities than the MY09-MY11 and GP5+-GP6+ assays and sensitivities comparable or equal to those of the MY/GP assay. All 18 HPV genotypes investigated were detected among the clinical samples. The ratio of high- to low-risk HPV genotypes increased from 4:1 (80 of 103) in CIN 0 to 19:1 (149 of 157) in CIN I to III. Multiple infections were detected in 47.9% (124 of 259) of the patients. In conclusion, the novel NMPCR method is a sensitive and useful tool for HPV DNA detection, especially when exact HPV genotyping and the identification of multiple HPV infections are required.
