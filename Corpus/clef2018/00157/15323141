Interlaboratory reliability of Hybrid Capture 2. We evaluated the interlaboratory reproducibility of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2 Digene, Gaithersburg, MD), a test for oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, using data from 4 clinical center (CC) laboratories and the quality control (QC) laboratory participating in the ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) and LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) Triage Study (ALTS). Residual liquid cytology specimens were tested routinely throughout the duration of ALTS at CC laboratories, and a stratified (by time in the study) random sample of specimens was retested by the HPV QC laboratory using equivalent protocols. Of the specimens selected (N = 1,175, 5.50% of all specimens obtained), 1,072 (91.23%) had sufficient specimen volume for retesting. The kappa value between all CC laboratories and the HPV QC laboratory was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.89), with kappa values for individual CCs and the HPV QC laboratory ranging from 0.79 to 0.89. Agreement between test results was lowest among results for women with negative cytologic findings (0.73)
