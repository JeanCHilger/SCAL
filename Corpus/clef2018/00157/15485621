Cervical cancer screening. Although primary prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections that are causally associated with invasive cervical cancer may be within our grasp, it is unlikely that these approaches will replace existing cervical cancer screening strategies for many years. Experts agree and data support periodic cytology screening for young-adult women using one of several technologies. Recent analyses of cost-effectiveness suggest that the addition of molecular HPV DNA testing for women aged over 30 years may allow the screening interval to be lengthened to 3 years for most women. Women at high risk for HPV infection and its associated cellular atypias warrant closer monitoring and follow-up. These patients would include organ transplant recipients, women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES), and HIV-infected women.
