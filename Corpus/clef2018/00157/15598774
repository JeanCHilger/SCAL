Distribution and prevalence of human papillomavirus genotypes in routine pap smear of 2,470 korean women determined by DNA chip. We examined human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution and prevalence from routine Pap smear cases in Korean women using DNA Chip.A total of 2,470 cervical specimens from women attending routine Pap smear cytology screening in local hospitals was subjected to HPV test. HPV detection and genotyping were done using DNA Chip.HPV DNA was detected in 44.8% of the patients and in 58.7% of the 861 atypical lesions based on the Bethesda system, including 52.6% of 627 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 69.0% of 168 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 89.4% of 66 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) cases. The most frequently found genotypes in all HPV-positive cases were HPV-16, HPV-52, and HPV-58. HPV-16 was the most prevalent type in within normal limits, ASCUS, and HSIL categories, whereas HPV-51 was most frequently found in LSIL. Multiple infection was identified in about 20% of HPV-positive cases and most of them were that by two different types. HPV-16 was present in the majority of multiple infection cases. A significant decrease in the percentage of multiple infection was observed in HSIL cases compared with ASCUS and LSIL.The distribution of HPV genotypes in Korean women was revealed to have differences to that of other regions, showing higher frequencies of HPV-52, HPV-58, and HPV-51. HSIL cases were mostly infected by sole HPV-16 whereas LSIL that by various HPV types, suggesting a certain type may become dominant over others as the disease progresses.
