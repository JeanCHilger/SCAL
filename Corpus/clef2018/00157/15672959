Evaluation of Langerhans' cells in human papillomavirus-associated squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix. Current research has been evaluating morphological modifications and density of Langerhans' cells in women with histopathological HPV lesions of the uterine cervix. Fourteen women with subclinical HPV infections underwent clinical, colpocytological colposcopy examinations, and paired biopsies of the uterine cervix. Histopathological, HPV hybrid capture and S-100 immunohistochemical examinations were performed in biopsy specimens. Groupings of viral lesions and normal tissue were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Langerhans' cells in the specimens were frequently located in the intermediate and basal layers of the epithelium. A significant reduction of cytoplasmic profiles occurred in viral lesions (144.08 profiles/mm2) when compared to normal tissue (256.27 profiles/mm2) of the epithelium. An inverse modulation occurred in the cytoplasmatic profiles/nuclei ratio with 2.80 in viral lesions and 4.89 in normal tissue of the stroma. A local immunodeficiency based on cytoplasmic changes of Langerhans' cells has been postulated as a mechanism by which HPV could be involved in the genesis of neoplasia.
