High viral loads of human papillomavirus predict risk of invasive cervical carcinoma. High loads of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and HPV 18/45 increase the risk of developing invasive cervical carcinoma, revealing higher risk in percentiles of highest viral loads for HPV 16 (odds ratio (OR) 58.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-151.4) compared to HPV 18/45 (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.2). Thus, HPV load is a type-dependent risk marker for invasive carcinoma.
