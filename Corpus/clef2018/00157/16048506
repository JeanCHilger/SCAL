Human papillomavirus DNA detection in women with primary abnormal cytology of the cervix: prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes. In this study, we focus on the prevalence and occurrence of different anogenital human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in a first abnormal cervical screening test, and correlate HPV genotyping with the cytological diagnosis on thin-layer liquid-based preparations in routine gynaecological screening.Out of 780 abnormal smears, 513 tested positive for HPV. All 25 different HPV types were identified by Line Probe Assay.The prevalence of high-risk HPV types increased from 72% in atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance to 94.5% in high-grade intra-epithelial lesion (HSIL). Co-infection with multiple HPV types was predominantly found in HSIL (35.8%). In the HSIL group the most common HPV types were 16, 52, 51 and 31 type 18 was rarely present.The role of types 31, 51 and 52 should be considered in future studies on vaccine development.
