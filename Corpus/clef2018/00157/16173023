High prevalence of high-risk oncogenic human papillomaviruses harboring atypical distribution in women of childbearing age living in Libreville, Gabon. The extent of human papillomavirus (HPV) genital shedding and type-specific diversity were evaluated in 354 consecutive women of childbearing age living in Libreville, Gabon. Detection of HPV DNA was performed by PCR using the MY09/MY11 primer set on DNA extracted from endocervical swabs. All PCR positive specimens were subjected to direct sequencing and HPV genotypes were identified on the basis of >95% sequence homology in the L1 region. Reverse line blot hybridization assay was used when a genotype could not be resolved by sequencing alone. HPV DNA was detected in 163 (46%) women, all clinically asymptomatic for HPV-related lesions. The highest prevalence of genital HPV detection (45%) was in the age group from 22 to 29 years. A total of 90 women (55%) harbored high-risk (HR) genotypes, with the most common being HPV-53 (19 12%), HPV-58 (17
