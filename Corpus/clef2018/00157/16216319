Development and evaluation of a highly sensitive human papillomavirus genotyping DNA chip. Test of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a useful adjunctive tool of Pap smear to screen cervical cancer. We have developed a novel HPV genotyping DNA chip arrayed by multiple oligonucleotide probes of both L1 and E6/E7 gene sequence of 42 types of anogenital HPV.Consensus PCR products of L1 and E6/E7 gene sequences of HPV are hybridized to arrayed probes on the HPV chip and HPV genotypes are identified by fluorescence scanner. We have comparatively analyzed the value of HPV DNA chip and DNA sequencing in 100 cervical cancer tissues.Overall, 98 cervical cancer tissues were found to harbor DNA sequences of high-risk type HPVs, of which 88 (89.8%) were detected by PCR-sequencing of L1 alone, 98 (100%) by PCR-sequencing of both L1 and E6/E7, and 98 (100%) by HPV DNA chip, respectively. All of the genotypes of HPV detected on sequencing analysis were also found on DNA chip analysis. HPV DNA chip was superior to direct DNA sequencing in detection of mixed infection.These results suggest that HPV DNA chip analysis in the present study is highly accurate for detection and genotyping of HPV and may have potential value as a robust, high-throughput screening test of uterine cervix cancer.
