Prognostic significance of pathological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Cisplatin-based chemoradiation is the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer patients however, neoadjuvant modalities are currently being tested. Neoadjuvant studies in several tumor types have underscored the prognostic significance of pathological response for survivalFour cohorts of patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma (stages IB2-IIIB) included prospectively in phase II protocols of either neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 1) cisplatin-gemcitabine, 2) oxaliplatin-gemcitabine, 3) carboplatin-paclitaxel or 4) chemoradiation with cisplatin or cisplatin-gemcitabine followed by radical hysterectomy were analyzed for pathological response and survival.One-hundred and fifty three (86%) of the 178 patients treated within these trials, underwent radical hysterectomy and were analyzed. Overall, the mean age was 44.7 and almost two-thirds were FIGO stage IIB. Pathological response rates were as follows: Complete (pCR) in 60 cases (39.2%), Near-complete (p-Near-CR) in 24 (15.6 %) and partial (pPR) in 69 cases (45.1%). A higher proportion rate of pCR was observed in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (with cisplatin [19/40, 47.5%] or with cisplatin-gemcitabine [24/41, 58.5%] compared with patients receiving only chemotherapy, 6/23 (26%), 3/8 (37.5%) and 8/41 (19.5%) for cisplatin-gemcitabine, oxaliplatin-gemcitabine and carboplatin-paclitaxel respectively [p = 0.0001]). A total of 29 relapses (18.9%) were documented. The pathological response was the only factor influencing on relapse, since only 4/60 (6.6%) patients with pCR relapsed, compared with 25/93 (26.8%) patients with viable tumor, either pNear-CR or pPR (p = 0.001). Overall survival was 98.3% in patients with pCR versus 83% for patients with either pNear-CR or pPR (p = 0.009).Complete pathological response but no Near-complete and partial responses is associated with longer survival in cervical cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
