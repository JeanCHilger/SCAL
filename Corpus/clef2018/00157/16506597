Cervical cancer precursors: cytohistologic correlation with the results of HPV testing. Persistence of high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for the development, maintenance and progression of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). Cytohistologic correlation with the results of the HPV testing in 52 patients over a 3year period is presented. Two patients out of the 52 patients presented in this histologic follow up bore the diagnosis high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) with the former cytology ASC-H. Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were found in eight patients, half of them diagnosed identically on cytology. Another four cases were formerly diagnosed cytologically as ASC-US. All women with the histologically confirmed dysplastic changes were HR HPV DNA positive. Our results indicate that significant histologic lesions may be discovered in patients exhibiting the high-risk HPV DNA positivity in the category of ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) and especially ASC-H (ASC cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). A combined screening test thus offers the possibility of greater protection and /or longer screening intervals.
