Aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes and allelic imbalance in cervical intraepitelial neoplasia. We analysed 42 high-grade CIN or CIN3 samples, 42 nondysplasia tissues adjacent to CIN3. 35 smears from women without gynecological pathology were also evaluated. Methylation status of six genes (p16, MLH1, HIC1, MGMT, N33 and RB1) was determined using methylation-sensitive PCR. There is some insignificant level of methylation determined in normal smears. Methylation percentages of the genes in CIN3 were: p16, 58% MLH1, 51%
