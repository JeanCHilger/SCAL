Investigation of human papillomavirus by hybrid capture II in cervical carcinomas including 113 adenocarcinomas and related lesions. Hybrid capture is an easy and highly sensitive technique for screening population due to its capacity to detect malignant and premalignant lesions of the cervix. To evaluate its sensitivity, we investigated the frequency of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and its correlation with glandular malignant lesions, analyzing a total of 113 cases of adenocarcinomas and related lesions. High-risk HPV was investigated using a hybrid capture II (HC2) assay. Samples were collected in two different ways: either brushed directly from surgical specimens before fixation or collected from the patients. We also investigated the frequency of HPV in squamous malignant lesions, 65 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 66 in situ squamous cell carcinomas (ISSCC), to compare the occurrence of HPV for these lesions. The 113 glandular lesions comprised 62 invasive adenocarcinomas (IAC), 8 in situ adenocarcinomas (ISAC), 26 IAC plus SCC, and 17 adenosquamous cells carcinomas (ASCC). The HPV-positive reactions were as follows: 51 (82.2%) in IAC, 8 (100%) in ISAC, 25 (96.1%) in IAC plus SCC, and 14 (82.3%) in ASCC. HC2-positive results in the squamous malignant lesions were as follows: 58 of 63 (89.0%) for SCC and 94 of 103 (91.2%) for ISSCC. High-risk HPV infection was quite similar for glandular and pure squamous invasive malignant lesions, 82.2% and 89.0%, respectively, indicating that high-risk HPV is also highly prevalent in glandular lesions. Although hybrid capture proved to be an excellent adjunctive technique, we do not believe its results merit replacing the Pap smear as a screening tool.
