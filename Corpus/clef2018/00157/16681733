Correlation of human papillomavirus and adeno-associated virus 2 infection in cytology with Korean women. The purpose of our prospective study was to investigate the prevalence of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and/or HPV 18 infection in Korean women with normal cervical smears and those with HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer in cytobrush samples, and to evaluate the correlation between AAV 2 and HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 infection. AAV 2 was detected in CIN I (9.7%), CIN II (20%), CIN III (22.8%), and cancer (10%). HPV 16 was detected in CIN I (42%), CIN II (55%), CIN III (54.3%), and cancer (70%). HPV 18 was detected in CIN I (51.6%), CIN II (50%), CIN III (62.8%), and cancer (43.3%). HPV 16 or HPV 18 was detected in CIN I (18.3%), CIN II (80%), CIN III (71.4%), and cancer (80%). In normal and HPV-infected group, AAV 2 DNA was detected in 16.3% and 4.4% of samples, respectively. HPV 16 was detected in 10.2% of normal patients and in 44.4% of HPV-infected patients, and HPV 18 was detected in 12.2% of normal patients and in 40% of HPV-infected patients. HPV 16 or HPV 18 was detected in 18.3% of normal patients and in 57.7% of HPV infection. The correlation between AAV 2 and HPV 16 was statistically significant in normal and CIN I/II group only, and AAV 2 and HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 showed no correlation. Therefore, the correlation between AAV and HPV were not statistically significant. These data support the previous reports that AAV might not be associated with cervical tumorigenesis.
