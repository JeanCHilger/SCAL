Serologic response to human papillomavirus 16 among Australian women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This study evaluated the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 antibody in HPV 16-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in Australian women. Seroreactivity to HPV 16 L1 virus-like particles was assessed in patients with CIN 2 (n= 169) and CIN 3 (n= 229) lesions previously tested for the presence of HPV DNA. Seropositivity was significantly commoner in women with HPV 16 DNA-positive lesions (98/184) than in women with no HPV DNA in the lesion (15/47) or with HPV of types other than 16 in the lesion (43/167) (P= 0.0004). In addition, seropositivity was observed in 33% (55/169) of women with CIN 2 and 46% (106/229) of women with CIN 3, in keeping with the lower fraction of CIN 2 (57/169) than CIN 3 (127/229) biopsies positive for HPV 16 DNA. HPV 16 seropositivity is most common in women with HPV 16-associated CIN, but many patients with HPV-associated CIN 3 are seronegative, and HPV 16 seropositivity is common in women with CIN associated with other HPV types. Overall, HPV 16 serology is a poor predictor of presence of HPV 16-associated CIN 3 in patient population studied.
