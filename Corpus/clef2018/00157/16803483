Human papillomavirus-specific viral types are common in Mexican women affected by cervical lesions. Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common in Mexican female population. The human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 frequencies in worldwide may be different due to geographical distribution. We analyzed the prevalence of HPV types and determinated their association in cervical lesion in a Mexican population. One hundred fifty-nine normal cervical smears, 95 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), 59 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL), and 108 CC samples of the patients were collected. HPV types were determined by sequencing. We detected 11 high-risk types, four low-risk types, three not determinated, and two probably high risk. HPV were present in 12%, 57%, 88%, and 92% from normal, LGSIL, HGSIL, and CC samples, respectively. HPV 16 was the most common in all cervical lesions (71.6% in CC). HPV 58 was present in 18.6% of HGSIL, and the HPV 18 in 4.6% of CC. The 76% of all detected viruses belong to A9 species branch. Control women showed high percentage of HPV high-risk infection, suggesting that this is a high-risk group. High frequency of HPV 16 compared with a low incidence of HPV 18 was observed. HPV 58 is frequently detected in HGSIL but low frequency is found in CC. These findings might be considered for HPV screening.
