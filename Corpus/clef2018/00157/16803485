Prediction of high-grade cervical disease with human papillomavirus detection in women with glandular and squamous cytologic abnormalities. The objective of this study was to assess whether human papillomavirus (HPV) detection with hybrid capture II (HC II) can help predict the presence and the nature, glandular or squamous, of histologic cervical lesions in women referred due to atypical glandular cells (AGC) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). A total of 247 women were included. Referral Pap smears comprised AGC (51 cases), AGC plus HSIL (28 cases), adenocarcinoma in situ (10 cases), and HSIL (158 cases). All patients were tested for high-risk HPV with HC II and had a histologic assessment of their cervix. Histologic analysis showed 38 women with (15.3%) cervicitis, 194 with (75.5%) squamous lesions, and 15 with (9.2%) glandular neoplasia. The overall rate of high-risk HPV detection was 77%. Almost 70% of AGC-HPV-negative patients did not have a pathologically proven cervical neoplasia, whereas 76% of women with AGC-HPV-positive result were diagnosed with a squamous or glandular neoplasia. Most (95%) of the lesions in patients with AGC-HSIL were of squamous nature, and HPV detection did not contribute to their differentiation from glandular lesions. We conclude that in women with AGC, HPV positivity strongly correlated with the presence of glandular or squamous cervical lesion but did not help distinguishing women with squamous from those with glandular neoplasia.
