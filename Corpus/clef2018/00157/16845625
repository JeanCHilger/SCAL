Prevalence of human papillomavirus genotypes and related abnormalities of cervical cytological results among HIV-1-infected women in Rochester, New York. Women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have higher rates of concurrent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical dysplasia than do HIV-uninfected women. They are also more commonly infected with multiple HPV types simultaneously. To determine the prevalence of different HPV genotypes in a group of HIV-infected women and to correlate these findings with cervical cytological results, we studied a group of 229 women attending a university-based HIV clinic during a 7-year period. When cervicovaginal lavage specimens, the reverse line-blot assay, and DNA sequencing were used, the most commonly detected HPV types (in decreasing order of frequency) were 56, 53, 16, 58, 52, MM7, MM8, and 33. These results contrast sharply with similar studies of HIV-uninfected women, in whom HPV-16 and -18 generally predominate. In our study, the HPV types most commonly associated with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) were 56 and 53. Types most commonly associated with high-grade SILs were 52 and 58. High-risk HPV types other than 16 and 18 are often found in HIV-infected women and are frequently associated with abnormal cervical cytological results in this setting. These observations have implications for the design of future HPV vaccines.
