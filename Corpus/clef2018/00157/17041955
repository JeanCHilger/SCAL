ASC-US and high-risk HPV testing: performance in daily clinical practice. Data are beginning to accrue on high-risk HPV DNA testing in patients with ASC-US on cervical cytology. We report on our experience at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. From February 2002 through December 31, 2005 (3 yr, 11 mo), the cytopathology laboratory processed 49,599 Pap Tests, of which 1,792 (3.6%) were diagnosed as ASC-US. Six hundred and seventy two (37.5%) of these cases were processed for high-risk HPV genotypes using the Digene Hybrid Capture II method. Of these cases, 266 (39.6%) were positive for high-risk HPV genotypes, 11 (1.6%) were equivocal, and 395 (58.8%) were negative. Biopsy follow-up was available for 127 (47.7%) of the 266 cases, of which 66 (52%) were negative, 46 (36.2%) showed CIN I, 9 (7.1%) were CIN II, and 6 (4.7%) were CIN III. Of the remaining 139 (52.3%) cases, 86 (62%) had follow-up Pap Tests, of which 57 (66.3%) were negative, 15 (17.4%) were ASC-US, 12 (15%) were low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 2 (2.3%) were high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions 53 (38.1%) were lost to follow-up. In combination, 90 (42.25%) of the 213 cases with follow-up showed atypia or above after a diagnosis of ASC-US
