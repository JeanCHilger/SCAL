Upregulation of telomerase (hTERT) is related to the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but is not an independent predictor of high-risk human papillomavirus, virus persistence, or disease outcome in cervical cancer. Telomerase activation and telomere maintenance are essential for cell immortalization and represent a rate-limiting step in cancer progression. The E6 oncoprotein of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to activate telomerase, but its expression in CIN lesions and its prognostic value in cervical cancer (CC) are still incompletely understood. As part of our HPV-PathogenISS study, a series of 150 CCs and 152 CIN lesions were examined using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for hTERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), and tested for HPV using PCR with three primer sets (MY09/11, GP5(+)/GP6(+), SPF). Follow-up data were available from all SCC patients, and 67 CIN lesions had been monitored with serial PCR for HPV after cone treatment. Expression of hTERT was increased in parallel with the grade of CIN, with major up-regulation upon transition to CIN3 (OR 18.81 95% CI 8.48-41.69
