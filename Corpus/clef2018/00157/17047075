Relationships of human papillomavirus type, qualitative viral load, and age with cytologic abnormality. Persistent cervical infections with carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause virtually all cervical cancer. Cytologic abnormalities are the manifestations of HPV infections used to identify women at risk. To compare the potential of the full range of anogenital HPV genotypes to induce cytopathic effects, we examined the influences of HPV type, viral load, and age on cytopathology among 1,222 women having a single HPV type at enrollment into a 10,000-woman population-based study in Costa Rica. Cervical specimens were tested for approximately 40 HPV types by MY09/MY11 L1 primer PCR and type-specific dot blot hybridization. Types were organized by phylogenetic species and cancer risk. PCR signal strength served as a qualitative surrogate for viral load. Overall, 24.8% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 22.4-27.3] of single prevalent HPV infections had concurrent abnormalities (atypical squamous cells or worse) ranging from 0.0% to 80.0% based on HPV type. Noncarcinogenic alpha3/alpha15 types, although highly prevalent, uncommonly caused cytologic abnormalities (13.1% 95% CI, 9.8-17.0). In contrast, one quarter to nearly one half of infections with a single major carcinogenic species type (alpha9/alpha11/alpha7/alpha5/alpha6) produced abnormalities. Greater abnormalities were observed with increasing qualitative viral load of carcinogenic types
