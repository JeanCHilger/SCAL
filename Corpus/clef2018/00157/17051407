Human papilloma virus-induced disease in HIV-positive patients. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), opportunistic infections by bacteria and fungi have been reduced in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. However, diseases caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) have become more frequent despite HAART. There is an increased incidence of anal and cervical carcinomas, their precancerous lesions such as anal/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and condylomas and oral warts. In order to prevent anal carcinomas, HIV-positive patients should receive proctoscopic examinations regularly. The examination should include anoscopy and smears for cytology and HPV polymerase chain reaction.
