Anti human-papillomavirus vaccines: concepts, aims and trials. Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) are epitheliotropic for stratified malpighian epithelia such as those of the cervix. Among them, oncogenic viruses are detectable in 99.7% of cervical cancers. A great priority is to develop a vaccine either against primary infection (preventive vaccine) allowing protection against HPV infection or therapeutic vaccine in order to kill previously infected or transformed keratinocytes.Preventive vaccines against HPV contain virus like particles (VLP) 16 and 18 and induce a high titer of blood anti-VLP antibodies. They were recently tested in humans and have shown true efficiency for the prevention of cervical cancer. The therapeutic vaccines are therefore currently being developed in order to increase anti-HPV natural CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immunity in women infected during their sexual activity.The perspective of the prophylactic vaccines is to decrease both genital HPV infection and cervical cancer. The impact of preventive vaccine must be carefully analyzed in order to prevent collateral side effects. The therapeutic vaccines have also a future in women already infected by HPV and might have an efficiency similar to surgery in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
