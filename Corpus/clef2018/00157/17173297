Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H): does HPV matter? The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cases diagnosed as atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high squamous grade intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) in cervical specimens is not well established. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of HPV status in cases of ASC-H in a major cancer center. One hundred thirty-two patients with a diagnosis of ASC-H were identified over a 4-yr period in our institution. Forty-four of 132 cases were evaluated for high-risk HPV and had biopsy follow-up. The positive predictive value (PPV) of ASC-H for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions overall was 32% while PPV of ASC-H with associated HR HPV was 42%. This increase was statistically significant with P = 0.003 and suggest that HPV testing might be useful to increase the PPV of ASC-H.
