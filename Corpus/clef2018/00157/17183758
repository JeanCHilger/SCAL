Clear-cell endocervical adenocarcinoma in a 19-year-old woman. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix is increasing within the US, but this diagnostic category is not typically associated with teenaged patients. A report on a case of a 19-year-old woman, with no history of diethylbestrol exposure in uteri, diagnosed with clear-cell endocervical adenocarcinoma is made. Malignant glandular cells were detected on both conventional and Thin Prep gynecologic tests with histologic confirmation. Human papilloma virus (HPV) high-risk type results were negative in this particular case. The patient's unremarkable medical and sexual history prompted us to review the diagnostic criteria and pathogenesis of the disease.
