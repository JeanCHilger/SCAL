Differentially expressed genes between high-risk human papillomavirus types in human cervical cancer cells. Cervical carcinoma (CC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide and the first cause of death among the Mexican female population. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most important etiologic factor for CC. Of the oncogenic types, HPV16 and HPV18 are found in 60-70% of invasive CCs worldwide. HPV18 appears to be associated with a more aggressive form of cervical neoplasia than HPV16 infection. At present, there are no studies on differentially expressed cellular genes between transformed cells harboring HPV16 and HPV18 sequences. Based on previous complementary DNA microarray data from our group, 13 genes were found to be differentially overexpressed between HPV16- and HPV18-transformed cells. These genes were as follows: E6BP, UBE4A, C20orf14, ATF7, ABCC8, SLC6A12, WASF3, SUV39H1, SPAG8, CCNC, E2FFE, BIRC5, and DEDD. Differential expression of six selected genes was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All real-time RT-PCRs confirmed differential expression between HPV18 and HPV(-) samples. The present work identifies genes from signaling pathways triggered by HPV transformation that could be differentially deregulated between HPV16(+) and HPV18(+) samples.
