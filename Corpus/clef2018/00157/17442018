Persistence of human papillomavirus as a predictor for treatment failure after loop electrosurgical excision procedure. We aimed to investigate whether postconization human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing can predict treatment failure and improve the accuracy of conventional follow-up in women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Between March 2001 and October 2005, 120 patients with confirmed CIN 2 or 3 were treated with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and were enrolled. Six patients were lost to the follow-up. Postconization follow-up was performed at every 3-6 months during the first year and then annually. Specimens were tested for the presence of HPV, using the Hybrid Capture 2 (Digene Co, Gaithersburg, MD) and HPV DNA chip (Mygene Co, Seoul, Korea) test. Persistent HPV infection was defined as persistently (two times or more) positive HPV tests with the same HPV subtype(s) at initial diagnosis. Twenty-two (19.3%) patients showed treatment failure after conization. The only significant risk factor for redevelopment of CIN after conization was persistence of the same HPV subtype (P < 0.0001). And women with recurrent or residual CIN had higher HPV load during the 6-month follow-up postconization. In conclusion, the persistence of the same HPV subtype after LEEP conization was an important predictor of treatment failure. The follow-up protocol after conization of CIN should include both cervical cytology and HPV test, and HPV DNA chip test is needed to detect a persistent HPV infection.
