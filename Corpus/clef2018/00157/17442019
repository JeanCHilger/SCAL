The relationship between human papillomavirus infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in Turkish women. To compare the prevalence of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Turkish women with normal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In between March 2002 and November 2005, the study was designed as case-control study. Cytologic abnormalities in Pap smears were classified according to the Bethesda System (2001). Identification of the presence of HPV was carried out by the Hybrid Capture II test for all patients. To compare the groups, Chi-square test was used. A total of 1353 reproductive aged women were screened. Of them, 1344 (99.3%) had normal or class I Pap smear. Remaining nine cases (0.7%) had CIN at several degrees (five CIN I, three CIN II, and one carcinoma in situ). While all these nine cases with cervical pathologies had HPV, only 20 cases from the other group (1.5%) had HPV (chi(2) 466.1 P = 0.0001). This is the first study of the evaluation of the association between HPV and preinvasive cervical lesions in Turkish population. In spite of low general frequency (2.1%) of cervical HPV colonization in this population, a strong correlation was found between HPV and CIN.
