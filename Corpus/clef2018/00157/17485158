The role of high-risk HPV-DNA testing in the male sexual partners of women with HPV-induced lesions. The objectives were to assess the prevalence of high-risk HPV in the male sexual partners of women with HPV-induced lesions, and correlate it with biopsies guided by peniscopy.Fifty-four asymptomatic male sexual partners of women with low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL) associated with high-risk HPV were examined between April 2003 and June 2005. The DNA-HPV was tested using a second-generation hybrid capture technique in scraped penile samples. Peniscopy identified acetowhite lesions leading to biopsy.High-risk HPV was present in 25.9% (14 out of 54) of the cases. Peniscopy led to 13 biopsies (24.07%), which resulted in two cases of condyloma, two cases of intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN) I, one case of PIN II, and eight cases of normal tissue. The high-risk HPV test demonstrated 80% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 88.9% negative predictive value for the identification of penile lesions. There was a greater chance of finding HPV lesions in the biopsy in the positive cases of high-risk HPV with abnormal peniscopy (p=0.007) OR=51 (CI 1.7-1527.1).Among asymptomatic male sexual partners of women with low-grade intra-epithelial squamous lesions, those infected by high-risk HPV have a higher chance of having abnormal penile tissue compared with male partners without that infection.
