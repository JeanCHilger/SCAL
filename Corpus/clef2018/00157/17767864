Human papillomaviruses infections among village women in Henan province. To investigate the prevalence of Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) among village women in Henan and to determine its relevant risk factors.A population based cross-sectional study on cervical cancer was conducted among village women in Xinmi, Henan. Women aged 20 - 54 who had sexual intercourse experiences were enrolled in this study. Self-sampling and direct-sampling were used in collecting women's vaginal discharge. 13 high-risk HPVs were tested with HC2 for all of the specimens. Then women with abnormal results did colposcopy and biopsy. The biopsy results were regarded as the golden standard.There were 881 women enrolled in this paper and 881 self-sampling and 880 direct-sampling specimens were collected. The HPVs prevalence rates for the self-sampling and direct-sampling were 13.05% and 12.27%, respectively. Age-specific prevalence rates were 10.57% (20-), 9.60% (25-), 12.00% (30-), 9.52% (35-), 17.60% (40-), 13.74% (45-) and 12.80% (50 - 54). HPV prevalence rates were increased with progression of cervical disease (chi(2) = 200.69, P = 0.00). And HPV prevalence rates were higher in women with more advanced education background (chi(2) = 11.05, P = 0.01). HPV infection rate in women whose husbands have more than one sexual partner was 18.02% and whose husbands have only one sexual partner was 10.88% (chi(2) = 6.37, P = 0.01).The infection rate of high-risk HPVs in this area is high. The relationship of HPV infection with age has not been observed in this study, but the the sexual activity is the major risk factor for cervical cancer.
