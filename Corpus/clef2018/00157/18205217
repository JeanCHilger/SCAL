Isolation and functional analysis of five HPVE6 variants with respect to p53 degradation. Persistent infection with high risk human papillomavirus is a necessary risk factor in the etiology of invasive cervical carcinoma. With regard to molecular details, the best studied types are HPV16 and HPV18 which are found in 70% of cervical cancer worldwide, however factors associated with the progression of individual cervical intraepithelial neoplasias into cancer are still poorly understood. Intratype amino acid variations in the immortalizing and transforming early proteins E6 and E7 were described to be associated with progressive disease and linked to increased viral persistence or progression. One of the key actions of high risk HPVE6 proteins is the inhibition of the function of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, by enhancing its degradation through the ubiquitin pathway. In this study, variants of five HPV type E6 proteins (HPV35, 53, 56, 66, and 70) isolated from patient materials are described and functional analysis of them were done with respect to p53 degradation. Interestingly the E6 protein of HPV type 53, which has no consistent risk classification in the literature showed the highest variability in our study. The analysis of all variants revealed no differences with regard to the degradation ability for p53 compared to the prototype E6 proteins, suggesting that the variants tested revealed no altered functions related to the carcinogenicity of the respective HPV types. It therefore seems more likely that variations in the E6 gene sequence may allow evasion from the hosts immune system, supporting increased viral persistence.
