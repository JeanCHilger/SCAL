Pilot study of prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes in Israeli Jewish women referred for colposcopic examination. The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in a group of Israeli Jewish women referred for colposcopic examination. Scrape specimens were prospectively collected from 84 women referred for colposcopic examination. All the women underwent Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and colposcopies, and some also underwent cervical or loop electrosurgical excision procedure biopsy. HR HPV was detected in scrape specimens (Amplicor HPV test Roche Molecular Systems), and the individual genotypes in these specimens were identified (HPV GenoArray test kit
