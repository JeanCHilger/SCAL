Factors associated with regular cervical cancer screening. To identify the factors associated with regular cervical screening (CS) in the French female population.Face-to-face interviews with 5354 randomly selected French women were carried out in this population-based, observational, cross-sectional study. The variables found significant by univariate analysis were entered in a stepwise analysis. A multivariate logistic model constructed with these variables permitted to identify which were significantly related to women undergoing regular CS.A significant relationship was found between regular CS and previous screening for HIV infection, being professionally active, fear of cervical cancer, level of education, and having had a gynecologic check-up in the past 5 years.Since the study sample was known to be representative of the female adult population, most of our observations may have important public health implications in France, where information on HPV infection and its possible consequences need to be improved.
