Human papillomavirus (HPV) type distribution in Korean women: a meta-analysis. The aim of the present study is to estimate the overall prevalence and type distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) in Korean women, through literature review and meta-analysis. We searched published data for the period between 1995 and 2007 using the following inclusion criteria (1) studies using type-specific HPV tests, (2) data from Korean female, (3) with cytologic or pathologic results, (4) having more than 20 cases for each subgroup classified by cytologic results, and (5) HPV detection including types 16, 18, and at least one other type. In total, 18 studies (13,842 cases) published up to April 2007 were identified and selected. Adjusted overall HPV prevalence was 23.9% (95% CI: 23.8-24.1%) in women with normal cytology and 95.8% (95% CI: 95.4-96.2%) in women with cervical cancer. Type 16 was predominant regardless of cervical disease status, and type 58 occupied a significantly larger proportion in high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer in Korean women. HPV types 58, 33, and 52 together accounted for about 20% of infections in cervical cancer and high-grade intraepithelial lesions. After introduction of HPV prophylactic vaccines, extended protection, especially against types 58, 33, and 52, will be an important issue for cervical cancer prevention in Korea. The future dominant genotypes will require follow-up epidemiological studies with a large-scale, multicentered, and prospective design.
