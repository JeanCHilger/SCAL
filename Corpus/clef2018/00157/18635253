Clinical role of cervical cancer vaccination: when and whom to vaccinate? The recent development of two highly effective vaccines against persistent infection by the 2 most important types of human papillomavirus (HPV) (16 and 18) and against high grade premalignant lesions (CIN2+) has opened a new scenario for the primary prevention of cervical cancer. The optimum target population for vaccination should be individually defined taking the following into account: 1) the efficacy of the vaccine, 2) the epidemiological context and 3) the vaccination programs available in each country. To achieve the maximum preventive benefits, the vaccine should be administered before the initiation of sexual relations. So, the HPV vaccine should be integrated in the school vaccination programs of adolescents together with other vaccines. The vaccination of sexually active women may considerably increase the speed with which results in the fight against this disease will be achieved. Developed countries will probably consider the vaccination of these women, although vaccination strategies and the efforts to reach this population will be conditioned by the resources of each country and by the estimations of the cost-efficacy relationship in each situation. Women with a previous history of premalignant cervical disease or with an abnormal screening test should not be excluded from the potential benefits which the vaccine may provide. There is no contraindication for the administration of the vaccine in immunosupressed women. However, it is still unknown under what specific circumstances of immunosuppression the immunogenicity of the vaccine may be affected and there are currently ongoing studies for an answer to this question.
