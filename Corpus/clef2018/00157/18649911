Human papillomavirus type 45 E7 is a transforming protein inducing retinoblastoma protein degradation and anchorage-independent cell cycle progression. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause cervical cancer. The biological properties of HPV-45, the third most prevalent high-risk HPV-genotype, are unknown. We demonstrate here that the HPV-45 E7 protein transforms immortalized NIH3T3 fibroblasts, while mutations in either the conserved LXCXE sequence (C28G) or the carboxyl-terminus (Delta87LQQLF91) significantly abolish this activity. To address the mechanisms underlying cell transformation by HPV-45 E7, we investigated its impact on the cell cycle. We show that HPV-45 E7 associates with the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and induces a significant reduction in the pRb half-life which can be blocked by epoxomicin. Moreover, HPV-45 E7 induces anchorage-independent cell cycle progression of NIH3T3 cells and extends the lifespan of primary human keratinocytes. HPV-45 E7C28G did not bind pRb and could neither induce pRb-proteolysis nor promote cell cycle progression. HPV-45 E7Delta87LQQLF91 had intermediate pRb-binding affinity and retained a residual activity to induce the degradation of pRb but lost the capability to promote cell cycle progression in suspension. Another carboxyl-terminal mutant, HPV-45 E7Delta81AEDL84, showed a trend to reduced transforming activity, had reduced pRb-binding activity and lost the capability to induce pRb-degradation however, this mutant could induce anchorage-independent cell cycle progression with the same efficiency as HPV-45 E7 wild type. In summary, these data suggest that HPV-45 E7 is a transforming protein and that abrogation of cell cycle control contributes to its oncogenic potential.
