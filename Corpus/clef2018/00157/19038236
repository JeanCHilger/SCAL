Gene expression profiles in HPV-immortalized human cervical cells treated with the nicotine-derived carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an established etiological factor for cervical cancer. Epidemiological studies suggest that smoking in combination with HPV infection plays a significant role in the etiology of this disease. We have previously shown that the tobacco carcinogen, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), is present in human cervical mucus. Here, we hypothesized that treatment of HPV-16-immortalized human ectocervical cells (Ecto1/E6E7) with NNK would alter the expression of genes involved in cellular transformation. Ecto1/E6E7 cells were treated with water (vehicle control) alone or with 1 microM, 10 microM, and 100 microM of NNK in water for 12 weeks. The colony-forming efficiency increased following NNK treatment the maximum effect was observed after 12 weeks with 100 microM NNK. Microarray analysis revealed that, independent of the dose of NNK, expression of 30 genes was significantly altered
