Analytical evaluation of the PapilloCheck test, a new commercial DNA chip for detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus. Recently, a commercially available HPV DNA chip, the PapilloCheck test, developed by Greiner Bio-One, has become available for human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping. The PapilloCheck test is a PCR-based test using a new consensus primer set targeting the E1 HPV gene. HPV oligoprobes immobilized on a DNA chip allow for the identification of 24 HPV types from the amplified product. In the present study, the analytical performance of the PapilloCheck test is compared to the Linear Array HPV genotyping test (Roche Diagnostics). Cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt (Cytyc) solution and obtained from women who presented abnormal cytological findings were tested primarily by the Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk assay (HC2-HR, QIAGEN). A total of 144 samples were selected according to the signal intensity obtained with the HC2-HR test, expressed as RLU/CO value, and divided into 4 groups as follows: [0-1] RLU/CO (negative HC2-HR result, 34 samples) [1-5] RLU/CO (positive HC2-HR result, 30 samples)
