What about the partners of women with abnormal Pap or positive HPV tests? Because high-risk HPV is highly prevalent in the general population, usually transient, and rarely causes clinical symptoms, and because diagnostic and treatment options for HPV in men are lacking, partner notification is not useful for preventing transmission or protecting the health of male partners.We conducted a nationally representative survey of clinicians in 7 specialties that perform cervical cancer screening. Providers were asked whether they recommend that women with an abnormal Pap or positive HPV test inform sex partners of the infection or refer partners to a clinician.A large proportion of providers in all 7 specialties encourage women with either an abnormal Pap or a positive HPV test to tell their sex partners to see a clinician, ranging from 48% to 73% across specialties. Providers who perform reflex HPV testing were more likely to recommend that patients with an ASCUS Pap inform their partners of test results if an HPV test was positive than if it was negative (66%-83% vs. 29%-50%) providers who perform adjunct HPV testing were more likely to recommend that patients with a normal Pap inform their partners if an HPV test was positive than if it was negative (72%-92% vs. 30%-52%).Most providers advise patients with cervical cancer screening tests suggestive of HPV infection to notify their sex partners and to refer them to a clinician. Guidelines are needed for providers to clarify any rationale for clinical evaluation of male partners, including that informing partners has a limited role in the control of HPV transmission or in preventing adverse health outcomes in the male partner.
