High risk human papillomavirus DNA detection in pap tests with both atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and Candida. We examined the detection rate of high risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) DNA in ThinPrep Pap tests with concurrent diagnoses of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and fungal organisms morphologically consistent with Candida species.Gynecologic cytology records were searched to find reports with concurrent diagnoses of both ASCUS and Candida infection. Over a 19-month period, 309 cases with reflex brhHPV tests results were identified. The rate of hr-HPV detection in this group was compared to our laboratory's overall brhHPV rate for women in general and among 5-year age groupings.There was a significantly higher overall rate of hr-HPV detection in cases of ASCUS with Candida (44.7%, p < 0.001) compared to the overall ASCUS hr-HPV rate (34.1%). When age was stratified, the ASCUS with Candida < or = and 21-25 age-groups had significantly higher rates of hr-HPVde tection compared to the overall ASCUS rates (65.0% vs. 58.5, p < 0.001 and 61.6% vs. 50. 5, p < 0.04, respectively).Our study shows that the presence ofCa ndida does not exclude hr-HPV and that atypical cytologic features in the presence of Candida should not be entirely attributed to reactive cellular changes, especially in younger women.
