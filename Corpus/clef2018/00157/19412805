Prevalence of cervical human papillomavirus infection and types among women immigrated to Sicily, Italy. We determined the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical infection and HPV genotypes among 115 women immigrating to Sicily (Italy), with regard to abnormal cytology and socio-behavioral characteristics in a cross-sectional, observational study. Information was collected with the help of cultural mediators/translators. HPV-DNA was assayed by the INNOLiPA HPV assay and a nested PCR/sequencing method. Sixty (52.2%) women came from sub-Saharan Africa and 55 (47.8%) from Eastern Europe. HPV infection was found in 55 (47.8%) women. The most frequent types were the oncogenic types HPV-16 (7.8%), HPV-18 and 51 (6.0% each), HPV-52 (5.2%), 31, 53, and 68 (4.3% each). Twenty-seven (23.5%) women had cytological abnormalities associated with HPV infection (p=0.04). Being single (OR = 2.98 95%CI: 1.30-6.84) and parity (OR = 0.29
