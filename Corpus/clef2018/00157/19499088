Herpesviruses as possible cofactors in HPV-16-related oncogenesis. Cervical carcinogenesis is a complex problem with papillomavirus widely accepted as a causative agent. Integration of a human papillomavirus (HPV) of the high-risk type into the host cell genome is one of the major contributing factors to cervical malignant transformation. In this study, the correlation of CMV, EBV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6 and HHV-7 infections with the physical status of the HPV genome in cervical cancer and precancerous cervical lesions was investigated in sixty HPV-16-positive women. Cervical secretion samples were submitted to DNA extraction and analyzed by PCR. HPV-16 DNA was confirmed in genotyping with the reverse hybridization line probe assay. Multiplex PCR with specific primers for the E2/E6 genes was used to assess the viral integration status of HPV-16. Our results show that CMV DNA was more frequently present in samples with mixed forms of HPV-16 than in the episomal form (P < 0.025). Such a correlation was also observed in the case of EBV (P < 0.005). The presence of CMV resulted in a six-fold (OR 6.069 95% CI 1.91-19.22
