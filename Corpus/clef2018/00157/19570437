Clinical analysis of 35 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade III. To evaluate the etiology, clinicopathological characteristics, treatment and prognosis of VINIII.Thirty-five patients with VINIII admitted in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 1993 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively.All 35 patients attended to hospital with the symptoms of pruritus vulvae and lumps. Among of them, there were 28 (80%) cases whose lesions presented as multiple plaques, while 7 (20%) cases lesion were monofocal. Fifteen out of 35 cases had coexistent with human papillomavirus (HPV) related lesions, and there were the evidence of HPV in 22 patients whose pathologic sections revealed koilocytes. 34 cases (97%) except one received different types of surgical resections, including wide local resection (14/34), simple vulvectomy (16/34) and simple vulvectomy plus perianal skin resection (4/34), while there two cases shown positive cut-edges and one of them received radiotherapy postoperatively. Four out of the 34 cases recurred locally in 2, 4, 6 and 22 months and received surgical treatment again or laser therapy, respectively. The median follow-up period was 66 months (range 1-166), and none of them were died of the disease itself except one case died of the concurrent cervical cancer. Among 26 cases received the investigation of the quality of life, there were nine cases (35%) suffered from sexual dysfunction after the operation, and one of them received vulvoplasty.VINIII has good prognosis. The development of VINIII may be related to the infection of HPV, because most of them concurrent with HPV diseases. Its primary treatment is surgical resection, while affecting on the quality of life.
