Analysis of diagnosis and treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and correlation to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To investigate the diagnosis and therapy of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) and correlation to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).The clinical and pathological data about age, liquid-based cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test, colposcopy, histology types and treatment in 35 patients with VAIN were reviewed to investigate the diagnosis and therapy of VAIN and correlation to CIN.Mean age at presentation was 43.9 years. The percentage of VAINI, VAINII and VAINIII were 52% (18/35), 34% (12/35) and 14% (5/35), respectively. 8% (1/13) of patients were younger than 40 years developed VAINIII, while 18% (4/22) patients were elder than 40 years. There were 83% (29/35) cases were diagnosed from 2007 to June 2008. 69% (24/35) or 17% (6/35) cases had the history of CIN or cervical cancer, respectively. VAINII-III accounted for 3/9, 53% (8/15) and 4/6 of CINI, CINII-III and cervical cancer, respectively. There were 87% (13/15) positive high risk HPV infection in VAINI, while 100% in VAINII and VAINIII. There were 97% (33/34) cases with abnormality for liquid-based cytology and 86% (30/35) cases of lesions were located in the upper 1/3 vagina. Among 19 cases received therapy, 14 cases (74%) were treated by surgery, 2 cases (11%) by brachytherapy, 3 cases (16%) used drug on the surface of vagina and the lesions were shown recovery in 9 cases followed up.The clinical characteristics of VAIN are similar to CIN and the principles of diagnosis and treatment are also the same as that of CIN.
