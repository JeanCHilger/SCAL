Role of high risk-human papilloma virus test in the follow-up of patients who underwent conization of the cervix for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To examine whether the presence of high risk-human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) after conization of the cervix was a risk factor for persistence or recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and whether HR-HPV test could be a guideline for post-therapy surveillance.The study retrospectively analyzed data from 243 patients who underwent LLETZ or CKC of the cervix due to CIN.A positive HR-HPV test result which was performed between 3 and 6 months after procedure was a risk factor for persistent or recurrent cytological (p<0.001, odds ratio [OR]=22.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]=9.74-52.02) and pathological (p<0.001, OR=18.28, 95% CI=5.55-60.20) abnormalities.HR-HPV positive patients between 3 and 6 months after procedure should undergo frequent and meticulous post-therapy surveillance, while HR-HPV negative patients do not require such high-level surveillance and could undergo routine surveillance.
