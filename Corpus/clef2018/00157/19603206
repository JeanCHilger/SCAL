Feasibility of collecting self-sampled vaginal swabs by mail: quantity and quality of genomic DNA. Vaginal self-sampling may be valuable as an alternative method of cervical cancer screening in areas of poor resources, to enroll women who, otherwise, would not participate in population-based cervical cancer screening and in epidemiological follow-up studies. We assessed the reliability of mailed vaginal samples by evaluating the quantity and quality of genomic DNA in the samples. Mailed swabs (n = 201) were compared with freshly collected samples (n = 200) for DNA concentration (45.1 versus 50.9 ng/microl, respectively) and purity (mean optical density [OD] 260/280 ratio 1.88 versus 1.78, respectively). A small, non-significant, decrease in DNA yield with longer transport time was noted. The DNA yield of mailed samples was significantly lower compared to fresh samples (P < 0.002), but this lower yield had little effect on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. In conclusion, the large majority of mailed self-sampled vaginal swabs resulted in DNA of adequate purity and concentration for further research.
