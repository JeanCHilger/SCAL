Predictors of human papillomavirus persistence among women with equivocal or mildly abnormal cytology. We investigated short-term persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among 2,408 women with low-grade or equivocal cytological abnormalities followed for 24 months. Odds ratios (ORs) for persistence to the next 6-month visit were estimated by a discrete time survival model. Prevalent HPV infections persisted longer in older women, but no association with age was found for incident HPV infections. Increased likelihood of persistence was found among current smokers of >20 cigarettes per day compared with smokers of <or=10 cigarettes per day (OR=1.43 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.01) and among current injectable contraceptive users (OR=1.15
