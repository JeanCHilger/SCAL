Human papillomavirus-specific genotypes in cervical lesions of women referred for smears with atypical glandular cells or adenocarcinoma in situ. This study was designed to analyze whether specific human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes may predict histologic outcomes in women with glandular abnormalities in their cervical smears. Of the 160 women included, 111 were diagnosed with atypical glandular cells, 35 had both atypical glandular cells and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, whereas 14 women had AIS, in 1 case associated with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. All women underwent colposcopic examinations and biopsy was performed in 129/160 (80.6%). Thirty-one women (19.3%) were considered negative for neoplasia and scheduled for follow-up. All specimens were tested for 27 HPV genotypes by Roche's polymerase chain reaction-reverse line blot assay. Histologic diagnoses were either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive carcinoma in 75 (58%) women, and negative for neoplasia in 54 (42%). The overall prevalence of HPV was 43%. HPV 16 was the most prevalent type followed by HPV 18. HPV 16 was significantly associated with squamous and glandular neoplasia and HPV 18 with glandular neoplasia. In women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3, 11 different HPV genotypes were found, whereas in those who had invasive glandular or invasive carcinoma HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found predominantly. The detection of HPV 16 in women with glandular abnormalities in cervical smears did not help differentiating squamous from glandular lesions. However, the detection of HPV 53 in abnormal smears can predict squamous neoplasia, whereas HPV 18 can predict glandular neoplasia as histologic diagnoses.
