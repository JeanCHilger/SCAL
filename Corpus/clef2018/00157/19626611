Importance of specimen type in detecting human papillomavirus DNA from the female genital tract. HPV testing is a valuable tool in cervical cancer screening and efficacy assessment of HPV vaccines. Concordance of specimens from three sites for detection of HPV DNA in the female genital tract was evaluated. At a single visit, the following specimens were collected: an endo-ecto-cervical swab (EEC), labial/vulvar/perineal/perianal swab (LVPP) and cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). Specimens were evaluated with HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18 type- and gene-specific PCR assays. Of the 898 women evaluated at baseline, 232 were HPV PCR positive in at least one specimen. Of these, for HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18, respectively, throughout: (a) 70.4%, 40.0%, 65.3%, and 64.1% tested three-site positive (b) 13.6%, 30.0%, 19.7%, and 18.8% tested two-site positive
