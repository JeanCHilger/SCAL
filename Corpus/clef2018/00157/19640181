Clinical results of the liquid-based cervical cytology tool, Liqui-PREP, in comparison with conventional smears for detection of squamous cell abnormalities. To compare the adequacy and efficacy of the liquid-based cytology tool Liqui-PREP (LP) with the conventional Papanicolaou smear (CS) test, for the screening of squamous cell abnormalities.Data for 2,000 subjects screened with CS and 4,000 different subjects screened with the LP test were compared.LP showed significant decrease in the rate of unsatisfactory smears (P<0.01) and the detection rate for atypical squamous cells was significantly higher (P<0.01). The rate of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion was also higher, but this did not reach statistical significance. The number of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions detected was increased with LP, and the histological correlation of LSIL lesions showed a higher positive-predictive value. The coexistence of abnormal colposcopic findings with abnormal smear results was higher for LP (P<0.004). Furthermore, high-risk HPV-DNA detection was found to be increased in atypical LP smears than in normal LP smears.The liquid-based cytology tool LP detected more squamous cell lesions than CS. Also it reduced the number of unsatisfactory results due to enhanced cell visualization, and improved screening for HPV-DNA.
