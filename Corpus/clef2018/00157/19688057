The increasing frequency of cervical cancer in Korean women under 35. The goal of this study was to determine the clinical and epidemiological trends of cervical cancer in young Korean women. Social behavior including sexual habits has changed in Korean women, with sexual activity commencing at a younger age. These changes are likely to influence certain risk factors of cervical cancer, resulting in changing trends in the occurrence of the disease.The incidence of cervical cancer in women less than 35 years-old between January 1990 and December 2006 was analyzed, and available medical records from January 1996 to December 2006 were reviewed. The clinical, pathological and epidemiologic characteristics and changing trends among these young patients were analyzed.Over the last two decades, the incidence of young (< 35 years) cervical cancer patients increased, more patients had an aggressive form of the disease, and there was a higher rate of women with more advanced education. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was detected in 94.0% of the women (63/67) tested. HPV 16 (82.5%) and HPV 18 (12.7%) were the two most common viral infections detected throughout the study period.The changing trends and risk factors identified suggest a need for more active education of young women about cervical cancer prevention strategies. In addition, young women are strongly recommended to undergo a regular screening test and HPV vaccination.
