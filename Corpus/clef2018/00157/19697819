Preinvasive vulvar and cervical cancer in a 32-year-old woman, DNA HPV 16 positive with mtDNA mutation--case study. Coincidence of preinvasive vulvar and cervical cancer in young women is very rare. Lesions like VIN 3/preinvasive vulvar cancer and CIN 3/preinvasive cervical cancer are strictly connected with viral infection and are multilocular. In the presented case the following tests have been performed: HPV DNA test for the presence of 13 oncogenic HPV types, mRNA HPV test for the presence of transcripts for HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45 and the analysis of mtDNA D-Loop region. In the examined patient HPV 16 infection, as well as the presence of transcripts for HPV 16 E6/7 were diagnosed. The analysis of mtDNA D-Loop region showed nucleotide lesions like: T>C 16.192, T>C 16.223, T>C 16.292, C>T 16.325, C>T 16.579.
