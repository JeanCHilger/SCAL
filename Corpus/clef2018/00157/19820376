Human leukocyte antigens I and II haplotypes associated with human papillomavirus 16-positive invasive cervical cancer in Mexican women. Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), mainly HPV type 16, is the major etiologic factor associated with cervical cancer (CC), but HPV infection alone is not sufficient for progression of precursor lesions. Host genetic susceptibility may lead to abnormal immune response resulting from virus persistence. Several studies have suggested a possible association with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II alleles and CC, but results are not consistent. The association of genetic HLA class I (A and B) and HLA class II (DR*B1 and DQ*B1) haplotypes with HPV16-positive CC (n = 104) and base population controls (n = 104) was evaluated in this Mexican population study. Sequence-specific primer HLA genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods in peripheral blood cell counts (PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotides). The cervical swabs of 208 women were tested for HPV16 by Hybrid Capture II. Allele and haplotype HLA frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg tests, and a haplotype homogeneity test were estimated using the Arlequin software v. 3.01. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated to compare cases and control women. Consistent associations across other studies in women with CC and infected by HPV16 were observed for HLA-DRB1*15 (OR, 3.9 95% CI, 1.6-10.2) and the haplotype DRB1*15 DQB1*0602 (OR, 4.1
