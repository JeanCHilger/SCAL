Preliminary study of vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias. To detect the clinical features of vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias (VIN and VAIN, respectively).Total 148 women were performed vulvar or vaginal coloposcopy-directed biopsy pathology tests, from Sep. 2004 to Dec. 2007.Among 148 women, vulvar or vaginal histologic results were vulvar cancer for 1, VIN or VAIN 2, 3 for 23, VIN or VAIN for 16, condyloma for 61, vulvitis and vaginitis for 47. Eighty-five percent (33/39) women with VIN or VAIN 2, 3 were more than 30 years old. Compared to women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), women with VIN or VAIN were older. The rate of high-risk HPV DNA in women with vulvar or vaginal lesions was 84% (84/100). VAIN occurred mainly in the upper vagina (90%, 69/75). VIN or VAIN often accompanied or followed CIN or cervical cancer (79%, 31/39), and VIN or VAIN 2, 3 often accompanied or followed CIN 2, 3 or cervical cancer (70%, 16/23).Our data suggest that women with high-risk HPV infection are at risk of developing VIN or VAIN 2, 3. The vulva and vagina should be carefully inspected by colposcopic examination at the time of colposcopy for any abnormal findings.
