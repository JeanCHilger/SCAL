Natural history of cervical papilloma virus infection in systemic lupus erythematosus - a prospective cohort study. To ascertain the incidence, cumulative prevalence, persistence, and clearance of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to assess the risk factors for the acquisition and persistence of HPV infection.One hundred forty-four patients with SLE were evaluated at 6-month intervals for up to 3 years. At each visit, a Pap test, a test for HPV DNA, and clinical assessment were performed.The cumulative prevalence of HPV infection increased significantly (12.5% at baseline to 25.0% after 3 years p = 0.006). Regarding type-specific HPV infection, 18.8% patients experienced 68 incident infections. The cumulative prevalence of high-risk HPV infection (11.1% at baseline to 20.8% after 3 yearsHigh frequency of persistent HPV infection, especially high-risk and multiple HPV infection, may explain why squamous intraepithelial lesions occurred frequently in patients with SLE. Patients with high inflammatory burden are at risk of acquiring HPV infection.
