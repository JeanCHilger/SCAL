Major clinical research advances in gynecologic cancer 2009. In this review, we summarized nine major clinical advances in gynecology which occurred in 2009. For cervical cancer, the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) test as a screening test, the efficacy of HPV vaccine for middle-aged women, randomized controlled trial (RCT) regarding concurrent chemoradiation using gemcitabine plus cisplatin, and the efficacy of pazopanib for metastatic or recurrent disease were chosen. For endometrial cancer, the necessity of systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy in early endometrial cancer was reviewed. For ovarian cancer, the timing of treatment initiation for recurrent ovarian cancer, dose-dense chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant treatment, the best chemotherapy regimen for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, and the efficacy of target agents were selected. In addition, the results of RCT testing the benefit of ginger in preventing post-chemotherapy nausea were examined.
