Detection of 14 human papillomavirus genotypes in cervical samples in women from a central-southern area of Italy showing different Pap test results. We evaluated the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and correlated the molecular test results with the cytological examination data (PAP test) in 364 women living in central-southern Italy (Molise region), by means of polymerase chain reaction HPV DNA genotyping and of cervical cytology. One hundred and twenty-eight women resulted HPV positive (35.2%), HPV16 being the most frequent genotype. HPV positive women were significantly younger than negative patients (35.9 +/- 8.4 years and 38.2 +/- 9.1, respectively p = 0.018)
