Human papillomavirus types 16, 18, and 31 serostatus and prostate cancer risk in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Since human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was first identified as a risk factor for cervical cancer, several seroepidemiologic and tissue-based studies have investigated HPV in relation to prostate cancer, another common genitourinary malignancy, with mixed results. To further inform this potential association, we conducted a large, prospective investigation of HPV types 16, 18, and 31 in relation to risk of prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Cases were a sample of men diagnosed with prostate cancer after visit 2 or on their end-of-study biopsy (n = 616). Controls were men not diagnosed with prostate cancer during the trial or on their end-of-study biopsy (n = 616). Controls were frequency matched to cases by age, treatment arm, and family history of prostate cancer. Sera from visit 2 were tested for IgG antibodies against HPV types 16, 18, and 31. No associations were observed for weak or strong HPV-16 [odds ratio (OR), 0.94 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.53-1.64 and OR, 1.07
