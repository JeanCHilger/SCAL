Research on cancer prevention, detection and management in low- and medium-income countries. The burden of cancer in low- and medium-income countries (LMIC) is expected to increase in the next decades. The application of current knowledge and results of research in key areas would contribute to limit the impact of this phenomenon. Opportunities for research on cancer prevention in LMIC include investigating specific circumstances of exposure to known carcinogens and to agents which are not prevalent in other regions, as well as interactions among carcinogens and between genetic and environmental factors. Early detection both by screening and early clinical diagnosis represents an important component of cancer control in LMIC. Research has been carried out to identify effective and sustainable approaches for early detection of cervical cancer through human papillomavirus testing and visual tests and of oral cancer through visual inspection. For other important neoplasms such as breast cancer, on the other hand, no effective low-cost screening methods are currently available. Downstaging represents a potentially important approach for cancer control and a priority area for future research. Studies addressing the efficacy of treatment protocols, country-specific cost-effectiveness of various interventions and the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of innovative heath care and communication technologies represent the priority for clinical cancer research.
