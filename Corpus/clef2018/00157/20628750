Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among women with and without normal cervical histology in Shandong Province, China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes infection in women with and with normal cervical histology in the littoral region of Shandong, China.Scrape specimens were collected from 4,601 women for Pap smear and HPV genotypes identification. 1,489 women without normal cytology or with cervical disease were referred for colposcopic examination and biopsy procedures.The HPV infection in healthy women of the littoral region of Shandong (9.61%) is lower than that observed in previous studies in China and much less than in the high-risk areas. HPV infection prevalence was 14.23% in cervicitis with normal cervical histology, which was significantly lower than that of the women without normal cervical histology (60.12%, P = 0.00). Compared to prevalence of high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes (11.04%) in cervicitis with normal cervical histology, HR HPV genotypes prevalence (59.82%) was significantly higher in women without normal cervical histology (P = 0.003). HPV types 16, 52, 58, and 31 were the most prevalent HPV genotypes found in women without normal cervical histology. No statistical difference was observed for multiple HR HPV genotypes infection between women with and without normal cervical histology (P = 0.892).Compared with prevalence rates for other populations, the prevalence of specific-HPV genotypes infecting women is different in the littoral region of Shandong Province, China.
