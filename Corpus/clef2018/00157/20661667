Polymorphism in exon 4 of TP53 gene associated to HPV 16 and 18 in Mexican women with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common cancer in Mexican women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary but not sufficient for CC development. Furthermore, genetic factors as polymorphisms could be important susceptibility factors. Controversial results regarding TP53 polymorphisms specifically in codon 72 of CC have been reported. In the present work, the exon 4 sequence of TP53 gene in CC and healthy Mexican-mestizo women were analyzed. A group of 111 women with CC and 126 healthy women (control) were included. Peripheral blood cells for polymorphism analysis and cervical scrape for HPV detection were used. PCR of exon 4 of TP53 were subjected to denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis and sequencing. HPV detection was subjected to PCR and sequencing. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Arlequin software. Codon 72 Arg/Arg was the most common SNP detected, and Hardy-Weinberg analysis showed equilibrium in control and CC samples (P>0.05). Wild type sequence of TP53 exon 4 was detected in 66 and 57% in control and CC samples, respectively. For codon 72 Arg/Arg, differences between control and CC women were found (P=0.043). An association between HPV 16/18 infection and 72 Arg/Arg in woman with CC was found (P=0.026). Haplotype GC (codon 36 and 72) was statistically significantly associated with CC (P=0.011). HPV 16 was the most common viral type. Codon 72 Arg/Arg is the most common polymorphism in the Mexican population and could be associated to HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 infection in CC.
