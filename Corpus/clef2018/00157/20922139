GST (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) polymorphisms in the genetic susceptibility of Turkish patients to cervical cancer. This work investigates the role of glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1), and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) enzymes and polymorphisms, which are found in phase II detoxification reactions in the development of cervical cancer.This study was conducted with 46 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and 52 people with no cancer history. Multiplex PCR methods were used to evaluate the GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism. However, the GSTP1 (Ile105Val) gene polymorphism was studied using a PCR-RFLP method. The patient and control groups were compared using a chi-square test with p<0.05.In the patient group, statistical significance was determined for gravidity (p=0.03), parity (p=0.01), and the number of living children (p=0.01) compared to the control group. The gene frequency of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms was evaluated. We observed that GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotype frequencies were 54.3% and 32.6% respectively, while GSTP1 (Ile/Val), (Ile/Ile), (Val/Val) genotype frequencies were 52%, 44%, and 4%, respectively, in the cervical cancer patients. No statistical variation was determined between the control and patient groups in terms of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms (p>0.05).Our results demonstrate that GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms are not associated with cervical cancer in Turkish patients.
