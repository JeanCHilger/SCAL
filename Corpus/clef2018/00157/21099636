ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 117: Gynecologic care for women with human immunodeficiency virus. The increased use of screening tests has led to the identification of large numbers of women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Consequently, there is an increased role for obstetrician-gynecologists in caring for infected women. Women infected with HIV are living longer, healthier lives and, therefore, the need for routine gynecologic care has increased. The purpose of this document is to educate clinicians about routine HIV screening practices as well as basic women's health screening and care, family planning, and preconception care for women who are infected with HIV.
