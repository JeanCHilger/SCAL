HPV testing for cervical cancer screening appears more cost-effective than Papanicolau cytology in Mexico. To determine the incremental costs and effects of different HPV testing strategies, when compared to Papanicolau cytology (Pap), for cervical cancer screening in Mexico.A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) examined the specific costs and health outcomes associated with (1) no screening (2) only the Pap testScreening women between the ages of 30-80 for cervical cancer using clinical-HPV testing or the combination of clinical-HPV testing, and the Pap is always more cost-effective than using the Pap test alone.This CEA indicates that HPV testing could be a cost-effective screening alternative for a large health delivery organization such as IMSS. These results may help policy-makers implement HPV testing as part of the IMSS cervical cancer screening program.
