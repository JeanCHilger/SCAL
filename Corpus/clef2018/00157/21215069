Study on the relations between high risk human papillomavirus and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in married women from Beijing. To investigate the prevalence and relationship between high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in married women from Beijing.From March 2007 to September 2008, a total of 6185 married women were sampled, covering 137 communities in 12 districts. The samples were screened by high-risk HPV DNA test (HC2) and cytological test. For those participants with cytological test results â‰¥ ASCUS, pathological tests were performed. An interview was also carried out with the same questionnaire. Results from the tests were inputted into the database twice using EpiData 3.0, reviewed, analyzed, using SPSS 15.0.(1) The prevalence rates of HR-HPV and CIN were 9.9% and 6.0%, respectively for the age group 25 to 54. (2) The peak age groups for HR-HPV and CIN prevalence rates were 30 to 34 years old. (3) The prevalence rates of positive cytology (40.3%) and CIN (30.4%) in HR-HPV positive female population were significantly higher than that in HR-HPV negative group. (4) Data from unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that, when comparing with the normal subjects, the risk odds ratios of HR-HPV with low grade CIN and cervical cancer/high grade CIN were 8.385 and 97.416 and the attributable risk proportions with these groups were 88.1% and 99.0%, respectively.HR-HPV infection seemed to be the main risk factor for CIN. Married women, from age group 30 - 34, were under the high risk group in both HR-HPV infection and CIN incidence.
