Repeat low-grade squamous intraepithelial cytology with unsatisfactory colposcopy treated by the loop electrosurgical excision procedure: a retrospective study. To evaluate the value of the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for repeat low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) with unsatisfactory colposcopy and the outcomes of postconization.We performed LEEP in 136 patients and followed them up with colposcopy, cytology, and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) detection using Hybrid Capture II (HCII).55.1% of women had CIN 1 in the specimen, 17.6% had CIN 2-3, and 27.2% had no lesion. The sensitivity of detecting persistent/recurrent disease can reach 90.9% when positive post-treatment HR-HPV or first abnormal cervical cytology after LEEP are found, and the specificity is 95.3% when positive post-treatment HR-HPV coexisting with first abnormal cervical cytology after LEEP are detected.Repeat LSIL with unsatisfactory colposcopy implies a significant risk of CIN 2-3. LEEP is a rational option to those patients with high-risk HPV infection or dysplastic endocervical curettage. Post-treatment follow-up of patients should include both cytology and HR-HPV testing.
