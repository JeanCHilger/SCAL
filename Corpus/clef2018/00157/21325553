Comparison of clinical performance of Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV test with that of hybrid capture 2 assay in a screening setting. Randomized trials have produced sound evidence about the efficacy of screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality. We evaluated the clinical performance and reproducibility of the Abbott RealTime High Risk (HR) HPV test compared with that of the HR hybrid capture 2 (HC2) assay as assessed by a noninferiority score test. A random sample of 998 cervical specimens (914 specimens of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia less severe than grade 2 [<CIN2] and 84 specimens of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe lesions [â‰¥CIN2]), collected in the Florence and Catania cervical Cancer Screening Programs from women aged 25 to 64 and already tested by HR HC2, were retested with the Abbott RealTime HR HPV test. Absolute specificity was 92.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.4 to 94.0) and 92.6% (95% CI, 90.7 to 94.2) for the Abbott RealTime HR HPV test and the HR HC2, respectively. Absolute sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI, 89.9 to 99.3) and 97.6% (95% CI, 91.7 to 99.7) for the Abbott RealTime HR HPV test and the HR HC2, respectively. The noninferiority score test revealed that the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott RealTime HR HPV test were not inferior (P = 0.004 and 0.009, respectively) to those of HR HC2. Overall agreement between the two assays was 96.5%, with a k value of 0.86 (CI 95%, 0.82 to 0.91). We evaluated the intralaboratory reproducibility by retesting 521 samples at least 4 weeks after the first test the crude agreement between the first and second test was 98.5%, with an overall k value of 0.97 (CI 95%, 0.95 to 0.99). This test fully satisfies the requirements of a primary cervical cancer screening test. This assay differentiates between HPV16, HPV18, and non-HPV16/18 types in every specimen, but how to use this information in a screening setting still is unclear.
