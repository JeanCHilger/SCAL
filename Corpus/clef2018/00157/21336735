Correlation of polymorphism of IL-8 and MMP-7 with occurrence and lymph node metastasis of early stage cervical cancer. The IL-8 and MMP-7 genes participate in the carcinogenesis of many malignancies, but the role of both genes in cervical cancer is not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of IL-8 and MMP-7 gene mutations and to assess their effects on the risk of early stage cervical cancer and lymph node metastasis. The clinical stage and histological grade of cervical cancer were also studied. The peripheral blood from the patients with early stage cervical cancers and normal controls was collected and the DNA was extracted. The incidence of IL-8 and MMP-7 gene mutations was assessed by using tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The data were statistically analyzed by x2 test. The results showed that: (1) The genotype frequency of IL-8 -251AT and TT was significantly higher in the cervical cancer group than in the normal control group (OR=2.290 and 2.619 respectively, P=0.001), and it was also higher in the lymphatic metastasis group than that without metastasis (OR=2.917, P=0.035) (2) The frequency of MMP-7 -181G/G genotype was significantly higher in the cervical cancer group and in the lymphatic metastasis group (P<0.05)
