Diseases caused by human papilloma viruses. Human papilloma viruses are responsible for a large number of benign and malignant lesions of the skin. HPV 6 and 11 cause up to 90 % of condylomata. Almost each cervical cancer is associated with HPV. HPV 16 und 18 induce up to 70 % of cervical neoplasias. The vaccination against HPV is internationally implemented and should be applied to young girls aged 12 to 17 according to STIKO criteria. The vaccination may reduce the rate of cervical cancer by 70 % and the rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by 50 %. Many studies demonstrated the efficacy and safetyness of both vaccines. Gardasil (®) offers protection against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18, Cervarix (®) against HPV 16 and 18. Protection against condylomata is offered by the quadrivalent vaccine in 90 %. The bivalent vaccine has demonstrated type-specific protection against the five most frequent cancer inducing types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45). The production of VLPs is an innovative technology. A comparison of both vaccines, Cervarix (®) and Gardasil (®), showed a higher immunogenicity for Cervarix (®). In Germany the immunization rates are still low comparing to other countries. As a method for secondary prevention of cervical cancer the PAP smear is still an effective method.
