Study on subtype of human papillomavirus infection among aged 25 - 54 reproductive women in Beijing from 2006 to 2008. To investigate subtype of HPV infection among women at age of 25 to 54 years in Beijing.From Sept. 2006 to Dec. 2008, 5552 reproductive women at age of 25 to 54 years classified into each 5-year as group were screened. Each participant completed a questionnaire and a sample of exfoliated cervical cells for liquid-based cytology and HPV subtype gene testing was performed.The overall prevalence of HPV was 6.68% (371/5552). High-risk HPV and Low-risk HPV prevalence were 5.76% (320/5552) and 2.00% (111/5552), respectively. The most common HPV types were HPV16 (2.61%, 145/5552), HPV58 (0.97%, 54/5552), HPV33 (0.85%, 47/5552), HPV43 (0.74%, 41/5552) and HPV56 (0.70%, 39/5552). There were two peaks of HPV prevalence: groups of 30 - 34 years and 40 - 44 years.The most common HPV subtypes in Beijing were HPV 16, 58, 33 and 43 and HPV prevalence showed a bi-modal age-specific curve.
