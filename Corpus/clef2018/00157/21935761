HPV-associated squamous cell carcinogenesis. About 7-8% of all human cancers are thought to be related to infections with high-risk (HR) human papilloma virus (HPV). Besides cervical cancer, especially squamous cell carcinomas of the anogenital and oropharyngeal regions are associated with HR-HPV. Transmission of HPV is due to sexual activity. Harald zur Hausen was awarded in 2008 with the Nobel price in medicine for the establishment of a causal link between certain HPV infections and cervical cancer. Meanwhile potent prophylactic vaccines are available to prevent infections with HPV-16 and HPV-18, the two most frequently observed HR HPV types worldwide. On molecular grounds a persistent HPV infection is the central risk factor for the development of HPV-associated neoplasias. Continued expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes disrupts cell cycle control mechanisms in infected cells, thereby gaining limitless proliferative capacity and resistance against apoptotic signals. However acquisition of mutations and genomic instability might cause malignant transformation in these cells.
