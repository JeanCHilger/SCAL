Prevalence and determinants of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in women with high socioeconomic status in Seoul, Republic of Korea. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in women of high socioeconomic status (SES) in Seoul, Republic of Korea and to identify risk factors. This study included 13,386 women visiting a prestigious healthcare center located in Seoul between 2003 and 2008. High-risk HPV infections were detected in 994 (7%) and the age-standardized prevalence was 8%. Abnormal Pap smear results â‰¥ atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS) were observed in 280 of 12,080 women (2%). Based on univariate analysis, age, level of education and number of children were associated with high-risk HPV infections. Based on multivariate analysis, age and high-risk HPV infections had an inverse relationship. In women with high SES in Seoul, the prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was 7% and the age-standardized prevalence was 8%. Age was a strong determinant of high-risk HPV infection.
