BK-virus infections: a literature review. BK-virus is a very common polyomavirus in the global population, similar to the JC-virus responsible for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. BK-virus infections are an important diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in immuno-compromised patients, including: bone marrow transplant pediatric recipients in whom it may cause hemorrhagic cystitis, renal transplant recipients in whom it may cause interstitial nephropathy leading to graft loss, and in HIV infected patients in whom it may cause some types of encephalitis. Indeed, this poorly documented virus is responsible for infections with various clinical profiles, probably under-diagnosed, but could also be involved in the genesis of some cancers, especially cervix and prostate cancer. We reviewed the latest published data on this virus focusing on its possible pro-oncogenic properties. We also listed the diseases in which it is involved, with an emphasis on rare and insufficiently investigated entities. Finally, we studied the new tools available for diagnosis and treatment, and their importance in current practice.
