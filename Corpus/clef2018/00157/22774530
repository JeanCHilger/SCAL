Prognostic value of human papilloma virus DNA test in patients surgically treated for squamous cell cervical cancer. The human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA test was performed in paraffinized biopsy samples of iliac lymph nodes obtained from 98 patients with cervical cancer receiving therapy in N. N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in 2000 to 2007. The data obtained was compared to patients clinical course. The HPV DNA was detected in 29 of 98 patients samples (29,6%), 27 of those patients had metastatic disease. These patients had significantly higher metastasis rate than HPV DNA-negative patients (p < or = 0,05). The following highly oncogenic genotypes of HPV DNA were detected: type 16 in 15 patients (51,72%), type 18 in 4 patients (13,79%), type 31 in 5 patients (17,24%) and type 33 in 5 patients (17,24%). In all the cases the HPV type detected in the lymph nodes corresponded to the one detected in the primary tumor. The relapse-free survival of HPV DNA-positive patients with iliac lymph nodes metastases (N1) was significantly lower than in HPV DNA-negative patients (p < or = 0,05). The iliac lymph nodes HPV DNA detection had 43,6% sensitivity (95% CI: 28/60%) and 79,7% specificity (95% CI: 67/89%) for relapse prediction. The test results had diagnostic value in 65,3% of cases, the test was false-negative in 56,4% and false-positive in 20,3% of cases.
