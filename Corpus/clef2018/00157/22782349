Cervical human papillomavirus and HIV infection in women of child-bearing age in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 2010. We sought to document the association of Human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and immunodeficiency with oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection in women with no cervical neoplastic lesions identified through a cervical cancer screening programme in Côte d'Ivoire.A consecutive sample of women stratified on their HIV status and attending the national blood donor clinic or the closest HIV clinic was recruited during a cervical cancer screening programme based on the visual inspection. Diagnosis of HPV infection and genotype identification were based on the Linear Array HPV test.A total of 445 (254 HIV-positive and 191 HIV-negative) women were included. The prevalence of oncogenic HPV infection was 53.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47.9-59.9) in HIV-positive women and 33.7% (95% CI 27.1-40.3) in HIV-negative women (odds ratio (OR)=2.3 (95% CI 1.5-3.3)). In multivariate analysis, HIV-positive women with a CD4 count <200 cells mm(3) or between 200 and 499 cells mm(3) were more likely to harbour an oncogenic HPV compared with women with a CD4 count ≥500 cells mm(3) with OR of 2.8 (95% CI 1.1-8.1) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.9), respectively.A high prevalence of oncogenic HPV was found in women with no cervical neoplastic lesions, especially in HIV-positive women. Despite antiretroviral use, immunodeficiency was a main determinant of the presence of oncogenic HPV.
