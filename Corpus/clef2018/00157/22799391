Evidence-based screening, early diagnosis and treatment strategy of cervical cancer for national policy in low- resource countries: example of India. Cervical cancer remains the most frequent cancer in women from the developing world. More than 88% of deaths occur in low-income countries, and it is predicted to climb to 91.5% by 2030. Although Pap-based screening programmes have shown to be effective in reducing the disease burden in high-resource countries, implementation and sustention of cytology-based programmes is quite challenging in low-resource settings. The present paper reviews evidence-based alternatives of screening methods, triaging algorithm, treatment of cervical precancerous lesions, and age-group at screening appropriate for low-income countries. Evidence shows that visual inspection methods using diluted acid acetic or Lugol's iodine, and HPV-DNA testing are more sensitive tests than the Pap-smear screening test. Visual inspection allows an immediate result and, when appropriate, may be immediately followed by cryotherapy, the so called "screen-and-treat" approach, achieved in a single visit, by trained nurses and midwives. Examples of cervical cancer prevention programmes in India and selected low-income countries are given.
