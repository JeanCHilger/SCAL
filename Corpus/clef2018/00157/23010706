Follow-up outcomes in a large cohort of patients with human papillomavirus-negative ASC-H cervical screening test results. Limited follow-up data are available on patients with cervical cytology results of atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude a high-grade intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), who test negative for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). Between June 2005 and December 2010, 885 patients were identified with ThinPrep results of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) hrHPV-negative cervical ASC-H liquid-based cytology and follow-up histopathology or cytology results extending to September 2011. Of the 885 patients with available follow-up results, 549 (62.0%) had at least 1 histopathologic result during the entire follow-up period, whereas 336 (38.0%) had only cytologic follow-up documented. In an average follow-up period of 29 months, 14 (1.6%) of 885 patients with HPV-negative ASC-H results showed evidence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3). No cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed. Four of 14 patients with HPV-negative ASC-H results with follow-up diagnoses of CIN2/3 had a history of earlier CIN2/3 diagnoses before HPV-negative ASC-H results. Follow-up of patients with HPV-negative ASC-H results using methods specified in this study yielded low rates of detectible CIN2/3 and no diagnoses of cervical cancer. Triage of study patients with HPV-negative ASC-H results to routine HPV and cytology cotesting at 1 year was a safe follow-up option.
