MBL serum concentration in women with HPV presenting CIN III lesions. This study proposes to assess MBL serum concentrations in HPV positive women that developed high risk preinvasive lesions, CIN III.A total of 90 consecutive women (mean age 32.2 years, range 18-45 years) with CIN III lesions confirmed by cone biopsy were enrolled as cases at the gynecology cancer department of the Erasto Gaertner Hospital, a center of reference for cancer treatment in Southern Brazil. All the patients were HPV positive. In addition, 81 healthy women, voluntary blood donors, were enrolled as healthy control subjects (mean age 33.3 years, range 14-71 years) with no evidence of HPV infection, tested by hybrid capture, or CIN lesions, from the same geographic area.The median concentration of MBL in the cases was 912 ng/ml (IQR: 100-5820 ng/ml) and in the controls was 1207.3 ng/ml (IQR 100-4320.6 ng/ml). No statistically significant difference was observed between cases and controls.This study reports data on MBL serum concentrations in HPV infected women for the first time. The analysis of our findings did not show a statistically significant difference between MBL serum concentrations in HPV women that developed CIN III lesions and healthy controls.
