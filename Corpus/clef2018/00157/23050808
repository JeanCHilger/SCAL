Cytology and human papillomavirus screening test results associated with 2827 histopathologic diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3. Cervical screening in the United States increasingly involves newer US Food and Drug Administration-approved cytologic methods and adjunctive high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA testing.To document cervical screening test performance preceding histopathologic cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 diagnoses.Preceding screening test results with computer-imaged, liquid-based cytology (LBC) and hrHPV results were analyzed for 2827 patients with histopathologic CIN 2/3 diagnoses.Of 2827 patients with CIN 2/3 diagnoses, 2074 (73.4%) had system LBC findings within 4 months of CIN 2/3 diagnoses: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n = 862 41.6%), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (n = 464Patients with histopathologic CIN 2/3 had recent abnormal LBC results, most often, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Among cotested patients, 97.4% (786 of 807) tested hrHPV(+). However, a significant number of patients tested during an extended period of several years had earlier negative Papanicolaou or negative HPV test results, suggesting the recent development of some CIN 2/3 lesions and supporting the value of cotesting for enhanced detection of other developing, small, inaccessible, or nondiagnostic precursor lesions.
