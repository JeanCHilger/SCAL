Relationship between cervical disease and infection with human papillomavirus types 16 and 18, and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV, particularly Type HPV 16 and 18, is necessary in the development of cervical cancer, but apart from HPV infection, other causative factors of most cervical cancers remain unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HPV 16 and HPV 18 and HSV 1 and HSV 2 in cervical samples, and to assess the role of HSVs in cervical carcinogenesis. Two hundred thirty-three healthy controls and 567 cases (333 of cervicitis, 210 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and 24 of squamous cell carcinoma) in cervical exfoliative cells were tested for HPV 16, HPV 18, HSV 1, and HSV 2 DNA using the triplex real-time polymerase chain reaction method. In contrast to healthy women, positive rate of HPV is related significantly to cervical lesions (odds ratios (ORs)â€‰= 4.1, P < 0.01 for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ORs = 24.9, P < 0.01 for squamous cell carcinoma), but not cervicitis (ORs = 2.3, P > 0.05). HSV 2 prevalence in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma was higher than in healthy women (ORs = 4.9, P < 0.05 for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
