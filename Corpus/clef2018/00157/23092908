Association of TP53 codon 72 polymorphism with susceptibility to ovarian carcinomas in Serbian women. Finding a potential genetic factor associated with a deadly disease, such as ovarian carcinoma, is of particular importance. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism in ovarian carcinoma development in Serbian women.47 wild-type TP53 gene ovarian carcinoma samples and 70 cervical smears from gynecologically healthy women were analyzed. DNA was extracted by a salting-out procedure. Codon 72 polymorphism was assessed by PCR-RFLP method. Ï‡(2), Fisher exact test and odds ratio were used for statistical analysis.The distribution of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes of codon 72 of the TP53 gene was: 46.8%, 46.8% and 6.4%, respectively in the ovarian carcinomas and 64.3%, 31.4% and 4.3%, respectively in the control group. We observed an increased risk for the development of ovarian carcinoma for Pro homozygotes in relation to heterozygotes plus Arg homozygotes (OR=1.52 95% CI 0.29-7.89) and a higher one for Pro/Pro plus Arg/Pro genotype in relation to Arg homozygotes (OR=2.04The results showed no association between codon 72 TP53 gene polymorphism and risk for development of ovarian carcinoma in Serbian women. However, this observation requires further analysis of a larger case-control study group.
