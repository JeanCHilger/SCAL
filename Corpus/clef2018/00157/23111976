The immunohistochemical detection of P16 and HPV L1 capsid protein on cell block sections from residual PapSpin liquid-based gynecology cytology specimens as a diagnostic and prognostic tool. Immunohistochemical staining for p16INK4a (p16) and HPV L1 capsid protein (HPV L1) are a useful ancillary technique for diagnosing preneoplastic lesions of the cervix in histologic specimens. The purpose of the current study was to examine the usefulness of p16 and HPV L1 immunolocalization in PapSpin Liquid-Based Gynecology Cytology Specimens (PapSpin cytology) derived cell block material in the diagnosis and prognosis of preneoplastic lesions of the cervix.The cervical cytologic smears of 64 patients who underwent colposcopic biopsy our Center were retrospectively evaluated. The cervical cytologic smears have been previously assessed by the PapSpin cytology and cell blocks were prepared from these samples. Immunohistochemical staining p16 and HPV L1 was performed on paraffin-embedded cell blocks of 64 PapSpin cytology specimens.The positive staining of the cell blocks for P16 was directly proportional to the degree of intraepithelial lesion. In cases with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), the positive staining of p16 was found to be statistically significant. In contrast, with the increasing degree of the lesion, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the HPV L1 positivity.Immunohistochemical p16 and HPV L1 studies on cell block may increase the diagnostic accuracy of cervical cytology. When p16 and HPV L1 are immunohistochemically applied together on the cell blocks, they can provide information about the prognosis of cervical intraepithelial lesions.
