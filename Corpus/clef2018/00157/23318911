The protein levels of MCM7 and p63 in evaluating lesion severity of cervical disease. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship among the protein levels of MCM7, p63, and human papillomavirus (HPV) in different cervical lesion tissues and appraise their predictive value in evaluating severity of cervical disease.Twelve normal cervix or chronic cervicitis, 42 squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 53 cervical carcinoma tissues were enrolled, and the protein levels of MCM7, p63, and HPV were detected by immunohistochemistry.The positive examination rates of all the MCM7, p63, and HPV proteins increased gradually and significantly from normal cervix and chronic cervicitis tissues, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to cervical carcinomas, respectively. As to predict high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and carcinogenesis is concerned, the MCM7 protein had a sensitivity of 94.0%, a specificity of 56.5%, a positive predictive value of 88.8%, and a negative predictive value of 72.2%. The p63 protein had a sensitivity of 78.6%, a specificity of 81.8%, a positive predictive value of 94.3%, and a negative predictive value of 50.0%. Protein level of MCM7 was positively correlated with that of p63 in cervical tissues (r = 0.806, P < 0.01), and the p63 was also positively correlated with histopathologic type (P < 0.05).Protein levels of MCM7 and p63 were associated significantly with high-grade cervical lesion, and aberrant p63 protein level may distinguish different histopathologic types of cervical carcinoma. They may act as co-predictive index in both HPV-dependent and HPV-independent high-grade cervical lesion with high sensitivity and specificity.
