Prevalence of type-specific human papillomavirus and pap results in Chinese women: a multi-center, population-based cross-sectional study. To estimate the burden of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among sexually active women in China.We conducted a multi-center, population-based study between May 2006 and April 2007. A total of 4,215 women aged 17-54 years were surveyed from five geographical sites: Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Henan, and Xinjiang. Direct endocervical exfoliated cells were collected from consenting participants for Sure Path liquid-based cytology (BD) and HPV testing. HPV testing was performed with Hybrid Capture II (Qiagen) with high-risk and low-risk probes, and Linear Array (Roche) was utilized for HPV genotyping.Approximately 11 % of the study population had a cytological abnormality (ASCUS or worse). HPV prevalence in the entire study population was 14.3 % (age-standardized to the world standard female population 14.5 %). The most prevalent types found were HPV16 (2.9 %), HPV52 (1.7 %), HPV58 (1.5 %), HPV33 (1 %), and HPV18 (0.8 %). Patterns of HPV prevalence differed by age, geographic region, and cytology findings. However, HPV16 was predominant among all grades of cytological abnormalities for all areas.Although HPV18 appeared to be less frequent among population-based samples of China, given the high prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or worse pap abnormalities, prophylactic HPV16/18 vaccines should substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer in China.
