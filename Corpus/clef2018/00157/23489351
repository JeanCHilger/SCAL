Emerging biomarkers in the detection, diagnosis and management of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma. Despite the success of widespread screening, cervical cancers continue to occur. Recently, the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis has been firmly established. HPV prophylactic vaccines are expected to eradicate âˆ¼ 70% of cervical cancers. An HPV test was demonstrated to improve the sensitivity of cytology and prolong the screening interval safely. Type-specific HPV testing will play an important role in the detection and follow up of cervical neoplastic lesions, as well as monitoring the efficacy of HPV vaccines. The combined use of cell proliferation markers with cytology can improve sensitivity, and some molecular markers seem to be related to the degree of dysplasia. Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of biomarkers in clinical settings.
