Cervical tuberculosis masquerading as cancer cervix: a report of three cases. Tuberculosis is still frequently observed in third world countries like Africa and Asia. Here we report three cases of genital tuberculosis with variable presentations. First case was a lady of reproductive age group who presented with polymenorrhea and post-coital bleeding with unhealthy cervix. Histopathology of cervical tissue revealed tubercular cervicitis. Second and third cases presented with different complaints like discharge per vaginum, post-coital bleeding and pain in lower abdomen with growth over the cervix. Cervical biopsy was inconclusive of tuberculosis but endometrial tissue sampling for TB PCR was positive. This shows that newer diagnostic marker test can help us to detect secondary genital tuberculosis.
