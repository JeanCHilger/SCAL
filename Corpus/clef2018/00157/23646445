Prevalence of HPV-DNA in Pap smears containing ASC and AGC performed within Population Programme of Prophylaxis and Early Detection of Early Cervical Cancer. to assess the incidence of HPV -DNA in women with ASC/AGC compared to patients with normal Pap smears.The study group consisted of 242 women (207 ASC and 35 AGC cases). The control group counted 200 age-matched women with negative Pap smears. Cervical samples collected from all the participants were tested for the presence of HPV-DNA using the Hybrid Capture-2 test.Total HPV infection was significantly higher in the study than in the control group (43.0% vs.14.0%) (p=0.005). There was no difference in the incidence of HPV -DNA between ASC and AGC groups. Prevalence of HPV-DNA ASC-H was significantly higher in ASC-US group (83.3% vs. 40.5%) (p=0.004). HPV positive endometrial AGC significantly outnumbered HPV positive endocervical AGC (88.9% vs. 26.9%) (p=0.003). Similar trends were observed for the high-risk type of HPV (p<0.001).The significant difference in HPV -DNA incidence between the study and control groups suggests that HPV plays a role in the development of ASC and AGC. The implementation of HPV testing in all women diagnosed with ASC or AGC can lead to tailored therapeutic management and more careful follow-up care.
