Comparison on the predictive values of four screening methods regarding cervical cancer. To compare the predictive values of 5% acetic acid stain and visual inspection, human papillomavirus (HPV) Self test, ThinPrep Pap and HPV direct test in screening for cervical cancer with biopsy as gold standard. Positive predictive values and negative predictive values were compared simultaneously by joint hypothesis tests and then either positive predictive values or negative predictive values of the any two screening tests were compared by marginal regression based on both GEE and weighted least square methods. Hochberg method was used for multiplicity adjustment. It was showed that HPV direct test had the highest negative predictive value and ThinPrep Pap the highest positive predictive value. 5% acetic acid stain and visual inspection had both the lowest positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Both HPV direct test and ThinPrep Pap were efficient, but the latter required compatible infrastructure and skilled caregivers to go with. Both 5% acetic acid stain and visual inspection were inexpensive, and their positive predictive value and negative predictive value were lower than HPV self-test. They also had similar positive predictive value with HPV direct test and similar negative predictive value with ThinPrep Pap. HPV self-test appeared to be efficient, suggesting that it had significant potential for screening program to be implemented in the rural areas of China since the test could be performed without speculum examination in low-resource regions.
