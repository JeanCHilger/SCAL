Role of HPV16/18/45 DNA testing of cervical specimens as a triage testing in cervical cancer screening. To evaluate the clinical performance of careHPV16/18/45 DNA testing of cervical specimens as a triage testing for women with positive findings during the cervical cancer screening.Eligible women aged 25-65 years were enrolled from two high-risk communities in Yangcheng County,Shanxi Province.After providing written informed consent on a voluntary base,women underwent questionnaire-based interview,gynecological examination,and sample collection.Hybrid capture 2 technology(HC2),careHPV,Avantage HPV E6 test,and visual inspection with acetic acid(VIA)were conducted as the primary screening tests at the enrollment visit.Women with any positive finding were invited to receive a second VIA and colposcopy.careHPV16/18/45 was performed as a triage testing.Any visible lesion under colposcopy was directly biopsied.Women with pathology confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and worse(CIN2+)were treated with standard procedures.For the self-collected and doctor-collected samples,the application of careHPV16/18/45 as a triage testing decreased the colposcopy referral to 3.2% and 3.1%,respectively.Meanwhile,the sensitivity,specificity,and positive predictive value(PPV)for CIN2+were 50.0%,97.6%,and 26.7% for women with positive self-sampling careHPV results and 63.0%,97.9%,and 34.0% for women with positive doctor-sampling careHPV results.careHPV16/18/45 is promising as a triage testing among women with positive screening findings in low-resource settings.
