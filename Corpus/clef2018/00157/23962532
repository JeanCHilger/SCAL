Is there a lack of information on HPV vaccination given by health professionals to young women? The aim of this survey is to compare the main sources of information about vaccination against Human papillomavirus (HPV) of young women aged over-18 and under-18 years.A multicenter study was carried out in Italy through the administration of a questionnaire. Univariate analyses were conducted to evaluate possible differences between age groups and different locations (chi-square test and Fisher test where possible).The sample consisted of 987 young women. The main sources of information about HPV vaccination are represented by magazines/books (23.1%) and TV (20.5%) for the over-18s, while for the under-18s the sources are general practitioners (22.6%) and pediatricians (15.4%). The over-18s with health professionals as parents consult mostly gynecologists (27.7%) and general practitioners (20.5%).This study highlights lack of information on HPV vaccination given by health professionals to young women and underlines the need to improve education about cervical cancer, prevention and HPV vaccination.
