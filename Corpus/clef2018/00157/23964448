Accuracy of abnormal pap smear at Thammasat University Hospital. The aim of the present study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the Pap smear in the diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Pap smear of 15,345 women in 2 years were screened for early detection of abnormal cervix. In 299 cases (1.9%) were diagnosed as low-grade SIL (LSIL), high-grade SIL (HSIL) and SCC by the Bethesda system (TBS) 2001. Only 195 cases (1.3%) had definitive histologic diagnosis as negative, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN 2, CIN 3 and SCC. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in LSIL was 86.5%, 70% and 71.3%, respectively. For HSIL it was 80.8%, 89.7% and 86.2%, respectively. For SCC it was 100%, 96.9% and 96.9%, respectively. Our data had high diagnostic performance for HSIL and SCC group and moderate diagnostic performance for LSIL group.
