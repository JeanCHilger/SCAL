Cervical cancer rates after the transition from annual Pap to 3-year HPV and Pap. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) introduced 3-year Pap and human papillomavirus DNA cotesting for cervical cancer screening in women 30 years or older in 2003 to 2004. Patient and provider willingness to extend screening intervals and the impact on annual cervical cancer incidence after interval extension are evaluated.Age-adjusted cervical cancer rates and screening intervals were calculated from KPNC Regional Laboratory databases and Northern California Cancer Registry from 2000 to 2009.The median screening interval between negative cotests was 36 months compared to the 16 months after a negative Pap test alone before the implementation of cotesting. The age-adjusted invasive cancer rate was 6.5 per 100,000 women in 2000 and 6.3 in 2009 there was no difference in the rates of cervical cancer in women 30 years or older from 2000 to 2009 (p(trend) = .7).Patients and providers were compliant with the extension of screening intervals with cotesting. Cervical cancer rates remained constant during the 10-year study period despite extending screening intervals after a negative cotest.
