Induction of heparanase by HPV E6 oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are highly invasive however the identity of downstream effectors responsible for their aggressive phenotype remains underinvestigated. Here, we report that HPV-mediated up-regulation of heparanase enzyme can provide mechanistic explanation for augmented invasiveness of HPV-positive HNSCCs. Heparanase is the sole mammalian enzyme (endo-Î²-d-glucuronidase) degrading heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan, key polysaccharide of the extracellular matrix. Cleavage of heparan sulphate by heparanase leads to disassembly of extracellular barriers, enabling local invasion and metastatic spread of the tumour, and releases heparan sulphate-bound growth factors from the extracellular depots. Heparanase is tightly implicated in head and neck cancer progression
