Association between aerobic vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis and squamous intraepithelial lesion of low grade. To determine frequency of HPV infection, aerobic vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis in respondents with squamous intraepithelial lesion of lower grade comparing to respondents with normal PAP test results.Prospective research of 100 respondents has been conducted at University-Clinic Center Tuzla and Gynecology and Obstetrics Department at Primary Health Care Center Tuzla in period from May 2011 untill January 2012. Examination program included: anamnesis, clinical gynecological examination, HPV typization, microbiological examination of vaginal and cervical smear and PAP test.High risk HPV group has been found more frequently among the respondents with LG SIL 46% (23) than in those with normal PAP result 14% (7) p < 0.05. Aerobic vaginitis has been found in the respondents with LG SIL in 28% (14) and there is statistically significant difference of this vaginitis comparing to the respondents with normal PAP result (p < 0.05). Bacterial vaginosis has been found in 12% (6) of the respondents with LG SIL and in 4% (2) of those with normal PAP result which is not statistically significant. In women with LG SIL and aerobic vaginitis in 9 cases E. coli has been isolated, in 4 E. faecalis and in 1 Staphylococcus aureus, while in women with normal PAP test results 3 cases of E.coli have been isolated. Examining changes in pH value of vaginal environment, higher measured values have been found in the respondents with LG SIL- 5.26 while in the respondents with normal PAP test result was 4.94 (p < 0.05). There is also statistically significant increase in the number of leukocytes in the respondents with LG SIL in relation to those with normal result.In women with LG SIL aerobic vaginitis is very common but is not an indicator of HPV infection. An adequate treatment of aerobic vaginitis would decrease the frequency of LG SIL and number of precancerous lesions which may
