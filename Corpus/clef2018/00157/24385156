Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in esophageal and cervical cancers in the high incidence area for the two diseases from 2007 to 2009 in Linzhou of Henan Province, Northern China. The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer has been well established. However, it is inconclusive whether HPV plays the same role in esophageal carcinogenesis. In this study, we detected HPV infection in 145 frozen esophageal tissues, including 30 normal epithelium (ENOR), 37 dysplasia (DYS) and 78 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and in 143 frozen cervical tissues composed of 30 normal epithelium (CNOR), 38 intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 75 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). The patients and symptom-free subjects enrolled in this study were from a high-incidence area for both ESCC and CSCC, Linzhou City, Northern China, from 2007 to 2009. The HPV infection analysis was conducted by using an HPV GenoArray Test Kit. We found that the high-risk HPV types accounted for more than 90 % of the HPV-positive lesions of esophagus and cervix tissues. The prevalence of high-risk HPV types increased significantly during the progression of both esophageal and cervical carcinogenesis (positive rate in esophageal tissues: 33 % ENOR, 70 % in DYS and 69 % in ESCC positive rate in cervical tissues: 27 % in CNOR, 82 % in CIN and 88 % in CSCC
