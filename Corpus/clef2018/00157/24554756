Testing and genotyping of high-risk human papillomavirus by the cobas HPV Test and the Hybrid Capture 2 high-risk HPV DNA test using cervical and vaginal samples. The accurate detection and typing of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) are critical for cervical cancer screening. The Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2) and cobas HPV tests showed high agreement for cervical samples (94.4%, κ=0.72, n=693) and moderate agreement for vaginal samples (κ=0.62, n=108). The HPV16 and HPV18 results were highly consistent between the cobas and Linear Array tests (κ≥0.96, n=197). Three hc2-negative vaginal samples were repeatedly invalid by the cobas test due to β-globin control failures, highlighting amplification control benefits. No cross-contamination was detected in a challenge experiment.
