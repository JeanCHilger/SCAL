Value assessment of high-risk HPV test and TCT in the screening of cervical carcinoma. To estimate the status of coincidence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) test and thinprep cytology test(TCT) with biopsy histopathological diagnosis. And explore the diagnostic value in the cervical cancer and precancerous lesions by combination of these two methods.Retrospective analysis cases with the positive cytological diagnosis. Acrodding to the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 3197 cases were selected and further investigated by high-risk human papillomavirus testing and biopsy histopathological diagnosis. We had a comparative analysis to the coincidence of TCT, high-risk HPV-DNA test and biopsy histopathological diagnosis.Among 3197 cases, 58.6% cases with chronic inflammation, 26.1% cases with condyloma or CIN I, 14.1% cases with CIN II-III, and 1.2% cases with invasive cervical carcinoma. Compared with pathological biopsy, the coincident rate of the diagnosis of TCT cytology and histopathology were 21.2% (ASC-US), 28.6% (ASC-H), 39.6% (LSIL), 56.2% (HSIL) and 72.4% (cervical carcinoma), respectively. Among cases of positive TCT diagnosis, Compared HR-HPV test and histopathological diagnosis, infection rate of HR-HPV increases significantly with increasing pathological grade (chi2 = 292.354, P = 0.000 < 0.05). As the TCT diagnostic level increases, the positive rate of HR-HPV marked grows (chi2 = 144.113, P = 0.000 < 0.05).TCT can reduce the incidence of cancer effectively. But lower sensitivity in the low-grade cervical lesions may cause missed diagnosis. Combined TCT and HR-HPV test will improve the detection rate of cervical lesions it is an ideal method to screening cervical cancer.
