Utilization patterns of prevention and early diagnosis for cancer in women. To estimate the utilization patterns of cancer prevention programs in women during the period 2000-2012 in Mexican women who participated in three national surveys.We analyzed data from the ENSA 2000, ENSANUT 2006 and ENSANUT 2012 that are representative of the Mexican population. Prevalences were obtained, trend tests and Poisson regression were used to determine the possibility of having more coverage.The coverage of Papanicolaou use in the last 12 months in 2012 was 45.5%, HPV testing in the last four years was 11.9% and mammography use in the past two years was 29.4% and 17.2% in women aged 50-69 years and 40-49 years, respectively.Although there was an increase in the coverage of screening programs, there should be a boost in the service quality and universal coverage.
