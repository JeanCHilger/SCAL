Reasons for non-attendance to cervical screening and preferences for HPV self-sampling in Dutch women. High attendance rates in cervical screening are essential for effective cancer prevention. Offering HPV self-sampling to non-responders increases participation rates.

A total of 35,477 non-responders were invited to participate in an HPV self-sampling study 5347 women did opt out. Finally, 30,130 women received a questionnaire and self-sampling device.The analysis was based on 9484 returned questionnaires (31.5%) with a self-sample specimen, and 682 (2.3%) without. Among women who returned both, the main reason for non-attendance to cervical screening was that they forgot to schedule an appointment (3068 32.3%). The most important reason to use the self-sampling device was the opportunity to take a sample in their own time-setting (4763Organisational barriers are the main reason for non-attendance in regular cervical screening.
