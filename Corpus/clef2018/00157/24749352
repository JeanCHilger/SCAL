Study on the relationship between the MTHFR polymorphism, the level of the folic acid and the cervical cancer susceptibility. To study the relationship between the occurrence of the uterine cervix cancer and the risk factors, such as the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 1298 polymorphism, the level of the folic acid and so on.The cases from some hospitals, including the Xiamen No. 1 Hospital, the Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Hospital and the Xiamen Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital during the year 2007 to 2011 were selected and divided into two groups, one was the cancer group with 129 cases of the cervical cancer, and the other was the control group with 214 non-cervical-cancer women. Through using the questionnaires and testing the expression of the MTHFR 1298 polymorphism, the the risk factors of cervical cancer were analyzed.(1) The level of the folic acid in the cancer group was (13.29 +/- 8.47) nmol/L, lower than that of the control group [(16.75 +/- 7.92) nmol/L] (P = 0.001). The ratio of the positive result of the human papillomavirus (HPV) in the cancer group was 73.6%, higher than that of the control group (25.7%) (chi2 = 75.178, P = 0.001). What's more, the ratio of the first parturition age below 25 years old in the cancer group was 68.22%, also higher than the ratio of the control group (54.2%) (chi2 = 6.556, P = 0.001). (2) The difference of the distribution of MTHFR 1298 polymorphism between the two groups was significant (chi2 = 12.466, P = 0.002), contrast with the women whom had the MTHFR 1298AA, the women whom carried the MTHFR 1298AC had much more risk to get the cervical cancer (OR = 1.831, 95% CI: 1.309-2.562), so did the women whom carried the MTHFR 1298CC (OR = 5.804, 95% CI: 2.187-15.405). (3) After combining the two gene types which were the MTHFR 1298AA and the MTHFR 1298AC into one group, the difference of the distribution of the MTHFR 1298 polymorphism between the cancer group and the control group was also significant (chi2 = 4.527, P = 0.033), OR = 4.650 (95% CI: 1.129-19.150).The occurrence of the cervical cancer may associate with the low level of the folic acid and the first parturition age below 25 years old. Meanwhile, the MTHFR 1298 polymorphism may be an important factor to the occurrence of cervical cancer, the MTHFR 1298AC or MTHFR 1298CC may increase the risk to get the cervical cancer, especially the MTHFR 1298CC genotype.
