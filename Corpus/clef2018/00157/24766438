Semi-quantitative HPV viral load in patients with ASC-US cytology: viral load correlates strongly with the presence of CIN but only weakly with its severity. This study was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) viral load, expressed in relative light units (RLUs), in patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cytology.A total of 349 ASC-US cases with HPV infection, detected using Hybrid Capture 2, were diagnosed histologically. A colposcopically directed punch biopsy was performed on acetowhite areas. Endocervical curettage biopsy and random cervical punch biopsy in four quadrants were performed in unsatisfactory colposcopy cases. In negative colposcopy cases, random cervical punch biopsy in four quadrants was performed.Case with no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), CIN1 and CIN2+ (CIN2/CIN3) accounted for 162, 135 and 52 cases, respectively. The mean age showed no difference among the three groups (P = 0.510). There was a significant correlation between RLU values and the presence of CIN (P < 0.001), but less so with its severity: the median RLU values for negative, CIN1 and CIN2+ cases were 42.68, 146.45 and 156.43, respectively, with widely overlapping confidence intervals. The cut-off values of RLU to detect CIN1+ and CIN2+ were 6.73 and 45.64, respectively.The HPV viral load in ASC-US cases showed a significant correlation with the presence of CIN and less so with its severity, and showed large overlap of viral loads between grades of CIN. In ASC-US cases, RLU was not an accurate predictor of immediate high-grade CIN.
