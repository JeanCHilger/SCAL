The utility of human papillomavirus testing in young women with atypical glandular cells on pap test. This study aimed to gain information regarding the follow-up diagnoses and human papillomavirus (HPV) status of women younger than 35 years diagnosed with atypical glandular cells (AGCs) on Pap test.This is a retrospective observational study in which the cytopathology files at Fletcher Allen Health Care were reviewed from 2000 to 2013 for the diagnoses of AGC in women younger than 35 years. Subsequent pathology reports and HPV testing results were obtained. Significant lesions were defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3, invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, or adenocarcinoma.One hundred six women younger than 35 years with an AGC Pap diagnosis and subsequent follow-up were identified. Significant lesions were diagnosed in 44.3% of the women (47) the majority (55.3%, 26 patients) of which were classified as CIN 2 or 3. Adenocarcinoma in situ was diagnosed in 27.7% of the cases (13). A diagnosis of both CIN 2 or 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ was made in 14.9% of the cases (7). One patient (2.1%) was diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma. The HPV status was identified in 36.8% of the women (39): 69.2% (27) was HPV positive, and 30.8% (12) was HPV negative. Fifty-five percent of HPV-positive women were diagnosed with a significant lesion upon follow-up. No known HPV-negative women were diagnosed with a significant lesion.Human papillomavirus testing may be useful in risk stratifying young women with AGC on Pap test because they are at risk of having an HPV-positive cervical lesion.
