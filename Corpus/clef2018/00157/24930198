Detection and estimation of human papillomavirus viral load in patients with cervical lesions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) high risk genotype infection and HPV viral load influences the development of invasive cervical cancer and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). HPV DNA testing for screening of cervical cancers may play a potential role in its early detection and management. The present study detected HPV DNA and estimated HPV viral load in different types of cervical lesions among Bangladeshi women. Using the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay, HPV DNA was tested among 68 women between 25-70 years of age. A total of 13 (19.1%) cases were positive for HPV DNA. The highest viral load (501 x 10(3) copies/ml) was detected in a patient with invasive carcinoma, while the lowest viral load (105 x 10(3) copies/ml) was detected from a case of chronic cervicitis. The mean viral load in CIN I was 119.25 x 10(3) +/- 12.5 x 10(3) copies/ml (range: 110 x 10(3) - 137 x 10(3) ) and 208.50 x 10(3) +/- 0.59 x 10(3) copies/ml (range: 139 x 10(3) - 305 x 10(3)) in CIN II/III. Interestingly, HPV DNA was detected from a patient with normal cytological findings. Our study observed a moderate presence of high-risk HPV genotypes among women with cervical lesions. The HPV viral load varied with the age of the patients and stage of cervical lesions. The HC2 assay is a promising tool for diagnosing high-risk HPV infection especially before cytology tests show any abnormality.
