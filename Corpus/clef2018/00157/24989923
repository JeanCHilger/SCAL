Value of high risk human papillomavirus viral load in predicting cervical lesions and triaging for high risk (HR)-HPV-positive women. To evaluate the value of high risk (HR)-HPV viral load in predicting cervical lesions and triaging for HR-HPV positive women.The study cohort came from a multicenter cervical cancer screening program. HR-HPV was detected by hybrid capture 2 (HC-2) assay, and viral load was measured by the ratio of relative light units to cut off (RLU/CO). Women were divided into 4 groups according to the RLU/CO value, and CIN diagnostic system was used to describe the severity of cervical lesions. Chi-square trend test was used to analyze the association between viral load and CIN. The absolute and relative risks of CIN2+ in different viral load groups were calculated, and the clinical performance to detect CIN2+ at follow-up by different cut-off values of baseline RLU/CO was also calculated.2 725 women with complete results of both baseline and follow-up were included in this analysis. The severity of cervical lesions increased with the increasing viral load (P < 0.001). In women with normal or CIN1 diagnosis at baseline, the absolute risk of one-year accumulative CIN2+ was 0.11% in the HR-HPV-negative group, compared with 3.14% in the moderate viral load group and 6.09% in the high viral load group, and the relative risk of 29.05 (95%CI: 6.07-138.99) in the moderate viral load group and 56.34 (95%CI: 12.89-246.30) in the high viral load group. Raising cut-off value of baseline HR-HPV viral load to 15.00, RLU/CO decreased the number of women who need to be followed up at one-year from 774 to 412, with the sensitivity of 91.30% and specificity of 47.94% in detecting CIN2+ at follow-up.The risk of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions increases with the increasing HR-HPV viral load. Raising the cut-off value of HR-HPV viral load can triage for HR-HPV-positive women, therefore help to allocate the health resources more effectively.
