The Influence of Human Papillomavirus Genotypes on Visual Screening and Diagnosis of Cervical Precancer and Cancer. To examine the influence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes on the sensitivity of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for screening, and colposcopy for diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or more severe (CIN2+).Women aged 25 to 65 years from China (n = 7,541) were screened with 6 tests (careHPV and Hybrid Capture 2 on self- and clinician-collected specimens HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-45 E6 detectionAmong the 143 women with a diagnosis of CIN2+, the percentage who were HPV16 positive increased with increasing severity of diagnosis: 33.3% for CIN2 (n = 39), 69.1% for CIN3 (n = 94), and 90% for cancer (n = 10). There was a higher percentage of HPV-16 in women with abnormal colposcopic impression (p = .007) and positive VIA (p = .02) than normal colposcopy and negative VIA, respectively. Colposcopy and VIA were more sensitive to detect CIN2+ among HPV-16- and/or HPV-18-positive women than HPV-16-/HPV-18-negative women (67.4% vs 43.1%, p = .008, for colposcopy and 53.3% vs 37.3%, p = .08, for VIA).Human papillomavirus type 16 is related to more clear visual acetowhite changes in the epithelium. Therefore, we should expect a reduction of the performance of VIA for cervical cancer screening to identify women with CIN2+, and reduction of the performance of colposcopy to diagnose CIN2+, in vaccinated populations.
