A B-myb--DREAM complex is not critical to regulate the G2/M genes in HPV-transformed cell lines. It is well-established that HPV E7 proteins, encoded by human papillomavirus (HPV) genes, frequently associated with cervical cancers bind avidly to the retinoblastoma (RB) family of pocket proteins and disrupt their association with members of the E2F transcription factor family. Our previous study showed that the repressive p130-dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class (DREAM) complex was disrupted by HPV16 E7 proteins in order to maintain the viral replication in CaSki cells. However, we would like to address whether the activator B-myb-DREAM complex is critical in regulating the replication and mitosis phase since our previous study showed increased B-myb-DREAM expression in HPV-transformed cell lines when compared to control cells.The association of B-myb with both LIN-54 and LIN-9 was equally decreased by depleting LIN-54 in CaSki cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that LIN-54 depletion caused an increased proportion of G2/M cells in T98G, SiHa and CaSki cells. The mRNA levels of certain S/G2 genes such as cyclin B, aurora kinase A and Polo-like kinase 1 have demonstrated a marginal increased in CaSki-Lin-54-depleted cells when compared to SiHa- and T98G-Lin-54-depleted cells. We further confirmed this experiment by depleting the B-myb itself in CaSki cells and the results showed the same pattern of cell cycle and mRNA levels for S/G2 genes when compared to LIN-54- and LIN-9-depleted cells.The B-myb-DREAM complex might not be vital for progression through mitosis in cells lacking a G1/S checkpoint and not as crucial as the p130-DREAM complex for the survival of the HPV virus.
