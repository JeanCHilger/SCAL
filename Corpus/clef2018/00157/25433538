Cervical cancer screening program in Thimphu, Bhutan: population coverage and characteristics associated with screening attendance. Bhutan has been engaged in good-quality cytology-based cervical screening since 2000 and has vaccinated >90% girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) since 2010. We explored the characteristics associated with lack of previous screening and screening coverage in women age ≥25 years.Women were invited at home or during their attendance at 2 outpatient clinics, in the capital, Thimphu, and nearby Lungthenphu. Age-adjusted odds ratios for lack of previous screening by selected characteristics were computed among 1,620 participating women. In Thimphu an invitation registry allowed to estimate screening history not only among participating women but also among additional 500 women who did not accept to join our study.Among women who had a Pap smear, lack of previous screening was associated with age <35 or ≥45 years. It was also associated with some occupations being single, or widowed/separatedTransition from an opportunistic screening to an all-reaching population-based screening is yet to be achieved in Bhutan, even in the capital. Better ways to target never-screened women are needed.
