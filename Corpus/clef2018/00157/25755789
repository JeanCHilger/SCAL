Diagnostic value of MCM2 immunocytochemical staining in cervical lesions and its relationship with HPV infection. Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide, and human papillomavirus infection represents the most important risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. Minichromosome maintenance protein-2 has been previously identified by DNA microarray and transcriptional profiling as genes that is overexpressed in cervical carcinomas. 183 cases were enrolled and tested with thin prep liquid-based cytology test. The expressions of human papillomavirus were detected and minichromosome maintenance protein-2 immuncytochemical test was performed on liquid-based pap smears from the samples. Those results were compared with the cervical histopathology results. The positive expression rates of minichromosome maintenance protein-2 and high-risk type human papillomavirus increased with the severity of cervical lesions. The expression level of MCM2 was positively correlated with high-risk types of human papillomavirus. In cervical carcinoma and precancerous lesions, minichromosome maintenance protein-2 was overexpressed and positively correlated with the high risk types of human papillomavirus. As minichromosome maintenance protein-2 immuncytochemical detection was better than genotyping of human papillomavirus, minichromosome maintenance protein-2 may serve as a useful marker in the screening of cervical carcinoma and precancerous lesions and improve the diagnosis of atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance. The joint application can improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis.
