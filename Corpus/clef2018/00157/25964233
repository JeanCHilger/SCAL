Home-based urinary HPV DNA testing in women who do not attend cervical cancer screening clinics. In France, cervical cancer screening is currently based on cytological examination of a Pap smear for women aged 25 to 65, but screening coverage is unsatisfactory. Previous studies have shown that self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing increases rates of compliance. With this purpose in mind, we performed the CapU study to evaluate the acceptance of a urinary HPV test. Letters proposing a new cervical cancer screening method using at-home urine self-sampling were sent to 5000 women aged 40-65 years who had not had a Pap smear over the past three years. The participating patients had to send their urine samples to the Angers Hospital Virology Laboratory for analysis using real-time PCR. Of the 771 samples received, 687 were analyzed. High-risk HPV were detected in 29 women. In follow-up, 28 women with positive urinary HPV results had a Pap smear or colposcopy done. The cytological results showed nine abnormal Pap smears, among which histology studies confirmed three cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III lesions. Our study shows that urinary HPV testing may be pertinent to women who do not have cervical Pap smears done and lead to the diagnosis of high-grade cervical lesions.
