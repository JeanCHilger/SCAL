Epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of women with genital warts in Greece. This is a prospective study of the epidemiological, clinical, and virological characteristics of cases of genital warts in a Greek University Hospital. The women completed a questionnaire regarding their medical and sexual history and underwent cervical cytology, HPV DNA typing, mRNA testing, colposcopy, Chlamydia testing, and proctoscopy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The most commonly detected types were type 6 (36.1%) and 16 (24.3%). E6/E7 mRNA testing was positive in 21.5%. Concurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse was found in 11.1% and intra-anal warts in 10.4%. For chlamydial infection the number of sexual partners was a significant predictor. Women with warts infected with types 6 and 11 constituted only 37.5% of the total. This could have a negative effect on the efficacy of vaccination in reducing the incidence of the disease. Based on the present findings the authors recommend cytology and colposcopy for all women with genital warts.
