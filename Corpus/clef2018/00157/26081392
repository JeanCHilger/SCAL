Screening technologies to advance rapid testing for cervical cancer prevention in developing countries. The rapid screening testing for cervical cancer prevention in low- and middle-income countries, careHPV assay, is developed by Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The careHPV assay is the first HPV DNA detection technique worldwide, which is simple, fast, accurate, safe, and inexpensive. The testing technique was verified using clinical outcome as the endpoint, and its accuracy was similar to the current standard HPV detection technique and even higher than VIA. The popularization and application of careHPV could tremendously contribute to cervical cancer prevention in China as well as other developing countries. This would also reduce the disparity between developed and developing countries in cervical cancer prevention and help reduce the incidence and mortality of this disease.
