Anticancer Potential of Cratoxylum formosum Subsp. Pruniflorum (Kurz.) Gogel Extracts Against Cervical Cancer Cell Lines. Most northeast Thai vegetables may play roles in human health by acting as antioxidant and anticancer agents. Recent study showed that Cratoxylum formosum subsp. pruniflorum (Kurz.) Gogel. (Teawdang) could inhibit growth of liver cancer cell lines. Cervical cancer, which has human papilloma virus as its main cause, is found at high incidence in Thailand. Due to increasing drug resistance, searches for potential anticancer compounds from natural source are required. Therefore, our purpose was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Teawdang extracts in cervical cancer cell lines.Teawdang edible parts, purchased from Khon Kaen market during July-October 2013 was extracted with organic solvent. Phenolic profiles of crude hexane (CHE), ethyl acetate (CEE), methanol (CME) and water (CWE) extracts were performed by high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) techniques. Their cytotoxic effects on cervical cancer cells were investigated with HPV-non infected (C-33A) and HPV-infected (HeLa and SiHa) cell lines.HPLC profiles showed that all crude extracts contained caffeine, ferulic acid and resveratrol. CME and CEE had high contents of gallic acid and quercetin. Catechin was found only in CWE. Cytotoxicity test showed that CEE had the lowest IC50 on HeLa (143.18±13.35 μg/mL) and SiHa cells (106.45±15.73 μg/mL). C-33A cells were inhibited by CWE (IC50 = 130.95±3.83 μg/mL).There were several phenolic compounds in Teawdang extracts which may have cytotoxic effects on cervical cancer cell lines. Investigation of these bioactive compounds as new sources of anticancer agents is recommended.
