Detection of Human Papilloma Virus (Type 16) among HIV-Positive Women in Ogbomoso, South-Western Nigeria. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted virus which infects the cutaneous and mucosal epithelium. HPV Type 16 is one of the viruses that causes cervical cancer and immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of different co-infections. Women living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have greater risk to the virus due to their impaired immunity. This study aimed at determining the seroprevalence of HPV IgM (Type 16) among HIV-infected women in Ogbomoso.The blood sample of 180 consenting subjects were obtained and their sera subjected to serological assay using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Samples were collected over a period of 6 months (July-December 2014).The mean age and mean CD4+ count of the subjects was 38.22 ± 0.79 years and 392.80 ± 20.98 cells/μL, respectively. Out of 180 subjects tested, 18 (10% 95% confidence interval) were positive for HPV Type 16 IgM. HPV Type 16 IgM was highest among the age group 31-45 (61.11%), traders (38.89%), >500 CD4/μL (33.33%). The seroprevalence using logistic regression at P < 0.05 shows there is a significant difference between the age and CD4 (+) cell count.The result provides evidence that HPV Type 16 is present among HIV-infected women in Ogbomoso and they are susceptible to cervical cancer. This seroepidemiological survey is important for the prevention efforts such as availability of vaccine.
