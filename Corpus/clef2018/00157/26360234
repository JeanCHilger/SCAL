Women's Attitudes Toward Cervicovaginal Self-Sampling for High-Risk HPV Infection on the US-Mexico Border. The purpose of this study was to assess the acceptability and intention to use cervicovaginal self-sampling for high-risk human papillomavirus infection after receiving an educational intervention among the predominantly Hispanic population residing along the US-Mexico border.Women received an educational intervention about cervical cancer prevention through screening with conventional cytology and with self-sampling for high-risk human papillomavirus. After the educational intervention, women performed the self-sampling test. Women's attitudes toward the self-sampling test and cervical cytology were assessed and compared.A total of 110 women aged 30 to 65 years completed the study. The mean (SD) age of the population was 48 (9.3) years. Most (87%) self-identified as being Hispanic and half were born in Mexico 16% had not had cervical cytology done in 3 years. Self-sampling was more acceptable than cervical cytologyThe high acceptability of self-sampling after participants received education about the test and the reported intention to use it if made available add to the evidence on the feasibility of integrating self-testing within cervical cancer screening guidelines.
