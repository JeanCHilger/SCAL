Atopic Dermatitis Is Associated With Cervical High Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection. High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is more likely to persist and cause cervical cancer in immunosuppressed women. Atopic dermatitis, which is known to affect cell-mediated immunity and skin barrier function, is associated with recalcitrant warts therefore, we hypothesized that women with atopic dermatitis may be more likely to be positive for hrHPV infection and progress to high-grade cervical dysplasia.A retrospective case-control study of 1,160 women who were either positive or negative for hrHPV in their index cervical cytology. Patient age, race, history of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, smoking, body mass index, socioeconomic status, marital status, hormone contraceptive use, and 2-year clinical outcomes (follow-up hrHPV testing and cervical biopsy results) were recorded. All cases with atopic dermatitis (n = 74) were confirmed by a dermatologist. Analyses were restricted to females with documented clinical follow-up, which yielded 577 hrHPV-positive and 583 hrHPV-negative cases for comparison. Associations were examined by t test, Ï‡ test, and multivariate logistic regression.Atopic dermatitis was more common in the hrHPV-positive cases (48/577, 8.3%) compared with HPV-negative controls (26/583, 4.5%, p = .007). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an adjusted odds ratio of 3.75 (95% CI = 1.3-10.9, p = .02) after controlling for significant covariates, such as age and marital status. Smoking was not associated with hrHPV infection, persistence, or high-grade cervical dysplasia in these cases.Atopic dermatitis is associated with cervical hrHPV infection in adult women.
