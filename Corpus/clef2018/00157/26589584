Primary HPV DNA based cervical cancer screening at 25 years: Views of young Australian women aged 16-28 years. Revised Australian guidelines have been announced under the Renew(Â®) program to commence screening at 25 years of age with HPV testing in 5-yearly intervals, in 2017. We conducted a study of young Victorian women to assess attitudes towards a change in cervical screening practice.An online survey was conducted of young women aged 16-28 years enrolled in the Young Female Health Initiative (YFHI) study at the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, to assess attitudes towards delaying the age of cervical screening, widening screening intervals and screening with HPV DNA testing, prior to the announcement of the renewal.Of 149 respondents (response rate 75%), mean age was 23.2 (range 16-27) years. Most (85/131, 65%) were concerned about delaying the age of cervical screening until 25 years. The majority (79% (106/135) were willing to undertake primary screening with HPV testing, whilst 66% (88/133) were willing to undertake HPV testing from 25 years, only 34% (45/132) were willing to undertake such screening every five years. Those willing to change screening practice were more likely to perceive that people important to them would expect them to do so to have been vaccinatedTargeted health campaigns are needed to address the concerns of young women prior to the introduction of new cervical screening guidelines in 2017.
