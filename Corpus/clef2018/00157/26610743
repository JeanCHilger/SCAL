Correlation of cervical cytology with high-risk HPV molecular diagnosis, genotypes, and histopathology--A four year study from the UAE. Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the world and in the Middle East. Its prevention and screening strategies assume great importance especially in view of the ability to identify the illness at an early stage and disrupt its progression toward neoplasia. Cervical cancer screening program of our center in UAE as well as this study is oriented in this direction.Cervical cytology data encompassing 4 years (2011-2014) was compiled and analyzed for 14,950 cases to assess the abnormal smear reporting pattern, correlation with biopsy histopathology, HPV high-risk screening data, and HPV genotype prevalence among patients with abnormal smear test, as well as in relation to the respective nationalities of patients.Abnormal smear rates as well as HPV high-risk positivity correlated well with established data. Cytology-histology correlation was good. HPV high-risk type 16 was the commonest, type 18 which is the second common type worldwide was less frequently detected, several other high risk subtypes such as 51, 31 as well as rare types such as 66, 56, and 59 were detected in a significant number of patients.Assessment of cervical cytology reporting pattern, correlation of cervical cytology with HPV molecular diagnosis, and biopsy histopathology is a useful way to audit our work and a good quality control practice. Higher prevalence of HPV HR types such as type 51, 31 as well as 66, 56, and 59 found in the present as well as many similar other studies apart from the commonest subtype 16 may imply necessity for development of more targeted and multivalent anti-HPV vaccines for protection of women in our region. HPV genotypes correlation with the nationalities of patients is useful from an epidemiological standpoint to plan preventive strategies.
