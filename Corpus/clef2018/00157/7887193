Evaluation of the validity of human papillomavirus detection in paraffin-embedded cervical samples by the DNA hybridization in situ. The DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 33 and 56 were prepared and biotinylated. They were used in hybridization in situ test for detection HPVs in the cells of 29 cervical samples with various grade of dysplasia and CIS. It was verified that DNA probes are suitable for HPV detection and that the grade of pathological changes is dependent on the presence of viral DNA. On the other hand, the pathological diagnosis of koilocytosis often do not reflect actual presence of HPV DNA in cell genome.
