Genital human papillomavirus infections in Taiwan. Identification and typing of HPV infections in genital condyloma and normal cytological cervix.Cervical cells from 289 Pap cases with normal cytological findings were examined for HPV infection by slot blot hybridization. Fifteen condyloma biopsy specimens were studied by Southern blot hybridization.Thirty-six cases (12.5%) with normal cervical cytology were HPV positive. The predominant HPV type in women with normal cytology is HPV-16. Risk factors for HPV infection in women with normal cytology depend on age and history of pregnancies. Twelve cases (80%) of condyloma contained HPV-6 or -11 sequences. The predominant HPV type in genital condyloma is HPV-11.HPV detection in population-based screening programs for cervical neoplasia can be an important tool in identifying women who are at risk of developing dysplasia and cervical cancer.
