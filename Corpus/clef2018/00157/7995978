Risk factors for squamous intraepithelial lesions on Pap smear in women at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. To determine risk factors for squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) on Pap smear, 253 women at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had Pap smear, HIV antibody testing, CD4+ cell measurements, and human papillomavirus (HPV) genome detection by Southern blot hybridization. Associated with SIL (P < .05) on univariate analysis were genital HPV (SIL prevalence in HPV-positive subjects, 36.3% odds ratio [OR], 9.3
