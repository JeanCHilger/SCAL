Use of semi-quantitative PCR for human papillomavirus DNA type 16 to identify women with high grade cervical disease in a population presenting with a mildly dyskaryotic smear report. The aim of this study was to assess whether qualitative or semi-quantitative detection of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) can help to identify women with major grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 and CIN 3) among those referred with a smear suggesting mild dyskaryosis. The study population consisted of 200 women sequentially attending the Royal Free Hospital colposcopy clinic. All women were investigated by cytology, colposcopy and, where appropriate, histopathology, and HPV 16 DNA was detected in cervical scrape samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A final clinical diagnosis of normal, wart virus infected (WVI), CIN 1, CIN 2 or CIN 3 was made in 179 women. On the basis of the qualitative PCR data, the presence of HPV 16 DNA was of borderline use in identifying women with high grade cervical disease [63/113 (normal/WVI/CIN 1) vs 46/66 (CIN 2/CIN 3) P = 0.065]. However, semi-quantitative PCR analysis showed that a high/medium HPV 16 result was significantly associated with high-grade disease [29/113 (normal/WVI/CIN 1) vs 38/66 (CIN 2/CIN 3)
