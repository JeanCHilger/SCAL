Genetic analysis of in vitro progression of human papillomavirus-transfected human cervical cells. The authors have established an in vitro model system which demonstrates the progression of the transformed phenotypes of human cervical epithelial cells transfected with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 DNAs. Both viral DNAs exhibit immortalizing potential however, only HPV 18-immortalized cell lines progress to exhibit anchorage-independent growth and, in a limited number of cases, tumorigenesis. In this paper, the authors have examined the genetic basis for this in vitro progression step by step, including immortalization, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity of the HPV-transfected human cervical epithelial cells by cell fusion. The results suggest that (a) all three transformed phenotypes, i.e., immortalization, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenesis, in this in vitro cervical carcinogenesis model are a result of recessive changes in genes or processes involved
