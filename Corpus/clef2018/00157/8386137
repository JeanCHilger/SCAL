Prevalence of HPV in cytomorphologically normal cervical smears, as determined by the polymerase chain reaction, is age-dependent. The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in relation to age was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in cytologically normal smears from 4 different groups of women. Group A consisted of young women from a district population, aged 15-34 years, using oral contraceptives and visiting general practitioners for a check-up (n = 156) group B were asymptomatic women, aged 35-55, in a district population participating in a triennial screening program for cervical cancer (n = 1555)
