T cell proliferative responses against human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein are most prominent in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia patients with a persistent viral infection. T cell proliferative responses against human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 protein were studied in relation to HPV status over time in 51 women originally diagnosed with abnormal cervical cytology and participating in a follow-up study. HPV-16-positive patients were grouped as having either a persistent, a cleared or a fluctuating HPV-16 infection as determined by PCR in consecutive cervical smears up until the moment of testing. Positive proliferative responses against HPV-16 E7 were found in 15/26 patients with a persistent, cleared or fluctuating HPV-16 infection (57.7%). In contrast, 0/15 patients who had been typed HPV-negative during follow-up showed positive responses (P = 0.0005). Further analysis showed positive responses to be more frequent in patients with persistent HPV-16 infections and stable or progressing cervical lesions (8/9 patients reactive, 88.9%) as compared to patients with cleared or fluctuating HPV-16 infections and stable or regressing cervical lesions (7/17, 41.1%, P = 0.04). The relatively strong T cell proliferative responses against HPV-16 E7 observed in patients with a persistent HPV-16 infection and progressive cervical lesions indicate that the effectivity of such responses cannot be predicted and apparently depends on additional factors.
