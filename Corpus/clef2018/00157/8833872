Koilocytosis an indication for conservative management. The management of women with mild dyskaryosis continues to be the subject of debate. The management of cases with such smears could be improved if additional morphological features were found to be indicative of low/high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Our own experience in the routine audit of the diagnostic accuracy of cervical smears had suggested that cases of dyskaryosis with koilcytosis were associated with low risk of CINIII. Two hundred and forty-four cervical smears reported as showing evidence of warty virus infection were reviewed and their subsequent histories noted. Of these smears, 173 demonstrated clear evidence of koilocytosis. Irrespective of the initial grade of dyskaryosis, only 28 cases (16.2%) had underlying CIN or had progressed to CIN over a minimum follow-up period of 21 months. Only two cases (1.2%) showed evidence of CINIII. Koilcytosis is associated with a low risk of CIN and an especially low risk of CINIII. The management of women with koilocytic smears should be modified accordingly.
