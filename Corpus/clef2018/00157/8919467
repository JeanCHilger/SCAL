Detection of type specific human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical cancers of Indian women. Commercial Vira Pap and Vira Type kits of Life Technologies Inc., U.S.A., were used to determine prevalence and type specific distribution of human papilloma viruses (HPV) in 18 biopsy samples of cervical carcinomas and 26 specimens of exfoliated cervical cells (swabs). The women were either attending out-patient's department of a suburban hospital or a cancer hospital in Calcutta, India. HPV DNA was detected in 9 biopsy specimens but not in any of the cervical swabs. Five of the 9 HPV positive biopsies had HPV DNA type 16/18. Neither HPV 6/11 nor HPV 31/33/35 DNAs were detected in any of these 9 specimens. Results indicated possible presence of HPV DNAs of types other than the above in at least 4 specimens.
