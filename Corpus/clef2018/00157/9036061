HPV-Dna hybridization allows differentiation of cervix lesions in PAP III cytologic findings. A repeat Pap smear as well as a smear for human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA detection with the Hybrid Capture assay (Digene diagnostics/Murex, Burgwedel) were collected from 30 women with Pap smears recurrently classified as "Pap III". All patients underwent colposcopy and histological assessment. The repeat Pap smear distinguished correctly in 15, colposcopy in 19 and the Hybrid Capture assay in 27 cases between neoplastic and inflammatory lesions. All invasive neoplasms were positive for HPV-DNA. HPV typing seems to be a suitable non-invasive method for early selection of cervical lesions that need histological assessment in women with smears classified as "Pap III".
