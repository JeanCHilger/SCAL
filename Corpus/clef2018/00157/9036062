Electrosurgical loop excision of the transformation zone in treatment of cervix neoplasia. 100 patients with CIN on referral Pap and with a distinct cervical lesion on colposcopy were treated with the loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP). Compared with 60 women who underwent cold-knife conization, the number of lesions classified as CIN-3 or more did not differ between the two groups (53% vs 53.3%). Severe haemorrhage and cervical stenosis were only observed after conization. Involvement of resection margins was found in 18% of all LEEP and in 16.7% of all cone biopsies. 3-12 months after LEEP the rate of cytologically and biopsy proven neoplasia was 2.2%. LEEP is a safe and effective procedure and should be used as the treatment of choice for distinct cervical lesions.
