Molecular diagnosis of persistent human papilloma virus infections. Persistent infections with human papilloma viruses (HPV) can lead to a wide range of benign and malignant epithelial tumors as cutaneous warts or anogenital cancers. Methods principally available for the laboratory diagnosis of HPV infections are cytology and histology, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy, serology and methods for the detection of HPV-specific DNA. Among the latter are polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern blot, dot blot, filter in situ hybridization, in situ hybridization and direct hybridization assays as Hybrid Capture. The advantages and disadvantages of the different assays are reviewed in this article. HPV DNA testing (and typing) by PCR and Hybrid Capture is clinically useful when combined with cytology in screening programs and for managing patients with equivocal cytology or cervical disease.
