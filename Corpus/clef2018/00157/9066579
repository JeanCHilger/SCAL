p53 immunostaining and HPV DNA detection by PCR in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: clinical implications of a combinated evaluation. We analyzed p53 immunoreactivity and clinical outcome in a series of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN), with respect to HPV DNA positivity. Cervical biopsy samples were obtained from 86 women who attended our Colposcopic Service from January 1993 to June 1994 due to abnormal pap-smear suspicious for CIN and/or human papillomavirus infection. Forty-one women with histologically confirmed CIN were included in the study. p53 positivity was immunohistochemically detected by monoclonal antibody anti-human p53 (pAb D0-7, Dako Denmark dilution 1:50), and expressed as the percentage of positive cells. p53 positivity was observed in 78% of CIN lesions. In particular, all the HPV DNA-negative dysplasias expressed p53 protein while only 12 out of 21 (57%) HPV DNA-positive were p53 immunoreactive
