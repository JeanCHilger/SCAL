Effectiveness of local anesthesia using EMLA cream for laser treatment of cervical and vulvar lesions. The efficacy of the anesthesia by the Emla cream (a mixture of lydocaine and prylocaine) has been tested on the cervix uteri and the vulva before laser treatment of warts and intraepithelial neoplasia. Five of the six women treated for vulvar warts did not feel any pain during laser treatment after the application of the cream. On the cervix, the pain was evaluated on a median of 9 on a visual scale going from 0 to 100, compared to a median of 25 for women treated without local anesthesia. The efficacy of local anesthesia was best after 4 minutes. The local anesthesia by the Emla cream seems to constitute a real progress in the patient's tolerance of local destructive treatment of cervical and vulvar warts and intraepithelial neoplasia.
