Management of the clinically positive neck in organ preservation for advanced head and neck cancer. To investigate clinicopathologic predictive criteria for the optimal management of neck metastases in patients with advanced head and neck cancers treated with combined chemoradiotherapy.Prospective study, 48 patients. Mean length follow-up, 23 months.Neck stage predicted neck response to chemoradiotherapy N3 necks showed more partial responses (P = 0.04), and N1 necks showed more complete responses (P = 0.12). Primary tumor site strongly predicted the pathologic response found on neck dissection in patients with a clinical partial response (cPR) following chemoradiotherapy. There was no difference in survival between patients with a clinical complete response (cCR) after chemoradiotherapy, and patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neck dissection (P = 0.20)Clinical response to induction chemotherapy is a poor predictor of ultimate neck control. Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy, and planned neck dissection for patients with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy, provides good regional control.
