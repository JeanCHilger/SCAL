A study of 10,296 pediatric and adolescent Papanicolaou smear diagnoses in northern New England. This study analyzes pediatric and adolescent Papanicolaou (Pap) smear diagnoses to determine the prevalence rates of squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) as well as infectious and reactive processes in this age group.A total of 10 296 Pap smear diagnoses from patients 10 to 19 years of age collected over a 1-year period and classified according to the Bethesda system were reviewed. This population was almost exclusively white, the majority residing in rural or suburban areas of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The percentage of abnormal smear results was then compared with data generated for older age subsets.The following diagnoses were made on 10 296 Pap smears from patients 10 to 19 years of age: 7208 (70.01%) normal 1689 (16.4%) benign cellular changeBecause the development of SIL and hence cervical cancer is causally related to sexually transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, this high rate of abnormal Pap smear results of both an infectious and precancerous nature in this population may reflect a high level of sexual activity among adolescent girls. These data reinforce the importance of implementing early cervical Pap smear screening in the sexually active pediatric and adolescent population.
