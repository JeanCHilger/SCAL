Diagnosis and therapy of cervical squamous epithelial dysplasias. Diagnosis of cervical dysplasia is based on colposcopy, cytology and histology. In case of suspect cytology, the management (controls only, extended diagnosis by histology or therapy without additional histological control) is dependent on colposcopic findings. Biopsy or endocervical curettings are necessary in cases of suspect ectocervical findings or endocervical lesions, respectively. As a rule, HE staining is sufficient for histological diagnosis. Yet, additional prognostic information is obtained by HPV-analysis and DNA-cytometry. Grading of dysplasia should be done according to the most recent WHO/ISGYP criteria. The exact diagnosis as to the grading and extension of dysplasia is the prerequisite of an effective individually adjusted therapy. For ablative therapy, gynecologists have to focus their attention on modern organ preserving surgery strategies (loop-excision).
