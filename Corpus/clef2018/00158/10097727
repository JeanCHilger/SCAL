Exfoliative cytology of a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in a cervical smear. A case report. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the cervix (LELC) is cytologically identical to its counterparts at other sites, such as the nasopharynx. LELC can be suspected on a cervical cytologic smear. The differential diagnosis includes nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with prominent stromal inflammation, carcinoma with intense stromal eosinophilia, glassy cell carcinoma, malignant lymphoma (especially lymphoepitheloid-Lennerts lymphoma) and metastatic Schmincke-Regaud tumor.A 55-year-old female presented with an ulcerated endophytic tumor in the cervix. Exfoliative cytology showed uniform, large tumor cells, often associated with inflammatory cells, with round or oval nuclei and one or more prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm was finely granular to flocculent, and the nuclei were uniformly vesicular. The chromatin was peripherally marginated. The cell borders were indistinct. There was no evidence of dyskeratotic or keratinized cells, koilocytes or glandlike formations. These findings were highly suspicious for LELC and were confirmed by biopsy. Flow cytometry showed DNA aneuploidy, with a DNA index of 1.08. In situ hybridization was negative for human papillomavirus 16 and 18.LELC of the uterine cervix has cytologic features that are sufficiently characteristic for a specific cytologic diagnosis. The diagnosis, nevertheless, has to be proven by histology.
