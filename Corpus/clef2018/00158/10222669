Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic.

Another 95 women who visited a university hospital were selected as a normal control group. A swab sample collected from the uterine cervix and external os was subjected to hybrid capture assays for low-oncogenic-risk HPV types (HPV A including types 6, 11, 42, 43 and 44) and high- and intermediate-oncogenic-risk HPV types (HPV B
