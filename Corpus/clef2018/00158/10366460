An association between LSIL and the high secretor phenotype of IL-1beta. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of a nucleotide transition from C to T, which leads to increased transcription of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in patients with different grades of cervical lesions, and to determine whether a correlation exists between the genotypes and cervical lesions.One hundred forty-seven DNA samples from patients with different grades of cervical lesions were compared with 100 healthy, age and sex-matched bone marrow donors. TaqI restriction digest of PCR products was used to analyze the IL-1beta +5887 C --> T mutation and the results were confirmed using induced heteroduplex analysis with an induced heteroduplex generator.The Pearson chi2 test (Yate's correction) was used for statistical analysis. Patients with LSIL (n = 80) demonstrated a high frequency of allele T, previously associated with high IL-1beta secretor phenotype, compared to controls (P = 0.000012). A trend was also observed in patients with HSIL (n = 28, P = 0.039).We report for the first time a highly significant association between high secretor IL-1beta phenotypes (i.e., IL-1beta +5887 CT or TT genotypes) and LSIL. A less significant association exists with HSIL. The intrinsic ability to produce variable amounts of IL-1beta during different clinical stages involving cervical lesions may be of immunological importance in their pathogenesis.
