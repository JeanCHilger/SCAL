High prevalence of human papillomavirus type 58 in Chinese women with cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) among 332 Hong Kong Chinese women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The overall HPV positive rate was 44.3% with 18.6% (16/86) for normal/inflamed cervices, 36.4% (32/88) for condyloma, 64.7% (33/51) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN 1), 37.9% (11/29) for CIN 2, 68.3 (41/60) for CIN 3, and 77.8% (14/18) for carcinoma. Double HPV infection was detected in 17 of the 147 positive samples, with a significantly higher proportion in patients with normal or inflamed cervices than those with CIN or carcinoma (31.3% vs 10.5%, P =.029). The six most commonly identified genotypes were HPV 16 (33.3%), HPV 58 (23.8%), HPV 11, 18, 31 (8.8% each), and HPV 33 (6.8%). The worldwide uncommon genotype HPV 58 was found to be the second most common genotype detected in patients with cervical carcinoma (6 of 18 patients). HPV 58 infection showed a significant association with CIN/carcinoma (odds ratio [OR] = 3.98 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-14.35) and a significant trend of increase in prevalence with increasing severity of cervical lesion (chi(2) = 5.84
