Human papillomaviruses and DNA ploidy in anal condylomata acuminata. Previous studies have emphasized the usefulness of DNA ploidy measurement and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) detection as prognostic markers in low grade cervical lesions. We addressed the eventual relationship between HPV type, DNA profile, and p53 tumor suppressor protein expression in anal condylomata acuminata to eventually determine parameters which may be considered as predictive risk factors for the development of cancer. DNA ploidy was assessed by image cytometry after Feulgen staining of contiguous serial sections of 45 anal condylomata acuminata without atypia containing HPV detected by in situ hybridization and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). p53 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. DNA aneuploidy was found in 53.3% of these lesions, 48.9% containing non oncogenic HPV types 6 and/or 11 and 4.4% harbouring HPV types 11 and 18. The DNA diploid lesions were all associated with non oncogenic HPV types 6 and/or 11 and one case also contained HPV type 33. There was no significant correlation between the detection of DNA aneuploidy and the presence of immuno-detected p53. DNA aneuploidy was not related to the presence of oncogenic HPV in anal condylomata acuminata. The DNA aneuploid profile frequently observed, especially in lesions associated with non oncogenic HPV types, is not yet well explained and cannot be considered as a prognostic factor. In contrast, a more intensive clinical follow-up should be proposed in patients with oncogenic HPV associated to DNA aneuploidy.
