Cytological screening of uterine cervical cancer by samples in liquid medium (CytoRich). Preliminary study of a series of 111 292 patients. We report on the preliminary results of a series of 111,292 patients who benefited from a liquid medium sample (CytoRich) for cervical cancer screening. The number of dubious or limited smears was reduced by 0.03% and 0.53% respectively. The junction zone was better explored, and metaplastic changes were observed in 35.71% of the cases. This method improved the identification of low-grade lesions by +56% (2751/111,292 2.47%) and of high-grade lesions by +75% (860/111,292
