The role of human papillomavirus in gynecological diseases. Papanicolaou (Pap) smears of the cervix and biopsies of the cervix, vagina, vulva, and penis are a substantial portion of the work load of any anatomic pathology laboratory. The importance of samples from these sites is highlighted by the fact that their most common disease is dysplasia, which is sexually transmitted and a recognized risk factor for carcinoma. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an essential co-factor for the development of lower genital tract dysplasia. Molecular testing for HPV has revealed a great deal about the pathophysiology of dysplasia and its evolution to carcinoma. Importantly, it now allows diagnostic pathologists the opportunity to be more accurate in their assessment of common conditions such as Pap smears of squamous atypia and biopsies equivocal for dysplasia. This review highlights the role of HPV in the evolution of disease in the lower genital tract and stresses the utility of HPV testing to the diagnostic pathologist.
