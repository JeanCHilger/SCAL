Immunotherapy of gynaecological high-risk human papilloma virus infection with human leukocyte ultrafiltrate. In this preliminary presentation the outcome of women following systemic treatment of cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) with a leukocyte ultrafiltrate is reported.Cervical brush specimens of 819 women with low-grade CIN-1 were evaluated for HPV infection. HPV-positive patients were treated either by cone biopsy because of suspicious colposcopy or by antibiotics for symptoms of bacterial cervicitis. The remaining women were considered as asymptomatic carriers of HPV and underwent systemic therapy by a human leukocyte ultrafiltrate in a dosage of 5 IE, 6 times in the first 2 weeks, and additionally as a single dose at weeks 4, 6, 8 and 10.The leukocyte ultrafiltrate was administered to 97 HPV-positive women. In follow-up 88.7% were HPV negative at week 6 the remaining 11 women were tested negative after completion of a second course of therapy.These preliminary data on the successful treatment of HPV infection by a leukocyte ultrafiltrate are very promising but have to be supported by additional research.
