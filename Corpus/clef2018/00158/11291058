HPV16 L1E7 chimeric virus-like particles induce specific HLA-restricted T cells in humans after in vitro vaccination. Cervical cancer has been shown to be highly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are constantly expressed by the tumor cells and are therefore targets for immunotherapy. In the present study we investigated the potential of HPV16 L1E7 chimeric virus-like particles (CVLP) to activate specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in human blood donors. CVLP were expressed by recombinant baculovirus and purified. Direct incubation of freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with CVLP resulted in induction of proliferation and growth of T cell lines. To enhance antigen presentation we also loaded dendritic cells with CVLP and used them to activate naive T cells. Growing cell lines were mainly CD3 positive (>95%) with a predominant CD4-positive and a minor CD8-positive component. Analysis of Tcell specificity was carried out by an interferon-gamma ELISpot assay. Dendritic cells pseudoinfected with CVLP or pulsed with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201-restricted peptide E7(11-20) or with a newly identified HPV16 peptide L1(323-331) were used as stimulator cells. T cells responsive to CVLP were found in the cultures with frequencies of 0.5%-0.7%. Frequencies to peptides were around 0.1%. These T cells had cytolytic activity toward autologous B-lymphoblastic cell lines either pseudoinfected with CVLP or pulsed with HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides. They also lysed the HPV16- and HLA-A*0201-positive cervical cancer cell line CaSki, whereas HLA-A*0201-negative SiHa cells were not lysed. We conclude from our data that CVLP show promise for a therapeutic vaccine in patients with HPV16-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions or cervical cancer.
