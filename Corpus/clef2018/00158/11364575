Gynecologic conditions and HIV. Studies are reinforcing the need for HIV-infected women to continue getting regular gynecologic examinations so that gynecologic complications can be detected early and monitored regularly. HIV-infected women who also have the human papillomavirus are more likely to progress to cervical cancer than their HIV-negative counterparts. Also, HIV-infected women are more likely to have abnormal pap smears and the presence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) compared to women who are HIV-negative. Because pap smears are not always accurate, women who have a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or SIL should probably include a colposcopy with their pap smear. Studies are showing a positive effect of anti-HIV therapy in lowering viral levels in vaginal secretions and in blood and semen in men. HIV RNA levels, however, have increased in vaginal secretions in response to standard treatment for CIN. HIV levels have also been shown to increase in the presence of sexually transmitted diseases, but when HIV viral levels are suppressed, there appears to be a lower susceptibility to gynecologic infections. Since research shows the benefits of early detection and treatment of gynecologic infections or conditions, all women should be aggressive and proactive in maintaining their health through regular gynecologic care.
