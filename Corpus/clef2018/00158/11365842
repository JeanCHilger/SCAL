Treatment of gynecological conditions in women. Women with HIV who have certain gynecologic conditions, such as yeast infections or particular pre-cancerous lesions, may require higher doses of medicine to treat these conditions. Other disorders like gonorrhea, chlamydia, and pelvic inflammatory disease seem to require similar treatment responses for HIV-positive and HIV negative women. Studies validate that women with HIV, especially those with decreasing CD4+ counts, are more likely to have several human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, which can lead to the development of pre-cancerous abnormalities. It is unclear whether highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has any beneficial effects in preventing HPV, however, it has been shown to reduce occurrences of Kaposi's sarcoma. Also, an observational study of 40 people was conducted to examine the effects of HAART on recurrence of genital warts. The findings suggest that relapse rates were directly related to viral load. Longer-term studies are needed to assess the rate of recurrences of cervical cancer in women with HIV. Women with HIV are also encouraged to get screened often for HPV with a pap smear or a colposcopy.
