Hybrid capture-II and LCR-E7 PCR assays for HPV typing in cervical cytologic samples. As part of an ongoing cohort study in the Hokuriku region of Japan, cervical cell samples from histologically confirmed normal (n = 114) or abnormal (n = 286) women were examined for the presence of HPV DNA using a second-generation hybrid capture assay (HCA-II) and LCR-E7 PCR. HCA-II detected low-risk (HPV-6, -11, -42, 43 and -44) and high-risk (HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59 and -68) HPV types, while LCR-E7 PCR detected an additional 7 HPV types and some uncharacterized types. In screening of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and invasive cervical cancer, the sensitivities of HCA-II and LCR-E7 PCR testing the high-risk HPV types were 83% and 81%, respectively, while the specificity of both assays was 93%. The sensitivity of LCR-E7 PCR increased to 87%, which was significantly higher than that in HCA-II, when testing both high-risk and other HPV types. Sixty-eight inconsistent results (17% of total tested) from HCA-II and LCR-E7 PCR were due to (i) low copy number of HPV genome (false-negative for HCA-II, 5.3% and for LCR-E7 PCR, 1.3%), (ii) infection with HPV types undetectable by HCA-II (4.8%), (iii) multiple HPV infections (5%) or (iv) unknown reasons (0.8%). LCR-E7 PCR revealed that infections with HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -51, -52, -56, -58 or -67 was a high risk for cancer since these types predominated in HSIL and invasive cervical cancer. Samples showing high relative light units (>20) with a high-risk probe in HCA-II also gave positive results in LCR-E7 PCR and were generally associated with abnormal cervical lesions. Thus, we propose that both HCA-II and LCR-E7 PCR are valuable screening tests for premalignant and malignant cervical lesions.
