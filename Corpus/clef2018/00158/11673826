High-risk HPV testing in women with borderline and mild dyskaryosis: long-term follow-up data and clinical relevance. In The Netherlands and most other European countries, women with two serial cervical smears with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (BMD) within 6 months are referred for colposcopy-directed biopsies. Only about 10% of these women have high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). This study therefore investigated whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing could identify which women with smears read as BMD are most likely to have high-grade CIN, either at referral or during follow-up and the relationship was determined between clearance of high-risk HPV and regression of abnormal cytology. Women with smears read as BMD (n=278) were referred to the gynaecologist for colposcopy. They were subdivided into two groups group A comprised women with a single smear (n=172) and group B women with two sequential smears (n=106) read as BMD before referral. High-risk HPV detection with Hybrid Capture II (HC II) was performed on a cervical scrape taken at the first visit before colposcopy (i.e. baseline smear) and during follow-up. Biopsies were taken when lesions suspected for CIN were seen at colposcopy. High-risk HPV DNA was present in the baseline smears of 126 (45.0%) women
