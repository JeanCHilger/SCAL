Minimal residual disease in thyroid carcinoma. The detection of disseminated tumor cells in differentiated (DTC) and medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) is one of the main topics in current thyroid cancer research. Immunocytochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provide the tools for the identification of a small number of thyroid cancer cells in peripheral blood and cervical lymph nodes. Thyroid-specific markers, such as thyroglobulin (Tg) mRNA and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) mRNA, have been detected with RT-PCR in blood samples of tumor patients and healthy control subjects. To prevent false-positive results, quantitative PCR systems were established. Tumor-specific markers, such as telomerase activity and cytokeratin 20 (CK20), have been detected in various epithelial tumors. Amplification products of these markers were found in blood samples and in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies of patients with thyroid carcinomas. Using molecular detection of disseminated tumor cells in cervical lymph nodes with CK20 RT-PCR, a higher percentage of involved lymph nodes was detected compared to immunohistochemistry. The results of the presented studies may help researchers to develop more sensitive methods for early tumor cell dissemination, and refine risk groups that might benefit from more extensive surgical procedures or adjuvant therapy. However, the prognostic value of minimal residual disease (MRD) in thyroid carcinoma has to be confirmed in large or multicenter prospective studies.
