Estimation of HPV infection presence in cytological smears in a group of asymptomatic women. Papanicolau (Pap) smear is the most important screening method in gynaecological oncology. According to EUROGIN and WHO statements it is suggested to perform additionally molecular detection of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most important risk factor of cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to estimate the HPV infection prevalence in healthy, asymptomatic women. Pap smears from 255 women were investigated according to The Bethesda Terminology. HPV DNA was detected by PCR method. We were able to detect high "oncogenic risk" HPV types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 52b, 58 and "low oncogenic risk"--HPV6 and 11. We found only 15 cases (5.9%) of HPV DNA presence. Most of them were HPV16--in 5 patients (33.3%) and HPV58--in 3 (20%). HPV detection could be very useful supplement to Pap smears. It allows selecting the patients with high risk of cervical cancer many years before clinical manifestation of the disease.
