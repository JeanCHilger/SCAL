Encapsulated plasmid DNA treatment for human papillomavirus 16-associated anal dysplasia: a Phase I study of ZYC101. High-grade dysplasia induced by high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) precedes invasive cancer in anal squamous epithelium just as it does in the cervix. A therapeutic HPV vaccine strategy as a potential treatment for anal dysplasia was tested in a standard Phase I dose escalation trial. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of the agent additional study aims were to evaluate the histological response, immune response, and effect on anal HPV-16 infection. Each subject was treated with four i.m. injections of 50-400 microg of ZYC101 at 3-week intervals. ZYC101 is composed of plasmid DNA encapsulated in biodegradable polymer microparticles. The plasmid DNA encodes for multiple HLA-A2-restricted epitopes derived from the HPV-16 E7 protein, one of two HPV oncoproteins consistently expressed in neoplastic cells. Fifty-six potential anal dysplasia subjects were screened to identify 12 eligible subjects with HPV-16 anal infection and a HLA-A2 haplotype. The investigational agent was well tolerated in all subjects at all dose levels tested. Three subjects experienced partial histological responses, including one of three subjects receiving the 200-microg dose and two subjects at the 400-microg dose level. Using a direct Elispot, 10 of 12 subjects demonstrated increased immune response to the peptide epitopes encoded within ZYC101
