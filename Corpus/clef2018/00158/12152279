Precancerous lesions and cervical cancer vs HPV infection in pregnant women--cytological assessment. An effort has been made in order to estimate the relationship between HPV, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma. The authors have been trying also to create a reliable prophylactic scheme as far as precancerous lesions and cervical carcinoma are concerned. 2243 pregnant women have been subjected to cytology and colposcopy examination. In selected cases HPV DNA hybridisation technique examination of cervical smear as well as colposcopy directed punch biopsy have been performed. The results of the study indicate of high efficiency of these methods in cervical cancer prophylaxis.
