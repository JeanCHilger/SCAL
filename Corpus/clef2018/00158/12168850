Frequent detection of human papilloma viruses in cervical dysplasia by PCR single-strand DNA-conformational polymorphism analysis. To clarify the pathogenicity of multiple human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, we applied SSCP (single-strand DNA conformation polymorphism) analysis for cervical neoplastic lesions.Two hundred and sixty-six cervical swab specimens from normal cervix (n=64), cervical dysplasia (n=95), carcinoma in situ (n=79) and cervical cancer (n=28), were studied by nested PCR-SSCP analysis using L1 consensus primers.In 95 samples of cervical dysplasia, HPV infection was detected in 98.9% (94 out of 95), multiple HPV infection was detected in 38.3% (36 out of 94). In 19 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 9 adenocarcinomas, the detection rate of HPV infection was 84.2% (16 out of 19) and 55.6% (5 out of 9), respectively, and all HPV-positive cases showed infection of a single HPV, among which HPV 16 occupied 68.6% (11 out of 16) in SCC and HPV 18 occupied 100% (5 out of 5) in adenocarcinoma.Multiple HPV infections may be concerned with pathogenicity in cervical dysplasia however, the single infection with only a few HPV types, such as type 16 in SCC and type 18 in adenocarcinoma, may play a role in cervical carcinogenesis.
