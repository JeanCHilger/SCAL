Cervical biopsy specimens and human papilloma virus positivity in patients with external genital warts. Cervical biopsy specimens were taken from 16 women with external genital warts in order to diagnose concomitant cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) according to pathology. Positive HPV infection was detected 56% (9/16) of the patients. Among those patients 66% (6/9) had concurrent subclinical low-grade CIN lesions. One of those patients had a high-grade CIN lesion. It is concluded that cervical HPV infection was rather common in women with external genital warts and it is valuable to examine cervical HPV infection by biopsy to detect concomitant CIN.
