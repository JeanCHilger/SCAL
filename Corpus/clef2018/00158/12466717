Distribution of human papillomavirus types in cervicovaginal washings from women evaluated in a sexually transmitted diseases clinic. Women evaluated for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) may be at increased risk for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a condition associated with cervical dysplasia. The distribution of HPV types in such a population is unknown.The goal was to determine the prevalence of HPV infection, the distribution of HPV types, and the type distribution in relation to cervical dysplasia in women in an STD clinic.Cervicovaginal lavage and Papanicolaou smear specimens were obtained from 295 women. Lavage specimens were analyzed for HPV by polymerase chain reaction/reverse blot strip assay.Cervical cytologic findings were abnormal for 19.7% of women. HPV DNA was detected in 49.2% of women (high-risk HPV in 42.4%). HPV positivity correlated with the degree of cytologic abnormality. In women with dysplasia, HPV types 16, 66, 83, 56, 52, and 59 were commonly detected. Specimens containing abundant HPV DNA occurred most often in women with dysplasia.HPV infection was common in women attending an STD clinic. Numerous individual HPV types were associated with cervical dysplasia, including "low-risk" types.
