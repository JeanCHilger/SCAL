High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types in patients with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). The aim of the paper was to determine the probability of joined occurrence of certain HPV types, particularly those with high oncogenic risk and histopathological (HP) findings (LGSIL and HGSIL, i.e., micro invasive and invasive carcinoma) as well as to find out to what extent either presence or absence of HPV can be identified in HP findings. The investigation was carried out on 48 patients. Based on a suspected colposcopy findings, Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and biopsy were performed and a histopathological analysis of the sample was carried out. A cervical smear was made on all the patients for HPV detection and typing. The results in the group with HPV, which showed histological diagnoses of LGSIL in 80% of cases, revealed numbers significantly higher with respect to the same summing up in the group where HPV was not detected (66.6%). HP findings of HGSIL in both groups were diagnosed in almost the same percentage and it should be taken into account that there were 6.7% of patients with Ca in situ in the group of HPV-positive patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that if a diagnosis of LGSIL or HGSIL, in particular, has been made on the basis of HP findings there is a great probability that it is a case of infection by one or more joined types of human papillomaviruses. The presence of virus specific genes in one of the stages of tumor development at the beginning of the infection indicates the viral etiology of tumors. The presence of HPV genome was not proved in 21% of patients with HGSIL. A multiple infection with different HPV types is more often found in patients with LGSIL than in those diagnosed with HGSIL. This demonstrates the selection of high oncogenic types and their persistence during the course of carcinoma progression.
