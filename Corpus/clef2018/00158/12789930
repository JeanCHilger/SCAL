Detection of HPV DNA in cervical specimens collected in cytologic solution by ligation-dependent PCR. To determine the feasibility and sensitivity of detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) in specimens collected in Cytyc PreservCyt fluid (Boxborough, Massachusetts, U.S.A.) using ligation-dependent polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) and to demonstrate the diagnostic value of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cytology in the detection of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), especially in cases of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS).LD-PCR is a recently invented DNA amplification technology that utilizes a capture probe for target isolation and 2 hemiprobes for target detection. The hemiprobes are designed in such a way that when they hybridize to their target, the 5' end of one probe and the 3' end of the other probe are brought together. Two hemiprobes can then be ligated into a full probe that can serve as a template for PCR amplification. A total of 94 cervical specimens were collected in cytologic fluid and tested with LD-PCR. The results were compared with those of the Digene Hybrid Capture II assay (HC II) (Beltville, Maryland, U.S.A.) and consensus PCR.The overall sensitivity for detecting HPV was 41.5% (39/94) by LD-PCR, 50% (47/94) by consensus PCR and 37.2% (35/94) by HC II. The prevalence of HPV by HC II, consensus PCR and LD-PCR were 87.5%, 100% and 87.5% in the high grade SIL group 100%, 90.9% and 90.9% in the low grade SIL groupLD-PCR is a useful method of detecting HPV in liquid-based gynecologic cytologic preservatives, and HPV testing as a method adjunct to the liquid-based Pap test could be useful in detecting SILs, especially for the management of patients with ASCUS.
