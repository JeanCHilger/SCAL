Delivering human papillomavirus testing to the public: one patient advocate's perspective. The availability of tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) will lead to increased use of HPV testing as part of cervical cancer screening. To reap the full benefit of HPV testing, that is, benefits both to the women being screened and to the medical system, a systematic public and provider education effort should be undertaken. Key elements of this effort are widely accepted guidelines, clear messages, development of partnerships, and strong leadership from the professional and patient communities. Lessons learned in other public health efforts, such as colorectal cancer screening and human immunodeficiency virus prevention, may be applicable to an HPV education effort.
