Alteration of P53 protein expression and p53 gene in laryngeal carcinoma. To study the prevalence of P53 protein expression and p53 gene mutation in laryngeal carcinoma.Using immunohistochemistry P53 expression was detected in 31 patients with laryngeal carcinoma. In 11 P53 negative patients,microdissection-PCR-HA technique was used to determine mutation in p53 exon 5, 6, 7, 8.Among the 31 patients tested with immunostaining, the overall average positive rate was 64.5%. Positive rates for T3 and T4 tumors were 86.7% vs 43.8% in T1 and T2 tumors.The positive rate was 91.7% in those with cervical node metastasis compared with 47.4% in those without lymph node metastasis. The positive P53 immunostaining was more frequently found in poor differentiated carcinoma (87.5%) and moderate-differentiated carcinoma (66.7%),than in well differentiated carcinoma (45.5%). The abnormal exon 5 or 7 of p53 gene were detected in 2 out of 11 cases, in which P53 was negative.P53 gene mutation is related with TNM grading and cervical lymph node metastasis in laryngeal carcinoma. P53 mutation tents to be correlated to pathologic grading.
