Role of HPV DNA testing in predicting cervical intraepithelial lesions: comparison of HC HPV and ISH HPV. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is widely accepted as the primary agent involved in the development of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma. Several commercial tests are available for detecting HPV DNA. This study compares the efficacy of INFORM HPV (in situ hybridization [ISH] HPV) and HCII (HC HPV) in predicting cervical lesions. A total of 762 sequential Papanicolaou (Pap) smears determined by cytologic examination to be either atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were tested by both Hybrid Capture (HC) HPV and ISH HPV 250 follow-up biopsies were reviewed as the reference standard for presence or absence of a lesion. ISH HPV and HC HPV differed significantly in accurately predicting biopsy findings from ASC-US and LSIL cases. The overall sensitivity and specificity of ISH HPV were 97% (28/29) and 86% (191/221)
