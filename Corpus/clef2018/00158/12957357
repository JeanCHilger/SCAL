Multiple HPV infection in cervical cancer screened by HPVDNAChip. This study determined the distribution of high-risk HPV type infection in cervical cancer using newly developed oligonucleotide chips (HPVDNAChips). The study subjects included 80 cases of cervical neoplasia and 746 controls with a normal Pap smear. For HPV genotyping, the commercially available HPVDNAChips was used. The risk of cervical cancer was increased in women with a family history of cervical cancer (adjusted OR=2.3, 95% CI: 0.92-6.17) and in smokers (adjusted OR=3.2, 95% CI: 1.45-7.06). There was also a trend of increased risk with the number of full term pregnancies (P(for trend)<0.001). There were only 7.2% (54 of 746) infected high-risk HPV types in the control, whereas 54.5% (six of 11) and 76.5% (52 of 68) were infected in the CIN and cervical cancer, respectively. Multiple HPV infection was observed in 0.5% (three of 592) of the control group but in 9.1% (seven of 77) of cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that subjects infected with multiple HPV types had a 31.8-fold (95% CI: 7.50-134.75) higher risk of cervical cancer, while the single HPV type had a 19.9-fold increased risk (95% CI: 10.90-36.18) (P(for trend)<0.001). These results show that the detection and typing of HPV infection by HPVDNAChip can be a useful in clinical applications because it provides information on multiple infections and the types of HPV in addition to HPV infection status.
