Production of human papillomavirus and modulation of the infectious program in epithelial raft cultures. OFF. Human papillomaviruses trophic for anogenital epithelia cause benign warts, and certain genotypes are closely associated with cervical neoplasia. By using our modifications of the epithelial raft culture system, we were able to recapitulate and modulate the infectious program of a papillomavirus in vitro for the first time. Small pieces of a condyloma containing human papillomavirus type 11 were explanted onto a dermal equivalent consisting of a collagen matrix with fibroblasts and were cultured at the medium-air interface. The infected stem cells proliferated rapidly across the matrix, stratified, and differentiated, as judged by histology. The results correlated with the state of epithelial differentiation, which, in turn, was dependent on the type of fibroblast in the matrix. Under conditions where the epithelial outgrowth underwent terminal differentiation, the entire productive program took place, leading to virion assembly. In contrast, using an alternative condition where the outgrowth failed to achieve terminal differentiation, only the E-region RNAs from the E1 promoter accumulated to any appreciable extent. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen was induced in the differentiated suprabasal cells in the productive cyst growth, which also exhibited high copy viral DNA and abundant E6-E7 RNAs. Comparable cells in the nonproductive cyst outgrowth were negative for all three. These results suggest that the E6 and E7 proteins may play a role in establishing a cellular environment conducive to vegetative viral replication. The culture conditions described should be useful for genetic analysis of this family of important human pathogens and for testing potential pharmacological agents.
