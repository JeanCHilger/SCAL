Colposcopic and histologic findings and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test variability in young women positive for HPV DNA. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease in women positive for HPV DNA by using a commercially available DNA detection kit and to compare these results to HPV DNA variability observed in repeated sampling. Young women attending family planning clinics who were positive for HPV DNA on routine screening were asked to return for a repeat HPV DNA test, cytology, colposcopy, and biopsy if indicated. Of the 78 women examined, 35% had biopsy-verified low-grade dysplasia of the cervix, and 64% had evidence of HPV-related disease somewhere in the anogenital area. Fifty percent of the women had a negative test on repeat sampling, but there was no association between DNA persistence at the second visit and colposcopic/histologic findings. In conclusion, the minority of women positive for HPV DNA have latent infection. In addition, variability in detection is common and unrelated to the presence of HPV-related disease.
