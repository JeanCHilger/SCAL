Multiple HPV 16-related squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva, vagina, anus, skin and cervix in a 31-year-old woman. A 31-year-old woman is reported with in the genital region multiple squamous carcinomas of the skin (buttock), vulva, vagina, anus and cervix uteri. All these carcinomas were HPV 16 positive as tested by DNA in situ hybridization. The existence of areas with normal epithelium between all tumor localisations and the absence of distant metastases indicate multicentric development of these multiple carcinomas. The presence of HPV 16 DNA in all carcinoma cells, as detected by DNA in situ hybridisation, argues for an etiological role of HPV 16 in the development of these multiple tumors.
