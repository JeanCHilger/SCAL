The demonstration of HPV DNA in cervical intraepithelial neoplasms and in invasive carcinomas of the cervix uteri by DNA-DNA in situ hybridization. Authors were applied a method of DNA-DNA in situ hybridization for demonstration of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 in cervical neoplasia and in invasion carcinoma of uterine neck. At 22 probes from CYV III and invasion carcinoma the results from hybridization with virus DNA were shown the presence of HPV-DNA at 15 patients. Some phases of method were optimized. Sensitiveness of method was controlled and compared with the results from the same probes, underlied to investigation with Southern-blot hybridization.
