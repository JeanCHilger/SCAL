Clinical significance and management of cervical atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance. To assess the clinical significance of a cervical cytological diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance and to formulate the most appropriate management guidelines for patients with such a diagnosis.Retrospective study.Regional hospital, Hong Kong.Seventy-two patients with diagnoses of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance who were managed in a colposcopy clinic between January 1998 and December 1999.Age, cytological diagnoses of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance and its subtypes, method of evaluation, final diagnosis, and outcome after 2 years.Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance were diagnosed in 83 (0.4%) of 21 854 cervical smear samples taken during the 2-year study period. Follow-up data were available from 72 patients, whose mean age was 43 years (range, 22-69 years). Forty-three percent of these patients had significant diseases of the genital tract. Patients with the subtype diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance-favour neoplasia had the worst outcome, with 90% of patients having significant disease, followed by patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance "not otherwise specified" (43%), and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance-favour reactive (8%).Patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance should be investigated early and thoroughly, because many of them will have premalignant or malignant disease.
