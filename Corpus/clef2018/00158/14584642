The current status of HPV DNA testing. Infection with high-risk types of HPV underlies most cases of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and practically all cases of invasive cervical cancer. Currently, cervical HPV DNA is detected by means of PCR and sandwich capture molecular hybridization methods. Research has focused on the potential role of HPV testing in three conditions: screening for cervical neoplasia, triage of women with low-grade lesions and follow-up after conservative surgical treatment for CIN. Concerning the first condition, HPV testing does not seem to offer an obvious advantage over traditional cytology screening, mainly due to false positive results in younger women with transient HPV infection. A possible exemption to this is the case of middle-aged women and low-resource settings, where the excellent sensitivity of a HPV test is desirable. Although data are controversial regarding low grade lesions, results from randomized studies indicate that HPV testing could be useful in a triage of women with an initial cytological diagnosis of ASCUS, where detection of DNA of a high-risk type should lead to colposcopy. Although there is a lack of randomized controlled trials in this field, data from observational studies indicate that HPV DNA testing after conservative surgical treatment for CIN may be very sensitive and detect early residual and recurrent disease.
