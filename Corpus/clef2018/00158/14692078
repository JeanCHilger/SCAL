HPV: from the cervical smear to the research bench to the court room. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted viruses in our culture, yet there is a high level of misunderstanding about its detection and usual biological course. The Pap smear, one of the most common specimens in a cytology laboratory, is one of the easiest ways to detect HPV infection. However, this is a screening test and comes with many diagnostic and laboratory management problems. The Pap smear accounts for one of the highest themes for malpractice suits, putting a great need on laboratories to maintain superb quality assurance measures. Much effort is underway toward better prevention and treatment of this virus. Decades from now, this now almost ubiquitous virus may prove to be a rare infection.
