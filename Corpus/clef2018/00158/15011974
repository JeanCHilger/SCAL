Human papillomavirus detection: verification with cervical cytology. Thirteen specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV), classified as high-risk for the development of cervical cancer, have been reported in 99.7% of all cervical cancers. For this reason, and because of the reported lack of sensitivity of the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear for detecting HPV, some experts believe that the use of papillomavirus DNA testing may replace cytology for routine gynecological screening. Our goal was to validate a commercial assay, the Digene Hybrid Capture-2 for the detection of human papillomavirus by comparing the results to cytological detection of cervical abnormalities.Cytology results of concurrent liquid-based Papanicolaou smears were compared to the Hybrid Capture-2 results. Correlation was assessed and discordant cytology results were reviewed.Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at Shreveport, Department of Pathology, HPV Diagnostic Laboratory.All liquid cytology specimens submitted for HPV testing between November 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001.Of the 291 cases tested by Hybrid Capture-2, 12% and 28% were positive with the low-risk and high-risk probes, respectively, and 265 had concurrent cytology results. Fourteen specimens testing positive only with the low-risk probe were not included in this comparison. Thus, the results for 251 of the 291 (86%) specimens tested for human papillomavirus DNA were compared to the original cytology report. Overall concordance between Hybrid Capture-2 and the original smear cytology result was 78%. Slide review reduced the number of discordant specimens from 22% to 12%.Based upon these data, we find the HPV assay to be useful as a routine screen for Human papillomavirus.
