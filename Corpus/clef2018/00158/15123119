Epidemiology of HPV infection. HPV DNA testing using Hybrid Capture 2 (Digene) was added to a program of liquid based (Thinprep, Cytyc) cervical cancer screening in a population of sexually active women aged from 20 to 62 years, without the history of uterine cervix pathology. 14.32% of 3832 women in this population were HPV positive. Positivity peaked in women aged 25-29 (19.4%) and gradually decreased, with 8% of positivity after 60 years. Positivity was independently related to parity, tobacco use and was correlated to cervical pathology. The rate of positivity in this population seems to preclude the use of HPV testing as a primary screening tool.
