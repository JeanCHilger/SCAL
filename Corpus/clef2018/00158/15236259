Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA by Hybrid Capture II in women referred due to atypical glandular cells in the primary screening. We assessed the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA (HPV-DNA) in women examined by a second Pap smear due to atypical glandular cells (AGC) detected in their screening Pap smear. In 91 women included in the study, a second Pap smear was taken and HPV-DNA test was performed using Hybrid Capture II (HC II). The second Pap smear showed no abnormalities in 28 (31%) cases, ACG in 17 (19%) cases, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or worse in 24 (26%). HC II test was positive in 36% of the cases. Considering the second Pap smear diagnosis, HPV-DNA was detected in 87% of the women with HSIL, 100% of women with in situ adenocarcinoma, and only in 11% of the women with no abnormalities. The use of the second Pap smear combined with HPV-DNA may improve the management of women with AGC in the primary screening.
