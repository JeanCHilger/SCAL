Genetic polymorphism of the interferon-gamma gene in cervical carcinogenesis. Beyond human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, host genetic factors may contribute to cervical carcinogenesis. This study aims to test the hypothesis that CA-dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the first intron of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) gene is associated with HPV-initiated cervical carcinogenesis. A hospital-based case-control study including patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs n = 93), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs
