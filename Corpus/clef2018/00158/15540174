Assessing the feasibility of single lifetime PAP smear evaluation between 41-50 years of age as strategy for cervical cancer control in developing countries from our 32 years of experience of hospital-based routine cytological screening. In view of the huge expenditure involved in mass cytological screening as well as lack of cytology manpower in the developing countries, single lifetime screening at 45 yr of age has been suggested as feasible strategy for control of cervical cancer. The present study is aimed at testing this hypothesis in a broader prospective, accommodating women between 41 and 50 yr of age from the data derived from the ongoing long-term hospital-based routine cervicovaginal cytology at Queen Mary's Hospital, Lucknow, India. The cervical smears of 31,032 women have been evaluated cytologically during a span of 32 yr (April 1971-March 2003) for early detection of carcinoma cervix and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The incidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) was found to be 6.1% while frank malignancy was seen in 0.5% of cases. The following observations were made from the accumulated cytological data: (a) approximately 30% of the total cancer cases was in the age group of 41-50 yr (b) the maximum number of SIL cases was detected in women between 41 and 50 yr of age (35% of the total SIL cases), and adequate management of these SIL cases would prevent cancer cases from occurring in later years, thus minimizing the maximum incidence of 1.3% observed in women beyond 50 yr of age
