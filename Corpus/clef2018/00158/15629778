High levels of p105 (NFKB1) and p100 (NFKB2) proteins in HPV16-transformed keratinocytes: role of E6 and E7 oncoproteins. We have previously shown that functional components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway are up-regulated and sequestered in the cytoplasm of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)-transformed cell lines leading to a reduced activity of NF-kappaB. In this study, we examined the expression of the NF-kappaB precursors p100 and p105 in keratinocytes transformed or not by HPV16. Western immunoblotting experiments demonstrated high levels of p100 and p105 proteins not only in HPV16+ cervical carcinoma-derived keratinocytes but also in keratinocytes stably transfected by HPV16 E6 or E7 oncogenes. Moreover, p100 and p105 proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear in keratinocytes expressing E7 and E6, respectively. A predominantly cytoplasmic localization of E7 protein was also detected in all keratinocytes expressing E7. Our results suggest that HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins modulate the expression and the subcellular localization of p100 and p105 NF-kappaB precursors.
