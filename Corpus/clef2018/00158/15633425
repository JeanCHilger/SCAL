HPV testing is an integral component of cervical cancer screening. This article presents general overview of molecular biologic methods current used in HPV diagnostic. Methods are divided according to its principle to three groups--hybridization based, PCR based and combined both of this principle. The review would help select optimum methodics for routinely screening, for causal clinical diagnostics of HPV associated diseases or for research study. From this context arise need of theoretical rudiments and experience for HPV diagnostics.Review article.Sikl's Department of Pathology, Charles University, Medical Faculty Hospital Pilzen, Czech Republic.
