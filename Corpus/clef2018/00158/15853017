Correlation of conventional and liquid-based cytology and their meaning in management of precancerous cervical lesions. Introduction of efficiency of liquid-based citoscreen cytologyConventional cytology with Papanicolaou method and comparison with novel cytology liquid-based method in women with histological findings associated to Human Papilloma Virus praecancerous lesions for "gold standard" method.100 women with praecancerous cervical lesions were included in the study. In all of the women, biopsy and endocervical curettage were made, and histological results were taken as a "gold standard". From the histology: LSIL was found in 64 women (64%) and HSIL in 36 women (36%). In LSIL, in 8 women the lesions are associated with existence of HPV or with coilocitic atipya and the other 56 women were with CIN 1. In group with HSIL, in 26 women was found CIN 2, 6 women were with CIN 3 and 4 women with CIS. In all women from both groups, conventional PAP and LBC cytoscreen were made. The results from conventional PAP were adequate in 42 women (42%), sub diagnosis in 34 (34%), over diagnosis in 10 (10%) and false-negative in 14 (14%). The results from LBC cytoscreen were adequate in 56 (56%), sub diagnosis in 22 (22%), over diagnosis in 16 (16%) and false-negative in 6 (6%). Sensitivity for PAP test is 84% and for LBC 94%.LBC cytoscreen method is better than the conventional PAP test in detection of the cervical epithlial abnormalities.
