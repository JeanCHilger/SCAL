A cost-effectiveness analysis of screening strategies for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To assess the costs and usefulness of colposcopy using three screening strategies for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).A decision model compared three screening strategies for CIN: (1) patients were screened annually with a conventional Pap smear, (2) patients were screened annually with a liquid-based cytologic method and reflex human papillomavirus testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance results, and (3) patients were screened biennially with a liquid-based cytologic method and reflex human papillomavirus testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance results.Biennial liquid-based screening was the least expensive strategy with a cost of $9.5 million per 100,000 patients. Annual liquid-based screening was the most expensive strategy at $13.7 million. Annual conventional screening had an intermediate cost of $11.6 million. Biennial liquid-based screening referred the fewest patients to colposcopy (11.8%), followed by annual conventional screening and annual liquid-based screening (15.2% and 15.6%, respectively).Each of these treatment strategies is reasonable however, biennial liquid-based screening would reduce medical costs significantly.
