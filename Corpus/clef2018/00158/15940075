Intraepithelial cervical squamous lesions: comparison between PAP-test, colposcopy, phase contrast microscopy and histology usefulness of their synergic use. In the last 10 years the tumors of cervix have showed a significant reduction in incidence, while the preneoplastic lesions are increased (linked often to human papilloma virus [HPV] infection), and so it is enhanced the role of early diagnosis.The Authors have examined 124 patients at colposcopy showing transformation zone anomalies and/or HPV infections. The patients have submitted to PAP-test, phase contrast microscopy and to biopsy.The analysis of our cases show oneself better sensitivity of colposcopy than cytologic exam, in particular in the diagnosis of low grade intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), corresponding to CIN 1 and HPV lesions.Phase contrast microscopy, by search of possible preneoplastic elements in the smear, is a complementary technique, and if performed systematically and by qualified operators allows to reduce furthermore false negative rate. The synergic use of tools allows to increase of number of intrecervical neoplasia diagnosis. The following cost's increase cannot be considered an obstacle and it is not should be necessary to counsel always the colposcopy in case of anomalous PAP smear revealed during screening.
