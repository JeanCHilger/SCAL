High-throughput cervical cancer screening using intracellular human papillomavirus E6 and E7 mRNA quantification by flow cytometry. The Papanicolaou (Pap) test, based solely on the morphologic examination of exfoliated cells from the cervix, has reduced deaths due to cervical cancer by 74% in the United States during the past 40 years. During that time, the molecular mechanisms of cervical cancer have largely been elucidated. Taken together, these observations have identified a need for a high-throughput cervical cancer screening assay. We report the development of a high-throughput assay consisting of simultaneous immunophenotyping and ultrasensitive in situ hybridization for human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 messenger RNA (mRNA). This assay can be performed in less than 3 hours directly from liquid-based cervical cytology specimens. Overall, HPV fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for E6 and E7 mRNA demonstrated 83.3% sensitivity and 91.3% specificity for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions compared with the Pap test in 231 liquid-based cytology samples from 2 cohorts. In a subset of these samples, HPV FISH demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than Hybrid Capture (Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) for high-risk genotypes.
