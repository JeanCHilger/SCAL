Cervical screening and human papillomavirus. Cervical screening in Australia has been successful in reducing the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection and an integral agent in the development of cervical cancer.This article discusses cervical screening, HPV infection and counselling women with low grade abnormalities on cervical cytology.For most women, detectable HPV infection is transient and subclinical.
