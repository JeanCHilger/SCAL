Usefulness of HPV testing in the follow-up of untreated cervical low grade lesions. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the usefulness of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing for the follow-up of women with untreated low grade cervical squamous cell lesions (LSIL). For that, 412 women with a cytological diagnosis of LSIL at entry were monitored by cytology, HR-HPV testing with the Hybrid Capture II assay (HC-II) and colposcopy. Our primary endpoint was clinical progression defined by the presence of a high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 and CIN3) at the biopsy. At baseline, histological control revealed 10 CIN2 and 11 CIN3 only in the cohort of women HR-HPV+. In the follow-up, 4 CIN2 and 8 CIN3 were detected, always in the women initially HR-HPV+. Thus, the recurrence of a HR-HPV+ infection clearly selects a population at high-risk for CIN2-3. The semi-quantitative appreciation of the viral load with HC-II could not be used as a good prognostic factor for the follow-up of women with LSIL. HR-HPV testing reduces the number of cytology and colposcopy examinations in the follow-up of women aged >35 years when HPV testing is initially negative. Thus HR-HPV testing should be reserved for the follow-up of this population of women initially HR-HPV+ and proposed 6 to 12 months after the cytological diagnosis of LSIL.
