Value and feasibility of HPV DNA test in cervical scraping smears. To investigate the reliability and feasibility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test in cervical scraping smears with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 131 cases of cervical scraping specimens were collected, and the positive rates and accuracy of HPV infection were determined in normal subjects and cervical cancer patients. GP5+/GP6+ and E7 primer pairs designed for detecting HPV L1 and HPV type 16 E7 were tested in this study. Our results showed that positive rates of HPV DNA in normal population and cervical cancer patients were 32.99% and 73.53% respectively and there was significant difference between them (P < 0.001). In normal subjects, detection rates of HPV DNA with GP5+/GP6+ and E7 primer pairs were 27.84% and 16.49% respectively, with statistically significant difference between them (P > 0.05). However the detection rates in cervical cancer patients were 38.24% and 67.65% for the two markers, with a significant difference found between them (P < 0.05). It is concluded that HPV DNA test with PCR for cervical scraping smears was feasible. GP5+/GP6+ primer pairs may be a useful probe to screen HPV infection in normal population, but they are not sensitive enough in cervical cancer patients. It is suggested that high risk type HPV DNA test was very useful in population with high risk of cervical cancer.
