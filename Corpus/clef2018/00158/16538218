Parallel cyclin E and cyclin A expression in neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. Cyclin E levels are high during late G1 and early S-phase in normal cells. The cyclin E expression over the cell cycle in tumours is not fully known. The impact on patient outcome by high cyclin E levels during other parts of the cell cycle than late G1- and early S-phase is unknown. We set out to study the expression of cyclin E over the cell cycle in cervical carcinomas. Using immunofluorescence staining of cyclin A, digital microscopy, and digital image analysis, we determined which cells in a tissue section that were in S- or G2-phase. M-phase cells were detected by morphology. By simultaneously staining for cyclin E, we investigated the variation in cyclin E levels over the cell cycle in cervical carcinoma lesions. In a case-control study, in which each deceased patient was matched with a patient still alive and well after >5 years of follow-up, we found that the deceased patients had a considerably higher fraction of cyclin A-positive cells staining for cyclin E than the survivors (n = 36). We conclude that parallel cyclin E and cyclin A expression is an indicator for poor outcome in cervical carcinomas. In addition, we investigated the expression pattern of cyclin E and cyclin A in consecutive biopsy samples from cervical carcinomas at different stages, as well as in human papillomavirus positive or negative adenocarcinomas in order to further study the cyclin E and cyclin A expression pattern in neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix.
