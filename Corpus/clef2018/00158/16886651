Follow-up of high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (H-SIls) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women. analysis of risk factors. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women are at high risk of co-infection from human papillomavirus (HPV) and of developing squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix.From April 1997 to March 1999, 86 women, affected by high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (H-SILs), were enrolled: 41 were HIV+ (CD4+ count >500/ml) and 45 were HIV-. The diagnosis of high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (H-SIL) was established for each patient by Pap test, colposcopy and guided biopsy. For all samples, the HPV/DNA test was also performed by PCR. The patients' lesions and recurrence were treated by cone biopsy or large loop excision (LEEP). Annual controls were performed for 5 years.A high rate of alcohol and drug use (60.7% vs. 31.4% p=0.004Our findings suggest the treatment of H-SIL in HIV-positive women, for a longer disease-free survival, or a lower risk of developing cervical cancer.
