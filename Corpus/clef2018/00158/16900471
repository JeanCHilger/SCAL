Dutch solutions for liquid-based cytology: analysis of unsatisfactory slides and HPV testing of equivocal cytology. The liquid-based techniques to obtain microscopy slides for cervical screening have replaced conventional smears almost completely in the USA, but not in all European countries. The decision making process to use liquid-based cytology (LBC) for nationwide screening programs depends on the health system. In a pilot study of over 7,000 screenees, we analyzed the unsatisfactory LBC slides and tested the equivocal cytologies for HPV by using the LiPA test. For comparison over 48,000 conventional screening data were used. Compared to conventional smears, the LBC slides were highly cellular, the state of fixation was much better, and obscuring blood did not exist. The unsatisfactory rate showed an increase from 262/100,000 (conventional smears) to 357/100,000 (LBC slides) due to too thick, undiagnosable epithelial fragments on the LBC slides. HPV testing of the equivocal cytology leads to a better patient management and less unnecessary referrals.
