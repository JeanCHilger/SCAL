Introducing HPV triage into the English cervical cancer screening program: consequences for participation. To predict the likely impact of adding human papillomavirus (HPV) triage for minor abnormalities on participation in the English cervical cancer screening program.Contingent valuations of the existing Pap program and a possible HPV-augmented screening program, obtained from questionnaires completed by 1141 women in east-central England.The value of participating in Pap screening was negatively associated with age, positively associated with educational level, and positively associated with the level of household income. Higher levels of worry about cervical cancer were associated with higher valuations of screening. Adding HPV-based triage to the Pap program lowered the value of screening participation for only two women, whereas for the sample as a whole, it increased the average valuation by about 47 percent. Supposedly-negative characteristics of HPV testing, when described, were expected to trigger psychosocial concerns in respondents and thereby give rise to significant decreases in valuations of participating in a Pap-plus-HPV program. For most women, however, such information changed their valuations of participation in screening little, if at all.Accepting the proposition that higher contingent valuations indicate stronger behavioural preferences, our results offer insubstantial grounds for believing that the inclusion of HPV triage would detrimentally affect participation in Pap screening for cervical cancer.
