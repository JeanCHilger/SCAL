HPV testing and Pap test: role for a combined approach in a non-screened population. The aim of the present study was to test the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a tool to identify human papillomavirus (HPV) in routine cytological samples scraped from the uterine cervix. Moreover, attention has been focused on the correlation between HPV types and early intraepithelial lesions. The study involved 586 women who had undergone conventional Pap test. Analysis of HPV infection was performed by PCR and HPV typing by dot blot. In a group of 78 cases histologically diagnosed as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), the cytological diagnosis was correct in 92.3% and the HPV test was positive in 89.8% of cases combined positivity at Pap and/or HPV tests raised this figure to 99.0%. In a group of 67 cases histologically diagnosed as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), the cytological diagnosis was correct in 73.1% and the PCR-based HPV test was positive in 64.2%
