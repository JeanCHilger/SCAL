Alternating high-risk human papillomavirus infection: consequences of progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Nearly every Dutch woman will be exposed to genital human papillomavirus (HPV) at least once during her lifetime, and most likely several times. In the current study, the authors investigated the prevalence of high-risk-HPV (HR-HPV) infection and the likelihood of progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).In this study, the course of HR-HPV infection in 703 women was observed. From a database of 720,016 negative cytology smears, the authors selected 703 women based on the availability of at least 2 HR-HPV polymerase chain reaction tests. The authors database stores not only the HPV data but also all other cytologic and histologic data, allowing the detection of women who progressed from negative cytology to CIN within a period of 10 years.Of the 703 selected women, 159 were found to have alternating HR-HPV infection (change from a negative HR-HPV test to a positive test or vice versa), 40 had a persistently positive HR-HPV test, and 504 women had a persistently negative HR-HPV test. The percentage of alternating HPV infection declined over time from 37% to 7%. Of the women age older than 40 years, 17% had an alternating HR-HPV infection, 2 of whom developed CIN. These findings led the authors to conclude that all the women in the current study with an increased risk of developing type 2 or 3 CIN were identified using 2 HPV tests. Women age older than 40 years still have a significant risk of acquiring a HR-HPV.In light of the current study findings, the authors believe it is worth considering the inclusion of women age 40 years and older who have negative cytology for HPV testing as part of the Dutch national screening program.
