Synchronous vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) of warty type and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN): case report. Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is a precancerous lesion of the vulva, which has been referred to in the past with varied terminology. It can be associated with multicentricity of other neoplastic squamous lesions in the cervix and vagina. We report a case of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and concomitant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a 30 year old female. An attempt is made to put forth the recent terminology of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.
