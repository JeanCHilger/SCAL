Inhibiting E7 oncogene in CaSki cells of cervical cancer by vector-based RNA interference technique. To test of the effect of vector-based RNA interference (RNAi) technique on inhibiting HPV16E7 gene in CaSki cells of cervical cancer.The HPV16E7-specific siRNA expression vectors P1, P2 and P3 were constructed and transfected into CaSki cells by liposome. The expression of HPV16E7 mRNA and protein were detected by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot.The expression of HPV16E7 mRNA and protein decreased with the transfection of P1, P2 and P3. Vector P1 had the strongest inhibition effect, with an inhibition rates of 92.86% and 81.0% for the expression of HPV16E7 mRNA and protein respectively three weeks after transfection.The expression of E7 gene in CaSki cells can be inhibited by HPV16E7-specific siRNA expression vector.
