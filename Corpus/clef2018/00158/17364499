Detection of autoantibodies to survivin in cervical mucus from patients with human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer and precursor lesions. To investigate the prevalence of mucosal autoantibodies to survivin in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer and precursor lesions.Cervical mucus from 117 HPV-associated cervical cancer, 102 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 107 low-grade SIL (LSIL), and 80 normal controls were tested by ELISA using either full length recombinant survivin or survivin-derived peptides. Survivin expression in cervical tissue biopsies was studied by Western Blotting.Cervical mucus from 33 cervical cancer (28.2%), 17 HSIL (16.6%), and 8 LSIL (7.4%) patients reacted with recombinant survivin. The IgA-class antibody response was significantly higher than that observed in the normal controls. The level of mucosal anti-survivin response was associated to the level and intensity of survivin expression in the different lesions. Finally, reactivity against a survivin Nt-derived peptide was found more frequently than reactivity against a Ct-derived peptide.IgA-class autoantibodies against survivin are present in a substantial proportion of cervical mucus from patients with HPV-associated cervical cancer, and precursor lesions. Mucosal anti-survivin response is positively associated with the level of survivin expression and the grade of cervical lesion.
