What does HPV vaccination mean for gynecologic cancer screening?. Human papilloma viruses (HPV) of the high-risk type cause almost all cervical carcinomas and some other anogenital tumors. Development of a carcinoma is uncommon most infections heal spontaneously. When carcinomas develop, the latent phase is at least 8, more often 15-30 years. A negative HPV test thus excludes the risk of developing cervical carcinoma for many years. The approved vaccine against HPV 6/11/16/18 and the soon-to-be-approved one against HPV 16/18 are extremely safe and effective. Vaccinated individuals are almost 100% protected by the vaccines containing virus-like particles. Current studies suggest that 70-80% of high-grade cervical neoplasias can be avoided, as well as other vaginal, vulvar, and anal neoplasias. The yearly costs for treating precursors of these cancers exceed the cost of vaccinating all girls born in a given year. Thus HPV vaccination is cost effective, even when a modified cancer screening program is retained.
