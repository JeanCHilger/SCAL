Management and triage of women with human papillomavirus infection in follow-up for low-grade cervical disease: association of HPV-DNA and RNA-based methods. Type-specific persistent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant risk factor for the development of cervical diseases. Persistent infection could be further refined by a sequencing approach to detect early cervical lesions that are at high risk of developing an invasive squamous cervical cancer. The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical utility of detecting mRNA transcripts of HPV oncogenes E6/E7 by using a Real-time NASBA technology (mRNA test) and to identify women with low-grade cytological disease but with an increased risk of developing high-grade cervical abnormalities or invasive squamous cervical cancer. Our preliminary results show that E6/E7 is detected in only a subset of HR-HPV-positive cases. Since viral persistence is considered to be the true precursor of neoplastic progression, only the detection of E6/E7 mRNA can identify the infection which is more likely to persist and induce neoplasia in future. For these reasons we believe that this test would be useful for the characterization of women with HR-HPV DNA positivity who should be effectively treated because at high-risk of developing a high grade cervical lesion or an invasive squamous cervical cancer.
