Adolescent cervical dysplasia: histologic evaluation, treatment, and outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate histologic findings and outcomes among adolescents with cervical dysplasia.Patient charts (2001-2005) were reviewed. Prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 2 and 3 and progression and regression were recorded.Five hundred one patients were identified. On biopsy, 324 patients (65%) had CIN 1 or less, and 177 patients (35%) had CIN > or = 2. Twenty-nine percent of the patients with CIN 2 opted for conservative treatment vs excision. Over 18 months, the condition of 65% of the patients regressed the condition of 20% of the patients was stable, and the condition of 5% of the patients progressed without cancer. Of the patients who underwent excision (follow-up median, 26 months), 84% experienced regression of their conditionCIN > or = 2 is present in 35% of our cohort. Most had CIN 2, and most experienced regression. Our observation supports continued vigilance in the evaluation of adolescents but suggests that less intervention for CIN 2 may be acceptable.
