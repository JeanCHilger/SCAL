Interobserver variability in human papillomavirus test results in cervicovaginal cytologic specimens interpreted as atypical squamous cells. We studied interobserver variability in the proportions of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive results for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) diagnoses among 5 pathologists from the me laboratory during a 2-year period. These proportions were compared with individual pathologist's ASCUS/squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) ratios. Of 1,299 ASCUS diagnoses, 32.3% had HPV testing 49.4% were HPV+. Positive findings by individual pathologists ranged from 38% to 67% (P = .057). There was a difference in the proportions of high risk HPV results for individual pathologists (P < .001). For the pathologist who diagnosed 38% (23/61) of samples as HPV+, the ASCUS/SIL was 0.58
