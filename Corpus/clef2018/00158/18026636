Molecular detection of HPV 16 and 18 in cervical samples of patients from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of HPV infection and the types 16 and 18 in cervical samples from patients attended at two public health services of the city of Belo Horizonte, MG.Cervical samples from 174 patients were collected for cytopathological and molecular tests. HPV infection was searched by PCR utilizing MY09 and MY11 primers or HPV 16 and HPV 18 specific primers.Amongst the 174 samples analyzed, 20.7% presented squamous intraepithelial and/or invasive lesions detected on cytopathological analysis and of those, 94.4% were infected by HPV. HPV 16 was found in 20% of the cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and in 40% and 50% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and squamous invasive carcinoma, respectively. HPV 18 was detected in 6.7% of the low-grade lesion samples and in two HPV16 co-infected samples. In 50% of the cases of high-grade lesion, the HPV type was not determined.The HPV 16 was the virus type more frequently detected. However, more than 50% of the positive samples at the cytopathological analysis were negative for HPV 16 and 18, indicating that possibly other virus types are present in relative high frequencies in the studied population.
