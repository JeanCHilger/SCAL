Reducing the burden of glandular carcinomas of the uterine cervix. Widespread use of the Papanicolaou test for the screening of cervical cancers has lead to a significant decline in overall incidence and mortality rates over the past 3 decades. When different histologic types of cervical cancers are considered and trends are reexamined, it becomes apparent that observed declines are reflective of squamous cell carcinomas predominantly the rates for adenocarcinomas continue to rise. This rise in incidence may be due to the greater difficulty in screening for glandular precursor lesions that often arise high within the endocervical canal. Reducing the incidence and mortality rates that are associated with adenocarcinomas can be accomplished by using improved screening techniques and large-scale implementation of cervical cancer vaccines that target the predominant oncogenic human papillomavirus types that are associated with adenocarcinoma.
