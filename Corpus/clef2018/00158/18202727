Usefulness of HPV test on cell sample from the cervix. New guidelines for triaging equivocal and low-grade cytology specimens with testing were implemented in the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Programme in July 2005.The Regional Health Authority in Western Norway analyzed 951 HPV samples from an elective patient group from October 2003 to October 2005. HPV test results were compared with those from previous, concomitant and later cytology and possible biopsy. High risk HPV was identified using Hybrid Capture II, a commercially available HPV test.A cytological or morphological correlate could be achieved (from previous cytology tests, follow-up cytology and results from biopsy) in 86% of the patients with a positive HPV test. The sensitivity for detection of high-grade lesions was 93% for the HPV test and 78% for cytology. The negative predictive value for not having a high-grade lesion (negative HPV, normal cytology) was >99.3%. The results so far support the use of HPV testing in addition to cytology testing at follow-up of women with equivocal or low-grade cell changes.
