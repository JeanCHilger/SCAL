Evaluation of hybrid capture 2 HPV DNA test and two variants of polymerase chain reaction (PCR-PGMY11/ PGMY09 and PCR-CPI/CPIIG) according to HPV types. [corrected] The choice of diagnostic tool for the detection of oncogenic HPV types affects in a great manner on the uterine cervical carcinoma prevention in women with early stage of cervical dysplasia.In this study 148 women with three subsequent cervical cytologic tests within two years showing mild dyskaryosis (Pap II) were enrolled. HPV infection was determined using three molecular approachs: Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA test and two variants of polymerase chain reaction (PCR-PGMY11/PGMY09 and PCR-CPI/CPIIG). HPV typing was performed by RFLP of PCR-PGMY11/ PGMY09 products.By HR-hc2 test, infection was detected in 32 of 38 HPV positive samples determined by minimally one approach. The results were negative for 6 samples with HPV infection caused by HPV6b, HPV44, HPV53 in 2/4 cases, HPV68 types and by multiple infection with four different HPV types: HPV66+HPV72+HPV73+HPV53, as well. Infections caused by low risk HPV types HPV6b and HPV44 were confirmed by using LR-hc2.hc2 HPV DNA test has satisfactory compatibility with both PCR variants according to HPV types. In the prevention of cervical carcinoma, high prevalence of new high risk HPV73 type and "probable high risk" HPV53 and HPV26 types in analyzed group of women should contribute to the fast production of new generation of the test enriched with RNA specific probes against mentioned oncogenic HPV types.
