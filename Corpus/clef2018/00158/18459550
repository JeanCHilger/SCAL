Knowledge about and attitudes to pap smears, cervical cancer and human papillomavirus among women in Slovenia. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) play a vital role in the development of precancerous changes or cancer in the uterine cervix. Prophylactic vaccination has proven to be an effective measure to reduce the incidence of precancerous changes in the uterine cervix and thereby also of cervical cancer. A population investigation was performed in Slovenia with the aim of determining the level of knowledge and awareness of women about cervical cancer, Pap test, HPV infection and preventive vaccination. The investigation was executed by computer-aided telephone inquiry in the period from 5-22 September 2006 on a sample of 500 women aged from 18 to 55 years from all regions of Slovenia. From the results it may be concluded that, in Slovenia, there is an urgent need to provide the lay population and medical community with relevant and accurate information on HPV infection, on early detection of cervical cancer and preventive vaccination.
