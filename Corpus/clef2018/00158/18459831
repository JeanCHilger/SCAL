Occurrence of human papillomavirus 16 and 18 in smears from the two cervix regions of onco-gynecological patients in Slovakia. We evaluated the relevance of tests for Human papillomavirus 16 and 18 (HPV-16, HPV-18) in two cervix regions (exocervical and endocervical) separately. The total of 142 cervical smears obtained from 91 women in Slovakia attending onco-gynecological outpatient care were examined for the presence of HPVs by PCR with the general primers GP5 and GP6 (GP5/6). The HPV-positive smears were examined for the presence of HPV-16 and HPV-18 and the results compared with cytological assessment. In 73 HPV-positive smears, the number of cases with detected HPV-16 was about three times higher in exocervix and about two times higher in endocervix in comparison with number of cases with detected HPV-18. In the smears considered as normal by cytology, two times higher occurrence of HPV-18 in endocervical smears was found in comparison with exocervical ones. Eight patients were double-infected with HPV-16 and HPV-18, but no patient was infected with these HPVs in both cervical regions. This finding emphasized the importance of examination of both cervical regions separately. Overlooking of the endocervical canal for the close examination by cytology and PCR might increase the failure to detect HPVs associated with adenocarcinoma.
