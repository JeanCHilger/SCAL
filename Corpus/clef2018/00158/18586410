A notable accessory screening program for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test is implemented to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in Taiwan. However, the utility of that has limitations. High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is an important risk factor in development of cervical cancer. In this study, we estimate the utility of HR-HPV testing in the screening of CIN.Firstly, 726 subjects were recruited and willing to prove cervical exfoliated epithelial cells for Pap smear screening and HR-HPV DNA testing. Subsequently, 205 of the eligible subjects with greater than or equal to CIN1 of Pap smear results were asked to perform histologic diagnosis that served as a gold standard for the estimation of the effects of both Pap smear and HR-HPV testing.The histology is significantly associated with HR-HPV infection, as well as significantly highly correlated with the individuals who have both Pap smear greater than or equal to CIN1 and positive HR-HPV infection but not significantly correlated with the individuals who only have Pap smear greater than or equal to CIN1 but without HR-HPV infection.Combinative surveillance of HR-HPV infection and Pap smear is a useful tool to detect and monitor precancerous lesions in the screening program. HR-HPV testing is a notable accessory screening program for detection of CIN in Taiwanese women.
