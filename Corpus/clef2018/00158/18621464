Prognostic significance of the detection of human papilloma virus L1 protein in smears of mild to moderate cervical intraepithelial lesions. To investigate whether it is possible to use detection of the human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid protein to predict the course of mild or moderate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Pap smears from 279 women in whom CIN 1 and CIN 2 had been diagnosed by cytology and histology, who were known to have a high-risk HPV status and had a median follow-up of 25 months, were immunohistochemically stained for the HPV L1 protein. The staining results were correlated with the clinical course of the disease.HPV L1-positive patients showed regression in 49.1% of cases, stable disease in 41.5%, and progressive disease in 9.4%, whereas HPV L1-negative women had progression in 25.9% of cases (regression 33.3%, stable disease 40.7% p=0.001). The effect was clearest in the group under 30 years of age. HPV L1-negative patients experienced progression significantly more often than women with a positive HPV L1 test (odds ratio 3.391).HPV L1-positivity was found to have prognostic significance in relation to disease progression in women with CIN 1 and CIN 2 and particularly in those less than 30 years of age.
