High level of HPV 16 and 18 DNA load in anal swabs from male and female HIV-1 infected patients. Despite HAART, the prevalence and incidence of anal cancer in HIV-infected individuals have increased. Recently, the relationship between the severity of cervical lesions and oncogenic HPV load was demonstrated however, few studies have assessed the level and the significance of oncogenic HPV load in patients at risk for anal neoplasia.To assess HPV genotypes and HPV 16/18 DNA load in HIV-1 infected patients at risk for anal neoplasia.Cross-sectional pilot study from male and female HIV-1 infected individuals at risk for anal neoplasia in an outpatient HIV Clinical Unit of Marseilles university Hospitals.Anal HPV was found in 79% of the patients whereas high-risk (HR) HPV types and infection with multiple HPV types were found in 83% and 61% of the patients, respectively. Using a sensitive real-time PCR, median HPV 16 and 18 DNA load were 5 x 10(6) copies/10(6) cells and 3.2 x 10(5) copies/10(6) cells, respectively. Notably, there were no significant differences in the HPV 16/18 viral loads with respect to the anoscopic results.Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the link between high anal HPV DNA load and progression to anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal cancer.
