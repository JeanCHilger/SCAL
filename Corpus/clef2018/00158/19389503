Genomic amplification of the human telomerase RNA gene for differential diagnosis of cervical disorders. To evaluate genomic amplification of the human telomerase RNA gene (TERC) as a supportive approach to cytopathology or histopathology in diagnosis of low-grade and high-grade uterine cervical lesions, 1,033 Chinese women at three medical centers had liquid-based thin-layer cytopathologic examination and TERC detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Human papillomavirus DNA testing, colposcopy with or without biopsy, and histopathologic examination were conducted as needed. In cytopathologic examination, genomic amplification of TERC was found in 30 of 659 (4.6%) normal or benign cellular changes in 23 of 170 (13.5%) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)
