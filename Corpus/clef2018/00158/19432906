Human papillomavirus infections among Japanese women: age-related prevalence and type-specific risk for cervical cancer. To obtain baseline data for human papillomavirus (HPV) screening and vaccination in Japan, we analyzed HPV DNA data from 2282 Japanese women (1517 normal cytology, 318 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] grade 1, 307 CIN2-3, and 140 invasive cervical cancer [ICC]) that visited the University of Tsukuba Hospital or Ibaraki Seinan Medical Center Hospital for screening or treatment of cervical diseases between 1999 and 2007. An L1-based PCR method was used for individual HPV genotyping. The most common HPV types in ICC were, in order of decreasing prevalence, HPV16 (40.5%), HPV18 (24.4%), HPV52 (8.4%), HPV58 (3.1%), and HPV33 (3.1%). Based on the comparison of HPV type distributions between normal cytology and CIN2-3 and ICC, estimated risk of disease progression varied considerably by genotype: HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV52, and HPV58 (prevalence ratio, 1.92 95% confidence interval 1.58-2.34)
