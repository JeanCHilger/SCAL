CDH1 polymorphism and its association with the risk of cervical cancer. To investigate the effect of CDH1 3'-UTR + 54C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on expression of luciferase reporter gene and its association with susceptibility to cervical cancer.The luciferase gene expression vectors containing CDH1 3'-UTR+54C/T SNP C or T allelotype were constructed. The effect of CDH1 3'-UTR+54C/T SNP on expression of luciferase reporter gene in 293 T cells were tested by daul luciferase reporter assay system. The CDH1 3'-UTR+54C/T SNP was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in 280 cervical cancer patients and 330 healthy controls.The luciferase activity analysis showed that the relative luciferase activity (RLA) of 293T cells with C allelotype was 1.46, which was significantly lower than that of the 293 T cells with T allelotype (3.01 t = 2.94, P = 0.042). There was no significant difference in age distribution between the cervical cancer patients and the healthy controls. The genotype frequency distribution of CDH1 3'-UTR+54C/T SNP in healthy controls did not significantly differ from that expected by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). The C allelotype frequency of CDH1 in cervical cancer patients was 80.%, which was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (74.5%The C allelotype of CDH1 3'-UTR + 54C/T SNP might decrease the expression of luciferase reporter gene and the C/C genotype might be a potential risk for cervical cancer development
