Postpartum outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in pregnant women determined by route of delivery. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) has its highest incidence during women's reproductive years. During 2 sequential 7-year periods, 1994 to 2000 and 2001 to 2007, 3695 and 3894 deliveries were performed, respectively, at Osaka University Hospital. CIN was detected in 21 cases (0.57%) during 1994-2000 and in 43 cases (1.1%) during 2001-2007. By comparison, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-complicated pregnancies increased significantly in the latter period (P = .015 by Fisher exact test, Odds ratio = 1.95 95%CI: 1.16-3.30). We observed CIN regression in 34 (76%) of 45 cases of vaginal delivery and in 6 (50%) of 12 cases of cesarean delivery, indicating that the outcome of an initially diagnosed CIN and the delivery routes appeared not to be significantly related. However, a different result was obtained when only those patients whose CIN lesions persisted until the delivery were analyzed. Among the 35 such cases in the vaginal delivery group, 24 cases (69%) regressed after the delivery
