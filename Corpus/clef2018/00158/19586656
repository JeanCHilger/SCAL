Efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine against cervical infection and precancer caused by oncogenic HPV types (PATRICIA): final analysis of a double-blind, randomised study in young women. The human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was immunogenic, generally well tolerated, and effective against HPV-16 or HPV-18 infections, and associated precancerous lesions in an event-triggered interim analysis of the phase III randomised, double-blind, controlled PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA). We now assess the vaccine efficacy in the final event-driven analysis.Women (15-25 years) were vaccinated at months 0, 1, and 6. Analyses were done in the according-to-protocol cohort for efficacy (ATP-E vaccine, n=8093Mean follow-up was 34.9 months (SD 6.4) after the third dose. Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 92.9% (96.1% CI 79.9-98.3) in the primary analysis and 98.1% (88.4-100) in an analysis in which probable causality to HPV type was assigned in lesions infected with multiple oncogenic types (ATP-E cohort). Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ irrespective of HPV DNA in lesions was 30.4% (16.4-42.1) in the TVC and 70.2% (54.7-80.9) in the TVC-naive. Corresponding values against CIN3+ were 33.4% (9.1-51.5) in the TVC and 87.0% (54.9-97.7) in the TVC-naive. Vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with 12 non-vaccine oncogenic types was 54.0% (34.0-68.4 ATP-E). Individual cross-protection against CIN2+ associated with HPV-31, HPV-33, and HPV-45 was seen in the TVC.The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine showed high efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 and non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types and substantial overall effect in cohorts that are relevant to universal mass vaccination and catch-up programmes.GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.
