Detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus in biopsies of uterine cervical adenocarcinoma. The genotyping of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) will improve knowledge about the local epidemiological association of this virus with adenocarcinoma.To determine the frequency of HPV genotypes in biopsies of women with uterine cervical adenocarcinoma in a geographic region of Chile.Forty-one cervical biopsies with a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, corresponding to all women diagnosed with this cancer between 2002 and 2004, were analyzed. Viral gene Ll was amplified by PCRfor viral detection. HPV genotyping was carried out by a Reverse Line Blot technique.Seventy one percent of biopsies were positive for HPV. The most common genotypes found were HPV 16 (61%), followed by HPV 18 (19.5%). Eighty seven percent of biopsies had a single HPV infection. Three patients had a multiple HPV infection. All of the latter were infected by HPV 16, associated with other three viral genotypes (45, 52 and 66). No low-risk HPV genotypes were found.In this sample of biopsies, there was a high prevelence of HPV 16 and a low prevalence of HPV 18, which historically has been related to adenocarcinoma. The genotypes found correspond to those described in South America.
