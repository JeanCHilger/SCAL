Screening for cervical cancer: which common technique is the most cost-effective choice? Screening is the basic practice in cancer prevention for cervical cancer. In the gynecology field, there are several alternative techniques for screening for pre-cancerous lesions for cervical cancer, including the Pap smear, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing and combined Pap smear and VIA. In this work, the author focused on cost effectiveness and puts forward an argument that the VIA is the most preferable choice on this basis.
