Detection of high risk HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis in vaginal and cervical samples collected with flocked nylon and wrapped rayon dual swabs transported in dry tubes. A dual collection device containing flocked and wrapped rayon swabs was used to collect vaginal and cervical samples from 494 women. The swabs were separated into individual tubes and sent to the laboratory in a dry state, where they were hydrated and tested for high risk HPV DNA [Digene-Qiagen hybrid capture 2] and Chlamydia trachomatis using in-house real-time PCR. The flocked swabs identified more high risk HPV and C. trachomatis infections from both sampling sites.
