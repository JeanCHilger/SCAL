Detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus DNA using polymerase chain reaction short PCR fragment 10-line probe assay in abnormal Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears. To evaluate the effectiveness of the short PCR fragment 10-line probe assay (SPF10-LiPA) system in detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) in abnormal Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears.We included 20 abnormal Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears. Samples were tested for HPV DNA detection and genotyping using the SPF10-LiPA system.All samples amplified the INF150 gene control. In 2 of 20 cases, amplification of the viral sequences was negative. Of processed samples, 18 of 20 presented HPV infection of them, 56% showed only 1 type of HPV infectionThe SPF10-LiPA system is efficient, sensitive, fast and simple for detecting and genotyping HPV DNA in abnormal Papanicolaou-stained cervicovaginal smears, which could be enormously useful in routine investigation for better clinical management of the patient.
