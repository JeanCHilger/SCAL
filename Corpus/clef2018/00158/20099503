Comparison of paired cervical scrape and tumor tissue samples for detection of human papillomaviruses in patients with cervical cancer. To compare the detection and distribution of HPV genotypes in paired cervical scrape samples and tumor tissue samples in patients with cervical cancer.Forty cervical scrape samples and 40 paired archival or fresh frozen tissue samples were collected from women with cervical cancer. Polymerase chain reaction with GP5+ and GP6+ primers was performed in all samples for HPV DNA detection. All GP5+/GP6+ negative samples were additionally tested using INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Test.Overall, 39/40 (97.5%) of CC samples were HPV DNA positive. HPV 16 was found in 24/40 samples, HPV 18 in 5/40 samples. A co-infection with two different HPV genotypes was identified in one cervical scrape specimen, while in tissue samples only single infections were detected. Overall agreement between paired samples was 98.75%.The present study has shown that cervical scrape samples are equally useful for HPV genotype determination as tumor tissue samples in patients with cervical cancer. They can be used as accurate clinical samples for detection of HPV genotype causing cervical cancer or for epidemiological molecular studies.
