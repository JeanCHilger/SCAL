Exploring the issue of cervical cancer prevention and control in women living with HIV/AIDS. Shared risk factors mean that women engaging in unprotected sex are at risk of contracting both the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human papillomavirus (HPV). As HIV suppresses bodily immune systems, an HIV-positive woman with HPV will likely see a faster progression of cancer cells around the cervix. Therefore, it is important to prevent and control cervical cancer in HIV-positive women. Findings from the literature on this topic include: 1) HIV-positive women face a relatively greater risk of: HPV surveillance, contracting high-risk HPV subtypes, contracting more subtypes of HPV, longer HPV clearance time, and acquisition, persistence, progression and relapse of cervical dysplasia and cancer and 2) Factors related to cervical cancer progression in HIV-positive women correlated with lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads, but not with anti-HIV medication. Based on such, we suggest: 1) Medical and social service systems should target appropriate safe sex education and sex counseling to HIV-positive women 2) HIV-positive women should receive a free Pap smear twice yearly
