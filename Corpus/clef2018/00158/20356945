Perianal condylomas, anal squamous intraepithelial neoplasms and screening: a review of the literature. Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASILs) are the precursors to anal cancer. Human papillomavirus infection has a direct link to ASIL formation and is responsible for up to 80% of anal cancers. But while much importance has been focused on targeting cancer precursors in the cervix, relatively little concern has been afforded to the anal canal. With the advent of cervical Pap smear screening in various regions, the incidence of cervical cancer has declined. However, marked similarities in the biological and pathological profiles of cervical cancer and anal cancer mean that anal cancer should be preventable in the same way - by curbing the progression of ASIL to cancer. This article explores the literature on ASILs and the growing problem of anal cancer in the community, along with the literature surrounding the current progress towards implementing a screening programme for ASIL in the future.
