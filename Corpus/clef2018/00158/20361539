The relationship between HPV16 and HPV18 viral load and cervical lesions progression. Cervical cancer remains one of the most important mortality causes worldwide. It is already known that high risk HPV (HR-HPV) has the main role in the development of pre- or cancerous lesions. Despite the fact that many studies focused on the HR-HPV viral loads as possible biomarkers, the viral load quantification utility for all HR-HPV genotypes is still a controversy. The purpose of our study was to determine if HPV16 and 18 viral load values might be a potential marker for HPV infection clearance versus of pre- and cancerous lesions development.80 women who tested positive for HPV16 and 18 were selected from a cohort of 250 patients. The samples, consisting in cervical smears, were collected in transport media ESwab (Copan). The patient's average age was 36.26 years. HPV DNA detection, genotyping and viral load determination were performed twice for each patient (within one year follow-up).HPV 16 viral load was significantly higher in normal cytology samples and in HGSIL patients than in ASCUS/LGSIL (p value < 0.0312). HPV 18 viral load was also significantly higher in HGSIL cases than in ASCUS/LGSIL (p = 0,038). Independently of cervical cytology, HPV 18 viral load was lower (7.93 x 10(4) copies/microL) than HPV 16 viral load (5 x 10(13)) copies/microL).For HPV types 16 or 18 positive patients with LGSIL cytology the viral load might have predictive value. Our study suggested that patients with elevated viral loads are at disease risk progression and should be carefully evaluated.
