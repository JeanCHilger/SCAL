Significance of human papillomavirus genotyping with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia treated by a loop electrosurgical excision procedure. This study was conducted to determine whether the human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype by the HPV DNA chip test (HDC) is predictive of residual or recurrent high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3 following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).Between January 2001-February 2007, 672 patients with CIN2-3 were treated by a LEEP and followed up with cytology, the hybrid capture II assay, and the HDC.A total of 37 (5.5%) patients developed a recurrence, and those who developed a recurrence tested positive for the same high-risk (HR) HPV genotype before and after the LEEP. The same HR-HPV genotype by the HDC during the follow-up had a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% for detecting residual/recurrent disease. Persistent HPV-16 and HPV-18 were significantly associated with recurrent CIN2-3 (P < .05).Persistent infection with the same HR-HPV genotype, especially HPV-16 and HPV-18, should be considered a risk factor for developing residual/recurrent CIN2-3.
