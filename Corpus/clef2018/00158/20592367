Anal cytology as a screening tool for early detection of anal dysplasia in HIV-infected women. HIV-infected patients show a high rate of anal dysplasia and anal carcinoma but there is no gold standard for early detection. Therefore, the objectives of this prospective study were: a) evaluation of an anal screening using anal/perianal cytology b) in case of a positive result to investigate its relation to immune status, clinical symptoms of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy.In every HIV-infected woman visiting our gynaecological outpatient clinic, an anal and perianal swab for anal cytology was taken. One experienced cytologist examined all specimens. Relevant details of the HIV-related history such as CDC classification, CD4 count, viral load, actual antiretroviral therapy etc. were documented.Altogether, 104 HIV-infected women were enrolled on this study. The results of 13 (13.5%) anal cytologies were classified as suspicious for low-grade or high-grade anal dysplasia and 6 of these were confirmed in an anal biopsy. A total of 9 out of 13 also had a cervical dysplasia and 12 were positive for high-risk HPV at the cervix. Ten of these women had already experienced clinical symptoms of their HIV infection and 8 showed a nadir of the CD4 count below 200 cells/microl. All but one took a highly active antiretroviral therapy.In this pilot study, anal screening using anal cytology showed 13.5% suspected anal dysplasia in HIV-infected women. All performed biopsies revealed the presence of a high-grade anal lesion. The majority of these women already had an advanced disease and/or immune defect related to their HIV infection. In summary, we found anal cytology to be a useful tool to early detect anal dysplasia of high-risk patients such as HIV-infected women. How far this screening method contributes to the prevention of anal cancer has to be evaluated in further investigations.
