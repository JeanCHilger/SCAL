A population-based study on the risks of cervical lesion and human papillomavirus infection among women in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Few population-based studies have investigated premalignant and malignant cervical abnormalities in Beijing.A total of 6,385 randomly selected sexually active women were interviewed and examined. Cervical lesion was diagnosed using cytology and histology. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected by the second-generation hybrid capture test and typed by gene chip of DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue.The cervical lesion prevalence diagnosed by histology was 5.8%. High-risk HPV overall prevalence was 9.9%, 50.5% with cervical lesion and 7.4% without cervical lesion. High-risk HPV DNA load increased with increasing degree of lesions. HPV 16 was the most common type (26.5%) among women with cervical lesion, followed by HPV 58 (8.8%), HPV 33 (7.8%), and HPV 56 (5.3%). Women under 50 years of age, married status, pregnancy and delivery status, couple's sexual behavior, contraceptive history, columnar ectopy, and bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas vaginitis history were more risk factors for HPV infection. Factors for cervical lesion were similar, but in comparison with HPV infection, all associations were weakened. Only middle-aged women, husband's sexual partners, oral contraceptives, columnar ectopy, and history of trichomonas vaginitis remained associated with cervical lesion.In Beijing, the prevalence of cervical lesion and high-risk HPV is higher than estimated in previous reports. HPV 16, 58, and 33 were the most prevalent types. This is relevant for work related to cervical cancer vaccination.The study was conducted to understand the current status and epidemiologic characteristics of women with cervical lesion and HPV infection in Beijing.
