Association between human papillomavirus and adenocarcinoma of rectum and recto-sigmoid junction: a cohort study of 10,612 women in Taiwan. This study aimed at assessing the association between the type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the risk of adenocarcinoma of the rectum and recto-sigmoid junction. A total of 10,612 women aged 30-65 years old were enrolled from seven townships in Taiwan. Cervical cells collected at study entry were tested for 39 types of HPV infection by polymerase chain reactions and HPV blot kit. Newly developed adenocarcinomas of rectum and recto-sigmoid junction were ascertained through computerized linkage with national cancer registry profiles. An increased risk of adenocarcinomas of the rectum and recto-sigmoid junction was observed with HPV infection, showing a hazard ratio [HR] (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 1.99 (0.98-4.04) after adjustment for age and body mass index. The adjusted HR (95% CI) for the infection of HPV types other than 6 and 11 was 2.18 (1.04-4.60). Women with cervical infection of HPV types other than 6 and 11 at study entry may have an increased risk of adenocarcinomas of the rectum and recto-sigmoid junction, which deserves further validation by large-scale studies.
