Multinational comparison of diagnostic clues for uterine cervical lesions among cytotechnologists in Asian countries. Vaccination has been underway in several countries for sexually inactive young girls or women against HPV 16 and 18 to prevent them from infection of these HPV types and concurrent cancer development. However, uterine cervical cancers may remain uncontrolled among some Asian countries, where other types of HPV infection are more frequent. A sensitive cancer screening system would remain important for detection of the earlier stage cervical cancers in Asian countries. In this study, 130 cytotechnologists (CTs) in Asian countries (Taiwan 80, Japan 18, Korea 15, Thailand 11, Singapore 3, Bhutan 2, and Mongolia 1) participated in the vote. Selected 10 cervical Pap smears that would be adequate to identify the diagnostic clues especially for atypical squamous cells (ASC) with two or three representative pictures for each case were displayed on the website. The percentages of consistent diagnosis voted by certified CTs with â‰¥5 years of experience were compared among 10 cervical cases or among Asian countries enrolled. As results, low consistency for ASC cases and high consistency for squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) were observed. Examining specimens for the diagnostic clues of ASC in TBS is crucial to maintain the high sensitivity and positive predictive value of SIL in Asian countries.
