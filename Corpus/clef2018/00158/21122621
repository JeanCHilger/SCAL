Healers in a non-traditional role a focus group study of Sangoma's knowledge of and attitudes to cervical cancer prevention and screening in Johannesburg, South Africa. Twelve Sangomas or traditional healers participated in a focus group exploring their understanding of cervical cancer and human papilloma virus (HPV), their role informing women about cervical cancer prevention and screening and their interaction/cooperation with western medicine. Participants lacked knowledge of HPV and the HPV vaccine but had an understanding of cervical cancer prevention and pap smears. Participants expressed interest in greater collaboration with western doctors, requested more prevention information, and noted the vaccine could serve as strategy to prevent HPV in victims of sexual violence, and time of vaccination could serve as an opportunity for parents to talk to their children about sex.
