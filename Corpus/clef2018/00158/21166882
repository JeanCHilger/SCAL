Germline polymorphisms of glutathione-S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1 and p53 codon 72 in cervical carcinogenesis. The clinical significance of glutathione-S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1 and p53 codon 72 polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis was investigated. Germline polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and p53 codon 72 together with human papillomavirus (HPV) types were examined in a total of 457 blood and cervical smear samples from normal healthy women and the patients with premalignant and malignant cervical lesions. The 167 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 49 with high-grade SIL (HSIL) and 83 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) had significantly higher frequency of high-risk HPV than 158 controls. The 49 patients with HSIL and 83 with SCC had statistically higher frequency of null GSTT1 genotype than 158 controls. There was an increased odds ratio for null GSTT1 genotype in HSIL and SCC cases compared with controls among 191 patients with high-risk HPV. The 67 cases with HPV types 16 and/or 18 had higher frequency of the GSTT1 null genotype than 186 with other types of HPV. There was no statistical difference in the polymorphic frequency of GSTM1 and p53 codon 72 genotypes between SILs and controls with or without high-risk HPV. These results suggest that GSTT1 null genotype may increase the risk of cervical cancer particularly in the cases with high-risk HPV types in a Japanese population.
