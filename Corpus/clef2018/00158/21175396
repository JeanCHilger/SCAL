The prevention of cervical cancer in Africa. In this article we aim to draw attention to the burden of cervical cancer in Africa for reproductive health and review strategies for prevention, including appropriate noncytology-based cervical screening and prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccination. We consider the heavy burden of disease attributable to human papillomavirus infection borne by developing countries, particularly in Africa. Following identification of the human papillomavirus as the infectious etiological agent and elucidation of the long natural history of cervical neoplasia, cervical cancer is now one of the most preventable of all cancers. Opportunities for primary prevention by prophylactic vaccination and secondary prevention by appropriate cervical screening are discussed, together with the importance of population coverage. Qualitative work on attitudes towards cervical cancer prevention, education needs, the creation of an environment for informed choice and uptake are essential aspects of effective prevention programs. Cervical cancer poses a huge health burden in Africa. It is a disease that is eminently preventable given political will, the availability of affordable vaccines, appropriate cervical screening and access to cheap, point-of-care human papillomavirus testing. There are a number of unanswered questions for the prevention of cervical cancer and a need for demonstration projects to address these and further develop prevention strategies.
