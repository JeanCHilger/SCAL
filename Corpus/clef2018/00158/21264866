Prevalence of human papillomavirus among women with normal cervical cytology in Kuwait. This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and type specific distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with normal cervical cytology in Kuwait. The study is the first of its type in Kuwait and one of few in the Middle East. The age specific distribution of HPV types was determined in 3,011 ThinPrep samples taken from women seeking routine gynaecological care. ThinPrep samples were screened for HPV DNA by real-time PCR. The type specific distribution of the viruses was determined by PCR-based sequencing. The results showed that HPV DNA was detected in 71 women (2.4%), and 21 different HPV genotypes were detected, comprising eight high-risk (HR) (16, 31, 33, 53, 56, 58, 66, and 73), seven low-risk (LR) (6, 11, 54, 61, 70, 81, and 90), four intermediate-risk (IR) (67, 82, 83, and 84) and HPV 102 and HPV 106. LR HPV types were found in 71.8% of infected samples, HR types in 32.3%, and IR types in 7%. With regard to age, 40.8% of all HPVs were found in women 30-39 years of age, 29.6% in women 40-49 years of age, 19.7% in women over 50 years and 9.9% in women less than 34 years old. The study shows that the prevalence of HPV infection in Kuwait is among the lowest in the world and suggests that HPV vaccine could prevent the development of HPV associated cervical cancer in 1.39% of young females living in Kuwait. However, more extensive population-based studies should be undertaken before implementing HPV vaccination.
