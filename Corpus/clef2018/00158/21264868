Analytical and clinical performances of a restriction fragment mass polymorphism assay for detection and genotyping of a wide spectrum of human papillomaviruses. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry-based restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP) assay was adapted to human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping. The analytical sensitivity and the clinical utility were evaluated by testing defined HPV genome equivalents and a total of 426 specimens composed of normal cytology, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The RFMP assay was able to detect 38.4-114.6 genomic equivalents of a wide variety of HPV types. The RFMP assay detected 34 different HPV genotypes in cervical samples of which 8% were found to be multiple-type infections. The high-risk HPV positivity rate according to the histological diagnosis was 7.9% (8/101), 31.7% (38/120), 50% (55/110), 86% (37/43), 96.2% (50/52) in normal, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and squamous cell carcinoma subgroups, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivities/specificities for the cervical lesions of squamous cell carcinoma and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse histology were found to be 96.2%/92.1% and 91.6%/92.1%, respectively. The sensitivity, accuracy, wide range of genotype identification and high-throughput capacity with cost-effectiveness of the test consumables make the RFMP assay suitable for mass screening and monitoring of HPV-associated cervical cancer.
