Comparison of the DiagCor GenoFlow Human Papillomavirus Array Test and Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test. Persistent infection of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been widely associated with cervical cancer. Monitoring HPV infection is therefore an important step against cervical cancer development. The DiagCor GenoFlow Human Papillomavirus Array Test (GenoFlow) is a novel HPV test based on PCR and "Flow-through" hybridization that can identify 33 HPV subtypes in 3 hours. In the present study, the GenoFlow Test was evaluated by comparing the genotyping results of 100 samples with Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (LA). The tests showed good agreement in detection of HPV-positive samples (concordance rate=95%, Cohen's Kappa=0.896), with good agreement in detection of HR HPVs (Cohen's Kappa=0.876). The GenoFlow Test showed high sensitivity (95%), high specificity (95%), low false positive rate (3.33%) and low false negative rate (7.50%). In conclusion, the novel GenoFlow Test showed comparable clinical performance to LA test, and offers advantages of reduction in turnaround time and manpower.
