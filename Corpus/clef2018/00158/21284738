Prevalence of human papillomavirus genotypes in cytologic abnormalities from unvaccinated women living in north-western Spain. Cervical cancer and its precursors low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) are associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV), in particular HPV 16 and 18. The distribution of the HPV genotype varies with the severity of cervical disease, age and the geographic location of the patients. We report the results of a population study carried out in a region of north-western (NW) Spain aimed at determining the prevalence of single and multiple infections by 35 types of HPV using low-density microarrays for 113 cases with negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancies 588 with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)/LSIL
