Identification of a gene-expression signature for predicting lymph node metastasis in patients with early stage cervical carcinoma. Pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) is an important prognostic factor for patients with cervical carcinoma. The objective of this study was to identify a gene-expression signature that could predict PLNM in cervical carcinoma.Eighty-eight women with cervical carcinoma with PLNM (n = 23) and without PLNM (n = 65) were divided randomly into a training group and a test group. An oligonucleotide microarray that contained probes for 1440 human cancer-related genes was fabricated in-house and was used to detect the gene expression profile of cervical carcinoma. The gene expression levels detected in the microarray were verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).A gene-expression signature for predicting PLNM was developed in patients from the training group, including 11 genes: ribosomal protein L35 (RPL35) thymosin Î² 10 (TMSB10)In this study, 11-gene signature for predicting PLNM in cervical carcinoma was identified that may help clinicians in planning therapy for patients with cervical carcinoma.
