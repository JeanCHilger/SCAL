Comparison of HPV genotyping assays and Hybrid Capture 2 for detection of high-risk HPV in cervical specimens. High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are among the primary causes of cervical cancers. Hybrid Capture 2 (HC-II) (Digene, Gaithersburg, MD), which detects 13 HR-HPVs as a group, is the only HPV assay approved to date by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In Korea, several HPV genotyping assays are commercially available, including HPV RFMP (GeneMatrix Co., Seoul), HPVDNACHIP (Biomedlab Co., Seoul), and MyHPV Chip (Mygene Co., Seoul). We compared the results of these assays with those of HC-II. Among 553 residual samples of liquid-based Pap tests, a total of 435 (78.7%) were available for HPV assays. They were classified into four cytologic categories: normal, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and high grade SIL or carcinoma (HSIL+). Among these samples, 23.0%, 40.6%, 82.5%, 93.8% were HR-HPV positive by HC-II, respectively 6.6%, 18.1%, 44.4%, 84.4%, by HPV RFMP, respectively
