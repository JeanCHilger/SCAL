Ovarian squamous cell carcinoma which metastasized 8 years after cervical conization for early microinvasive cervical cancer: a case report. Squamous cell cervical carcinoma that metastasized to the ovary is common in patients with bulky tumors or locally advanced disease however, ovarian squamous cell carcinoma that metastasized after cervical conization surgery for early microinvasive uterine cervical carcinoma is very rare. We present a case of ovarian squamous cell carcinoma that metastasized 8 years after cervical conization surgery for early microinvasive cervical carcinoma. She had no sign of recurrence in the uterine cervix. We detected human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in both cervical tissue and ovarian tissue, suggesting that ovarian squamous cell carcinoma is derived from microinvasive cervical cancer. Although there are very few cases of early microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma that metastasized to the ovary with delayed recurrence, we should pay attention strictly not only to the cervical condition but also to the ovarian condition on regular post-operative follow-up.
