Comparison of the Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV test and INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra test for the detection of human papillomaviruses in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical cancer specimens. Comparative evaluation of Abbott RealTime and Innogenetics INNO-LiPA on alternately processed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 31 cervical cancers and 31 uterine myomas showed complete agreement in the detection of 14 assay-common HPV genotypes and partial genotyping of HPV-16 and HPV-18. The tissue preparation protocol was shown to be sample-to-sample contamination safe.
