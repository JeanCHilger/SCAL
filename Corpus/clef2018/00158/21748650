Inhibition of human papillomavirus expression using DNAzymes. Deoxyribozymes (DXZs) are catalytic oligodeoxynucleotides capable of performing diverse functions including the specific cleavage of a target RNA. These molecules represent a new type of therapeutic oligonucleotides combining the efficiency of ribozymes and the intracellular endurance and simplicity of modified antisense oligonucleotides. Commonly used DXZs include the 8-17 and 10-23 motifs, which have been engineered to destroy disease-associated genes with remarkable efficiency. Targeting DXZs to disease-associated transcripts requires extensive biochemical testing to establish target RNA accessibility, catalytic efficiency, and nuclease sensibility. The usage of modified nucleotides to render nuclease-resistance DXZs must be counterweighted against deleterious consequences on catalytic activity. Further intracellular testing is required to establish the effect of microenvironmental conditions on DXZ activity and off-target issues. Application of modified DXZs to cervical cancer results in specific growth inhibition, cell death, and apoptosis. Thus, DXZs represent a highly effective antisense moiety with minimal secondary effects.
