Human papillomavirus infections in the oral mucosa. Public awareness of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the causal agent of cervical cancer and of the availability of HPV vaccines has increased. As a result, more patients are asking their dentists about oral HPV infection and its prevention by means of vaccination. Parents of pediatric dental patients also may be concerned when their children have HPV-associated oral lesions, because HPV infection still often is considered a purely sexually transmitted disease. In this review, the authors provide the latest information for dental professionals about HPV infection in the oral mucosa and in general.The authors searched PubMed for all studies regarding HPV infection in the oral mucosa, and they reviewed relevant publications focusing exclusively on HPV infections of the oral cavity. In selecting studies for review, the authors made a clear distinction between studies regarding HPV infections in the mouth and those regarding HPV infection in the oropharynx or in other head and neck sites.HPV can infect oral mucosa. A subgroup of oral cancer clearly is associated with HPV. Oral HPV infection is transmitted sexually but also can be transmitted from mouth to mouth and vertically from an infected mother during delivery.Persistent HPV infection in the oral mucosa might increase the risk of developing oral cancer. Regular and meticulous clinical examination is the dentist's most important tool in detecting HPV-associated changes in the oral mucosae. HPV-associated oral cancer may affect a population younger than that typically affected by HPV-independent oral cancer. Alcohol and tobacco use increase the risk of developing oral cancer, so good practice includes encouraging patients to avoid these habits. The available HPV vaccines cover the HPV genotypes found most commonly in the oral mucosa, but their protective effect against oral cancer remains to be elucidated.
