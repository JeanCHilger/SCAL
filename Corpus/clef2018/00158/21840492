Human papillomavirus and Papanicolaou tests screening interval recommendations in the United States. Guidelines recommend when the human papillomavirus (HPV) and Papanicolaou tests are used together (HPV co-test) for routine cervical cancer screening, screening intervals can be extended to 3 years. We assessed HPV test practices and Papanicolaou test screening interval recommendations of US providers.Using a multistage probability design, we analyzed nationally representative data that were collected in 2006 through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.Approximately 51% of providers ordered the HPV co-test however, clinical vignettes found that <15% of providers who ordered the HPV test recommend the next Papanicolaou test in 3 years for women with concurrent normal HPV co-test results and a documented normal screening history.Overall, annual cervical cancer screening continues to be a common recommendation, regardless of whether a screening history has been established or an HPV test has been ordered.
