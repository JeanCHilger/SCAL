Predictors associated with the willingness to take human papilloma virus vaccination. Human papilloma virus vaccine is considered to be the primary form of cervical cancer prevention. The objectives were (1) to determine knowledge about, and perception of human papilloma virus infection in relation to cervical cancer, (2) to explore the intention of the community to be vaccinated with human papilloma virus vaccine, and (3) to identify variables that could predict the likelihood of uptake of the vaccine. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in a semi-urban Town of Malaysia, using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Summary statistics, Pearson chi-square test and a binary logistic regression were used for data analysis. A total of 232 respondents were interviewed. Overall, only a few had good knowledge related to human papilloma virus (14%) or vaccination (8%). Many had misconceptions that it could be transmitted through blood transfusion (57%). Sixty percent had intention to take vaccination. In the binary logistic model, willingness to take vaccination was significant with 'trusts that vaccination would be effective for prevention of cervical cancer' (P = 0.001), 'worries for themselves' (P < 0.001) or 'their family members' (P = 0.003) and 'being Indian ethnicity' (P = 0.024). The model could fairly predict the likelihood of uptake of the vaccine (Cox & Snell R(2) = .415 Nagelkerke R(2) = 0.561). Results indicate that intensive health education dispelling misconception and risk perception towards human papilloma virus infection and cervical cancer would be helpful to increase the acceptability of vaccination program.
