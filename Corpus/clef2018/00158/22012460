Detection of human papillomavirus oncoprotein E7 in liquid-based cytology. The selection and characterization of a set of mouse mAbs against high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 oncoprotein and the development of protocols for immunocytochemistry (ICC) are described here. A large number of antibodies raised towards HPV16 and 18 E7 were tested for high-risk specificity by ELISA using a panel of HPV E7 proteins. Antibodies detecting low-risk E7 were discarded, resulting in 38 high-risk HPV E7-specific antibodies. The corresponding epitopes were mapped using overlapping HPV E7 fragments displayed on phage particles. Functionality in ICC against formalin-fixed cervical cancer cell lines was demonstrated for ten mAbs their high-risk specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis and ICC on transiently transformed cells expressing high- or low-risk HPV E7. These mAbs were specific for one or several of the high-risk strains HPV16, 18, 31, 35 and 45. Specific E7 staining of liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples was demonstrated for seven mAbs and optimized protocols were established. The E716-41 and E718-79 mAbs demonstrated particularly strong and specific staining of cells stored in LBC fluid for at least 6 months. It is proposed that the high-risk HPV E7 staining protocols established in this study may have the potential to be included in a complementary test for the detection and identification of malignantly transformed cells, in for example atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance samples.
