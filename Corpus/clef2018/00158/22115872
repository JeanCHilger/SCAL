Comparison of Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV and Hybrid Capture 2 for the detection of high-risk HPV DNA in a referral population setting. The Abbott RealTime High Risk HPV assay (ART) is an automated multiplex real-time PCR test for detection of DNA from 14 high risk (HR) HPV types in cervical specimens and simultaneous distinction of HPV16 and HPV18 from other HR-HPV.To evaluate the performance of the ART assay in specimens referred for HPV testing to our laboratory (referral population) by comparison with historical data from HC2 and INNO-LiPA as well as histological status, if available.412 cervical specimens were collected from women between 18 and 70 years of age: 301 previously tested by HC2 without clinical data and 111 previously tested by HC2 and INNO-LiPA with histological diagnosis of CIN3+.Our study demonstrated good overall agreement between ART, HC2 and INNO-LiPA. In the group of the CIN3+ specimens HR-HPV was detected by ART in 93.07% (95% CI: 88.12-98.02), while HR-HPV detection rates with HC2 and INNO-LiPA were 91.09% (95% CI: 85.53-96.65) and 95.05% (95% CI: 90.82-99.28), respectively. The typing capability of ART for HPV16, HPV18 and a pool of twelve other HR-HPV types was investigated by comparison with INNO-LiPA demonstrating high overall assay concordance (89.81% k 0.87).The Abbott RealTime assay showed similar clinical performance for detection of CIN3+ compared with HC2. The high level of automation and ability to identify HPV16, HPV18 and other HR-HPV make this assay a very attractive option for HR-HPV testing, potentially improving patient management by risk stratification of cytological abnormal populations.
