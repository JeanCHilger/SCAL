Follow-up after conservative surgery for cervical precancer lesions. To summarize current knowledge of postoperative follow-up after conservative surgical treatment of cervical precancer lesions.Review article.Oncogynecological center, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, General Faculty Hospital and 1st Medical School of Charles University, Prague.Residual or recurrent disease is diagnosed in a small amount of women after conservative surgical treatment of cervical precancer lesions. Series of consecutive negative findings are necessary prior to return back to routine screening. Most sensitive marker for residual and recurrent disease is detection of HPV infection. Negative predictive value of HPV testing is significantly higher as compared with negativity of surgical margins or negative Pap smear.Combination of HPV and Pap smear negativity shows nearly absolute negative predictive value for oncologically relevant finding in postoperative management.
