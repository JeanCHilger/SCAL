AgNOR, p16 and human papillomavirus in low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions of the uterine cervix. Preliminary report. It has been shown that infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPV) is related to the development of cervical cancer. The persistence of the virus in intra-epithelial lesions of cervix uteri (SILs) is the basis for the application of HPV testing for screening and management of patients. Most infections by HR-HPVs resolve spontaneously, however, and do not progress to dysplasia or cancer. p16INK4a is a useful biomarker of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia and could be a marker for the progression of low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (LSILs) to high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (HSILs), because it correlates independently with increasing SIL grade. We conducted a preliminary histological study of 28 patients diagnosed with LSIL, HSIL or nondysplastic epithelium (NDE) from whom 28 biopsies of uterine cervix and 28 endocervical brushed biopsies were taken. Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) and p16INK4a assays were performed on the biopsies, and endocervical brushings were used for HPV typing. The high risk HPV group showed that the number of patients with AgNOR areas greater than 3.3 µm(2) and with expression of p16INK4a were statistically greater than the number of lower risk patients. None of the biopsies of LR-HPV carriers expressed p16 and AgNOR areas> 3.3 μm(2) simultaneously. Four LSILs and the NDE of this group expressed neither of the two markers. If the correlation between AgNOR areas and p16INK4a is good, we may be able to develop a low cost simple technology for studying patients infected with HR-HPV and diagnosed with LSIL of uncertain behavior.
