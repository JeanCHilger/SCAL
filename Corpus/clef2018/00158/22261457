The interplay of age stratification and HPV testing on the predictive value of ASC-US cytology. Results from the ATHENA HPV study. We have previously shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping, using the cobas HPV Test (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA), can be used to identify women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) at the highest risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse. We investigated the impact of age stratification on the risk of CIN 2 or worse in women with ASC-US and the performance of HPV genotyping in different age strata. The sensitivity of the cobas HPV Test was 93.3% in the 21- to 29-year-old age group and 67.7% in the 40 years or older group, most likely owing to pathologic misclassification of CIN 2 or worse in older women. The prevalence of CIN 2 or worse in younger women was nearly 4-fold that detected in older women and was predominantly HPV-16-related. Age-specific evaluation of ASC-US cytology in conjunction with HPV genotype status enables more effective risk assessment and could be used in clinical management.
