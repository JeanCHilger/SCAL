Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer knowledge, health beliefs, and preventive practices in 2 age cohorts: a comparison study. Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States and a known precursor of cervical cancer. Recent studies suggest a bimodal HPV prevalence for women in 2 age groups: 19 to 26 and 40 to 70. HPV and cervical cancer knowledge has yet to be investigated in the older population of women.The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the HPV and cervical cancer knowledge, health beliefs, and preventive practices in women in these 2 age groups.This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive design. A convenience sample of 300 women in 2 age groups was recruited from 3 ambulatory obstetrics and gynecology practices in Philadelphia, Pa. Participants completed the Awareness of HPV and Cervical Cancer Questionnaire to determine their HPV and cervical cancer knowledge, health beliefs, and preventive practices.A total of 280 responses (131 for the age group 19-26 years and 149 for the age group 40-70 years) were received. Significant differences were found between the 2 groups in knowledge (P = 0.010) only, but not health beliefs (perceived susceptibility [P = 0.111] and perceived seriousness [P = 0.266]). Significant differences in select preventive practices were also noted between these 2 groups. These included Pap smear (P = 0.05), use of condoms (P = 0.002), and use of oral contraception (P < 0.001).There is a remarkable need for age-appropriate HPV and cervical cancer awareness and education for women older than the age of 40. Women's health care providers are perfectly positioned to act as a catalyst to improve HPV and cervical cancer knowledge, health beliefs, and preventive practice to ensure optimal health promotion for all women.
