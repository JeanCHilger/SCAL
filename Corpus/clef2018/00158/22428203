Human papillomavirus types in women with cervical cancer in Haifa District. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is recognized as the absolute cause of cervical cancer and is found in 99% of the Lesions. HPV 16 and 18 are detected in 70% of the cases. Two vaccines against HPV 16 and 18 were approved for use in Israel in recent years.To determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with invasive cervical cancer in the Haifa district, and to see if the vaccine is suitable for our population.The study population included 65 women from the Haifa District who were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer in the Cervix Clinic of Carmel Medical Center. Samples for HPV typing were obtained during the evaluation of those patients. DNA was extracted from brush samples and HPV genotype was determined by nested-PCR followed by sequencing.Out of 65 patients with cervical carcinoma, 64 were found positive for HPV. The main HPV types in our patients were HPV 16 in 53.8% of the patients, HPV 18 in 12.3% of the patients and HPV type 45 in 13.8% of the patients. HPV type 33 was found in 4.6% of the patients, and HPV types 31 and 66 in 3.1% of the patients. Each of HPV types 54, 56, 58 and 59 were found in one patient. The main complaint was postmenopausal bleeding or menometrorrhagia in 24 patients (36.9%), post coital bleeding in 18 patients (27.7%) and 14 patients (21.5%) were evaluated due to an abnormal cytological smear Squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed in 83% of the patients and cervical adenocarcinoma in 15.1% of them.The prevalence of HPV types in Haifa district is similar to world prevalence of HPV's, where HPV 16 and 18 cause 66.1% of cervical cancer, while in our study HPV45 and HPV 66 were found in higher proportions of cases than reported worldwide. In our population the vaccine against HPV 16/18 can prevent almost 70% of cases of cervical cancer, but a multicenter study should be performed in order to obtain larger numbers.
