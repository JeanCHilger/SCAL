Molecular epidemiology of genital papillomavirus infection in the Republic of Belarus. Determination of epidemiologic features of genital HPV infection in women living in the Republic of Belarus, and detection of phylogenetic features of HPV-16.1035 samples of epithelial cervix smears from patients with benign pathology, pre-cancer and cervix cancer were included into the study. 35 samples containing HPV-16 type DNAwere selected for sequencing. HPV L1 gene sequencing (300 n.p.) was performed by using 3100-Avant (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing results analysis was performed by using ClustalX (1.8) and BioEdit. MEGA 4.1 was used for phylogenetic analysis of the fragments obtained and tree construction.HPV-16 type is a dominant genotype that is responsible for the development of cervix cancer, its frequency of occurrence is 56.7% among patients with the specified pathology living in the Republic of Belarus. Predominance of East-Asian and European HPV-16 subtypes that can be attributed to a single evolutionary branch are the territorial features. At the same time detection of HPV-16 subtypes that have 0.003 - 0.007 p-distance between probes may indicate the presence of the several progenitors circulating in the country. A unique HPV-16 subtype was sequenced in the Gomel Region that could be one of the progenitors of HPV-16 circulating on the European continent.Further studies performed in the field of molecular epidemiology will allow to give a qualitative characteristic of the epidemic process, determine the direction and time of introduction of the virus into the country, control the circulation of the virus in the population.
