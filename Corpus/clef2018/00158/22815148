Direct human papillomavirus E6 whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for objective measurement of E6 oncoproteins in cytology samples. A novel, whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a non-type-specific anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 antibody was tested on 182 residual cytological specimens. For samples with a designation of more severe than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3+), 83% tested positive for E6 in a subset with paired testing for E6 ELISA and HPV DNA, 72% tested E6 positive and 92% tested high-risk (HR)-HPV DNA positive (P = 0.2). Among the women with a less than CIN3 diagnosis, 31% and 47% tested positive for E6 and HR-HPV DNA, respectively (P = 0.0006).
