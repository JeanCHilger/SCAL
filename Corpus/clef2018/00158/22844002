Colposcopy referral rate can be reduced by high-risk human papillomavirus triage in the management of recurrent atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology in Finland. The aim of this study was to establish whether a combination of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing and cervical cytology could reduce colposcopy referral among women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology. We randomized 598 women in the Helsinki area, Finland into three study groups. Different strategies of hrHPV testing, cytology and colposcopy with biopsy were used subsequent hrHPV test results and cytological findings were compared with histology. The rates of hrHPV positivity and CIN2+ were compared. In total, 62.5% of all samples were hrHPV-positive. Altogether 45 (12.7%) CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) lesions were found in study groups A and B. Among hrHPV-positive women the rate of CIN2+ was 19.0% (n = 43), in contrast with 1.6% (n = 2) among hrHPV-negative women (relative risk = 12.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6-81.1, P < 0.001). Among all hrHPV-negative women whose cytological findings were normal or ASCUS, dysplastic lesions were uncommon (n = 4/119, 3.4%), and all were CIN1. If these women had not been referred to colposcopy, the number of colposcopies would have been reduced by 33.6%. We conclude that hrHPV testing combined with repeat cervical cytology had a high negative predictive value in patients with recurrent low-grade cervical cytology. This could reduce the referral rate to colposcopy without jeopardizing patient safety.
