Prevalence and distribution of human papillomavirus genotype in south eastern Italy, in the period 2006-2011: implications for intervention. Persistent infection of High Risk (HR) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can lead to cervical cancer. The HPV genotypes are found worldwide, but important regional variations have been found. For a population-based HPV type prevalence study to assess the effect of existing and new prevention methods, frequently updated information on the burden of cervical cancer is essential. We evaluated the prevalence of HPV genotypes in a volunteer population screened for cervical cancer at the Local Health Unit (LHU) of Lecce. A total of 9,720 women were studied. The tests were performed by INNO-Lipa HPV Genotyping and LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test. The overall HPV prevalence was 29.7% (95% CI, 28.8-30.6) for any HPV DNA. The prevalent type for all age groups was HPV 16 (7.4% CI, 6.9-7.9) followed by HPV 31 (3.4%
