Geographical distribution of human papillomavirus and their correlation with cytologic abnormalities in cervical lesions and with the age in a female population from Transylvania. Cervical samples from 182 females aged 16-63 years were tested between 2008-2011 for human papillomaviruses (HPV) using PCR methods through the reverse hybridization and Roche genotyping. In 99 (54.4%) cases, different types of HPV were detected in 53 (53.5%) single infections and in 46 (46.5%) multiple infections, frequent in urban (94 cases: 50 single infections and 44 multiple infections). 32 different types of HPV were identified, 15 types being with high-risk. There were only seven rural patients, having single infections with the types 51, 58, 84 multiple infections with three or more than three associated HPV were not found. The most frequently identified was type 16 with high-risk, both in urban and rural areas, prevalent at 20-30 years of age. The types 35, 39, 59, 68 with high-risk were isolated only from multiple infections. Of the 9 females of rural origin investigated through cytological examination Babe≈ü-Papanicolaou, the types 16, 31, 58 (with high-risk) were detected in five cases. 42 (42.4%) cases with HPV infections were found in females aged 20 to 25 years. The frequency of HPV infection decreases with the age. The mean of age is significantly increased in females without infection (p = 0.00007) and it is significantly decreased in females with multiple infections, as compared with those with single infections or without infections. The females with single infections have the average of age significantly lower, as compared with the females free of HPV infections. There is a significant correlation between the age and the total risk of HPV infection (the age increase and the total risk decrease).
