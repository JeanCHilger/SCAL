Lung cancer chemoprevention: difficulties, promise and potential agents? In a variety of cancers there is evidence that specific regimens can prevent or significantly delay the development of cancer. Thus, for breast cancer (ER+) use of SERMs or aromatase inhibitors can substantially decrease tumor incidence. For cervical cancer, HPV vaccination will inhibit long term cancer incidence. For colon cancer, the second greatest cancer killer, administration of aspirin and other NSAIDs decreases advanced colon adenomas in Phase II trials and epidemiologic data support their ability to prevent colon cancer. To date prevention trials in the area of lung cancer have shown minimal efficacy.The paper examines and discusses in greater detail certain promising agents which the authors have tested either preclinically and or in early phase clinical trials. These agents include RXR agonists, EGFr inhibitors, NSAIDs and Triterpenoids. Other agents including glucocorticoids, pioglitazone and iloprost are briefly mentioned. In addition, the paper presents various types of potential Phase II lung cancer prevention trials and describes their strengths and weaknesses. The potential use of various biomarkers as endpoints in trials e.g. histopathology, non-specific biomarkers (e.g., Ki67, cyclin D expression, apoptosis) and molecular biomarkers (e.g. specific phosphorylated proteins, gene expression etc.) is presented. Finally, we examine at least one approach, the use of aerosols, which may diminish the systemic toxicity associated with certain of these agents.The manuscript presents: a) a number of promising agents which appear applicable to further Phase II prevention trials b) approaches to defining potential preventive agents as well
