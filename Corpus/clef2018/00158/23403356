Novel E6 and E7 oncogenes variants of human papillomavirus type 31 in Brazilian women with abnormal cervical cytology. HPV-31 has been widely described as an important oncogenic type, showing high incidence in worldwide and especially in Northeastern Brazil. We sought to identify the presence of specific mutations in HPV-31 E6 and E7 oncogenes in women with abnormal cervical smear. We enrolled 150 gynecological patients from Sergipe State, Northeastern Brazil. HPV screening was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (MY09/11). E6 and E7 oncogenes were amplified with specific primers and sequenced. The sequences obtained were aligned with the GenBank reference sequences in order to search for genetic variants. We identified genetic variants in E6 and E7 sequences from HPV-31. Two new nucleotide changes in E6 and E7 were described for the first time in this study. A novel mutation in E6 resulted in amino acid change in a site belonging to T-cell epitope with MHC II binding activity. There was no significant difference in the distribution of HPV-31 E6 and E7 variants when compared to all selected clinical/epidemiological characteristics. HPV-31 isolates have been clustered into three main groups called lineages A, B and C. We describe new HPV-31 variants in Brazil, contributing to better understand the genomic diversity of these viruses.
