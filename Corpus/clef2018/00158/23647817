Prevalence of genotype-specific HPV infection among women in France: implications for screening and vaccination. To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and genotype distribution by age and cervical cytology/histology status among women undergoing routine gynecological examinations, and to discuss the possible impact on preventive strategies.Liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples were tested for HPV DNA, mRNA, and HPV genotypes. Women with ASC-US+ and/or at least one positive HPV test were referred to colposcopy. Those with normal colposcopy results had biopsies taken at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions of the normal transformation zone.Of the 5002 women, 515 (10.3 %) were less than 25 and 4487 (89.7 %) were 25 years old or more. Overall HPV prevalence was 10.1 % to 16.1 % depending on the assay. HPV prevalence increased with the cytological and histological severity of cervical lesions. Prevalence of HPV 16/18 was 5.2 % and 2.7 % in women less than 25 and 25 years old or more, respectively. HPV 16 was the type most strongly associated with a diagnosis of CIN3+ (odds ratio=11.64 versus HPV 16 absent, P<0.001). A high proportion of high-grade cervical lesions (60.6 % of genotyping assay-positive CIN2+) were associated with HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, or 58. DISCUSSION ET CONCLUSION: These data indicate that almost all young women could benefit from HPV prophylactic vaccination, but confirm the need for continued cervical screening and highlight the need for future vaccines to target a wider range of HPV types.
