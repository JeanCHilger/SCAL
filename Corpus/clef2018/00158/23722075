The role of family history of cancer on cervical cancer screening behavior in a population-based survey of women in the Southeastern United States. Our objective was to determine the association of self-reported family history of cancer (FHC) on cervical cancer screening to inform a potential link with cancer preventive behaviors in a region with persistent cancer disparities.Self-reported FHC, Pap test behavior, and access to care were measured in a statewide population-based survey of human papillomavirus and cervical cancer (n = 918). Random-digit dial, computer-assisted telephone interviews were used to contact eligible respondents (adult [ages 18-70] women in South Carolina with landline telephones]. Logistic regression models were estimated using STATA 12.Although FHC+ was not predictive (odds ratio [OR], 1.17 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-2.51), private health insurance (OR, 2.35Findings suggest targeting older women with screening recommendations and providing available screening resources for underserved women.
