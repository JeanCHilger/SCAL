Competing-risks regression models in analysis of biomarkers as predictors of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection outcomes and incident CIN in the LAMS cohort. To assess the prediction potential of a 5-biomarker panel for detecting high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) progression. Five biomarkers, lipocalin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, p300, interleukin-10, and stratifin, were assessed in cervical biopsies from 225 women of the Latin American Screening Study. Competing-risks regression models were constructed to assess their predictive power for (i) HR-HPV outcomes (negative, transient, or persistent infection) and (ii) CIN outcomes (no progression, incident CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3). p300, LCN2, stratifin were significantly associated with prevalent HR-HPV but lost their significance in multivariate analysis. In the multivariate model, only p300 was an independent predictor of CIN3 (odds ratio=2.63 95% confidence interval, 1.05-6.61
