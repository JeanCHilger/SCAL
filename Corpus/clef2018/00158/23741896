Prevalence and genotyping of the human papillomavirus in the cervical specimens among women of Southern Croatia (Dalmatia County). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPV types in the female population with either normal or abnormal Pap smears in Southern Croatia (Dalmatia County) and to evaluate the distribution of HPV types and their association with different cytological findings.During one year period, we routinely screened 1,160 women for HR HPV at the Educational Public Health Institute of Split and Dalmatia County, by using Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA test. Only HR HPV positive specimens determined by HC2 were further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay at the Department of Pathology and Forensic Medicine, Split.Out of the total number of tested women, 406 (35%) of them were positive to HR HPV. The following frequency was observed: HPV 16 in 10.8%, HPV 18 in 7.8%, HPV 31 in 2.3%, HPV 33 in 1.1%, HPV 52 in 0.9%, HPV 45 in 0.6%, and HPV 59 in 0.4% specimens.The data obtained from our study indicate that HPV 16 is the most common HPV type found in the cervical specimens among women of Southern Croatia, as in most studies worldwide, followed by HPV 18 and HPV 31. The positivity rates in our study slightly differed for HPV types 18 and 31 from those found in the other studies conducted in Northern Croatia. These suggesting geographic and environmental factors are related to the prevalence of HPV types. We consider it very important to gather information on regional variations in the HPV type spectrum.
