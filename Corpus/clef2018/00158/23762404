Differential expression of HPV16 L2 gene in cervical cancers harboring episomal HPV16 genomes: influence of synonymous and non-coding region variations. We tested the hypothesis that (i) synonymous variations within the coding regions, and (ii) variations within the non-coding regions of HPV, influence cervical cancer (CaCx) pathogenesis under the impact of intact HPV16 genomes. Whole genome sequence analysis of HPV16 isolates within 70 CaCx cases and 25 non-malignant samples revealed that synonymous variations were significantly higher within the E6 (p = 0.014), E5 (p = 0.001) and L2 (p = 0.0002) genes of HPV16 isolates within cases, compared to isolates within non-malignant samples. All of the 25 (100%) humanized codons identified within L2 ORF of the samples analyzed, were harbored by CaCx cases, while 8 out of 25 (32%) were harbored by HPV16 positive non-malignant samples (p = 3.87105E-07). L2 (mRNA and protein) expression was evident only among cases with episomal viral genomes and L2 mRNA expression correlated significantly with E2 gene copy numbers suggesting expression from all episomal genomes. Among such cases, Asian American (AA) isolates portrayed all of the humanized codons (100% 4-6/sample) recorded within L2, which was significantly higher (p = 2.02E-7) compared to the European (E) isolates (22.8%
