Cost-effectiveness analysis on the once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening program for women living in rural and urban areas of China. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening program and to predict the optimal modality for its operation on women living in rural and urban areas of China, based on Markov modeling and simulation.Three modalities including visual inspection with acetic acid plus Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap Smear (Pap Smear), and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) were hypothesized for the rural cohort, whereas other five modalities including Pap Smear, liquid-based cytology (LBC), simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing (HC2), and LBC plus HC2 (LBC + HC2) were tested for the urban cohort. A Markov model was constructed based on the factors as natural history, screening, diagnosis and treatment on cervical cancer using data related to the epidemics and the costs from rural and urban areas of the country. Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were predicted through simulation of the model.Compared to the non-screening scenario, the amount of life years saved were 277.97 - 2727.53 and 134.02 - 1446.84 years per 100 000 women, respectively, for different cohorts in rural and urban areas. The cost-effectiveness ratios were 1520.99 - 2453.74 and 3847.35 - 44 570.35 RMB per life year saved, respectively, for different cohorts in rural and urban areas. The incremental cost-effective ratio for careHPV starting from 40 years old (careHPV@40) and careHPV from 30 years old (careHPV@30) dominated other strategies for the rural cohort, while careHPV@40, careHPV@30, HC2 from 30 years old (HC2@30), and LBC + HC2 from 30 years old (LBC + HC2@30) were dominant for the urban cohort.All eight once-in-a-lifetime cervical cancer screening modalities were cost-effective based on our model. In particular, careHPV screening starting from 40 years old seemed to be the most cost-effective one for women living in both rural and urban areas.
