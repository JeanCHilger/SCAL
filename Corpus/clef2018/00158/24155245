Genomic diversity of low-risk human papillomavirus genotypes HPV 40, HPV 42, HPV 43, and HPV 44. In order to investigate the genomic diversity of low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, a total of 108 isolates of HPV 40, HPV 42, HPV 43, or HPV 44, obtained from anal swabs or tissue specimens of patients with anogenital warts, and cervical swabs of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of different grades, were analyzed. The characterization of genomic variants was established by sequencing one third of the viral genome and analysis of three different genomic regions: L1, LCR, and E6. Maximum variant divergence accounted for 0.4-1.1% of the investigated genomic segments. Several novel, potentially important nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and insertions are described. Altogether, among 14 HPV 40 isolates, a total of nine different genomic variants were identified, composed of eight L1, five LCR, and four E6 genomic variants. Among 49 HPV 42 isolates, a total of 30 genomic variants were identified, composed of 20 L1, 18 LCR, and four E6 genomic variants. Among 10 HPV 43 isolates, distributed into two major genomic variant lineages with clearly defined nucleotide signatures, three genomic variants were identified, composed of three L1, two LCR, and two E6 genomic variants. Among 35 HPV 44 isolates, a total of eight HPV 44 and 11 subtype HPV 44 genomic variants were identified, composed of 13 L1, 14 LCR, and 6 E6 genomic variants. A similar level of genomic diversity of HPV 44 and its subtype was identified in our geographic region as has been reported previously on isolates collected worldwide.
