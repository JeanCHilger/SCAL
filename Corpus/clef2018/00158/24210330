Influence of HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infection and CD4 count on cervical HPV DNA detection in women from Senegal, West Africa. HIV infection is associated with greater risk of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer in women. However, several factors remain unclarified regarding the association between HIV infection and HPV detection, especially among those with HIV type 2 versus type 1 infection and severely immunocompromised persons.To evaluate HPV overall and type-specific detection among HIV-infected and uninfected women in Senegal.Detection of HPV DNA for 38 genotypes in cervical swabs using PCR-based methods was evaluated in HIV-positive (n=467) and HIV-negative (n=2139) women participating in studies in Senegal. Among HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 positive women, CD4 counts were assessed. Adjusted multivariable prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated.The prevalence of any HPV DNA and multiple HPV types was greater among HIV-infected individuals (78.2% and 62.3%, respectively) compared with HIV-negative women (27.1% and 11.6%). This trend was also seen for HPV types 16 and 18 (13.1% and 10.9%) compared to HIV-negative women (2.2% and 1.7%). HIV-infected women with CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/Î¼l had a higher likelihood of any HPV detection (PRa 1.30 95% CI 1.07-1.59), multiple HPV types (PRa 1.52HIV-infected women, especially those most severely immunocompromised, are more likely to harbor HPV. Measures to prevent initial HPV infection and subsequent development of cervical cancer through focused screening efforts should be implemented in these high risk populations.
