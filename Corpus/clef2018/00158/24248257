Prevalence and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus infection in Harbin, Northeast China. This study aimed to investigate the overall prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among women examined at a hospital in Harbin and to evaluate the impact of HPV types on the natural outcome and state of cervical cytology. A total of 2,938 female outpatients from the affiliated hospital of Harbin Medical University were enrolled. Rapid hybridization gene chip and liquid-based cytology tests were used to detect HPV genotypes and cervical cytology. The overall prevalence of HPV in women who came to this hospital was 36.45 %. The majority were infected with a single strain, and the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) type constituted the largest proportion. HPV16 and 58 were the most common types, while the genotypes of single low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) were not the same in different age groups. HPV53, 16 and 81 were the most common types in multiple HR-HPV infection HR-HPV16, 33, 81 and LR-HPV 6, 44, 43 were the most common in HR and LR-HPV infection. In total, 44.1 % of the women with HSIL and 44.0 % with ASCUS were positive for HR-HPV16. Multiple HPV infections and single HPV infections had no effect on the natural outcome after half a year. HPV16, 81 and 35 had a better natural outcome, followed by HPV52 and 53, but HPV58, 59 and 18 had a bad outcome after half a year. This is the first study to show that the distribution of HPV types is different in Harbin than it is in other regions. These findings will provide guidance for the vaccination program in this area.
