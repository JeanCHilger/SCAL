Prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in patients attending Minia Maternity University Hospital. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of the genital tract. Wide use of screening programs can help in prevention of cervical cancer.To screen and evaluate the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) by visualization of the cervix after application of 5 % acetic acid (VIA) in Minia Maternity University Hospital.The study included 3,600 women from outpatient clinics of Minia Maternity University Hospital. They were screened for cervical cancer with the use of visual inspection of the cervix after application of 5 % acetic acid (VIA). Positive cases were subjected to colposcopy after referral to the colposcopy unit in the same hospital. Colposcopy-guided biopsies were done for colposcopic positive patients. One hundred and twenty women with negative VIA as control were randomly examined with colposcopy to evaluate the effectiveness of the test used, and no cases experienced cervical lesion.The prevalence was 5.8 % for cervical lesions, 1.4 % for HPV infection alone, 3.3, 0.84 and 0.27 % for CIN I, CIN II and CIN III, respectively. The prevalence of CIN II or higher was 1.11 % (40/3,600).Prevalence of CIN in the study population was 138 out of 1,800 cases (7.7 %). Pre-invasive high-grade lesions represent 1.3 % in participant women. VIA can be used in national programs for cervical cancer screening.
