Association of human papillomavirus L1 capsid protein with koilocytosis, expression of p16, and Ki-67, and its potential as a prognostic marker for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To study the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid protein (L1) and koilocytosis on ThinPrep cytology tests (TCTs) and the association of HPV L1 with p16 and Ki-67 expression in their corresponding biopsies.TCTs of 75 patients with high-risk HPV infection were studied for cytologic features of koilocytosis and for HPV L1 expression using combined detection of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. All TCTs had follow-up biopsies on which p16 and Ki-67 were confirmed by immunostaining.Of 75 TCTs, 45 expressed HPV L1, while 23 displayed koilocytosis. All TCTs with koilocytosis expressed HPV L1. HPV L1 was lost in 23.3% of cervical intraepithelial neplasia (CIN) I, 16.7% of CIN II, and 60% of CIN III or higher (carcinoma in situ including suspected minor infiltration), categorized by biopsy, and the difference among CIN grades was statistically significant (chi2, p = 0.015). Expression scores of p16 and Ki-67 were higher in L1 negative cases than in positive cases (1.63 vs. 1.54 for p16 1.53 vs. 1.32 for Ki-67)HPV L1 expression was significantly associated with koilocytosis on TCT, and loss of L1 was associated with increase in CIN grade but not with p16 or Ki-67 expression. Our study suggests that HPV L1 is a more sensitive method than koilocytosis for detecting active HPV infection. Detection of HPV L1 on TCTs of high-risk HPV-infected patients can be helpful in risk assessment and prognostic prediction of CIN.
