Testing of integrated human papillomavirus mRNA decreases colposcopy referrals: could a change in human papillomavirus detection methodology lead to more cost-effective patient care? This study investigates potential colposcopy referral rates, as per the latest American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommendations, following the change in high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) detection methodology from Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) to APTIMA at our institution.Rates of colposcopy referral were compared between two cohorts, each comprising all Pap samples with a diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) tested for HR-HPV in our laboratory during a 12-month period. Cohorts I and II included Pap samples tested with HC2 (n = 1,856) and APTIMA (n = 1,651), respectively. The rates of quantity not sufficient (QNS) results were determined for all Pap samples during the same time periods.The proportion of HR-HPV-positive Pap samples with an ASCUS diagnosis was significantly lower with APTIMA (42%) than with HC2 (53% p < 0.0001). APTIMA also resulted in a significantly lower QNS rate among all Pap samples (0.42 vs. 4.3% with HC2The change in HR-HPV detection methodology from HC2 to APTIMA has led to a 21% reduction in colposcopy referrals and a 90% decrease in QNS rates at our institution. The new methodology has resulted in more cost-effective patient care and fewer insufficient samples requiring repeat HR-HPV testing.
