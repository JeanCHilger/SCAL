Seroprevalence of 8 oncogenic human papillomavirus genotypes and acquired immunity against reinfection. Natural human papillomavirus (HPV) antibody titers have shown protection against subsequent HPV infection, but previous studies were restricted to few HPV genotypes. We examined the association of naturally occurring antibodies against 8 carcinogenic HPV types with subsequent infections.A total of 2302 women enrolled in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study provided blood samples at baseline. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against 8 carcinogenic HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58) using a multiplex serology assay. We analyzed the relationship between HPV antibodies and HPV infection during 2 years of follow-up among women negative for the specific HPV type at baseline.Baseline seroprevalence for HPV16 L1 was associated with decreased risk of DNA positivity for HPV16 (odds ratio, 0.39 [95% confidence interval, .18-.86]) at â‰¥2 follow-up visits. We observed similar but nonsignificant decreased risks for HPV18 and 31. These findings were restricted to women reporting a new sex partner during follow-up. There was no association between baseline seroprevalence and detection of precancer during follow-up.Seroprevalence conferred protection against subsequent HPV infection for HPV16 and indicated possible protection for 2 other genotypes, suggesting that this effect is common to several HPV genotypes.
