Human papillomavirus detection and genotyping, by HC2, full-spectrum HPV and molecular beacon real-time HPV assay in an Irish colposcopy clinic. Cervical screening programmes are moving towards HPV testing as part of the screening process and as a triage for colposcopy. Three HPV detection methods were evaluated using cervical cytology specimens from colposcopy patients. PreservCytâ„¢ liquid based cytology specimens from 241 women attending colposcopy clinics with greater than 2 persistently abnormal smears were recruited through the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin. HPV DNA was detected by Hybrid Capture (HC2) for 13 high-risk HPV types, Full-Spectrum HPV (FS-HPV) for 49 high and low-risk types and Molecular Beacon Real-Time HPV assay (MBRT-HPV) for 16 high and low-risk types. HPV genotyping was performed using Linear Array HPV Assay (LA-HPV). HPV was detected in 83.3% (195/234), 91.9% (217/236) and 80.1% (169/211) of cytology specimens by HC2, FS-HPV and MBRT-HPV, HPV DNA detection assays. The sensitivity of the assays for the detection of high-risk HPV in cytology specimens that had a Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2+ result by histology were, 98%, 97% and 94% for HC2, FS-HPV and MBRT-HPV assays with positive predictive values of 94.1%, 94.1% and 97.3%. The most common HPV genotypes were HPV 16, 31, 33, 58, 42, 61 and 53, and the most common high-risk HPV genotypes were HPV 16, 31, 33, 58, 18, 45, 59, 51, 56 and 39, with detection of multiple infections in 57.7% of all cases. FS-HPV and MBRT-HPV are highly sensitive and have a similarly high PPV as the HC2 assay for detection of HPV in patients with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2+ disease. HPV genotyping of women with persistent abnormalities is warranted prior to the introduction of HPV DNA testing in a colposcopy setting.
