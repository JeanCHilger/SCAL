Arguments in favor of HPV testing for cervical screening and post-treatment CIN2+ monitoring. Several studies have shown that the human papilloma virus (HPV) test is a more sensitive and objective primary cervical cancer screening tool than cytology. Therefore, conversion of cytology into HPV screening (as is planned in The Netherlands and some other European regions) will result in a better protection against cervical cancer and high-grade precursor lesions. Moreover, offering self-sampling for HPV testing will increase screening attendance by re-attracting former non-attendees. However, triage of HPV positive women is necessary because the specificity of HPV testing is 2-4% lower than of cytology. Several triage strategies have been evaluated, of which two, with cytology testing included, are feasible and were recently recommended. As an alternative for cytology triage, objective, non-morphological disease markers are upcoming and so far have shown promising results. Finally, HPV testing can also contribute to a more efficient monitoring of women treated for high-grade cervical precursor lesions, permitting fewer follow-up visits.
