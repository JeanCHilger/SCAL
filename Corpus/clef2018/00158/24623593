Genotypes and prevalence of HPV single and multiple concurrent infections in women with HSIL. The contribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) types to the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer has been established for a long time. However, the role of phylogenetically related and rare variants remains uncertain, as well as the influence of concurrent multiple HPV genotypes infection. We aimed at studying the prevalence of several HPV genotypes infecting women with single versus concurrent multiple HPV genotypes infection with a HSIL diagnosis in a cervical cytology. We conducted a cross-sectional study using Thin-Prep(®) liquid-based cervical cytology specimens with the diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), in which HPV genotype was sequentially tested. Genotypes were determined with a PapilloCheck(®) system, a DNA-Chip for the type-specific identification of 18 high-risk and six low-risk types of HPV. Of the total study population, 176 cases had a diagnosis of HSIL and positive HPV genotyping result, being HPV16 the most prevalent genotype (48.86% 95%CI: 41.58-56.19) followed by HPV31 (14.20%
