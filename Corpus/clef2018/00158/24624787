The significance of physical status of human papillomavirus type 16 for predicting the effectiveness of invasive cervical cancer treatment. For the 83 patients with HPV 16-cancer of the cervix (cervical cancer) I-III stages it was performed a comparative analysis of primary tumor response to therapy, the clinical outcome of the disease for 3-5 years after radical treatment and an evaluation of the possible contribution in these rates of the physical status of the virus. It was shown that total tumors regression in the early stages of the observation predominate in patients with "high-integrated" virus DNA (the degree of integration > 50%) of compared with a group of patients with episomal and "low-integrated" form of the virus, but in a distant periods (3-5 years) in the first group predominate an adverse outcome of disease. This pattern is true for tumors of stage I-III, and for less common--I-II stages. It is assumed that the integration of HPV16 DNA into the cellular genome may serve as an independent predictor of clinical outcome of cervical cancer.
