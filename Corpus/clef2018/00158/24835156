Did the recommendation of the French public health council modify the antipapillomavirus vaccines' prescription level?. In France, two vaccines are approved for prevention of papillomavirus infection: Cervarix(®) and Gardasil(®). The 17th of December 2010 the French High Committee of Public Hearth changed its recommendation about Cervarix(®) and decided that no scientific element justified a preference using Gardasil(®). This notification was published the 25th of January 2011. Our study aimed to determine whether this decision changed medical prescriptions.An ecological study was performed with reimbursement data for the two vaccines. We performed a Chi(2) test for qualitative variables and Student's t test for quantitative variables.A significant difference was observed between the prescription of Cervarix(®) before and after the 25th January 2011. The difference favored increased prescription, compared to Gardasil(®) (P ≤ 0.05).This variation can be explained by the impact of recommendations for medical decisions. The strong involvement of pharmaceutical firms in medical education may explain why prescribers reacted so rapidly after the publication of the new recommendations.
