Prospective study of hTERC gene detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 natural prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of human chromosome telomerase gene (hTERC) overexpression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) natural prognosis.A total number of 2,499 women aged 30-49 years were screened in a population-based cervical cancer screening study from Jiangxi province rural sites. Pathology as the gold standard, 74 CIN1 patients first diagnosed by pathological examination were studied. They were observed by carrying the hybrid capture2 (HC2) and hTERC genetic testing to understand the baseline. All observed women accepted voluntary follow-up. Follow-up for the first time in the first 12 months after screening included hr-HPV HC-2 testing. The second follow-up after screening the first 24 months, included hr-HPV HC-2, colposcopy + pathological examinations.Of the 74 CIN1 cases that were followed-up for 24 months, seven cases (9.5%) progressed 25 cases (33.8%) persisted, and 42 patients (56.7%) regressed. There was significant difference between hTERC amplification positive and negative group (chi2 = 21.07, p < 0.001). The risk of CIN1 persistence and progression in positive group was 3.24 (1.96-5.37) times higher than that in negative group. There was significant difference between hr-HPV persist positive and turn to negative or persistent negative group (chi2 = 7.645, p = 0.006). There was significant difference between hTERC gene and the initial test of hr-HPV both positive and both negative group (chi2 = 4.544, p = 0.033).There was a strong association between prevalence of hTERC gene overexpression and CIN1 natural prognosis. The follow-up results indicated that Hr-HPV required repeat testing and that there was significant difference between hr-HPV persistent positive and turn to negative/persistent negative group (chi2 = 7.645, p = 0.006). hTERC gene overexpression could prognoses cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 natural prognosis individually.
