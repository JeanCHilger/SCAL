Impact of risk factors on prevalence of anal HPV infection in women with simultaneous cervical lesion. The aim of our study was to determine the risk factors associated with anal HPV infection in HIV-negative women with high-grade cervical lesion. The study group included 172 "high-risk" women who underwent conization for high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesion or microinvasive cervical cancer (CIN 2+). The control group consisted of 100 "low-risk" women with non-neoplastic gynecologic diseases. All participants completed a questionnaire detailing medical history and sexual risk factors and were subjected to anal and cervical HPV genotyping. Concurrent cervical and anal HPV infections were detected in 42.4% (73/172) women of the study group, and in 8.0% (8/100) of women in the control group, respectively. The subgroup with concurrent HPV infections (n=73) dominated women with CIN 3 and microinvasive cancer and anal HPV 16 infections (n=53). Women with concurrent infections more frequently reported any type of sexual contact with the anus including non-penetrative anal sex (OR 2.62, p=0.008). Reporting >5 lifetime sexual partners (OR 2.43, p=0.041), smoking > 60 cigarettes per week (OR 2.33, p=0.048), and a history of penetrative anal intercourse (OR 3.87, p=0.002) were observed as the significant risk factors in women with multiple concurrent HPV infections. Our data support anal HPV testing and anal Pap smear screening in all women with severe cervical lesions caused by HPV 16 and a history of any sexual contact with the anus, heavy smoking and/or more than 5 lifetime sexual partners.anal cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, HPV, risk factor.
