HPV genotyping among women treated for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with no lesion in the conization specimen. To evaluate whether specific HPV genotypes or multiple HPV infection are associated with absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in the conization specimen.In a retrospective study, data were reviewed for women treated by conization at a center in Barcelona, Spain, between 2008 and 2011. Women whose pretreatment biopsy showed CIN2/3 with positive p16 staining but had no lesions in the conization specimen were included in the study group if material was sufficient for HPV genotyping. Age-matched control patients who had CIN2/3 in the conization specimen were selected. HPV genotyping was conducted on all histologic specimens.Both groups contained 43 patients. High-risk HPV genotypes were identified in the conization specimens of 14 (33%) women in the study group and of 42 (98%) in the control group (P<0.001). HPV16/HPV18 was detected in the pretreatment biopsy samples of 27 (63%) women in the study group and 25 (58%) in the control group (P=0.413). Multiple HPV infections were detected pretreatment in 8 (19%) women in the study group and 9 (21%) in the control group (P=0.50).No association was found between HPV genotype or multiple HPV infection and absence of lesion in the conization specimen.
