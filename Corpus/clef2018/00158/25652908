HPV genotyping for triage of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening results: a multicenter prospective study. In cervical cancer screening programs, women with abnormal cytology are referred for colposcopy for histological evaluation. We examined whether a human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping assay could be used to identify women who do not need immediate colposcopy and biopsy because of low risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+).We prospectively evaluated test performance for 2 carcinogenic HPV genotypes (HPV16/18), for 8 types (HPV16/18/31/33/35/45/52/58), and for 13 types (HPV16/18/31/33/35/45/51/52/56/58/59/68) for prediction of histological CIN3+ results among 427 screen-positive women referred for colposcopy. The study subjects consisted of 214 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 184 with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and 29 with atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H).Among women with LSIL cytology, HPV16/18 positivity was 29.4 % and increased to 58.9 % for 8 types and to 74.8 % for 13 types (P < 0.001). The risk of CIN3+ biopsy results was still 7.9 % for women testing negative for HPV16/18, but decreased to 0.0 % for those testing negative for at least eight types of HPV (HPV16/18/31/33/35/45/52/58). Although HPV genotyping results enabled additional risk stratification among women with HSIL/ASC-H cytology, the risk of histological CIN3+ diagnosis among women testing negative for eight types or more was still sufficiently high (>35 %) to warrant immediate colposcopy referral.Of women with LSIL cytology, those testing negative for at least eight of the highest-risk types of HPV (HPV16/18/31/33/35/45/52/58) may not need immediate colposcopy and biopsy. This would reduce the number of colposcopy referrals by approximately 40 %. However, the HPV genotyping assay is not likely to alter the clinical management of women with HSIL/ASC-H.
