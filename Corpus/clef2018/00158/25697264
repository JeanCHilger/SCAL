GSTM1, GSTT1, and NQO1 polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis. The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical significance of glutathione-S-transferase GSTM1, GSTT1, and NQO1 c.609C>T (rs1800566) genetic polymorphisms in cervical carcinogenesis. GSTM1, GSTT1, and NQO1 polymorphisms together with human papillomavirus (HPV) types were examined in a total of 192 cervical smear in exfoliated cervical cell samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system. The 19 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion had statistically higher frequency of null GSTT1 genotype than 9 with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) among the 67 patients with high-risk HPV (P = 0.024). The 24 patients with HSIL had also statistically higher frequency of NQO1 (CT+TT) genotype than 14 with LSIL among the 67 patients with high-risk HPV (P = 0.024). GSTT1 null and NQO1 genotype in cervical cell samples may be associated with more severe precancerous lesions of the cervix in a Japanese population.
