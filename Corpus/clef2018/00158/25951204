The clinical significance of cervical atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: analysis of 200 patients with long-term follow-up. Two hundred premenopausal middle- or upper-income women in monogamous relationships and without a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or genital human papillomavirus infection underwent prospective evaluation for repetitive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance Papanicolaou (Pap) cervical smears.Only two patients were found to have or developed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions after 2 years of follow-up. Only 10 patients had or developed lowgrade squamous intraepithelial lesions.The usefulness of the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance category in detecting cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions appears to be of limited value in this patient population.
