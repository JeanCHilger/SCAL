Human papillomavirus combined with cytology and margin status identifies patients at risk for recurrence after conization for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To compare the ability of cytology, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and co-testing to identify recurrence of patients treated by loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2-3.Retrospective analysis (R.A.): the medical records of 372 women treated for CIN 2-3 were reviewed. Resection margin, HPV typing, Pap smears, and biopsies post-LEEP were collected. Prospective analysis (P.A.): 97 women were followed post-LEEP by cytology, HPV test and colposcopy every six months.Positive margins were found to be an independent risk factor for recurrent disease (OR 0.192 95% CI 0.074-0.497 in R.A. and OR 0.096Co-testing is the best option in follow-up protocols after treatment for CIN 2-3. If margins are free and co-testing is negative at six and 12 months, 18 months visit could be avoided.
