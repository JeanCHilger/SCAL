A novel highly sensitive and specific flow cytometry system for cervical cancer screening. This study assessed the performance of a novel flow cytometry (FCM) cervical cancer screening system compared with human papillomavirus (HPV) Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2).Chinese women aged 20years or older were enrolled in this study at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. All participants underwent cytology/pathology testing (gold standard), HPV HC2 testing and FCM testing involving analysis of cell proliferation index (CPIx).Among 437 women enrolled in this study, 185 women (42.3%) were diagnosed as "gold standard positive" by pathology with diseases including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 (n=11), CIN3 (n=41), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC n=115), adenocarcinoma in situ (n=2) and adenocarcinoma (n=16). The remaining 252 cases were deemed "gold standard negative". The sensitivity was 87.6% (95% CI, 82.8-92.3) for FCM testing and 89.7% (95% CI, 85.4-94.1Our results showed that the FCM screening system had high sensitivity and specificity for women of various ages. The FCM CPIx was able to evaluate the severity of disease quantitatively.
