Is colposcopic evaluation necessary in all women with postcoital bleeding? To evaluate what extent postcoital bleeding (PCB) is an indicator of cervical cancer (CIN2 (+)).This is a retrospective cohort study. Between 2007 and 2013, amongst all referred patients, a total of 1491 consecutive women who had both conventional cytology and cervical biopsy were enrolled in the study. Of those 237 women have PCB, according to biopsy results, subjects were divided into two groups: CIN1 (-) and CIN2 (+). Multiple logistic regressions was used to construct a model to predict the occurrence of CIN 2 (+) based on age, menopause, marriage status, smoking, PCB, HPV and cytology.Among the all women with CIN 2 (+) colposcopy guided biopsy result, PCB was 13.1% (53/406). The relationship between biopsy results and age, parity, menopausal status, marital status, smoking, presence of PCB, HPV DNA, and cytology is statistically significant (p=0.012, p=0.001, p=0.023, 0.013, p>0.001, p=0.038, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). According to regression analysis only smoking, HPV (+) and abnormal cytology increase the probability of CIN2 (+) 1.687 times (p=0.018), 4.065 times (p<0.001), 5.787 times (p=0.001) respectively. Having PCB only does not indicate an increased risk of CIN2 (+).Colposcopic examination and biopsy should be performed only in the situation where women have PCB and any of the following: smoking, positive HPV, or abnormal cytology.
