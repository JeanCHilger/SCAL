Impact of RAD51 G135C and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms on ovarian carcinoma risk in Serbian women. The polymorphic variations of DNA repair genes may contribute to functional deficiencies in DNA repair processes increasing susceptibility to cancer. We aimed to investigate the impact of 135G>C RAD51 and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms on ovarian carcinoma risk in Serbian women.The study included 50 ovarian carcinoma samples and 78 cervical swabs of gynecologically healthy age-matched controls. RAD51 G135C and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP. Deviations of the genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were assessed using the Ï‡2 test. The allele- and genotype-specific risks were estimated as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.RAD51 135C and XRCC1 Arg allele are associated with ovarian carcinoma [OR (95% CI): 2.54 (1.22-5.29) for C vs. G 2.64 (1.53-4.55) for Arg vs. Gln]. RAD51 C exerts its effect in dominant (CC plus GC vs. GG) [OR (95% CI): 2.83 (1.21-6.62], while XRCC1Arg in dominant (ArgArg plus ArgGln vs. GlnGln) [OR (95% CI): 4.76 (1.69-13.42)] and recessive model (ArgArg vs. ArgGln plus GlnGln) [OR (95% CI): 2.21 (1.07-4.56)].The results suggest that the RAD51 G135C and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms could be biomarkers of susceptibility for ovarian carcinoma development. Further larger case-control study is needed to confirm our findings.
