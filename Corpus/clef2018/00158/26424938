Improving compliance with cervical cancer screening guidelines. Current cervical cancer screening guidelines for the care of healthy women include HPV cotesting with all Papanicolaou (Pap) smears after the age of 30. To improve compliance with current guidelines, we instituted two processes: first, simplifying the ordering process to a single order for Pap smear plus HPV cotesting using an electronic medical record system (EMR) and second, providing education for clinic staff. Baseline and postintervention data were collected by retrospective chart review. Patients were selected during three intervals: prior to the transition to Epic EMR, after the transition to Epic, and after an educational intervention. Compliance with standard guidelines was evaluated in relation to the trial intervals, type of provider, patient age, and duration from the previous Pap smear. Provider type was analyzed by considering gynecologists versus nongynecologist providers, and physicians versus mid-level providers. Overall, the percentage of compliance with HPV test ordering did not differ (P = 0.21) between intervals. Univariate analyses performed to identify factors likely to be associated with the practice of ordering HPV cotesting only involved the type of provider. In conclusion, transition to Epic and a training session had minimal impact on compliance with ordering HPV cotesting at the time of a Pap smear except among family practice physicians, who did significantly improve their compliance rate. Gynecologists and mid-level providers were more compliant with ordering HPV cotesting throughout, but did not significantly improve after the interventions.
