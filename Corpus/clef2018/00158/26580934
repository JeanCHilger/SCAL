Demographic characteristics of human papillomavirus detected by PCR-RFLP in peruvian women. In order to determine the sociodemographic characteristics of human papillomavirus (HPV) in patients referred to the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases (INEN) between 2012-2014, the detection of HPV in cervical cells was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 465 cervical samples, 151 (32.5%) cases were HPV positive. The most common genotypes were HPV-16 (23.8%) and HPV-6 (11.9%). The presence of HPV was higher in women aged 17-29 years (OR = 2.64, 95% CI 1.14 to 6.13) and single women (OR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.91). The presence of genotypes of high-risk HPV was higher in single women (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.62). In conclusion, young and single women had a higher frequency of HPV-positive cases. Therefore participation by these groups should be emphasized in screening programs with combined molecular and cytological methods in order to detect the risk of developing cervical cancer in a timely manner.
