Follow up of women with a history of mildly abnormal cervical smears which have returned to normal without treatment. The progress of 124 women with at least two negative cervical smears following a history of mildly abnormal smears for which no treatment had been given was compared with 106 women with negative smears and a clinical history of genital warts or herpes virus infection and 460 age-matched controls. After 4 years, excluding those for whom there was no follow up, 5.8% of those with a history of abnormal smears, none of those with a clinical history of genital warts or herpes virus and 1.1% of controls had developed histological evidence of at least cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CINIII) when referred for investigation of subsequent abnormal smears one woman, from the control group, had developed invasive cervical cancer. Women with two negative smears after a history of abnormal smears who subsequently developed CINIII were more likely to have had a previous smear reported as moderate or mild-moderate dyskaryosis (2/6) compared with those whose follow up was negative (2/89). The results suggest that two negative cervical smears may not necessarily indicate that a lesion has regressed, but that a clinical history of genital warts or herpes virus infection should not be an indication for increased surveillance.
