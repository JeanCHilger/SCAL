Prevalence of deletions of YY1-binding sites in episomal HPV 16 DNA from cervical cancers. Expression of the oncogenes E6 and E7 of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV 16) appears enhanced in pre-malignant and malignant genital tumors. We recently identified a transcriptional silencer upstream of the oncogene promoter P97, comprising 4 binding sites for the cellular YY1 protein. The analysis of the long transcriptional control regions (LCR) of episomal HPV 16 DNAs from primary tumors and lymph-node metastases of 6 patients with cervical cancer revealed deletions and point mutations of YY1 binding sites in 4 cases. To test for the activity of the P97 promoter, the mutated LCRs were cloned in a luciferase reporter gene vector. A point mutation in YY1-recognition site 4, which prevents DNA-protein interaction, did not affect promoter activity, probably due to compensation by the overlapping YY1-binding site 3. However, 5.5- to 6.5-fold increased luciferase expression was obtained under the control of 3 shortened LCRs lacking 2 to 4 YY1-binding sites. A point mutation in YY1-recognition site 2, which was previously shown to stimulate P97 3.5-fold, could be detected in the HPV 16 LCRs from both primary tumor and metastasis, indicating that the mutation is a stable characteristic of HPV 16 DNA associated with the individual cancer. These findings suggest that deletions or mutations of YY1-binding sites play a significant role in over-expression of viral oncogenes and tumor progression.
