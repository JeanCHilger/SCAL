Relationships of cervical cytologies to selected variables among women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. A retrospective chart review was conducted for one year to determine cervical cytological abnormalities and their distribution among women attending a STD clinic, and to analyse cervical cytologies by STD diagnosis and history or presence of genital warts. Analysis was performed on 790 Pap smears. Most (60%) cytologies were benign. Prevalence of STD among CIN-1 cytologies (78%) was significantly higher (P = 0.02) than among benign cytologies (46%). Commonest cytologies presenting among youngest age groups were CIN-1/condyloma, CIN-1, CIN-2. Women with preceding or concurrent clinical HPV infection had significantly more HPV associated changes on cytology (P < 0.001) than women with no such history. The presentation of cytological abnormalities considered to be precursors to cervical cancer among sexually active young women demonstrates the importance of Pap smear testing of STD clinic populations.
