Role of steroid hormones in potentiating transformation of cervical cells by human papillomaviruses. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are etiologically involved in cervical neoplasia, and epidemiological evidence suggests that steroid hormones can increase the risk of this cancer in HPV-infected women. Steroids can interact with hormone-response elements in the viral long control region, enhancing HPV transcription and resulting in transformation of cervical cells. Subsequent malignant progression may involve virus-induced chromosomal instability, facilitating viral DNA integration and deregulation of gene expression.
