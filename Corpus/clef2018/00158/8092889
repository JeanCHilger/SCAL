Immunohistochemical localization of filaggrin in benign, premalignant and malignant cervical tissue. Epithelial distribution of filaggrin, a histidine-rich protein related to squamous terminal differentiation, was investigated in 87 cervical biopsies using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique with a monoclonal anti-human filaggrin antibody (AKH1). Normal squamous cervical epithelium exhibited a positive homogeneous immunoperoxidase stain in the upper parabasal, intermediate and superficial cell layers. Similar findings were obtained in cervical condylomas, although full-thickness staining was observed in 35.7% of the cases (P < 0.001). Filaggrin expression in CIN was inversely related to the severity of the lesion (P < 0.001). An irregular staining pattern was present in most high-grade CIN. Filaggrin expression was closely connected to the degree of tumour differentiation (P < 0.05) in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix. Abnormal filaggrin stainings identified a premalignant/malignant cervical squamous lesion with a positive predictive value of 92.3%. Non-squamous epithelia showed lack of filaggrin expression. Filaggrin may therefore be considered a marker of squamous differentiation in both the normal and pathological human uterine cervix.
