Human papilloma virus types in routine cytological screening and at colposcopic examinations. Certain types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) play a crucial role in the development of anogenital cellular dysplasia and cancer. We have searched for a broad spectrum of HPV-types by PCR in cervical cell samples from 230 women aged 20-29 years enrolled at routine gynecological health control and 506 women referred to colposcopy due to suspected cytological changes. Thirteen percent of the health control women had HPV DNA of identified types. Half of the colposcopy patients showed benign histology with corresponding HPV DNA prevalence of 18%, while among the patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia between 61% and 78% had HPV DNA. Among both women with normal cytology or histology and those with various degrees of cervical dysplasia, cancer-related HPV types represented about 85% of the types found. The strong correlation between HPV infections and development of cervical dysplasia is an argument for HPV DNA testing of certain patient groups.
