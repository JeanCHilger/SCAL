Human papillomavirus DNA in locally recurrent cervical cancer. Ten vaginal and central recurrences of cervical carcinoma were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization under nonstringent and stringent conditions for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 11, 16, 18, 31, and 35 DNA. Cases judged HPV-negative by this assay were tested with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV 16 and 18. All 10 recurrences were HPV-positive. Seven tumors contained HPV 16, one contained HPV 18, one contained HPV 16 and 18, and one contained HPV-related sequences. In three cases, where the corresponding primary tumor could be studied, the identical HPV type was contained. The consistent presence of HPV DNA in local recurrences of invasive cervical carcinoma argues in favor of a role of these viruses also in the maintenance and reappearance of malignancy.
