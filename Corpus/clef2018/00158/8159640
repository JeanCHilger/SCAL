Detection of human papillomaviruses in paraffin-embedded biopsies of cervical intraepithelial lesions: analysis by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and the polymerase chain reaction. One hundred and forty biopsies with an initial diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIL) were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using commercial biotinylated probes (Vira-Type in situ assay Digene Diagnostics, Silver Spring, MD) or probes labeled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique. Immunohistochemistry was more inferior to the in situ hybridization method, with a detection rate of 14% (20/140) compared to 61% (86/140) for the in situ assay with the digoxigenin-labeled probes. Biotinylated probes proved to be slightly less sensitive than digoxigenin-labeled probes, with a detection rate of 53% (74/140). Although less sensitive in our series taken as a whole, immunohistochemistry was positive in a few cases of CILs negative by in situ hybridization, so that the association of these techniques gave the highest detection rate (66%
