Papilloma virus infections in women with cervical pathology. The presence of Papilloma capsid antigen in patients hospitalized in the Institute of Gynecology and Obstetrics was studied, using immunoperoxidase technique. Of 73 patients, 44 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), in the following grades - CIN 1 (n = 21), CIN 2 (n = 5), CIN 3 (n = 18). Two cases of squamous cell carcinoma were confirmed. In 9 other patients cervical infections were found. Eighteen women with normal PAP smears were treated as the control group. For Human Papilloma Virus studies, smears were taken from 73 patients, and cervical from 8 women only. Of the 44 patients with CIN, in 7 cases (15.2%) capsid antigen was found. The frequency of Papilloma virus antigen detection was higher in the biopsy material than in the cervical smears. Chlamydia trachomatis infections and the presence of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma in the genital tract were also studied. Chlamydia trachomatis was found in 14.3% of the CIN patients, and Ureaplasma urealyticum dominated both in women with CIN (40.5%) and in women with genital inflammatory diseases (55.6%).
