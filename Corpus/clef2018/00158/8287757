Cervical cytology findings in women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. It has been suggested that immunocompromised, HIV-infected patients are at risk of developing HPV infection and SIL. The well documented role of HPV and SIL in cervical carcinogenesis should lead to frequent, careful evaluation of HIV infected women. Forty-four cervical smears from 23 patients (20 HIV and 3 AIDS) were reviewed. While 11 of the 23 patients produced negative smears, 11 had abnormal cytological findings on at least one occasion. Sixteen smears (36 percent) from 10 patients (43%) showed evidence of HPV and/or SIL. Two smears (two patients) were assigned to the benign epithelial atypia category. (One of these showed keratosis which may indicate HPV infection.) Six smears (three patients) represented either a severe Trichomonas, fungal (Candida sp.), or Herpes infection. Three smears were deemed unsatisfactory for diagnosis due to severe acute inflammation or obscuring blood. Five biopsies were available. In four, histologic findings supported the original cytologic diagnosis. One patient with a negative smear had a biopsy showing condyloma. This study further supports an association of HPV and/or cervical dysplasia with HIV. Careful evaluation and follow-up of HIV-infected women is essential.
