Detection of human papillomavirus 16 and 18 DNA in epithelial lesions of the lower genital tract by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction: cervical scrapes are not substitutes for biopsies. Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 in 66 women with histologically documented lesions of the genital tract and 64 control cohorts were investigated. The efficacies of in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in detecting HPV 16 and 18 DNA were analyzed. In order to assess the usefulness of replacing biopsies with cervical scrapes, the two samples were compared by PCR. The prevalence rates of HPV infection by PCR were 59.1 and 10.9% in patients and controls, respectively. PCR was three times more sensitive than in situ hybridization (52.6 versus 17.8%). However, the need to improve PCR sensitivity by subsequent dot blot hybridization reduced one of the main advantages of PCR, i.e., expeditious diagnosis. Cervical scrapes were less sensitive than biopsies (13.6 versus 53%), although with four (6.1%) patients with intraepithelial neoplasias, HPV DNA was identified only by means of cervical scraping. We conclude that obtaining biopsy specimens and cervical scraping are complementary sampling procedures.
