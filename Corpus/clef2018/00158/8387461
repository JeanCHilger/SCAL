Genital types of papillomavirus in children of women with HIV-1 infection in Kinshasa, Zaire. Increasing evidence indicates that infection with genital types of human papillomavirus (HPV) can occur prior to the onset of sexual activity, possibly by perinatal transmission. Evidence is also accumulating that women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) more frequently express HPV. We conducted this study to measure HPV prevalence in HIV-seropositive and -seronegative women in Kinshasa, Zaire and in their children. We collected cervico-vaginal lavage specimens from 80 mothers (52 HIV-seropositive and 28 HIV-seronegative at the time of delivery) and oropharyngeal and perineal specimens from their 81 3-year old children (21 HIV-seropositive and 60-seronegative). We used the ViraPap and ViraType assay to test specimens for HPV DNA by the dot-blot technique. Detection of HPV in the mother was highly associated with HIV: 20 HIV-seropositive women and one seronegative woman had HPV DNA. Ten children had HPV DNA. However, detection of HPV in the children was not associated with the mothers' HPV or HIV status or with the child's own HIV status. These findings document a substantial prevalence in young children of HPV DNA types that are linked to genital-tract neoplasia in adults, but do not specifically support a hypothesis of mother-to-child transmission of genital HPV types.
