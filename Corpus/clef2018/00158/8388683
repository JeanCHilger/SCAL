Transmission of human papillomaviruses from mother to child. Exfoliated cervical epithelial cells from women 6 weeks postpartum were analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using the polymerase chain reaction, and results were compared with those from buccal mucosal smears from their babies. Eleven mothers had genital genotypes of HPV in their cervical smears, and the children of 8 of these had HPV of the same genotype in buccal mucosal cell samples. Nineteen mothers had no HPV DNA detected in their cervical smears, and 1 of the buccal mucosal cell samples from their children was positive for HPV DNA (p < 0.0001). Contamination of a child's mouth with 'genital' HPV from a mother's cervix appears to occur commonly at birth or in the perinatal period, and to persist for at least 6 weeks. This observation has implications for the epidemiology and management of HPV associated cancer and precancerous conditions in the cervix and the mouth.
