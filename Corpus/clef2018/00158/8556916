A study on the relationship between cervical carcinoma, dysplasia and sexually transmitted diseases. To reveal the relationship between cervical carcinoma, dysplasia and infections of human papillomavirus (HPV) and/or chlamydia trachomatis (CT).Indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) was used in 99 patients with cervical lesions to test the specific antibody to CT in serum. At the same time, HPV in biopsies was determined from 40 patients with or without CT infection by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).(1) CT infection was found in a significantly greater proportion in women suffering from cervical carcinoma (61.5%) and dysplasia (83.3%) than in those of the control group (39.5%) (P < 0.01). (2) Under colposcopy, the incidence of white epithelium in patients suffering from dysplasia was 28.6% (12/42) in the CT positive group, while in the CT negative group the incidence was 6.5% (2/31). The incidence of white epithelium in patients with both CT and HPV infections was higher than that in patients with CT infection alone. (3) In CT positive group, the incidence of HPV in patients suffering from cervical cancer and from dysplasia (60%) was much higher than that in the CT negative group (10%).CT and HPV-infections play a synergetic role in the etiology of cervical cancer.
