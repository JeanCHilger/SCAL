Screening for cervical neoplasia in Mamelodi--lessons from an unscreened population. To determine the prevalence of abnormal cervical cytological findings in an unscreened population to assess patients' awareness of cervical cancer and the importance of early diagnosisDescriptive.Mamelodi Hospital, a community day hospital east of Pretoria, serving a black urbanised population that had never been exposed to a routine cervical cytological screening programme.One thousand and ninety-five women of reproductive age, who presented with a non-gynaecological complaint, were offered cervical cytological testing and were asked to complete a questionnaire. Visual appreciation of the cervical condition was noted and compared with the cytology report.The prevalence of abnormal cervical cytological findings (low- and high-grade squamous cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN), excluding human papillomavirus-induced cell changes only) was 54/1,000. Only 2% of the patients had a good knowledge of cervical cancer and cervical screening. Visual inspection of the cervix detected 4 out of 5 cervical cancers in this group, but failed to identify those patients with high-grade CIN.This study shows a high prevalence of abnormal cervical cytological findings in a population ignorant about cervical cancer. Recommendations on how to improve this situation are made.
