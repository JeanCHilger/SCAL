Can papilloma virus testing be used to improve cervical cancer screening? This report investigates different options for using human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in cervical cancer prevention. These options are evaluated by a stochastic model of the progression of pre-malignancy and its relationship to HPV infection. Three screening policies are compared: 2 based on cytological screening, with or without HPV testing, and 1 in which HPV testing is the primary screening method. A policy of HPV testing for women with mildly abnormal smears would have little effect on the overall incidence of invasive cancer when compared with a policy of repeat cytology, provided follow-up is efficient. Moreover, the potential value of HPV testing as a primary screening method is strongly dependent on the proportion of neoplasias that are HPV-negative. Important factors in assessing the future role of HPV testing would be cost-effectiveness and benefits from improved compliance.
