Bethesda classification of cervicovaginal smears: reproducibility and viral correlates. Fifty-five cervicovaginal smears from women with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) were independently evaluated on two separate occasions by four cytopathologists using a binary classification system (the Bethesda system). Smears were categorized as low-grade (LSIL) or high-grade (HSIL) using previously published criteria. All women had subsequent cervical biopsies containing human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and typed by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. Three or more observers agreed on classification in 49 of 55 cases (87%) unanimous diagnoses were rendered in 31 cases (56%). Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility ranged from fair to near-excellent (kappa values 0.40 to 0.63
