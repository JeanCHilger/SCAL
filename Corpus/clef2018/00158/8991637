T-cell proliferative response to human papillomavirus type 16 peptides: relationship to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer is increased with immunodeficiency, but the role of immune response, including cell-mediated immunity, in disease prevention is not well understood. In this study, T-cell proliferative responses to six synthetic peptides with predicted immunogenic determinants from the HPV-16 E4, E6, E7, and L1 open reading frames were analyzed in 22 sexually active women with new-onset CIN and 65 sexually active women without cervical disease, characterized by cytology, colposcopy, and HPV testing. T-cell proliferative responses were demonstrated to all six HPV-16 peptides. Although not statistically significant, rates of reactivity to E6 (24-45) were higher among sexually active women without disease (26%) than among women with current CIN (7%), as was the overall number of peptides stimulating a response. Women with CIN may not respond to selected HPV antigens as well as women without disease do.
