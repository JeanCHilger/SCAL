Human papillomavirus DNA and antibodies to human papillomaviruses 16 E2, L2, and E7 peptides as predictors of survival in patients with squamous cell cervical cancer. To assess whether human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection in cervical cancer specimens, or antibodies to selected HPV 16 peptides are predictors of tumor recurrence and long-term survival in patients with squamous cell invasive cervical cancer.Four hundred seventy-one cases included in two population-based case-control studies underwent follow-up evaluation. The survival and cause of death were ascertained for 410 cases (87%), with a median follow-up time of 4.6 years after diagnosis. HPV DNA was assessed using an L1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based system and Southern hybridization (SH) on scraped cytologic specimens or biopsies. HPV 16 antibodies to E2, L2, and E7 peptides were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Clinical stage was the only independent prognostic factor for recurrence or survival. Although seropositivity to HPV 16 E7/3 peptide predicted a twofold excess risk of mortality (adjusted hazards ratio [HRa] = 2.0 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 3.3), the association was restricted to stage I (HRa = 6.6The presence of antibodies to HPV 16 E7 proteins is of prognostic value in early-stage cervical cancer. Our results provide strong evidence that detection and typing of HPV DNA in cervical cells or tissues is not a prognostic factor for recurrence or survival.
