Detection of human papillomavirus type 16 early-gene transcription by reverse transcription-PCR is associated with abnormal cervical cytology. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is associated with abnormal Papanicolou smears, indicative of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV-16 is the most common genital HPV and is found in up to 40% of young women with normal cervical cytology. In order to investigate whether transcriptionally active HPV-16 infection is associated with abnormal cervical smears, a reverse transcription-nested PCR assay with primers from the E5 open reading frame was developed to detect all HPV-16 early-region mRNA (E-mRNA) transcripts. It was used to study HPV-16-infected women with normal and abnormal cervical cytologies to obtain evidence of active infection. Among HPV-16 DNA-positive women, HPV-16 E-mRNA was detected in 15 of 37 (40.5%) women with abnormal cervical cytology but in only 4 of 35 (11.4%) women with normal cytology (P = 0.007). Thus, HPV-16 E-mRNA transcription is associated with abnormal cervical smears and may have value as a prognostic marker of progressive disease.
