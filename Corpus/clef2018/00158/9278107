The diagnostic value of cytomorphological traits in low and high risk type HPV infections. The purpose of the study was to establish the diagnostic value of cytomorphological traits present in cervical smears in determining HPV infection. We examined 528 women, most of them between 18 and 34 years of age and sexually active, for the prevalence of HPV infection and compared the results of HPV DNA detection with the presence of cytomorphological traits of HPV infection in their cervical smears. The Digene Hybride Capture System technique was employed to detect HPV DNA in cytological material cervical smears were examined by an experienced pathologist, who did not have prior knowledge of the HPV DNA test results. None of the cytomorphological traits examined proved to be pathognomonic for HPV infection. The diagnosis of HPV infection cannot be determined with certainty by a routine cytological examination. Only 15% of cervical smears from women infected with HPV showed classic cytomorphological traits of HPV infection - koilocytosis and/or dyskeratosis. We conclude that if more than three non-classic traits of HPV infection are found in a cervical smear, HPV infection can be suspected.
