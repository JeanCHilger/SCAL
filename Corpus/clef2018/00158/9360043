Detection of high-grade cervical dysplasia: impact of age and Bethesda system terminology. Pap smear, colposcopy, and biopsy results were collected from 1988-1993 at a group of family planning clinics. Positive predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated for diagnosis of high-grade lesions based on age and Pap smear results.
