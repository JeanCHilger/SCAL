The papillomavirus E6 proteins. Specific types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) are strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer. The E6 gene from cancer-related HPVs has exhibited functions in tumorigenesis, regulation of transcription, telomerase, and apoptosis. Cancer-related HPVs E6 proteins bind the tumor suppressor p53 and promotes its degradation through an ubiquitin-dependent pathway. Several additional cellular E6-binding proteins have recently been identified and implicated in playing roles in p53-independent functions of E6.
