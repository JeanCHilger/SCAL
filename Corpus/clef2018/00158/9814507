Metastatic thyroid carcinoma arising from congenital goiter due to mutation in the thyroperoxidase gene. A very large cervical tumor that extended to the upper mediastinum was seen in a newborn after an uneventful pregnancy. The computed axial tomography scan confirmed the presence of a solid mass with precise limits and scattered foci of calcifications situated in the anterolateral region of the neck. The infant underwent thyroidectomy on the seventh day after birth. Pathological examination revealed a follicular carcinoma of the thyroid and probable dyshormonogenetic hyperplastic goiter. At 5 months of age, whole body scans indicated the presence of lung and bone metastases, which were treated with therapeutic doses of radioiodine. Genomic DNA was obtained from the newborn, her parents, her paternal aunt, and her paternal grandparents. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR fragments corresponding to exon 14 of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene indicated the presence of a mutant TPO allele present in the propositus, her father, and her paternal grandmother. Sequencing of the TPO gene demonstrated a mutation resulting from an insertion of a single extra cytosine in a stretch of seven cytosines at positions 2505-2511. The insertion caused a frame shift and a stop signal in exon 16. This sequence would translate into a structurally modified and probably inactive TPO protein. We conclude that the aggressive thyroid metastatic carcinoma arose from a dyshormonogenetic goiter caused by a defective TPO protein.
