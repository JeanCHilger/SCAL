Risk factors for HPV detection in archival Pap smears. A population-based study from Greenland and Denmark. The most important risk factor for cervical cancer is genital infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). The presence of HPV was studied in archival smears from a random sample of women living in Greenland (GW) and Denmark (DW) having, respectively, a high risk and an intermediate risk for cervical cancer. Risk factors were also examined of the original 126 Danish and 129 Greenlandic archived smears collected during October and November 1988. 125 were located from each country including all abnormal smears. HPV DNA was isolated from the smears and detected by means of a consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detecting a broad spectrum of genital HPV types. HPV was detected in all the abnormal smears and in 22 and 33% respectively of the cytological normal smears from DW and GW. Risk of HPV was significantly higher in smears from women who started sexual life relatively recently (respectively, < or = 4 and < or = 6 years ago in DW and GW) compared with > or = 10 years ago (adjusted prevalence-OR: 9.3 95% CI: 2.2-39.2 in DW and 5.9
