Prognostic features of cervical dysplasia associated with specific types of HPV DNA and cytologic features characteristic of HPV infection in dysplasia. To study a possible etiologic relationship between the prognosis of uterine cervical dysplasia, association of type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and cytologic features characteristic of HPV infection.Two hundred thirteen cases of uterine cervical dysplasia were selected in which follow-up survey for more than two years was possible. Frequency of the presence of HPV DNA in the DNA samples was determined by polymerase chain reaction. The cervical scrapings were also examined microscopically for the frequencies of cells with cytologic features characteristic of HPV infection.HPV was positive in 98 cases (46.0%). The high-risk type of HPV was detected at almost the same frequencies in both progressive and regressive states of dysplasia. Cytologic features were more evident in cells infected with the low-risk type of HPV.Involvement of an as-yet-unknown factor or factors coupled with infection with the high-risk type of HPV is implicated in the progression of uterine cervical dysplasia. Cytologic features characteristic of HPV infection may serve as a diagnostic marker for a favorable prognosis in dysplasia.
