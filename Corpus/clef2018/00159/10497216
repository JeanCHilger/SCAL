The Brn-3a transcription factor plays a critical role in regulating human papilloma virus gene expression and determining the growth characteristics of cervical cancer cells. The Brn-3a POU family transcription factor has previously been shown to activate the human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) promoter driving the expression of the E6- and E7-transforming proteins. Moreover, Brn-3a is overexpressed approximately 300-fold in cervical biopsies from women with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia type 3 (CIN3) compared with normal cervical material. To test the role of Brn-3a in cervical neoplasia we have manipulated its expression in cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines with or without endogenous HPV genes. In HPV-expressing cells, reduction in Brn-3a expression specifically reduces HPV gene expression, growth rate, saturation density and anchorage-independent growth, whereas these effects are not observed when Brn-3a expression is reduced in cervical cells lacking HPV genomes. Together with our previous observations, these findings indicate a critical role for Brn-3a in regulating HPV gene expression and thereby in controlling the growth/transformation of cervical cells.
