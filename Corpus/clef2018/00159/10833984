Combined Pap smear, cervicography and HPV DNA testing in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer. The sensitivity of the Pap smear (PAP) continues to be the subject of debate. During the past several years, cervicography (CER) and HPV DNA testing have been suggested as optional tools in the screening of cervical cancer precursors.The performance characteristics of PAP, CER and HPV DNA testing (hybrid capture test [HCT]) in all potential combinations were evaluated in a series of 1,030 women (aged 16-70, median, 33), subjected to colposcopy (COLPO) as the reference tool.Of the 992 evaluable cases, 402/992 (41%) had positive COLPO (i.e., an abnormal transformation zone). Of them, 298 women underwent directed punch biopsy, while of the COLPO negative patients, 18/93 positive by at least one of the three tests had endocervical curettage. Of the 402 COLPO positive women, 146 (36%) remained negative on all tests, whereas 256 (64%) had at least one positive test. There were 84 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3 lesions and 6 invasive carcinomas. Of the former, 10 were detected by PAP alone, 4 by CER alone and 3 by HCT alone. Three of the 6 carcinomas were HCT negative. The predictive value (PPV) of a positive test was 45% for PAP, 51% for CER and 48% for HCT. The combinations of PAP with CER (for PAP negative cases) and PAP with HCT were more sensitive for CIN 2 and 3 (95% and 94%, respectively) as compared with PAP alone but were associated with a significant decrease in specificity (44% and 46% vs. 57%, respectively). However, both combinations retained a PPV (43%) similar to that of PAP alone (45%).The potential combinations of PAP with CER and with HCT were more sensitive in detecting CIN 2 and 3 as compared with PAP alone and retained a PPV similar to that of PAP.
