Relationship between HPV infection of the cervix and blood serum levels of steroid hormones among pre- and postmenopausal women. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are frequently present in anogenital lesions but little is known about their role in carcinogenesis. There are steroid hormone response elements in virus genomes that influence expression patterns of viral genes. Activity of the elements may contribute to development of neoplasia in case of hormone level anomalies. Our study was to determine whether the presence of HPV DNA in cervical smears correlates with abnormal levels, of steroid hormones in blood serum. One hundred women aged 40-62 participated in the tests and were divided into two groups: premenopausal and postmenopausal (45 and 55 individuals, respectively). Presence of HPV DNA in cervical smears was detected by PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. Progesterone and estradiol levels in blood serum were measured by radioimmunoassay. Our study showed a higher prevalence of HPV DNA in women with higher levels of progesterone in blood serum. A relationship between hormone level and HPV DNA prevalence should alert clinicians about using hormone contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy.
