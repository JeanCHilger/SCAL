Cervical neoplasia and repeated positivity of human papillomavirus infection in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive and -seronegative women. Increased risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women may be explained by repeated positivity of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection facilitated by HIV infection and related immunosuppression. As part of a longitudinal study with semiannual examinations, 268 women in Baltimore, Maryland (of whom 184 were HIV+), provided 1,426 cervicovaginal lavage specimens tested for HPV DNA by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay between 1992 and 1998. HPV positivity and time to HPV clearance according to HIV serostatus and CD4+ cell count were compared using models for correlated binary data and survival analysis. Of the 187 participants who had at least one positive measurement, the probability of subsequent HPV positivity among HIV- women and HIV+ women with CD4+ > or =200 and <200 cells/microl was 47.5%, 78.7%, and 92.9% (p < 0.001). Within-women HPV results were correlated (i.e., clustered) in each group (p < 0.01). Compared with HIV-participants, the relative incidence of HPV clearance was 0.29 and 0.10 among HIV+ women with CD4+ > or =200 and <200 cells/microl (p < 0.001). At the end of follow-up, 11 women had biopsy-confirmed CIN. The association of HIV and CIN (p = 0.014) was fully explained by repeated HPV positivity induced by HIV infection (p = 0.648). Reversal of immunosuppression following potent antiretroviral therapy must be expected to have a dramatic impact on HIV-related CIN.
