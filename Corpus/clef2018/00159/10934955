Glandular and squamous atypia and intraepithelial lesions in atrophic cervicovaginal smears. One institution's experience. To review the cytologic features and follow-up histologic findings in atrophic cervicovaginal smears with the diagnoses of glandular or squamous atypia or intraepithelial lesion.A total of 228 cases were included in the study. The selection criteria included: age > 48 years and a diagnosis of either atypical glandular cells (AGC) (51 cases), cellular changes suggestive of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (S/O HPV, 97 cases), low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (60 cases) or high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (20 cases). Follow-up biopsy information was available for 103 cases (45%).From the AGC group, 35 (69%) cases had tissue studies 14 (40%) cases showed glandular lesionsEven though atrophy-related epithelial changes often pose diagnostic difficulties in the interpretation of postmenopausal smears, application of reproducible and established cytologic criteria in diagnosing SIL and/or glandular lesions can improve diagnostic accuracy and result in selection of patients for follow-up tissue studies.
