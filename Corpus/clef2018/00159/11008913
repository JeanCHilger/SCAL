Human papillomavirus testing for primary screening of cervical cancer precursors. Our objective was to determine whether the addition of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to screening cytology improves the detection of cervical cancer precursors. Women of ages 18-69 years underwent conventional Pap cytology and HPV DNA testing in a multicenter study in Newfoundland, Canada. Those with positive cytology and/or HPV and a random sample of those with dual negative results were referred for colposcopy. The study enrolled 2098 women. The relative sensitivity of HPV testing was significantly higher than cytology for all-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [SILs 73%
