The role of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid assay and repeated cervical cytologic examination in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women. Cervical Disease Study Group of the American Foundation for AIDS Research Community Based Clinical Trials Network. We sought to measure the characteristics of a quantitative human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid assay and repeated cervical cytologic examination in screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.Human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with screening CD4+ lymphocyte counts of < or = 500 cells/mm3 (n = 103) were examined by quantitative human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid assay and serial cervical cytologic examination and by colposcopy with biopsy and endocervical curettage during the course of 1 year.Quantitative measures of total human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid and high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were strongly associated with any cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (P = .005) and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (P = .0006), but they improved the sensitivity and negative predictive value of baseline screening only slightly when combined with cervical cytologic examination. Incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia occurred frequently (20%) during 1 year of follow-up and was more common among human papillomavirus-infected women. Repeated cytologic examination identified 60% of women with new cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.Human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with at least mild immunosuppression have a high incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, which warrants close follow-up. Those with high baseline human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid levels may be at the highest risk for incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
