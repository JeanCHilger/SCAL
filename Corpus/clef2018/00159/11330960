CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 polymorphisms and the risk of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in a multiethnic population. In this investigation, we explored the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome P4501A1 (T3801C) and glutathione S-transferase classes mu and theta (GSTM1 and GSTT1) gene deletions promote the development of cervical dysplasia by moderating the activation and detoxification of polycyclic hydrocarbons and other compounds that influence oxidative stress and DNA adduct formation.A multiethnic, case-control study of 131 women with biopsy-confirmed cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and 180 controls with cytologically normal cervical (Pap) smears was conducted between 1992 and 1996 in Honolulu, Hawaii. We collected in-person interviews, a blood sample to extract genomic DNA, and an exfoliated cervical cell sample to determine the presence and type of human papillomavirus (HPV) using PCR dot-blot hybridization. Genotyping for the CYP1A1 MspI allelic variant and deletion of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene loci followed a PCR method.Women who were homozygous, but not heterozygous, for the CYP1A1 MspI variant allele were at significantly increased risk of cervical SIL (odds ratio (OR) = 3.4 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-10.7) compared to women who were homozygous for the wild-type allele. Subjects with the GSTM1 null genotype had a nonsignificant elevated risk of cervical SIL (OR = 1.6These findings, although based on a small number of subjects, suggest that the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism may be a susceptibility factor for early, premalignant changes in the cervical epithelium.
