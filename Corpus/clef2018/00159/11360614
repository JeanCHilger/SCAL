Relationship between histopathologic observation of cervical condyloma and human papillomavirus infection. To study the relationship between histopathologic changes of cervical condyloma and different subtypes human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.158 women with abnormal Pap smears diagnosed by computer assisted cytologic technique (CCT) including 71 cases with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 65 cases with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 17 cases with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 5 cases with squamous cancers, underwent directed biopsies under colposcopy and were simultaneously detected for HPV6/11, HPV16/18 DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Koilocytotisis in 73 cases with pathologically proven cervical condyloma were grouped into type I and II according to its atypical degree of nuclei.HPV16/18 infection rate among condylomas cases was 86.0%, which was significantly higher than that of type I (16.7%) (P < 0.01). In LSIL with type II koilocytotisis, HPV16/18 infection rate and abnormal mitotic figures (AMFs) occurrence were 85.7%, significantly higher than those in type I koilocytotisis or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I.Type II koilocytotisis was correlated with HPV16/18 infection. LSIL with type II koilocytotisises, distinct atypical nuclei, also associated with high HPV16/18 rate and AMFs, therefore treatment and follow-up should be more aggressive.
