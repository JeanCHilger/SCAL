Histologic and immunophenotypic classification of cervical carcinomas by expression of the p53 homologue p63: a study of 250 cases. Recent studies of the p53 homologue p63 indicate that this gene is preferentially expressed in basal and immature cervical squamous epithelium. This study correlated p63 expression with morphologic phenotype and human papillomavirus (HPV) type in a wide range of cervical neoplasms. Two hundred fifty cases of cervical carcinoma, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA n = 178), adenocarcinoma (ADCA
