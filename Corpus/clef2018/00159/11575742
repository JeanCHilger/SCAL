Hybrid capture as a means of detecting human papillomavirus DNA from liquid-based cytology specimens: a preliminary evaluation. The connection between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer is well documented, as is the benefit of an adjunctive, standardised objective test to complement cervical screening. Here, 197 liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens previously processed for cytological examination (75 negative, 108 borderline/mild dyskaryosis, and 14 moderate/severe dyskaryosis) are examined for the presence of HPV using a hybrid capture assay. Of the 197 specimens tested for HPV DNA, 97 (49.2%) were positive using the combined high/low-risk probe, and 59 (29.9%) were negative cytologically and with the hybrid capture HPV test however, 16/175 (21.3%) specimens classified as negative cytologically with LBC proved positive for HPV by hybrid capture. Of the 122 samples that showed abnormal cytology, 81 (66.4%) were positive for HPV. Although the number of samples tested is small, the results show that the use of LBC technology for both cervical cytological screening and the hybrid capture test has the potential to reduce both false-negative and -positive rates associated with cytological screening alone.
