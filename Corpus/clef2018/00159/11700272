Serum carotenoids and risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in Southwestern American Indian women. The objective of this research was to evaluate the association between serum carotenoids and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) among Southwestern American Indian women. Cases were American Indian women with biopsy-proven CIN II/III cervical lesions (n = 81) diagnosed between November 1994 and October 1997. Controls were American Indian women from the same clinics with normal cervical epithelium (n = 160). All of the subjects underwent interviews and laboratory evaluations. Interviews evaluated demographic information, sexual history, and cigarette smoking. Serum concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Cervical human papillomavirus infection was detected using a PCR-based test. Increasing levels of alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lutein/zeaxanthin were associated with decreasing risk of CIN II/III. In addition, the highest tertiles of beta-cryptoxanthin (odds ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.17-0.91) and lutein/zeaxanthin (odds ratio = 0.40, 95% confidence interval = 0.17-0.95) were associated with the lowest risk of CIN. In conclusion, specially targeted intervention efforts to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables may protect Southwestern American Indian women from developing CIN.
