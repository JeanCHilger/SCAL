Determinants of cervical human papillomavirus infection: differences between high- and low-oncogenic risk types. This cross-sectional survey assessed the determinants of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections among 2080 women who participated in cervical cancer screening. HPVs were typed by restriction and sequencing analyses. The prevalence of HPV was 7.3% (4.2% for high-risk, 1.9% for low-risk, and 2.1% for unknown-risk types). High-risk HPV prevalence decreased with age, whereas low- and unknown-risk HPVs had a second peak in older women. Young age was the only common variable associated with the 3 groups of HPV infections. Lifetime number of sex partners was associated with high- and low-risk types but not with unknown-risk HPVs. Previous Pap smear, treatment for cervical lesions, induced abortion, smoking and having smoker(s) in the family were risk factors for high-risk HPVs. Barrier contraception was protective for low-risk HPVs current vaginal discharge had a negative association with unknown-risk HPVs. The results indicate that different risk profiles exist for infections with different HPV groups.
