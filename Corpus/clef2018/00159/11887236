Genital human papillomavirus infection identification by molecular biology among asymptomatic women. To evaluate whether epidemiological factors may be associated to genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.A cross-sectional study was carried out among 975 women seen at a public health service for cervical cancer screening in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Women were considered infected if tested positive to HPV either by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Hybrid Capture II (HC-II) methods. Women with genital HPV infection were compared to women without infection drawn from the same population.The study enrolled 975 women. The HPV prevalence (both methods combined) in this population was 27%. However, when each diagnostic method is analyzed separately, HPV prevalence was 15% and 16% for HC-II and PCR, respectively. Unconditional multiple logistic regression was used to correlate disease status to women characteristics. A positive association was found with HPV infection for the following variables: years of schooling (11 years: OR=2.05 95%CI =1.31Various factors may contribute to genital HPV infection, especially those related to sexual behavior (young age at first intercourse, high number of lifetime sexual partners, and marital status), and those related to social and economic status (years of schooling).
