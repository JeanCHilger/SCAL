p53 codon 72 polymorphism and its association with bladder cancer. p53 codon 72 Arg homozygosity has been associated with increased risk of developing cervical cancer. This association has been tested in various human cancers with controversial results. In the present study we investigated the impact of this polymorphism in a population-based case-control study of bladder cancer. Using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction to detect the p53 codon 72 polymorphism, we tested peripheral blood samples from 50 patients with bladder cancer and 99 healthy individuals of similar age and from the same geographical region. Tumor specimens from all bladder cancer patients were examined for the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV). The distribution of p53 alleles in bladder cancer patients and in controls was statistically significant (P<0.002 odds ratio, 2.67
