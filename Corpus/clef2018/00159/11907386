Human papillomavirus absence predicts normal cervical histopathologic findings with abnormal papanicolaou smears: a study of a university-based inner city population. We studied the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) typing in predicting cervical dysplasia in women with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test results.A university colposcopy clinic-based consecutive sample of 179 women completed a questionnaire and underwent colposcopy, HPV typing (Hybrid Capture System HPV DNA Assay II Digene Diagnostics, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and biopsy (if indicated).No severe dysplasia was observed in women with low-risk HPV or in women with negative HPV test results who had a low-grade abnormality on the Pap test. High-risk (HR) HPV was present in every case of severe dysplasia on biopsy. The cumulative odds risk for cervical dysplasia was 1.11 in HIV(+) women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on the Pap test who were older than 21 years of age and HPV-HR(+).In the population studied, HPV typing is a valuable adjunct to a low-grade abnormality on the Pap test in predicting the absence of cervical dysplasia on biopsy. Larger prospective population-based studies are needed to study the role of HPV as a negative predictor of disease in cervical dysplasia.
