Analysis of risk factors for cervical cancer in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province. To investigate the risk factors for cervical cancer in the areas of high incidence, and provide evidence for current intervention of cervical cancer.In the areas of Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Provicne with high incidence of cervical cancer, 1 997 women were interviewed using a questionnaire, including baseline information, menstrual, marital and pregnancy histories, sexual behavior, health habits, contraception, medical history and family history of cancer, etc., after its screening with six kinds of methods. All subjects, including 84 cases with pathological diagnosis of greater than cINI, and 1 784 cases with pathological diagnosis of normal, were tested for high-risk HPV.The overall rates of HPV infection were 20.8% (415/1 997) in high-risk subjects, 97.7% and 14.2% in the cases and control groups, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that risk factors with statistical significance included high-risk HPV infection, age at first sexual intercourse, history of pregnancy and abortion, the number of sexual partners and family history of cancer. Analysis with non-conditional logistic regression model revealed high-risk HPV infection, multiple sexual partners and family history of cancer associated obviously with occurrence of cervical cancer. In addition, there was significantly positive relationship between HPV infection, which increased with the number of sexual partners, and extramarital sexual activity both in males or females.The main risk factor for cervical cancer in this region was high-risk HPV infection, which related to sexual behavior, hygienic habits during menstruation and puerperium. It was particularly important to detect and treat precancerous lesions and to implement behavior modification. In addition, further research on genetic susceptibility was suggested.
