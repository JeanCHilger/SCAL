HLA-DQBl alleles and susceptibility to cervical squamous cell carcinoma in Southern Iranian patients. The association of HLA class II with various autoimmune diseases has been extensively investigated. Despite the importance and functions of HLA genes in the evolution of cancer, the allele specific association of HLA molecules in cancer patients has not been well investigated. In this study the HLA-class II alleles frequency was investigated in Iranian patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. HLA typing was carried out by PCR amplification using sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 typing was performed for 23 patients. The allele frequencies were calculated and compared with 36 healthy Iranian female controls. A positive association was observed between the existence of HLA-DQB1* 0601 and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (p<0.04, RR=1.94). Moreover, analysis of HLA-DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 haplotypes indicated that none of the putative haplotypes were significantly associated with either patient or control group. Positive association of cervical carcinoma with a single allele of HLA-DQ provides evidence on the importance of HLA class II molecules and the immune response in squamous cell carcinoma of cervix.
