Susceptibility locus for epidermodysplasia verruciformis not linked to cervical cancer in situ. Cervical cancer is strongly associated with infection by oncogenic forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), mainly HPV 16 and HPV 18. The aim of this study was to test if a locus previously mapped to a region on chromosome 17 qter in patients with epidermodysplasia verucciformis (EV) and psoriasis and considered to be responsible for an increased susceptibility to HPV 5, also is linked to increased HPV susceptibility in cervical cancer in situ. We also wanted to test whether HPV 16 positivity cluster in families with cervical cancer. DNA was extracted from formalin fixed biopsies of 224 affected from 77 families diagnosed with cervical cancer in situ. Two microsatellite markers (D17S939 and D17S802) containing the locus were genotyped and linkage analysis was performed. No linkage was found to any of the two markers, neither when considering all cancer cases as affected nor when only considering HPV 16 infected cancer cases as affected in the analysis. We conclude that the susceptibility locus for HPV 5 infections associated with EV and psoriasis does not seem to affect susceptibility to HPV 16, frequently detected in cervical cancer. Also, positivity for HPV 16 did not show a significant clustering in families.
