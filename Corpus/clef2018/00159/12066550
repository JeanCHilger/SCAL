Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and its relationship with central intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). HPV (Human papillomavirus) infection is strongly associated and is the main cause of cervical cancer. The main target for HPV viruses is the cervical transformation zone. In our work infection with HPV 18 and HPV 16 as also other types of viruses were investigated in 15 patients by taking biopsies. Before hand the patients were signalized by cytology as well as all of them were colposcopically examined. The samples were examined immunohistochemically in the laboratory at the Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment in Oncology. Nine out of 15 patients /60%/ were found positive for HPV-16, five /33%/ were found positive for HPV-18 and 1 /6.6%/ were infected with both HPV types. Our method is very sensitive and practical for determining at very high risk of developing HPV connected cervical cancer.
