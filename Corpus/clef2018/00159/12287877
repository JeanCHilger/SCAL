Cervical cancer control in Korea: colposcopy / cervicograph / cytology. Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women of South Korea.  The annual incidence rate of cervical cancer is 24.2/100,000 population.  Possible risk factors of cervical cancer among South Korean women are low educational level, marriage at early age, high parity, coital frequency, and number of partners.  A method for screening the mass population for cervical cancer should be simple, accurate, and cost effective.  Cytologic screening methods yield high false negative rates, while colposcopy and cervicography yield high positive rates.  The accuracy rates of colposcopy in South Korea are 92.8% for cervicitis, 89.3% for cervical dysplasia, 90.9% for CIS, and 91.5% for invasive carcinoma.  Special training and an expensive device are needed for colposcopic examination.  Catholic University Medical College (CUMC) gynecologists have developed a Korean type of cervicography for mass screening.  It consists of a 100 mm macroles, 35 mm camera body, 50 mm extension ring, and a ring strobe light.  It has high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.  A study to compare the effectiveness of the three screening methods showed that cervicography is best for mass screening.  CUMC gynecologists recommend: biannual screening tests for women at high risk of developing cervical cancer first cervical screening at age 18 years
