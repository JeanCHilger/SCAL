Human papilloma virus infection in vaginal condyloma acuminatum. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus(HPV) infection in vaginal papillomatous lesions diagnosed in Tsuji Ladies Clinic. From January, 2000 to February, 2001, 52 patients were diagnosed with condyloma acuminata in the Clinic. All the patients received a complete gynecologic examination including colposcopic evaluation, and HPV DNA was assayed for in cervicovaginal lavages using polymerase chain reaction. HPV was detected in 31 of the 52 (60%) patients, and high risk HPV was found in 23 patients(45%). The incidence of high risk HPV infection is very high in vaginal condyloma acuminata. Detection of high risk HPV-positive women suggests that they may also be at risk for developing carcinoma. Therefore, it is very important to follow-up patients with condyloma acuminata.
