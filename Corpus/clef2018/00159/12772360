Human papillomavirus: beware the infection you can't see. Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection. In the first 10 years of sexual activity, point prevalence rates approach 25% and the lifetime risk of acquisition of this infection may be as high as 80%. There are over 200 types of HPV, of which approximately 50 infect the genital area.This article aims to discuss HPV detection and its role in cervical cancer development.The HPV types that cause genital warts do not cause cervical cancer. The subclinical types (especially types 16 and 18) are most frequently found in high grade epithelial abnormalities and therefore can potentially cause anogenital cancers. Human papillomavirus is a 'necessary but not sufficient cause for cervical cancer'. Most genital HPV infection is transient. Cervical cancer is actually a rare outcome of HPV infection. However, only 5% of women in developing countries have had a Pap smear in the past five years, and worldwide approximately 250 thousand women die of this disease every year. The role of HPV DNA testing has not yet been defined, but is no doubt a potential tool for the future. Meanwhile, international vaccine trials using HPV virus-like particles are taking place, and look promising.
