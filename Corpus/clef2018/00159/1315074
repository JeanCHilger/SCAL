Human papillomavirus, cervical intraepithelial cancer and immunosuppression. Two cases in renal transplant recipients. Immunosuppression is therapeutically induced in an increasing number of patients, exceeding largely the only transplant recipients. Its carcinological complications are a major preoccupation, among which the uterine cervix intraepithelial neoplasia. The strong relationship between these genital neoplasia and the lesions caused by human Papillomavirus is now evident and has to be taken in consideration for an early and regular follow-up of these women. Cervical smear tests, colposcopic assessment and histological examinations allow to undertake the adequate treatment and to give some preventive advice.
