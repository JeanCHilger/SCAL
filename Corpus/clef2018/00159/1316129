Detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) using dot blot and Southern blot, hybridizing with a mixture of seven probes. A previously presented method for the detection and typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA has been modified for the simultaneous analysis of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35. The method has two steps, where a dot blot test is used to exclude cases that do not hybridize with HPV-DNA. The remaining cases are then analysed by a Southern blot procedure, using a mixture of subgenomic probes for the simple and accurate analysis of HPV types. When the procedure was used for the analysis of clinical samples, patient groups at varying risk were found to differ with regard to the prevalence of HPV infections. Thus, the virus was detected in only 8.8% of otherwise healthy young women - i.e. women without clinical signs of HPV-related disease - as compared to 48% of women who also had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). A similarly high prevalence was found in patients in whom CIN persisted (42%) as compared to those in whom the morphological lesion regressed to normal (8%).
