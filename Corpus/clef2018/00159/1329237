Human papillomavirus DNA detection in primary anogenital warts and cervical low-grade intraepithelial neoplasias in adults by in situ hybridization. In this study, 58 consecutive patients with primary anogenital warts were selected from patients attending a genitourinary clinic. Patients were grouped on the basis of clinical lesion site, i.e. patients with genital warts only, patients with perianal or anal canal warts only, and patients with concurrent perianal and genital warts. Of these patients, 38% of the men (12/31) and 33.3% of the women (9/27) had other anogenital infections, such as nonspecific urethritis (NSU) or nonspecific genital infection, which were the most common. Of the patients who had perianal warts, 37% of the men (7/19) and 25% of the women (4/16) also had warts in the anal canal. Of the women who had anogenital warts, 63% (17/27) had concurrent subclinical low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA (either 6 or 11, 16 or 18, or 31 or 33 or 35) was detected in 53.3% (40/75) of the anogenital wart biopsy samples, and in 35.2% (6/17) of the low-grade CIN lesions. HPV types 6 or 11 were the most common types in anogenital warts (45.3%) and in CIN lesions HPV types 6 or 11 and 16 or 18 were found with equal frequency (17.6% each). There were no significant differences in HPV types between patients with genital warts and patients with perianal and anal canal warts. Anogenital infection with HPV is multicentric
