Natural history and epidemiological features of genital HPV infection. The spectrum of genital HPV infections comprises clinical, subclinical, and latent disease in addition to HPV-associated neoplasia. The definition of subclinical and latent HPV infection is still incomplete and awaits clarification by highly sensitive HPV detection systems that preserve the morphology of the tissue. Genital HPVs infect the human body mainly by sexual transmission, but other pathways of HPV transmission may be possible as suggested by (a) high prevalences of antibody reactivity in children (b) lack of association of HPV seropositivity with sexual activity
