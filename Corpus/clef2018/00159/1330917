Detection of human papillomavirus in cervical scrapes by the polymerase chain reaction in relation to cytology: possible implications for cervical cancer screening. An HPV screening strategy based on general primer-mediated and type-specific PCR is described. A relationship was found between an increasing HPV prevalence rate and a higher degree of cervical dysplasia (up to 100% in cervical carcinoma). Based on these prevalence studies in the Netherlands and preliminary data showing that progression of cervical lesions is always associated with persistent infection of oncogenic/high-risk HPV types, a cervical cancer screening scheme incorporating PCR-based HPV detection is proposed for use in industrialized countries.
