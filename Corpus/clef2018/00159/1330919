HPV types in women with normal cervical cytology. PCR-based hybridization methods have been used to show that some women with normal cytology are carriers of HPV DNA of the types strongly related to cervical cancer. How these women should be managed remains unclear. This chapter selectively reviews reports which have estimated type-specific HPV prevalence in relation to the presence or absence of morphological signs of HPV infection. Overall, these reports indicate that among women who were identified as carriers of HPV DNA (by PCR-based methods) and who also had a normal cytological smear, the HPV type detected in the majority of instances was a high-risk viral type for cervical cancer (HPV types 16/18 = 44.7% HPV types 31/33/35 = 8.1%
