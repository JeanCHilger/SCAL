Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Epidemiological and clinical study of 45 cases. We observed 45 cases of Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN) histologically diagnosed which came to our observation between 1986 and 1991. The average age of the patients and the grade of the VIN lesions were evaluated. We also examined the eventual association with Papillomavirus infection, with non-neoplastic epithelial disorders in the adjacent areas and with intraepithelial neoplasias of the cervix and/or the vagina (CIN and/or VAIN). These data were studied in relation to the vulvoscopic pictures and symptomatology presented by the patients at the moment of diagnosis.
