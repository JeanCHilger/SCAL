Predictive value of human papillomavirus DNA detection by filter hybridization and polymerase chain reaction in women with negative results of colposcopic examination. This study focused on women who had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear and a subsequent colposcopic examination negative for a cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion. Cervical swabs obtained during the initial colposcopic examination were analyzed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, and these results were correlated with the follow-up examinations. Human papillomavirus DNA was detected by dot-blot hybridization in 31 of 109 (28%) cases. The rate of subsequent biopsy-proved squamous intraepithelial lesion was 17 of 31 (55%) for the HPV-positive group compared with 9 of 78 (11%) for the HPV-negative group. The HPV-DNA detection rate by polymerase chain reaction was 46 of 109 (42%), with a rate of subsequent squamous intraepithelial lesion of 18 of 46 (39%) for the HPV-positive group, compared with 8 of 63 (13%) for the HPV-negative group. Most women had no evidence of squamous intraepithelial lesions on follow-up if the concurrent Papanicolaou smear was normal, even when HPV DNA was detected, suggesting that HPV detection per se does not necessarily correlate with subsequent squamous intraepithelial lesion.
