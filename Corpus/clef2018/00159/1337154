The role of colposcopy in the diagnosis of HPV infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implicated as an important etiologic factor in cervical carcinoma. This study evaluates the efficacy of colposcopy in the detection of cervical lesions with koilocytosis features. Colposcopy, cervical smears and biopsy specimens from 217 women seen in our department between January-December 1991 were examined. The colposcopy examination detected 77.5% of the viral presence the histological diagnosis detected 85% of HPV, but the cytologic smears showed only 52% of infection. The data suggests that colposcopy is a good examination to evidence koilocytosis infection.
