Replication of an adenoviral vector controlled by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter causes tumor-selective tumor lysis. Telomerase reactivation is a critical step for tumorigenesis, allowing cancer cells to proliferate indefinitely. Taking advantage of this property, we generated an adenovirus vector in which E1 gene expression, and therefore viral replication, is under control of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. This vector, referred to as Ad5-hTERT-E1, replicated in cancer cells and demonstrated efficient cancer-selective cytolysis in a variety of tumor cell lines, including HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma cells) HeLa (cervical carcinoma cells)
