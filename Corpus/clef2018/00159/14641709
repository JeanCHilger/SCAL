Preventable but not prevented: the reality of cervical cancer. The incidence of invasive cervical cancer has decreased in the last 50 years in the developed countries substantially due to the use of routine pap smears. However, in the Asia-Oceanic region it continues to be high as screening programs are not established. Credit for starting cytology services in India goes to Professor P.N. Wahi of Agra. He became Founder President when about 34 cytologists got together in 1970 to form the Indian Academy of Cytologists. Since then cytology has spread through all parts of India. The Cytology Clinic in Cama & Albless Hospital was started in the same year. Since then over 100000 women have been screened. Approximately 1200 cases of pre- and early cancers have been detected and treated. Since 1982 we are aware of the important role of human papillomavirus infection. We diagnose it by cytology and colposcopy and histology. Facilities for polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization and other virology studies are not available to us. CO2 laser treatment is found particularly useful in multicentric human papillomavirus disease.Since 1984 we have planned for a screening program for our State. We have a population of 78.9 million. Approximately 15 million women in the age group of 35-64 years have to be screened. The health care infrastructure is good with 36 medical colleges and over 35 district hospitals. Screening is planned in phases. Trained personnel are the key to a successful program. In the final analysis, cervical cancer is not just a biomedical disease. It has socio-cultural and economic implications.
