A case-control study of endogenous hormones and cervical cancer. Both parity and oral contraceptive use are associated with elevated circulating levels of sex hormones, at least transiently, and with increased risk of cervical cancer in human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected women. We directly evaluated whether elevations in the physiologic levels of these hormones predispose to the development of cervical neoplasia. We identified 67 premenopausal and 43 postmenopausal women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, 3, or cervical cancer (>/=CIN2) diagnosed during enrollment of a population-based cohort of 10 077 women. Four controls, two chosen randomly and two chosen from women testing positive for cancer-associated HPV, were matched to each case on menopausal status, age, days since last menses (pre), or years since menopause (post). Sex hormone-binding globulin, oestradiol, oestrone, oestrone-sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, and progesterone were measured in enrollment plasma. There was no consistent association between the sex hormones and risk of >/=CIN2. Excluding cases with invasive disease had a minimal impact on results. Though this case-control study was based on a well-defined population, it was limited by reliance on a single measure of hormone levels taken at the time of diagnosis. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis that plasma levels of sex hormones have an important bearing on the risk of cervical neoplasia in HPV-infected women.
