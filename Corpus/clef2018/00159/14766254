Psychosocial factors and the grade of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia: a semi-prospective study. To study the influence of psychosocial factors on the grade of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.The influence of psychosocial factors on the grade of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) was studied in a group of 342 patients with an abnormal cervical smear. Participants completed a set of questionnaires after colposcopy directed biopsy before knowing the biopsy result. Negatively rated life events, social support, and coping style were studied in relation to distress and grade of CIN. Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) types was controlled for, as well as sick role bias caused by suspicion of having cervical cancer and distress due to the abnormal cervical smear.Negatively rated life events, lack of social support, and emotional coping were significant predictors for level of distress. No significant relationship was found, however, between the psychosocial factors and grade of CIN.No support was found for an influence of negatively rated life events, social support, coping style, and distress on grade of CIN.
