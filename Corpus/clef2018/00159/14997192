Management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix. Strategies of management for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) vary even on a national level. We evaluated the diversity of management algorithms. This should serve as a source to find a common basis for the management of low-grade SIL. A total of 38 representatives and specialists for colposcopy and cervical pathology were contacted to provide national guidelines, recommendations or consensus for the management of patients diagnosed with the cytologic diagnosis of low-grade SIL. In all, 23 addressees (60%) responded. The algorithms provided varied considerably. Three variants of algorithms could be defined. Variant 1 was proposed in 14 countries and recommended colposcopy immediately after cytologic diagnosis of low-grade SIL or at the same time the smear is taken. If available, HPV testing was recommended as a triage option in some countries. Variant 2 is used in three countries and colposcopy is only performed after a repeated abnormal cytologic result within a 6-month interval or after an optional test positive for high-risk HPV. Variant 3, as proposed in six countries, takes into account the socio-economic status of the patient: In patients with poor compliance, 'see and treat' management is recommended in patients where compliance can be assured, follow-up is carried out by cytology and colposcopy. Global policy of management of patients with low-grade SIL can be summarised in three algorithms. Quality standards and outcome parameters must be defined in order to improve the management of women with low-grade SIL.
