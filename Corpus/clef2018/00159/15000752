Human papillomavirus genotyping by the DNA chip in the cervical neoplasia. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated as an etiologic agent in neoplasitc lesions of the cervix. In this study, we used an HPV DNA chip to detect the type-specific sequence of HPV from cervical swabs in women with biopsy- proven neoplastic lesions of the cervix. Four hundred seventy-one patients were involved and classified into four groups based on the cytopathologic diagnosis: group I (normal, n = 290), group II (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), n = 68), group III (high-grade SIL, n = 51), and group IV (invasive cervical cancer, n = 55). HPV detection rates were 17.6% (51 of 290), 73.5% (50 of 68), 92.2% (47 of 51), and 95.2% (59 of 62) in patients of group I to group IV, respectively. HPV-16 was the most frequent type (21.8%) in all specimens tested, and significantly increased the prevalence by advancing the grade of the cervical lesions (P < 0.01). The next frequent virus types were HPV-18 and HPV-58. The prevalence of multiple HPV infections was 37.3, 43.7, 27.7, and 28.8%, and no significant difference was detected between each group (P > 0.05). This suggests that the HPV DNA chip is a sensitive diagnostic tool for the detection of HPV in cervical specimens, and that it would provide more useful information on viral genotype and multiple HPV infections. Taken together, molecular biological data on HPV might be beneficial for the prevention and management of cervical neoplastic lesions.
