Detection of antibodies against a human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 peptide that differentiate high-risk from low-risk HPV-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. A nonapeptide (16L1) was derived from the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) major capsid protein and tested for detection of potential cross-reactive serum IgG and cervical IgA antibodies in low- and high-risk HPV-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and cervical cancer patients by ELISA. The IgG response was similar in women with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and controls (P=0.1). In contrast, more than 90 % of patients with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL were seropositive. Although tumours from cancer patients were all positive for the presence of high-risk HPV DNA, the level of seropositivity decreased significantly in this group (P<0.0001). Cervical IgA antibodies were also detected in a significantly high proportion of women with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL compared with controls. However, the proportion of IgA-positive patients was lower than the proportion of IgG seropositives. In conclusion, the 16L1 peptide appears to be a high-risk type-common epitope that induces cross-reactive antibodies in high-risk, but not low-risk, HPV-associated LSIL patients, allowing differentiation of high- and low-risk infected women at this stage of infection.
