Diagnostic tests for HPV infection. Human papillomavirus is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. HPV-associated neoplasms, such as cervical cancer, are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent advances in molecular biology have facilitated testing methods for HPV infection. Of the various methods, the only test cleared by the FDA for HPV testing of the cervix is the hybrid capture second-generation assay that uses RNA probes specific for the identification of certain high-risk or low-risk HPV types. Currently, the principal cervical-cancer screening modality is the Pap test, but given its higher sensitivity, HPV testing is being incorporated into algorithms for cervical-cancer screening. The development of HPV therapeutic and prophylactic immunization may expand the need for systematic HPV testing to help define eligible subgroups for intervention.
