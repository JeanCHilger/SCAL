Activation of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is related to grade of the lesion but not to high-risk human papillomavirus, virus clearance, or prognosis in cervical cancer. We subjected 302 archival samples (150 squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs] and 152 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] lesions) to immunohistochemical staining with extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1) antibody and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing with 3 primer sets. Follow-up data were available for all SCC cases and 67 CIN cases. High-risk (HR) HPV types were associated with CIN (odds ratio [OR], 19.12 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.31-157.81) and SCC (OR, 27.25
