High-risk HPV detection by Hybrid Capture and ploidy determination by a computer-assisted system in cervical biopsies. To correlate high-risk HPV (hrHPV) detection by Hybrid Capture II (HC2) (Digene, Gaithersburg, Maryland, U.S.A.) with DNA content (ploidy) of cervical biopsies analyzed by a computer-assisted system.Cervical biopsies from 54 women examined at Leonor Mendes de Barros Hospital, SÃ£o Paulo, as part of the Latin American Screening study during 2002--2003, were tested for hrHPV with HC2. All patients had been referred for colposcopic examination due to an abnormal cervical cytology. The final diagnosis included 30 cervicitis, 14 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 5 CIN 2, 4 CIN 3 and 1 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Five-micrometer sections of each biopsy were stained with Feulgen-tionine and evaluated with the CAS 200 System (Becton Dickinson, U.S.A.), using the 3.0 software (version 8.1) of the DNA Quantitative Measurement Program (Becton Dickinson). Ploidy was evaluated from histograms obtained by analyzing atypical nuclei.Of the 30 cervicitis cases, 28 (93.3%) were diploid, and hrHPV was detected in 8 (28.5%) of the cases. Two tetraploid cervicitis lesions were observed, 1 positive and 1 negative for hrHPV. Among the CIN 1 lesions, 8 (57.1%) were diploid and 6 (42.8%) aneuploid. Of the latter, 4 (66.6%) were negative and 2 (33.3%) positive for hrHPV. Of the 5 CIN 2 lesions, 2 were diploid, 2 aneuploid and 1 tetraploid all were positive for hrHPV. All CIN 3 lesions and the SCC proved to be aneuploid and positive for hrHPV.The data suggest that the majority of cervicitis and CIN 1 lesions are diploid and negativef or hrHPV. This is in sharp contrast to high grade CIN 2-3 lesions, all of which were positive for hrHPV in this study and also aneuploid, consistent with their progressive potential.
