Down-regulation of p21 contributes to apoptosis induced by HPV E6 in human mammary epithelial cells. Infection with human papillomaviruses (HPV) is strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer. The HPV E6 gene is essential for the oncogenic potential of HPV. E6 induces cell proliferation and apoptosis in cervical cancer precursor lesions and in cultured cells. Although induction of telomerase and inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 play important roles for E6 to promote cell growth, the molecular basis of E6-induced apoptosis is poorly understood. While it is expected that inactivation of p53 by E6 should lead to a reduction in cellular apoptosis, numerous studies demonstrated that E6 could in fact sensitize cells to apoptosis. Understanding the mechanism of p53-independent apoptosis is of clinical significance. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of apoptosis during E6-mediated immortalization of primary human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC). E6 by itself is sufficient to immortalize HMECs and is believed to do so at least in part by activation of telomerase. During the process of E6-mediated HMEC immortalization, an increased apoptosis was observed. Mutational analysis demonstrated that E6-induced apoptosis was distinct from its ability to promote cell proliferation, activate telomerase, or degrade p53. While the known pro-apoptotic E6 target proteins such as Bak or c-Myc did not appear to play an important role, down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) (p21) by E6 correlated with its ability to induce apoptosis. Ectopic expression of p21 inhibited E6-induced apoptosis. Moreover, a p53 degradation defective E6 mutant was competent for p21 down-regulation and apoptosis induction. The anti-apoptotic function of p21 may not simply be the result of p21-induced growth arrest. These studies demonstrate an E6 activity to down-regulate p21 that is important for induction of apoptosis.
