Condyloms, dysplasia and carcinomas of cervix: a twenty years experience (1980 - 1999). After twenty years of semi-regular detection(1980-1990) concerning 100,358 cervical smears carried out in the Cytology Laboratory in the CHU of Dakar, we have determined the types of cervical lesions in our study. We've found 21.03% of precancerous and cancerous lesions with 17.56% of CIN1, 2.49% of CIN2 and 0.49% of CIN3 and carcinomas. We've observed 9.07% of normal smears, 69.89% of benign cellular modifications, 17.56% of low grade lesions of Bethesda and 3.47% of high grade lesions of Bethesda. These very high figures show that on the one hand precancerous cervical lesions represent a serious public health concern in Senegal, on the other hand regular detection has become an urgent need in Dakar and in the other regions of Senegal where it's not carried out at all at the present time.
