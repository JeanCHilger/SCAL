Age-related performance of human papillomavirus testing used as an adjunct to cytology for cervical carcinoma screening in a population with a low incidence of cervical carcinoma. High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing has been proposed as a replacement for cytology or as an adjunct to cytology for primary cervical carcinoma screening. The objective of this study was to assess the age-specific prevalence of HR-HPV infection and the correlation between HR-HPV status and cytologic diagnosis.The authors enrolled 7254 women receiving routine cytologic screening in a cross-sectional study that was conducted during 12 months. Cervical samples were collected using liquid-based cytology to perform both Papanicolaou smears and HR-HPV testing. Analyses were performed using age stratification, and the cytologic results were considered as the reference diagnosis for parameter analysis tests.The overall rate of HR-HPV infection was 11.4% (95% confidence interval, 9-12%) and was higher in younger women compared with older women (age < 30 years vs. > or = 30 years 16% vs. 8.5%, respectivelyThe prevalence of HR-HPV was age-dependent, with the strongest correlation between HR-HPV positivity and disease observed among older women, who potentially may derive the most benefit.
