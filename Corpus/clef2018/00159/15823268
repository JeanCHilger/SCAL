Preventing cervical cancer in low-resource settings: how far have we come and what does the future hold? The Alliance for Cervical Cancer Prevention (ACCP) came together in 1999 to answer key research questions and to advocate for greater global and national interest in reducing the heavy burden of morbidity and mortality caused by this preventable disease. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI), and human papillomavirus (HPV) tests have been shown to be viable alternatives to traditional cytology. ACCP experience confirmed that cryotherapy is a safe and effective method that is acceptable to women and can be delivered by a range of health providers, including nonphysicians. Programs can maximize coverage by accommodating local needs and involving community leaders and women in planning and implementation. Advocacy efforts have led to significant policy changes and galvanized support for cervical cancer prevention. Despite the prospect of new HPV vaccines, screening will be needed for at least the next 30-40 years. Our experience has shown that with creativity, flexibility, and well-focused use of resources, the inequitable burden of cervical cancer borne by women in poor countries can be sharply reduced.
