Human papillomavirus detection by hybrid capture II and residual or recurrent high-grade squamous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). The purpose of this study was to assess the association between highly-oncogenic types HPV DNA detection by Hybrid Capture II (HCII) and residual or recurrent high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 or 3) during the follow-up of women submitted to large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).In this cohort study, 94 women submitted to LLETZ because of CIN 2 or 3 between March 2001 and September 2002 were followed up twice yearly until September 2003. Follow-up visits consisted of an interview regarding clinical, social and demographic characteristics complemented with gynecological examination with specimen collection for Pap test and HCII and colposcopy. Eighty-one patients attended the first visit (mean 4.8 months, range 3-6) and 75 the second visit (mean 10.9 months, range 7-17 months). McNemar's test to assess the variation of HPV DNA detection following LLETZ, odds ratios (OR) to evaluate the correlation between HPV DNA positivity and residual/recurrent CIN during follow-up, and logistic regression to assess the risk of residual/recurrent CIN were used.There was a strong and significant reduction in HPV detection after LLETZ (P < 0.001). HPV DNA detection was correlated with residual/recurrent CIN at the first (OR = 103.4 95% CI 5.5 to 1961.2) and second (OR = 12.7High risk HPV DNA detection decreased substantially after CIN treatment with LLETZ, but HPV persistence was strongly correlated with residual/recurrent CIN.
