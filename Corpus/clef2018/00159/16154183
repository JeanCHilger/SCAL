Cervical chromosome 9 polysomy: validation and use as a surrogate endpoint biomarker in a 4-HPR chemoprevention trial. Several genetic alterations have been described in cervical cancers including: human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins, subtle sequence changes, alterations in chromosome number, chromosome translocations, and gene amplifications. This report focuses on establishing chromosome 9 polysomy as a cervical biomarker of chromosome instability and using it in a chemoprevention trial. Chromosomal instability is a feature of most human cancers and is probably an early event in the process.We used 37 cervical cone specimens to validate chromosome 9 polysomy as a biomarker and then tested its modulation in a randomized clinical trial of 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR) in 39 patients with three blinded histopathologic reviews. No confounders were identified. In the present study, immunohistocytochemical analysis of Chromosome 9 polysomy was carried out and quantitatively measured.The Cell Index, the ratio of the number of total chromosome 9 copies to the total number of ells, increases significantly in archival samples as the cervix changes from normal to CIN to invasive cancer. In the chemoprevention trial, chromosome 9 polysomy was used as a biomarker and supported the histological analysis showing that 4-HPR impaired the natural regression response.Chromosome 9 polysomy appears to be a marker of genetic instability that can be used in chemoprevention trials as a surrogate endpoint biomarker. In this randomized trial of 4-HPR, the chromosome 9 polysomy measurements supported the clinical histopathologic reading in a quantitative manner suggesting that 4-HPR at 200 mg/day may have been inhibiting the regression seen in the placebo arm by inducing genetic instability.
