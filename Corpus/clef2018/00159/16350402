Establishing HPV-containing keratinocyte cell lines from tissue biopsies. The generation of cell strains and established cell lines from human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected cervical biopsies and ano-genital warts is best achieved by the application of conventional protocols for keratinocyte cell culture. The optimal protocol that permits growth at clonal density and serial cultivation involves the use of an inactivated 3T3 fibroblast feeder layer and medium supplemented with hydrocortisone and fetal bovine serum. Modifications in terms of additives and serum concentration are required for optimal culture of neoplastic and malignant HPV-containing keratinocytes.
