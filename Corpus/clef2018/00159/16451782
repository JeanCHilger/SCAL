What is the appropriate management for a patient with CIN1 on colposcopy? Of the different strategies available for managing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), testing for high-risk subtypes of the human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) DNA at 12 months has the highest sensitivity for predicting the development of CIN2 or CIN3 and leads to the lowest rate of referral to repeat colposcopy. If the hr-HPV DNA test result is negative at 12 months, then the patient may return to routine cytology screening. If the hr-HPV DNA test result is positive, the patient should undergo repeat colposcopy.
