Increased risk for cervical disease progression of French women infected with the human papillomavirus type 16 E6-350G variant. To test the significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and HPV16 E6 variants as risk factors for viral persistence and progression to high-grade lesion, we did a nested case-control study within a cohort study of >15,000 Caucasian French women. Three groups infected with high-risk HPV were compared: (a) women with cleared infection (controls, n = 201), (b) women with persistent infection (cases, n = 87), and (c) women who progressed into high-grade lesion (cases, n = 58). Women with persistent HPV infection and those that progressed into high-grade lesions were likelier to harbor HPV16 than other high-risk HPV types [odds ratio (OR), 2.4 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.3-4.3 and OR, 4.2
