Serological detection of anti HPV 16/18 and its association with pap smear in adolescents and young women. Verify the relation between HPV 16/18 antibodies and the association with cervical cytology findings in adolescents and young women.A cross sectional study with 541 healthy and sexually active women from 15 to 25 years of age was carried on from September to November 2000. At gynecological examination, a cervical sample on liquid-base for cytology-testing and a blood sample for ELISA identification of HPV 16 and 18 antibodies were collected and sent to a reference laboratory in Belgium. Statistical analysis estimated the prevalence and prevalence ratio with a 95% confidence interval.Of these young women, 150 (27.7%) were seropositive: 79 (14.6%) to HPV 16 antibody 35 (6.4%) to HPV 18 antibody and 36 (6.6%) to both HPV 16/18 antibodies. Cytological abnormalities were detected in 107 cases (20.5%): 63 presented with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 41 were suggestive of low grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (LGSIL) and 3 of high grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (HGSIL). Prevalence of abnormal cytology with a positive serology was only 1.75 times that of prevalence of abnormal cytology with a negative serology. Detection of abnormal cytology was not correlated with positive serology.Results of this study indicate a high prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 in young healthy women which showed no relation to the abnormal findings of cytology smears.
