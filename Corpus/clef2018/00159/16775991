Cervical cancer screening: current status and perspectives. Cervical cancer screening with Pap cytology has effectively reduced the incidence of morbidity and mortality from invasive cervical cancer. However, Pap cytology has important limitation and is not completely protective. Invasive cervical cancers are still diagnosed and main reasons are an insufficient coverage rate and presence of false-negative results. HPV testing has greater sensitivity than Pap cytology for detecting high-grade lesions and cancer and is clearly one of the most promising new screening tools. It has the potential to improve cervical cancer screening effectiveness. The aim of our study was to discuss the current situation of cervical cancer screening in Switzerland, limitations of Pap cytology as well as the benefice expected with HPV testing and vaccienes.
