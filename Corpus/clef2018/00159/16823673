Family physicians' knowledge of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related conditions, United States, 2004. Information about human papillomavirus (HPV) has evolved rapidly and HPV DNA tests are now available. Little is known about family physicians' knowledge about HPV and how it relates to HPV test use and counseling practices.In mid-2004, confidential surveys were mailed to a nationally representative sample of 760 family physicians. We assessed and analyzed relationships between knowledge about HPV, HPV test use, and counseling messages provided when collecting cervical cytology and managing anogenital warts.The adjusted response rate was 68% (n=368). Ninety-one percent provided cervical cancer screening, and 90% had managed genital warts. Responses indicated that more than 90% had up-to-date knowledge about several issues: HPV infection is common, persistent infection increases risk of cervical neoplasia, and treatment does not eliminate the causative infection. However, fewer than 50% were aware that HPV infections may clear spontaneously and that the HPV types associated with warts and cervical neoplasia differ. Only 57% had ever used HPV tests. Some HPV knowledge varied by clinician characteristics, and knowledge was associated with HPV test use but not counseling messages.Most physicians were aware of new information about HPV infection, but some were unaware of important information relevant for patient counseling. These topics have been highlighted in new clinical training and patient education materials.
