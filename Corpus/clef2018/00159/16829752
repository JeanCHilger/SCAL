Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, human papillomavirus, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 in adolescents: ASC-US, age, and high-grade cervical neoplasia. To determine rates of and factors associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 among women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.This is a retrospective review of 357 women with ASC-US and known high-risk HPV infection. To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to have subsequently undergone colposcopic-directed cervical biopsy and/or endocervical sampling. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios of CIN 2 or 3 by risk factors associated with HPV and CIN.Thirty-three of 215 (15%) women with ASC-US and oncogenic HPV who underwent histological sampling demonstrated CIN 2 or 3. In the adjusted model, only nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.8) retained a marginal association with the outcome. No significant age-related differences in the prevalence of high-grade disease emerged. The high-grade lesions seen in adolescents consisted of single, small lesions.In the light of these findings, and in conjunction with the high rate of oncogenic HPV infection among adolescents with ASC-US, both reflex HPV testing and immediate colposcopy do not appear to be of benefit in the initial management of teenagers with this cytological diagnosis.
