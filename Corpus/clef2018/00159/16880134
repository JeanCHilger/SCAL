Clinical significance of cytologic diagnosis of atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade, in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. We used cytohistologic correlation to determine the clinical significance of atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade (ASC-H) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
