The distribution and differential risks of human papillomavirus genotypes in cervical preinvasive lesions: A Taiwan Cooperative Oncologic Group Study. To clarify the distribution and relative risk of different human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in cervical preinvasive lesions, 1246 women with abnormal Papanicolaou smear including atypical squamous cell of unknown significance (ASCUS), atypical glandular cell of unknown significance (AGUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were enrolled in a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Colposcopy and HPV tests with hybrid capture 2 and polymerase chain reaction-reverse line blot were performed. The prevalences of HPV in ASCUS/AGUS-negative histology, ASCUS/AGUS, LSIL, HSIL, and invasive cancer were 33.8%, 38.3%, 74.9%, 84.3% and 100%, respectively, with an overall positive rate of 68.8%. The most common HPV types were HPV 16 (18.5%), 52 (16.5%), 58 (13.2%), 33, 51, 53, 18, 39, 59, 66, MM8, and 31. In comparing the relative risk of HPV infection in different disease status, LSIL and HSIL/carcinoma had a 4.64 (95% CI: 2.98-7.24) and 10.53 (95% CI: 6.69-16.58) folds of risk of high-risk HPV infection than the negative group. The same was true in mixed HPV infection, but not in low-risk type infection. Looking into each high-risk HPV type, the relative infection risks for LSIL and HSIL/carcinoma, in comparison with the negative group, were 1.67 (0.63-4.43) and 8.67 (3.46-21.70), 2017 (1.01-4.68) and 3.04 (1.42-6.47), and 1.40 (0.52-3.77) and 5.22 (2.07-13.19) for HPV type 16, 52 and 58, respectively. The study confirmed the high prevalence and risky nature of HPV 52 and 58 in Taiwanese population and conveyed the need to include these HPV types in vaccine development.
