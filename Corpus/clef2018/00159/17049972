Clinical utility of atypical glandular cells (AGC) classification: cytohistologic comparison and relationship to HPV results. To determine the utility of the category of atypical glandular cells (AGC) in the management of patients with putative cervical neoplasia and to correlate HPV-DNA test results when available.The Johns Hopkins Hospital cytopathology records of 50,668 women patients were searched for all liquid-based gynecologic cytology (LBP) results of Atypical Glandular cells of Undetermined Significance (AGUS) and AGC from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2003, yielding 98 patients (0.19%). Oncogenic HPV-DNA tests were performed on the residual fluids of 43 of these patients, 37 of whom had follow-up biopsy. During the period of January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002, we identified 237 patients (0.58%) with conventional Pap smears in the AGUS or AGC category, among 41,024 conventional smears collected contemporaneously. To avoid confusion in this paper, AGC will be used to replace those results that originally were AGUS.Following the 98 LBP AGC interpretations, 24 lesions (33.8%) were discovered out of 71 biopsies. HPV-DNA tests were performed on the residual of 43 LBPs, 18 (41.9%) were positive for oncogenic HPV. Only 37 patients had follow-up biopsy and 15 (40.5%) were positive for oncogenic HPV, of which 40% (6/15) had a significant lesion. Of the 237 conventional AGC Paps, 18 lesions (15.3%) were discovered out of 118 biopsies.Comparison of liquid-based and conventional Pap tests revealed a significant difference (33.8% vs. 15.3% respectively) (OR: 2.84, 95% CI: 1.4-5.73, p=0.004) in the detection of glandular and squamous lesions. HPV testing may prove beneficial to triage AGC patients with negative colposcopic findings and positive HPV results.
