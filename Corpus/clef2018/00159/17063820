Assessment of HPV detection assays for use in cervical cancer screening programs. Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus types (HPV) infection is an important tool in the screening of cervical cancer and triage of cytological abnormalities. The different techniques for detection of this cancer need to be contrasted and validated for use in population screening.Cervical cell samples were collected from 166 women attending a dermatology clinic in Oviedo (Spain). We evaluated the performance of three different assays for VPH detection. The methods utilized were 1) In-house PCR-EIA using LI consensus primers MY09/ MY11, 2) A PCR-reverse line blot hybridization (PCR-LBH) that uses LI consensus PGMY primers. 3) Hybrid Capture 2. All assays were performed blinded. The kappa statistic was used to test for global agreement between assay pairs.HPV DNA was detected in 24,7%, 25,3% and 29,5% of the women, respective to the assay. The overall agreement between the in-house PCR, PCR-LBH and HC2 was (73.5%) with all kappa values between assay pairs exceeding 0.56 (p<0.001).The three HPV assays were equally accurate in estimating high-risk HPV prevalence and HPV-related lesions. The method for HPV detection must be decided depending on the goals of the search (screening, follow-up or molecular studies).
