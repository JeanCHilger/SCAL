Use of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing to deal with atypical squamous cells undetermined significance and low squamous intraepithelial lesion. To explore the role of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in improvement of recognition of cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) 2, 3 or cervical cancer confirmed by biopsy in women with abnormal cervical cytology including atypical squamous cells undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL).Total 940 patients with abnormal cervical liquid-based cytology including ASC-US and LSIL were included in this study. Hybrid capture II assay was applied in the high-risk HPV detection. The cervical pathologic diagnoses were obtained under colposcopy guided biopsy.Of the 940 cases, 497 were ASC-US, and 443 LSIL. With pathological diagnosis of cervical biopsy, 417 cases were chronic inflammation, 315 condyloma, 124 CIN 1, 65 CIN 2, 19 CIN 3 or cervical cancer. The positive rate of high-risk HPV DNA in groups of ASC-US and LSIL were 59.6% and 84.9%, respectively. In each group of abnormal cytology, detection rates of CIN 2, 3 or cervical cancer in patients with positive HPV DNA were 8.8% and 14.1%, respectively, which were higher than those with negative HPV DNA (0.2% and 6.0%, P < 0.05). In group of ASC-US, high-risk HPV DNA test had a negative predictive value of 99.5% detection rates of CIN 2, 3 or cervical cancer in patients with HPV DNA virus load 1-9.99 and > or = 10 was 1.6% and 10.7%, respectively.High-risk HPV DNA test were helpful to improve the detection rates of CIN 2, 3 or cervical cancer in patients with ASC-US.
