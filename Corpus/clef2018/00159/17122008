Agreement between the AMPLICOR Human Papillomavirus Test and the Hybrid Capture 2 assay in detection of high-risk human papillomavirus and diagnosis of biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervical disease. The AMPLICOR HPV test (AMP) and the Hybrid Capture 2 assay (HC2) detect 13 high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types. Evaluation of comparative performance with clinical samples is needed to allow informed implementation of AMP into clinical practice. AMP was used (i) to assess the prevalence of HR-HPV in 1,032 samples of known cytology, HC2 status, and/or confirmed histology (ii) to determine agreement between AMP and HC2
