The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and cyclooxygenase-2 in relation to human papilloma viral load and persistence of human papillomavirus after conization with negative margins. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations between human papillomavirus (HPV) load and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and to identify biomarkers that may predict high-risk HPV clearance or persistence after conization with negative margins. The following samples were analyzed: 77 paraffin-embedded specimens from patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), including 27 CIN 2 conization specimens and 50 CIN 3 conization specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with antibodies to VEGF, EGFR, MMP-2, and COX-2. Hybrid capture II testing was used to detect HPV DNA. VEGF expression was significantly associated with HPV load (rho = 0.27186, P = 0.0191), while COX-2 expression was significantly and inversely associated with HPV load (rho = -0.34309, P = 0.0028). In univariate analysis, HPV load (P = 0.0112) and VEGF expression (P = 0.0274) were significantly associated with high-risk HPV clearance or persistence after conization with negative margins. In multiple regression analysis, high viral load (relative light unit/positive control > 500) and positive VEGF expression were significantly associated with high-risk HPV persistence after conization with negative margins (odds ratio [OR]: 9.915, CI: 1.891-51.994 OR: 6.661, CI: 1.208-36.722, respectively). In conclusion, VEGF expression is related to HPV load, while COX-2 expression is inversely related to HPV load, and immunohistochemical analysis of VEGF expression and HPV viral load are a significant and an independent prognostic indicator of high-risk HPV persistence after conization with negative margins.
