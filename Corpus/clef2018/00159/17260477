Distribution of human papillomavirus types in Shenzhen women. To investigate the status of genital infection as well as distribution of types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women in Shenzhen and provide population data for the future vaccine intervention on cervical cancer.Women with age between 15 and 59 years were selected in cluster stratified sampling from Huaqiaocheng community, Nanshan district, Shenzhen and received a population-based cervical cancer screening. After consent, every woman was interviewed by using questionnaire and tested by liquid-based cytology and HPV DNA (hybrid capture 2 and gene chips typing) separately.Totally 1 137 women were screened. The rate of high risk HPV of hybrid capture 2 test (14. 0% ) was higher than gene chips typing test (9. 8%) (chi(2) = 27. 198, P < 0. 001)  the consistency of the two tests was acceptable ( kappa = 0. 498, P < 0. 001). The rates of low risk HPV types and other types of gene chips typing test in this population were 1. 9% and 0. 2% respectively. The percentages of HPV 16, 18 and 58 in HPV positive women were 29. 7% , 18. 9% and 18. 9%. The rates of different age group of low risk HPV were 1. 4% (17-34), 1. 7% (35-44) and 3. 2% (45-59) , respectively.HPV 16, 18, and 58 are the most popular types in the study population. The differences of infection rates of high risk HPV are due primarily to the variation of HPV16 distribution among age-specific population. The chances of being affected by low risk HPV will increase with age.
