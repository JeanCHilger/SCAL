Retinoic acid receptor beta silences human papillomavirus-18 oncogene expression by induction of de novo methylation and heterochromatinization of the viral control region. Retinoic acid receptor beta2 (RAR beta2) is often down-regulated during the multistep process to cervical cancer. In that way, its inhibitory function on the transcription factor AP-1, indispensable to maintain human papillomavirus (HPV) gene expression is relieved. Using HPV-18 positive HeLa cells as a model system, we show that ectopic expression of RAR beta2 is able to down-regulate HPV-18 transcription by selectively abrogating the binding of AP-1 to the viral regulatory region in a ligand-independent manner. This resulted in down-regulation of the viral mRNAs at the level of initiation of transcription. Decreased oncogene expression was accompanied by a re-induction of cell cycle inhibitory proteins such as p53, p21(CIP1), and p27(KIP) as well as by a cessation of cellular growth. Reduced transcriptional activity as a consequence of AP-1 reduction by selective c-Jun degradation apparently targets the HPV-18 regulatory region for epigenetic modification such as de novo methylation and nucleosomal condensation. This mechanism is otherwise counterbalanced by active and abundant viral transcription in malignant cells, because RAR beta2 itself becomes inactivated during cervical carcinogenesis. Hence, our study shows that the temporal co-existence of a potential repressor and viral oncoproteins is mutually exclusive and provides evidence of a cross-talk between a nuclear receptor, AP-1, and the epigenetic machinery.
