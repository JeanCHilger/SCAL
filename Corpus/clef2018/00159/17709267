Insulin-like growth factor system gene expression in cervical scrapes from women with squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer. There is ample evidence that the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) system is involved in the development of several types of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in exfoliated cervical cells in cervical carcinogenesis.mRNA levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3 and IGF-IR were assessed by real-time PCR in 105 cervical scrapes obtained from 16 patients diagnosed with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 24 with high-grade SIL (HSIL), 23 with cervical cancer, and 42 from controls with normal Papanicolau (Pap) test.IGF-I mRNA levels were very low and no significant differences were seen between control and other groups. IGF-II mRNA levels were significantly lower in LSIL than in control group (median [arbitrary units]: 0.38 vs. 2.42, P=0.006) but its expression in HSIL and cervical cancer was similar to the one observed in controls. IGFBP-3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in cancer than in controls (median [arbitrary units]: 0.43 vs. 0.73, P=0.03). We observed a decrease in IGF-IR gene expression as the SIL degree increased (median for controls, LSIL, HSIL, and cervical carcinoma [arbitrary units]: 31.24, 9.08, 8.95, and 3.56, respectively). IGF-IR mRNA levels were significantly lower in HSIL and cervical cancer in comparison with controls (P=0.043 and P<0.001, respectively).The present observations suggest that a reduced expression of IGFBP-3 and IGF-IR can be associated with progression to cervical cancer the specific role played by the IGF-IR in this process remains unclear.
