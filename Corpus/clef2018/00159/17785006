Molecular epidemiology of genital human papillomavirus and Chlamydia trachomatis among patients attending a genitourinary medicine clinic - will vaccines protect? High-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the main causative agents of cervical cancer, for which Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) may sometimes be a co-factor. Vaccines have been developed against some subtypes of human papillomavirus and a vaccine against CT is in development. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of the subtypes of HPV and CT in genitourinary (GU) medicine clinic attenders. In total, 1000 consecutive patients attending the GU clinic participated in this anonymized point-prevalence study. Urethral swabs from 437 men and urethral plus cervical swabs as a single specimen from 563 women were tested for the subtypes of both organisms. Nested major outer membrane protein (MOMP) polymerase chain reaction detected CT chromosomal DNA in 44/437 (10%) of the men and 73/563 (13%) of the women. Genotypes E, F, and D were the most common. In all, 55/437 (13%) of men and 244/563 (43%) of women were infected with at least one high-risk HPV type. In conclusion, the new HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, would have protected against 58% and 45%, respectively, of the high-risk subtypes found in women in this population. The rate of high-risk HPV infection (43%) found in women in this study raises concern.
