Outcomes of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and high-risk human papillomavirus DNA. To study the risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 in women with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) cytology over a 2-year period using the 2001 Bethesda System and ThinPrep Paps.In 2002, 846 patients with ThinPrep cervical cytology having an ASCUS interpretation and positive for high-risk HPV DNA were identified. A cohort of 514 (60.8%) patients with follow-up by repeat cytology, cervical biopsy or both was included in the study. Patient age was 12-81 years, with a median of 25 years.There were 291 women (56.6%) with negative status by cytology, HPV testing or biopsy with a median interval of 8.5 months, and an additional 174 patients (33.9%) had persistent ASCUS, positive HPV DNA or low-grade SIL/CIN 1. Finally, 49 patients (9.5%) had CIN 2 or 3, with a median interval of 8.5 months.Our study suggests that HSIL or CIN 2 or 3 will be detected in 1 in 10 women with HPV-positive index ASCUS cervical cytology at initial colposcopy or within a 2-year follow-up period.
