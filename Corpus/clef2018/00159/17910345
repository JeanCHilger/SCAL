A human papillomavirus testing system in women with abnormal Pap results: a comparison study with follow-up biopsies. To evaluate the efficacy of INFORM HPV using the SurePath collection method in women whose Pap tests indicated abnormal results.Ninety-two women from the gynecology clinics at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center who had Pap tests and underwent follow-up biopsies were selected for the study. This included 51 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 23 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 15 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 3 women with negative Pap results. The INFORM HPV, an in situ hybridization assay, testing for oncogenic types of HPV was performed, and the results were compared with follow-up biopsies.The positive rate of the INFORM HPV increased with higher grades of cytology diagnoses. The sensitivity of the INFORM HPV testing for predicting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) also increased with higher grades of cytology diagnoses. A negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.9% and a specificity of 80.4% for predicting CIN 2/3 were observed in the ASCUS group.Using SurePath Pap specimens, the INFORM HPV lacks sufficient sensitivity and NPV for predicting CIN 2/3 in women with ASCUS. Therefore, use of the test as a triage tool is limited.
