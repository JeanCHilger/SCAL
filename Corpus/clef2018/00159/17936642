Correlates of intent to seek unnecessary pap tests among elderly women. Cervical cancer screening may be over-used by elderly women who might not benefit from the test. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative importance of objective factors (e.g. intact cervix) and subjective factors (e.g. patients' Pap-smear related beliefs/attitudes) as correlates of elderly women's intention to have a Pap smear.This study was a secondary data analysis using a subset sample of the elderly women (>or=65 years) who participated in the Texas Tech 5000 Survey Wave 4, a cross-sectional phone interview study conducted in 2002. Intent to have a Pap test, previous gynecologic history, and beliefs/attitudes related to Pap tests were measured. chi2 tests and logistic regression were conducted.Among the 1,044 women in the analytical sample, 70.2% (733) reported intending to have a Pap smear test within the next 2 years. About 77% (449/582) of the women who had not undergone a hysterectomy reported the intend to have a Pap smear, whereas 62% (284/462) of the women who had undergone a hysterectomy reported the same intent (chi 2 = 30.26 df = 1Public health educational messages intended to increase appropriate use of Pap screening should include factual information about risk factors such as age and possession of an intact cervix. Other messages intended to reduce inappropriate use of Pap screening should be directed at physicians, since many elderly women intend to inappropriately seek Pap tests based on erroneous beliefs/attitudes.
