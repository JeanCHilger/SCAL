Abnormal cervical smears in adolescents: a ten-year comparative study of demographic criteria and management. Comparison of the demographic criteria and management of adolescents and other age groups referred to a colposcopy clinic with abnormal smears.Retrospective study of newly referred cases to a colposcopy clinic in a UK district general hospital between 1996 and 2005.Most of the sociodemographic and sexual factors associated with HPV infection and cervical cancer were more obvious among adolescents than older women. There was a comparable incidence of high-grade cervical lesions in the two groups.A policy is needed to deal with adolescents who are exposed to all the risk factors associated with the development of HPV infection and high-grade cervical lesions. This has become an important issue for discussion recently in the UK after raising the age of onset of cervical screening to 25.
