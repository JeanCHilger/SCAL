The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in paired urine and cervical smear samples of HIV-infected women. HIV-infected women are at increased risk for cervical dysplasia. Cervical dysplasia is caused by persistent infections with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Conventional testing for genital HPV infections requires cervical cytology. A non-invasive screening method by detection of HPV DNA in urine samples is preferable but is not a routine practice.To investigate the prevalence and concordance of HPV in paired urine and cervical smear samples and cytological results of Pap smears in HIV-infected women.Paired urine and cervical smear samples were collected from 27 HIV-infected women.The HPV prevalence in urine and cervical smear samples was 81.5% and 51.9%, respectively (p = 0.01). The concordance for HPV positivity and negativity between urine and cervical smear samples is 71%. Seven women (25.9%) had an abnormal cervical smear of Pap II or higher. In all urine samples from these cases HPV DNA was detected.In the present study we show that the HPV prevalence in urine and cervical smear samples of HIV-infected women is high and HPV test results are highly concordant. Therefore, urine samples can be used as medium for HPV testing. HPV testing in urine samples is a simple, reliable, non-invasive screening method.
