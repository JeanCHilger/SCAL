Human papilloma virus infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in transplanted patients. Progress in diagnosis and treatment has led to an increased number of transplantation patients who consequently have immunological depression and emergence of tumors. The incidence of cervical neoplasia, according to previous studies, is 11% this tumor is the only one that can be investigated by screening before and after a graft. Our purpose was to evaluate whether transplanted patients showed an increased incidence of genital human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and whether this infection produced greater progression of disease in cases of low-risk HPV infections. Our study involved 151 transplant patients who underwent Papanicolaou (Pap) and HPV tests. Patients listed for grafts underwent Pap and HPV tests 6 months before and 6 months after transplantation. All patients had negative Pap tests before their grafts. After their grafts 16 patients (10.59%) had negative Pap tests, but positive viral typing. Eleven patients (7.28%) showed positive Pap tests, 6 of whom had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and 5 patients high-grade SIL. The final HPV infection incidence (15.23%) was consistent with the literature. The incidence of lower female genital tract intraepithelial lesions (7.28%) was higher than the healthy population or analogous studies (4.5%-8.5%). We showed a constant association between high-risk HPV infection and gynecologic intraepithelial neoplasia, whereas there was no association between low-risk broods HPV infection and neoplasia. In conclusion, screening should start at almost 6 months before grafting to avoid an irreversible situation that is difficult to treat.
