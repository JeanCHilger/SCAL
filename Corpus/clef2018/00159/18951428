Photodynamic therapy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with hexaminolevulinate. CIN is a disease of women in their reproductive years, and treatment includes excisional techniques with increased risk of preterm deliveries. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursor of photoactive porphyrins may be a non-invasive alternative with minimal side effects. This study assessed the feasibility and response rate of PDT with hexaminolevulinate (HAL) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.Twenty four patients with a CIN 2 or 3 or a persistent CIN 1 and a positive high-risk HPV-DNA test were included. Each patient had gynaecologic examination including cervical cytology, HPV DNA testing, colposcopy and biopsy. Ten milliliters of HAL-thermogel (10 mM) were topically applied to the cervix for 3-5 hours, followed by 1,000 seconds of illumination of both ecto- and endocervical canal with red coherent light (wave length 633 nm) using a PDT laser and a special light catheter. Follow-up examinations were carried out after 3 (cytology, colposcopy, HPV DNA testing, and if needed re-PDT) and 6 months.Seven, 10, and 7 patients had a CIN 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Treatment could be accomplished in all cases and no severe side effects were encountered. Fifteen out of the 24 patients had a complete response (15/24 = 63%) and a HPV remission 6 months after 1-3 treatments. The remission rates were 71%, 50%, and 71% for CIN 1, 2 and 3.HAL PDT seems to be a non-invasive, repeatable procedure for CIN and cervical HPV infection with minimal side effects which can be easily performed on outpatient basis.
