Human papillomavirus vaccines and vaccine implementation. Countries are now challenged by the rapid development of vaccines aimed at the primary prevention of infections. In the years to come, several vaccines will need to be considered as potential candidates in routine immunization programs. Recently, two new vaccines against two/four types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been commercialized. Bivalent HPV 16 and 18 (Cervarix) and quadrivalent HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 (Gardasil) vaccines are now extensively used in some countries. These vaccines will prevent infection and long-running complications, such as cervical cancer, other HPV-related cancers and genital warts (for the quadrivalent vaccine). The beneficial effect of these vaccines will be largely observed in women. This article summarizes the burden of HPV preventable disease worldwide and briefly describes the impact of secondary prevention and the most relevant aspects of the current available vaccines, their efficacy and safety. Finally, some major aspects that are likely to impact the introduction of these vaccines around the world are outlined, with particular emphasis on developing countries.
