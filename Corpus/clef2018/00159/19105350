Significance of human papillomavirus test in triage of patients with atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance. To investigate the significance of human papillomavirus test in triage of patients with atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASCUS) diagnosed by cervical cytology.Human papillomavirus test,colposcope and cervical biopsy were performed in 184 patients with a referral diagnosis of ASCUS by cervical cytology.Confirmed by pathological diagnosis of cervical biopsy, 112 cases were chronic inflammation (60.87%), 33 CIN I (17.93%), 17 CIN II (9.24%), 8 CIN III (4.35%), 4 cervical squamous carcinoma (2.17%) and 10 condyloma (5.43%). Of the 184 women with cytological ASCUS, 124 (67.39%) cases were positive in high-risk HPV test among which 66 cases were histologically confirmed as chronic inflammation (53.23%), 22 as CIN I (17.74%), 16 as CIN II (12.90%), 8 as CIN III (6.45%), 4 as cervical squamous carcinoma (3.23%) and 8 as condyloma (6.45%). The positive rate of HPV in groups of ASCUS were higher than those with negative HPV (P < 0.003).Women with ASCUS should be tested for HPV. Cervical biopsy under colposcopy is recommended for women with HR-HPV infection.
