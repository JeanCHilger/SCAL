Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and aneusomy of TERC: assessment of liquid-based cytological preparations. The implementation of effective screening programs has decreased the incidence and mortality of cervical carcinoma. However, single screening tests are subjective and carry a significant false-negative rate. Therefore, supplementary tests to support the Papanicolaou (PAP) smear are being developed. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has increased the specificity of the PAP smear, but has high sensitivity rate. This has proven unhelpful in low-grade lesions and in young women. Cervical carcinogenesis is a multifactorial disorder. In addition to exposure to oncogenic HPV, which is regarded as the initiator, there must be a promoter to eventuate in invasive disease. The promoter factor appears to be the acquisition of extra copies of chromosome 3q and has been shown to be a constant recurrence in cervical carcinoma (squamous and adenocarcinomas). The 3q region contains the RNA sequence of the human telomerase gene TERC. Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between high-grade cervical lesions and abnormalities of TERC. This study supports the previous studies and examines the status of the TERC gene in low and high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions, diagnosed on cytology. ASC-H smears are also examined in an attempt to categorize lesions that are more likely to progress. Potentially this may help identify women in need of close clinical follow-up and early treatment.
