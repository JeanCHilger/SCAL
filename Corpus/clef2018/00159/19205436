Human papilloma virus in adolescence. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases especially in adolescence. The majority of the infections are self-sustained by the immune system. However, HPV may lead to genital warts, cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer. Sexually active adolescent females should be encouraged to obtain gynecologic screening for HPV and be well informed about HPV and the risks associated with this infection. All the efforts are now focused on the vaccines that are being developed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HPV infection if administered in time.
