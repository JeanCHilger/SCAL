Prevalence and risk factors for human papillomavirus and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among HIV-positive women at a tertiary level hospital in India. The hypothesis to be tested was that the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia would be significantly higher in HIV seropositive women as compared with seronegative controls. Secondary aims were to determine the risk factors for HPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and the HPV types in HIV-positive women.A cross-sectional study of women 18 to 49 years old was done. Seventy-five women who were HIV seropositive and 58 seronegative women, of whom 27 had HIV-positive partners, participated in the study. A Pap smear and a cervical swab for HPV were done. Women with Pap smear abnormality underwent colposcopy and large loop excision procedures if indicated.Ten (13.3%) HIV-positive women had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion as compared with 2 (3.4%) seronegative women (odds ratio [OR] 4.3 95% CI = 0.9-41.7HIV-positive women have a higher risk for multiple HPV infections as compared with seronegative women. Behavioral factors dominate HIV in determining HPV infections and resultant cervical neoplasia.
