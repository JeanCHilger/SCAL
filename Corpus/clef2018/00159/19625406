Adeno-associated virus type 2 induces apoptosis in human papillomavirus-infected cell lines but not in normal keratinocytes. The results of seroepidemiological studies suggest that infection with adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) is negatively correlated with the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer. We studied the potential of AAV2 oncosuppression of HPV and showed that HPV/AAV2 coinfection of cells culminated in apoptotic death, as determined by DNA laddering and caspase-3 cleavage. The induction of apoptosis coincided with AAV2 Rep protein expression increased S-phase progression
