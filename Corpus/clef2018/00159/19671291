Detection of multiple human papillomavirus infection in cervical specimens by flow fluorescent hybridization. To explore the clinical significance of detection of multiple human papillomavirus infection in cervical lesions detected by flow fluorescent hybridization technology with Luminex multi-analytic profiling (xMAP).Cervical exfoliated cell specimens were collected from 301 randomly selected women accepting opportunistic screening for cervical lesions with the cytological results and hybrid capture 2 (HC-2) assay>or=atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASC-US), 48 with the pathological diagnosis>or=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2 (case group) and 253 with normal histological result or only inflammation (control group), aged (34+/-9) (21-59). The samples were tested with xMAP technology with blind method. The coincidence of the xMAP and HC-2 was assessed. The HPV genotype, multiple HPV infection rate, and their relationships to the patients' clinical-pathological features were analyzed.The rates of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of xMAP technology to detect>or=CIN2 cervical lesions were 80.49%, 80.00%, and 80.07% respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 47.06% and 96.30% respectively. The Kappa Index for agreement between xMAP technology and HC-2 was 0.56. The prevalence rate of high-risk HPV infection was 28.24% (85/301). The prevalence rate of multiple HPV infection was 11.30% (34/301), significantly lower than that of single type high-risk HPV infection (16.94%, P<0.05). The proportion of multiple HPV infection in total positive HPV results was 35.05% (34/97). The proportion of duplex and treble HPV infection were 29.90% (29/97) and 5.15% (5/97) respectively. The multiple HPV infection rate of the case group was 37.50% (18/48), significantly higher than that of the control group (6.32%, 16/253, P<0.01). The common duplex HPV infection modes were 16+51/58 (n=4), 51/58+52/59 (n=4), 11+16 (n=3), and 11+52/59 (n=3), 18+52/59 (n=3). The common treble HPV infection modes were 11+16+52/59, 16+18+31, 16+18+52/59, 31+33+39, and 31+33+52/59 (all n=1). HPV16, 52/59, 51/58, 18, 11, and 31 were the common types in multiple HPV infections.Flow fluorescent hybridization technology is able to detect multiple HPV infection that is associated with cervical lesions and to identify the HPV genotypes.
