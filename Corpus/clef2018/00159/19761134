Uterine cervical neoplasia prevention in Parque Indigena do Xingu. Results of preventive health measures, diagnosis and treatment applied to Parque Indigena do Xingu native women were studied. Thirty-seven cases of uterine cervical intraepithelial lesions and invasive neoplasias were treated in the local villages without referral to an advanced medical center. LEEPs were carried out in 32 women, three cold knife conizations, one vaginal hysterectomy and one Wertheim Meigs procedure. Results of 53.1% of LEEP surgical procedures did not have margin involvement by the lesions. Bleeding complications were seen in 15.6%. Regular follow-up with two or three cytologic and colposcopic tests in 32 women was carried out. All cases were negative for lesions. Five women were not followed-up due mainly to logistical reasons. Health endeavors adopted in the period 2005-2007 brought about a significant reduction of precursor lesions in this native aboriginal population without screening resources.
