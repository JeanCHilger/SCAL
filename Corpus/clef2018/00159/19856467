Prevalence of human papillomaviruses in urine samples of male patients infected with HIV-1 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Human papillomavirus is a DNA virus that includes 118 genotypes. HPV16 is responsible for 80% of cervical cancer in women. Men are important reservoirs and major transmitters of HPV to their partners. The aim of this study was to detect HPV DNA and to determine the prevalence of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in urine samples of men infected with HIV-1. This study included 223 patients infected with HIV-1 from the Center of Reference on HIV/AIDS (CRT-SP) and an outpatient clinic of HIV. Urine samples were collected and after DNA extraction real-time PCR was performed for detection of HPV DNA. Positive samples were then tested by conventional PCR using type-specific primers for the four HPV types. A total of 223 men infected with HIV-1 were tested, 81% of whom were on HAART. Four (5.8%) were positive for HPV6, 18 (26.1%) were positive for HPV11, 22 (31.9%) were positive for HPV16 and five (7.2%) were positive for HPV18 by conventional PCR. Twenty (29%) patients had other HPV types and five patients (1.5%) had multiple types. The mean T CD4+cells count was 517 and 441 cells/mm(3) (P = 0.30), in HPV negative and positive men, respectively. The HIV viral load was higher in the HPV negative group than for in the men with HPV (P = 0.0002). A 30.9% prevalence of HPV was found in asymptomatic urine samples of men infected with HIV-1. This study suggests that urine may be a useful specimen for HPV screening.
