Relationship of atypical glandular cell cytology, age, and human papillomavirus detection to cervical and endometrial cancer risks. To quantify the age-specific and reproductive organ-specific cancer risk after an atypical glandular cell (AGC) cytologic interpretation in large clinic-based sample in which routine high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is conducted.: To estimate the absolute risk of cervical precancer, cervical cancer, and endometrial cancer in women with AGC cytology, we conducted a cross-sectional study of women with AGC cytology (n=1,422) in a large health maintenance organization that introduced high-risk HPV DNA testing into cervical cancer screening in 2003. Risks and binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe (CIN 2 or worse) and endometrial cancer were calculated.A total of 238 women with AGC cytology (16.7%, 95% CI 14.8-18.8%) were diagnosed with CIN 2 or worse, endometrial cancer, or other cancers. Among women aged 50 years or older, 420 high-risk HPV-negative women were at a 10.5% (95% CI 7.7-13.8%) risk of endometrial cancer, and 77 high-risk HPV-positive women were at a 10.4% (95% CI 4.6-19.4%) risk of cervical cancer and 0% (95% CI 0.0-4.7%) risk of endometrial cancer.High-risk HPV testing may distinguish between risk of endometrial cancer and cervical cancer in women with AGC cervical cytology, particularly in women aged 50 years or older.III.
