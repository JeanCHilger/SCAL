Epidemiological study of high risk human papillomavirus infection in 25 to 54 years old married women in Beijing.. To investigate high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) prevalence among married women in Beijing and to study the high risk factors.During March 2007 to September 2008, a total of 6185 married women sampled from 137 communities in 12 districts were screened by HR-HPV DNA test and cytological test. The interview was carried out with unified questionnaires. The database was set up and twice entered in EpiData 3.0. After checked up, the data were analyzed in SPSS 15.0.(1) The HR-HPV infection rate was 9.89%. The HR-HPV infection rate of the city zone, the suburb and the exurb were 9.34%, 10.51% and 9.51% (P > 0.05). The HR-HPV infection rate of the native and the outlander were 9.53%, 11.30% (P < 0.05). (2) The age distribution of HR-HPV infection was that the rate was around 10% among 25 to 44 age groups, which was the highest (11.21%) in 30 to 34 age group then the rate was descended as the age raising, the rate of 50 to 54 age group was the lowest (7.78%). (3) Multiple logistic regression showed that the related risk factors of HR-HPV infection mainly included 1000 RMB and above of family income per person per month, possessing more than 1 sexual partner of her husband, outlander and high levels of education. (4) The prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in HR-HPV positive group was significantly higher than that in HR-HPV negative group (29.76% vs 3.32%, P < 0.01).(1) The HR-HPV infection rate among aged 25 to 54 years was 9.9% and there was no significant difference in area distribution. (2) The high risk population which should strengthen screening was the married bearing-age women with high level of family income, outlander, high levels of education and her husband possessing more than 1 sexual partner. (3) HR-HPV infection is the main risk factor for CIN and cervical cancer, while does not provide a causal relationship with them. The high risk population should be checked regularly to understand the development of HR-HPV infection and CIN incidence.
