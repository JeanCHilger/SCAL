Recovery of DNA from BD SurePath cytology specimens and compatibility with the Roche AMPLICOR Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Test. The AMPLICOR HPV Test has been validated for use with cervical cells collected in liquid-based preservative fluids, such as BD SurePath. It is currently recommended, however, that residual BD SurePath samples be stored at 4 degrees C prior to testing.The aim of this study was to demonstrate that DNA isolated from SurePath cervical cytology specimens and stored at ambient temperature was also compatible with the AMPLICOR HPV Test.DNA was extracted using the AmpliLute Media Sample Preparation Kit. Amplification and detection of HPV was performed both as directed by the manufacturer and with minor protocol modifications.Cervical specimens collected in SurePath preservative fluid remained stable for testing with the AMPLICOR HPV Test for at least 21 days. The performance of DNA extracted from specimens stored at room temperature was equivalent to DNA extracted from specimens stored at 4 degrees C. The beta-globin internal control was detected in all of the 146 residual SurePath cervical cytology specimens tested using the AMPLICOR HPV Test, and high-risk HPV was detected in 46.2% (18/39) of ASCUS cases, in 63.3% (19/30) of LSIL cytology specimens, and 92.3% (24/26) of HSIL cases. Concordance of AMPLICOR HPV Test results with Hybrid Capture II was 83.9%.The AMPLICOR HPV Test can be successfully and reproducibly performed from DNA isolated from residual SurePath cervical cytology specimens stored at ambient temperature for at least 21 days. This provides clinical laboratories flexible storage conditions for residual SurePath cytology specimens.
