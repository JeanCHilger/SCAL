Laser vaporization in the management of CIN. To evaluate the effectiveness of laser CO2 vaporization in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias and to assess the diagnostic reliability of cytology, colposcopy, microbiology and HPV tests in predicting recurrence in a long-term outcome.Forty-four patients affectd by high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-CIN) were submitted to laser CO2 vaporization and followed-up a minimum of five years. Vaginal smears for microbiological examination were detected. HPV testing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The average age of the patients was 19.5 years (range 15-24). The cure rate after a single treatment was 95%. Two cases (5%) revealed HG-CIN persistence after three months. The five year follow-up of all cases submitted to a second laser procedure revealed negative cytologic and colposcopic findings.A higher degree of expertise and experience from the colposcopist and long-term follow-up proves the effectiveness of laser vaporization in the management of CIN in young women. It has been suggested that HPV infection alone may not be sufficient to promote carcinogenesis and that other cofactors could be involved. Microbiological tests are important to identify and treat any inflammation which might represent a cofactor of HPV infection in the pathogenesis of cervical dysplasia. Cytocolposcopic long-term follow-up, microbiological and HPV tests can improve regression of disease.
