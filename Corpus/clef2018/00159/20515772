A new method of screening human papillomavirus genotypes and clinical validation. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a necessary factor in the development of cervical cancer. A new HPV screening method, "Human Papillomavirus Genotyping (HPG)", was developed to detect 29 HPV genotypes distribution in China. The utility of HPG was compared to Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test (HC2), and it was determined that the HPG test had been proven to be a more credible and sensitive screening HPV method than the HC2 test. HPV16, HPV 52, HPV 56, and HPV 58 were the four most common HPV genotypes in women who have suffered chronic cervicitis or abnormal vaginal bleeding in China. HPV 16 (28.57%) and 18 (17.86%) were more likely to infect multiple HPV genotypes than other HPV genotypes. Age group more than 50 years had a higher risk than other age groups.
