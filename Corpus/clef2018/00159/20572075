Characterization of human papillomavirus infection in north Taiwan. The detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) is very important for the evaluation of preventative strategies for cervical cancer. The major objective of this study was to characterize the prevalence of different genotypes of HPV in north Taiwan to contribute to the epidemiological knowledge of HPV infections. Papanicolaou (Pap) cervical smears were collected from 10,543 women aged between 14 and 87 years. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA array hybridization techniques were used to genotype 51 different HPV strains. HPV was detected in 1,577 women, which gave an overall HPV prevalence rate of 15%. Forty-eight different genotypes were found in these patients, which included 9.7% that were high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) genotypes. The most common types of HR-HPV in patients, in descending order of frequency, were HPV 52, 16, 58, 56, 39, 51, 18, 68, 31, 33, 59, 45, and 35. HPV 52 was the most frequent type in every age group. The four most common HR-HPV types were found in 56.6% of the patients infected with HR-HPV. In cases that were infected with multiple HPV genotypes, 69.2% had at least one HR-HPV genotype. The rate of infection with HR-HPV was higher in the younger age groups than the older ones. In conclusion, 48 HPV genotypes were identified from a large study of cervical screening samples and the prevalence of HPV genotypes in different age groups was very diverse. The formulation of a public health strategy for HPV vaccination should take into account the prevalence of various HR-HPV/LR-HPV genotypes.
