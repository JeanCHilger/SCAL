Conjugation of HPV16 E7 to cholera toxin enhances the HPV-specific T-cell recall responses to pulsed dendritic cells in vitro in women with cervical dysplasia. We have evaluated whether cholera toxin (CT) as a carrier/adjuvant can enhance human T-cell responses to a viral oncoprotein in vitro using dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-presenting cells. Monocyte-derived DCs obtained from women with cervical dysplasia were pulsed with the HPV16 oncoprotein E7, either alone or conjugated to CT, and tested for their ability to induce antigen-specific activation of autologous T cells in vitro. CT-conjugation of E7 significantly improved the capacity of pulsed DCs to activate antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion. The CT-E7-pulsed DCs also produced significantly more of the Th1-inducing cytokine IL-12 compared to DCs pulsed with E7 or CT alone. Furthermore, DCs pulsed with CT-conjugated HPV16 E7 caused a response in T cells from women with advanced disease (CIN III) as well as in T cells from women that were currently not infected with HPV16. These data show the potential of using CT-conjugated viral oncoproteins for DC-induced T-cell activation in humans.
