Screening based on papillomavirus detection: too many false alarms. Screening for highly oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) variants can detect more cases of severe dysplasia than the cervical smear test, but this advantage is offset by a higher frequency of false alarms and colposcopy procedures. In practice, this test has no proven value in the prevention of invasive cervical cancer or related deaths.
