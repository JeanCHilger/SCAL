Cervical cytology biobanks as a resource for molecular epidemiology. A cervical cytology biobank (CCB) is an extension of current cytopathology laboratory practice consisting in the systematic storage of Pap smears or liquid-based cytology samples from women participating in cervical cancer screening with the explicit purpose of facilitating future scientific research and quality audit of preventive services. A CCB should use an internationally agreed uniform cytology terminology, be integrated in a national or regional screening registry, and linked to other registries (histology, cancer, and vaccination). Legal and ethical principles concerning personal integrity and data safety must be respected strictly. Biobank-based studies require approval from ethical review boards. A CCB constitutes a nearly inexhaustible resource to perform fundamental and applied biologic research. In particular, it can contribute in answering questions on the natural history of HPV infection and HPV-induced lesions and cancers, screening effectiveness, exploration of new biomarkers, and surveillance of short- and long-term effects of the introduction of HPV vaccination. To understand the limitations of CCB, more studies are needed on quality of samples in relation to sample type, storage procedures, and duration of storage.
