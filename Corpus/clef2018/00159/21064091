Type-specific HPV geno-typing improves detection of recurrent high-grade cervical neoplasia after conisation. The aim of this case-control study was to examine if type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA geno-typing before and after treatment of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) improves prediction of recurring or persisting CIN 2 or 3 compared with follow-up cytology or high-risk (hr)HPV testing. Women with biopsy-proven recurrence of CIN 2 or 3 (cases) in a follow-up period of at least 24 months after treatment of high-grade CIN were compared with women without recurrence (controls). These cohorts were identified by a database search of the Riatol Laboratoria (Antwerp, Belgium). In a cohort of 823 women treated with conisation for high-grade CIN between January 2001 and December 2007, 21 patients with a histologically proven recurrence of CIN2+ were identified. A group of women (n=42) from the same cohort without recurrence was randomly chosen. We found that hrHPV testing at 6 months post-treatment is significantly more sensitive compared with follow-up cytology (ratio: 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.54), but less specific (ratio: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.81-0.90) to predict failure of treatment. When compared with hrHPV testing, HPV geno-typing is more efficient (equal sensitivity, but higher specificity, ratio: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.280-1.62). When compared with follow-up cytology, HPV geno-typing is more sensitive (ratio: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.10-1.54) and more specific (ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14-1.36). All women who developed a recurrence tested positive for hrHPV. The negative predictive value in the absence of hrHPV DNA was 100%. Six months after treatment HPV geno-typing is the most sensitive and specific method to predict recurrent or persistent CIN 2-3 in the next 24 months.
