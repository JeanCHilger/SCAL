Type-specific human papillomavirus detection in cervical smears in Romania. Although Romania has one of the highest incidence of cervical cancer in Europe (30 new cases/100 000 women), little is known about the distribution of the human papillomaviruses (HPV) genotypes in this population. We seek to determine the distribution of HPV genotypes in women with normal and abnormal cervical cytology. We analyzed 460 cervical cytology specimens from women who self-referred to the gynecologic clinic. HPV was detected and genotyped using the commercially available INNOLiPA (INNOGENETICS NV) kit based on the reverse hybridization principle. HPV DNA was detected in 279 cases (60.7%) with a median age of 32.9 years. In HGSIL (High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) cytology, the presence of HPV DNA was confirmed in 82.7% of cases. The most frequent high-risk genotype was HPV16, found in 32.6% of HPV-positive samples. The next common high-risk genotypes were HPV18, HPV31 and HPV51. Our findings on the distribution and frequency of the HPV genotypes in Romanian population confirmed the utility of the current available HPV vaccines, HPV16 and 18 being detected in 28.7% of cases in the investigated area.
