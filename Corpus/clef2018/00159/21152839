Prevalence of HPV 16, 18, 45 and 31 in women with cervical lesions. To determine the prevalence of HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45 in cervical screening samples of women with cellular changes and/or colposcopy suggestive of persistent high grade or low grade lesion who were submitted to conization.A total of 120 women were included in the study. Histological analysis of the cervical cones revealed 7 cases of cervicitis, 22 of CIN1, 31 of CIN2, 54 of CIN3, and 6 invasive carcinomas. The cervical screening samples were analyzed before conization for the presence of HPV-DNA by PCR using the consensus primers PGMY09/11. HPV-DNA-positive samples were tested for the presence of HPV16, 18, 31 and 45 using type-specific primers for these HPV.HPV-DNA was detected in 67.5% of the studied women. HPV 16 (40%) was the most prevalent type in most ilesions, followed by HPV 31 (13.3%), 45 (13.3%), and 18 (4.1%). Multiple infections occurred in 15% of the cases and infections with other HPV types were detected in 14% of the sample.HPV 16 and 18 infections do not always occur as a single infection, and may be associated with other HPV types on different occasions.
