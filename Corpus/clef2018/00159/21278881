Major clinical research advances in gynecologic cancer in 2010. This review summarizes 11 major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology in 2010. For ovarian cancer, bevacizumab as a leading molecular targeted agent, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in recurrent disease, the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an advanced setting, an effective screening method, and ARID1A mutations as a clue to the origin of clear cell carcinoma are mentioned. For cervical cancer, confirmation of the efficacy and the introduction of a self collection method of the human papillomavirus (HPV) test, and the association between the HPV vaccine and miscarriage are examined. For endometrial cancer, the superiority of laparoscopy in staging operation, the role of vaginal brachytherapy in an adjuvant setting, and the effect of para-aortic lymph node dissection are reviewed. In addition, the trend of geriatric oncology and chemotherapy in carcinosarcomas is also assessed.
