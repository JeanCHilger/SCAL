Psychological burden of testing positive for high-risk human papillomavirus on women with atypical cervical cytology: a prospective study. To assess the psychological burden of testing positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) on Chinese women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS).Prospective observational study.Five community women's health clinics in Hong Kong.Ethnic Chinese women (n=299) with ASCUS who underwent reflex HPV testing (of whom 142 tested HPV negative and 157 tested HPV positive).Women's psychological condition was assessed by self-administered questionnaires at smear result notification and by structured telephone interviews six months after notification. All women who tested positive for HPV were referred for colposcopy.State anxiety, cervical cancer worry and psychosocial burden.At result notification, the HPV-positive group had significantly higher state anxiety, cervical cancer worry and psychosocial burden than the HPV-negative group (all p<0.001). Irrespective of the HPV results, all outcome scores decreased over time. About 80% of the women who were HPV positive attended colposcopy as recommended. At six months, the two groups did not differ in state anxiety, cervical cancer worry, perceived risk of cervical cancer and satisfaction with intimate relationship, but psychosocial burden remained higher in the HPV-positive group (p=0.001).A concurrent positive HPV result intensified the distress of women with ASCUS at result notification. With time and after colposcopy, their initial heightened anxiety and cervical cancer worry were significantly lowered. However, HPV positivity may pose a prolonged psychosocial burden on women even after having had the necessary follow-up for their cervical abnormalities.
