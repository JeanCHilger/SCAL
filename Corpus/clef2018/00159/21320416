Malignant degeneration in laryngeal papillomatosis. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is considered a benign disease although malignant transformation is well-described. The involvement of human papilloma virus (HPV) in malignant transformation is still being discussed. We present a case of rapid malignant transformation of RRP in a 29-year-old male. The tumour as well as biopsies from his previous laryngeal papillomas tested positive for HPV 16. Introduction of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine with a view to preventing cervical cancer may also reduce RRP, and subsequently possibly also the incidence of head-and-neck cancers.
