Endocervical adenocarcinoma--a current diagnostic problem. Adenocarcinomas currently account for 15-20% of all invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix in developed countries. The tumor is asymptomatic in up to 20% of the cases and is usually discovered as result of abnormal Pap smears. Cytology smears however are relatively ineffective in detecting of the cervical adenocarcinoma and its precursors. Today, more effective methods are being implemented for the obtaining and interpretation of cytology smears such as the "liquid based Pap", the "Thin Prep imaging syst". This is required also due to the paucity of trained cytotechnicians and cytopathologists. The introduction of computer assisted system for screening raises the effectiveness of detecting LSIL and HSIL to 37% and 42% respectively The problem however with the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma remains more complicated even with the introduction of the above mentioned techniques for a number of reasons. For instance, there are some morphological differences which delineate it from the squamous carcinoma. In everyday practice the pathologist is faced with the following more important issues surrounding the histologic diagnosis of the cervical adenocarcinoma: (1) the recognition of preivasive glandular lesions (2) the distinction of preinvasive from invasive adenocarcinoma
