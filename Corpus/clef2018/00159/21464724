Association between HPV types and species groups and cervical neoplasia from a high-risk area for cervical cancer, Goiânia, Brazil. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of single or multiple-human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and phylogenetic groups on the prevalence and severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women undergoing colposcopy after an abnormal cervical smear. Colposcopy was performed in 198 cases and biopsy was performed in 193 patients. All specimens were tested for 27 HPV genotypes using the Roche polymerase chain reaction reverse line blot assay. The overall prevalence of HPV infection in women with an abnormal cervical smear was 86% (171 of 198). The prevalence of HPV 16 in high-grade CIN (2/3) was 52% (40 of 76), being detected in 88.8% of cases (8 of 9) of invasive carcinoma. The prevalence of HPV types 31 and 35 in high-grade CIN was 10.5% (8 of 76) and 6.6% (5 of 76), respectively. Single or multiple-type infection involving HPV 16 were significantly associated with a diagnosis of high-grade neoplasia (≥ CIN 2) [odds ratio (OR) 6.49 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.88-23.44 and OR: 3.65
