Human papilloma virus screening by hybrid capture II in Chinese women of Jiangsu Province. To survey Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection in Chinese Women of Jiangsu Province and discuss the relationship between HPV and the biology of cervical cancer.Two thousand, one hundred and fifty-three sexually active women (including 66 cases of cervical cancer) were selected for high-risk human papilloma virus DNA test with Hybrid Capture II (HCII).The overall HPV prevalence was 32.6% (701/2153) with higher positive rates in cervical carcinoma and Cervical Interstitial Neoplasia (CIN) [93.9% and 54.6%] respectively. For women aged 40-59 years, the overall high-risk HPV prevalence was higher than those of other age groups. Compared with CIN I, the positivity rate and viral load of HPV DNA in CIN III is much higher (80.2% vs. 29.9%, 11.89 vs. 0.53). Ninety-four per cent (64/66) of patients with Cervical cancer were detected to be HPV positive. There was no significant difference in HPV DNA among each clinical stage and pathologic grade. But the positive rates and the value of HPV DNA were higher in the patients with cervical interstitial incursion. Eighty per cent of patients (20/25) could become negative within six months after operation.High-risk HPV DNA test is effective in screening for cervical diseases. HCII is an effective method to detect HPV DNA.
