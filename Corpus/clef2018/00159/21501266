Men's lack of knowledge adds to the cervical cancer burden in South Africa. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of knowledge regarding cervical cancer among Black men living in Ga-Rankuwa, South Africa. A quantitative survey was conducted. The population consisted of 980 (n = 980) convenience sampled men. Self-reported data were gathered using a structured interview and a pre-tested questionnaire served as data gathering instrument. The study provided evidence that men living in Ga-Rankuwa did not have knowledge of cervical cancer. None of the sample mentioned the HPV as risk factor while some knew that having multiple sexual partners add to a woman's risk. It is, however, doubtful whether the respondents experienced themselves as those with the multiple partners. More than 90% of the sample (n = 963) reported to have had more than one sexual partner in the previous 5 years while less than a quarter indicated that they would have to change their sexual behaviour to prevent cervical cancer. Men add to the cervical cancer burden in South Africa as their knowledge would not enable them to protect their partners from HPV infections, motivate them to be screened or allow them to protect themselves against this dreadful disease.
