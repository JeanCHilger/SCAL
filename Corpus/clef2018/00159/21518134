Correlation between immunocytochemistry of human papilloma virus L1 capsid protein and behavior of low-grade cervical cytology in Korean women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in Korean women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) in relation to the immunocytochemical detection of the HPV L1 capsid protein.From January 2006 to December 2007, a total of 353 immunocytochemistry tests were performed on specimens from HPV-infected patients with LSIL. Due to exclusions, the study population was reduced to 318. Subjects were monitored at 4-6 month intervals. The regression, persistence, and progression of the cytologic abnormalities of the 318 cases were compared with the results of HPV L1 capsid protein immunocytochemical detection.Of the 137 patients negative for the HPV L1 capsid protein, 38 (27.7%) showed progression to high-grade lesions, 50 (36.5%) showed persistence, and 49 (35.8%) showed regression to normal cytological features. In contrast, of the remaining 181 patients positive for the HPV L1 capsid protein, 15 (8.3%) showed progression to high-grade lesions, 74 (40.9%) showed persistence, and 92 (50.8%) showed regression. The results of immunocytochemical testing for the HPV L1 capsid protein show a linear association with the progression or regression behavior of low-grade cervical cytology in patients infected with HPV (linear by linear association test, P<0.05).Immunocytochemical detection of HPV L1 was significantly related with the biological patterns of LSIL in Korean women. Hence, immunocytochemistry for the detection of HPV L1 is beneficial in providing further information for LSIL.
