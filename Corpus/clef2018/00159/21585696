Knowledge of Pap smear, HPV and the HPV vaccine and the acceptability of the HPV vaccine by Thai women. The primary prevention for cervical cancer, a human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, has been available in Thailand for almost 3 years. The present study evaluates knowledge about the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, HPV and the HPV vaccine and focuses on identifying predictors for the acceptability of the HPV vaccine.A sample of 764 women attending the gynecology clinic at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, was asked to answer a questionnaire on their personal background, their knowledge of the Pap smear and HPV and the HPV vaccine and the acceptability of the HPV vaccine for themselves and their daughters.Knowledge of the Pap smear (96%) is higher than that of HPV (41%) and the HPV vaccine (36%). Only 40% of participants had previously heard about HPV. The acceptability of the HPV vaccine for participants and their daughters was high, 77% and 84%, respectively. Knowing about HPV increases acceptance for the HPV vaccine (adjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.5, in the participants and OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.5-3.6 in their daughters). Participants younger than 45 years old (OR = 2.3 and 95% CI = 1.6-3.4 for themselves OR = 2.2 and 95% CI = 1.4-3.3 for their daughters) were more likely to accept the vaccination than those aged 45 years old and above.Knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine is generally poor in Thai women. However, the acceptability of the HPV vaccine is good. Knowing about HPV and age under 45 years predict the acceptability of the HPV vaccine.
