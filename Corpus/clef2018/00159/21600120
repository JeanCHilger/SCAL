Significance for the detection of human papillomavirus DNA in cervical atypical glandular cells. To evaluate the potential link between high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV)DNA testing and histological diagnosis in women referred for atypical glandular cells (AGC) at Pap smear.All cervical cytological examinations with the diagnosis of AGC between January 2007 and Dec 2009 were identified by means of a computerized database in 97 patients. The histopathological results of cervix were analyzed by colposcopic biopsy, dilatation and curettage (D&C), cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and high-risk human papilloma virus DNA testing.(1) All patient were monitored by colposcopy, histopathology and HPV DNA test. Sixty-four patients had pathologic lesions. (2) In predicting the presence of high-grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, the sensitivity of human papilloma virus was 96%, specificity 92.86%, positive predictive value 96% and negative predictive value 92.86%. (3) 98.9% of the AGC patients received colposcopic, cytological examinations and HPV test at follow-ups: 3 cases of PAP smear and 6 cases of HPV testing were abnormal at the first follow-up, and 100% negative for cytological examination and HPV test at the second follow-up visit.HPV DNA test and colposcopic examination are effective in the initial evaluation and subsequent follow-ups of cytological atypical glandular cells.
