Human papillomavirus genotypes among infected Thai women with different cytological findings by analysis of E1 genes. Cervical cytological data may not be sufficient for cervical cancer screening and prevention. In this project, we determined HPV genotype among infected Thai women with different cytological findings by characterization of E1 genes. Five hundred and thirty-five specimens were tested by PCR amplification of the E1 genes. HPV genotypes were determined by sequencing, comparison with the GenBank database and were analyzed in relation to different cytological findings. HPV-DNA by PCR were typed and revealed 32 different genotypes. HR-HPV (HPV16, 18 or 52) was detected in all samples with cervical cancer cytology. HPV16 was most prevalent irrespective of cervical cytology. Moreover, HPV31 and 52 were most prevalent in the HSIL and LSIL groups whereas HPV66 was found mostly in the LSIL group. The LSIL group displayed the highest variation of HPV genotypes. Moreover, HPV31 and 52 predominated in the HSIL and LSIL groups especially HPV52 which was found in cancer samples. We hoped that these data of HPV genotypes can be used as preliminary data of HPV in Thailand and can serve as basic data for future research into the HPV genotype in south-east Asia.
