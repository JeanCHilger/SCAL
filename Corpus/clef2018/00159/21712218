The knowledge levels and opinions of biomedical students regarding the human papillomavirus quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) recombinant vaccine. The objective of this research was to assess the knowledge levels and attitudes of all students enrolled in 1 biomedical university regarding the human papillomavirus quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) recombinant vaccine (Gardasil-Merck the HPV vaccine). A survey of students from all 7 programs at the University was conducted in January 2009. A total of 1120 useable questionnaires were obtained. These programs included pharmacy, osteopathic medicine, physician assistant, physical therapy, occupational therapy, doctor of psychology, and master of biomedical sciences. Mean percentage correct on the HPV vaccine knowledge test was 73. Subjects scored highest on the question that asks whether the vaccine helps prevent cervical cancer (97% correct) and lowest on the one asking whether it helps prevent genital warts (41% correct). Eighty-eight percent thought that patients 18 years and older should be able to receive the HPV vaccine without parental consent. Only about 5% think that the vaccine would cause patients to become sexually active, or that it would cause patients to have unprotected sex. The results suggest that these students have reasonable but limited knowledge of the vaccine. Their positive attitudes suggest that they will likely recommend or provide the vaccine to their patients.
