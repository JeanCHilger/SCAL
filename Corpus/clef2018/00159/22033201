Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in women in the province of Asti (Italy). The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of HPV infection in women in the general population and identify associated risk factors. Five hundred women participating in a cervical cancer screening program were included in the study which was performed in Asti between April 2005 and October 2005. The prevalence of HPV infection was 10.6%. The most common genotypes were types 18, 16, 51 and 31. Cigarette smoke and oral contraceptive use were found to be significantly associated with infection.
