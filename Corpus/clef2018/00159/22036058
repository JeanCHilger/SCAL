Regional variation in histopathology-specific incidence of invasive cervical cancer among Peruvian women. To evaluate patterns of cervical cancer incidence in Peru by examining variation in 2 common histopathologic types, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC), and analyzing trends over time.Data on the incidence of invasive cervical cancer between 1984 and 2006 were obtained from 3 population-based cancer registries in Peru: Lima, Trujillo, and Arequipa. For each registry, data quality assessment was performed, crude and age-specific incidence was calculated, and time trends were analyzed.Overall and SCC incidence varied across registries but incidence of ADC did not. Overall and SCC incidence showed significant declines in Trujillo (P<0.05) and modest declines in Lima (P>0.05) over time. ADC incidence showed marginally significant increases among women aged 15-29 years in Trujillo (P=0.10) and modest increases among young women in Lima (P>0.05).Population-based cancer registries were an efficient source of data for evaluating the incidence of cervical cancer once data quality had been established. Geographic and temporal variations in cervical cancer burden were documented in Peru. The trends suggest that cervical ADC is increasing among young women in urban Peru, particularly in Trujillo. We recommend supplementing current Papanicolaou test screening with complementary methods of cervical cancer control, including human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and HPV DNA testing.
