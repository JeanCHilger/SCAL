Human papillomavirus subtypes in oral lesions compared to healthy oral mucosa. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are involved in the etiology of cervix cancer, but it is still unclear whether they play a role in related oral lesions.The presence of HPV in oral leukoplakia biopsies (n=50) and oral squamous carcinoma biopsies (n=50) was compared to normal oral mucosa swabs (n=50) for the purpose of indicating a possible etiological role for the virus.DNA was extracted from tissue biopsies and from mucosa swabs of control samples. Nested PCR was performed with primers targeting conserved sequences within the capsid gene L1. PCR products were sequenced to identify the HPV genotype.The results reveal a profile of low-risk HPV genotypes in oral leukoplakia similar to that in healthy controls, while HPV was less frequently observed in oral squamous carcinoma.HPV does not seem to represent an important causal factor for the development of oral leukoplakia or oral squamous carcinoma.
