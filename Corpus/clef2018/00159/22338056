Correlation of histopathologic/cytologic follow-up findings with vaginal ASC-US and ASC-H Papanicolaou test and HPV test results. Current American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommendations about human papillomavirus (HPV) triage and further management for atypical squamous cells are pertinent to cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. There are limited data on HPV detection in vaginal liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens. The aims of this study were to determine whether adjunctive high-risk (HR)-HPV testing is useful for disease risk assessment in women with vaginal atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) Pap results. We identified 1,125 ASC-US and 36 ASC-H vaginal Pap results with HR-HPV testing. Of the cases, 244 (21.7%) ASC-US and 21 (58%) ASC-H were HR-HPV+. Among ASC-US HR-HPV+ cases, 47.8% had a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) compared with 4.7% of HR-HPV- cases. Among ASC-H HR-HPV+ cases, 75% (12/16) had SIL compared with 31% (4/13) in HR-HPV- cases. Our results indicate that HPV triage testing is a reasonable and cost-effective approach for women with ASC-US vaginal Pap results and also a useful option for women with ASC-H vaginal Pap results.
