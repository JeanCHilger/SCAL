Obstetric and neonatal outcome after surgical treatment of cervical dysplasia. Conization is the gold standard today for the management of severe cervical dysplasia. However, with the increasing delay until first pregnancy, obstetric follow-up of patients with a history of conization is a growing concern.Retrospective case-control study using data from the electronic database of a university hospital. We compared the obstetric and neonatal outcome of 106 pregnancies delivered after conization with the outcome of 212 pregnancies of patients with no history of conization.A significant reduction in the mean gestational age at delivery (38.23 ± 2.51 weeks vs. 39.15 ± 1.56 weeks) was observed, together with a higher rate of premature rupture of the membrane (9.4% vs. 1.9%), premature onset of labor (9.4% vs. 2.4%), premature delivery (17% vs. 3.8%) and neonatal hospitalization (17.9% vs. 6.6%) in the group of patients with history of conization. Children born to women who had surgery had a significantly lower birth weight (3146.9 ± 611 g vs. 3347.3 ± 502 g) and size (49.1 ± 2.6 cm vs. 50.0 cm ± 2.2 cm) than those of the control group. Furthermore, these children were more frequently admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (22.6% vs. 10.4%, p=0.004).Conization is an important risk factor for premature birth and women with a history of conization require cautious obstetric management during pregnancy. Anti-HPV vaccination and proactive surveillance of low-grade or moderate dysplasia, instead of immediate surgery, should be encouraged in young patients.
