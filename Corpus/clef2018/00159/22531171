Detection of human papillomavirus in small cell carcinomas of the anus and rectum. Small cell carcinomas represent <1% of colorectal/anal carcinomas and have a poor prognosis. Anorectal squamous cell carcinomas are often associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, similar to squamous and small cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. In HPV infection, the oncoprotein E7 inactivates the tumor suppressor Rb, leading to p16 upregulation however, in small cell carcinomas, the Rb pathway is often blocked by other mechanisms
