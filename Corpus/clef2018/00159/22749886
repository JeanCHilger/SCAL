Local cytokine profiles of patients with cervical intraepithelial and invasive neoplasia. Several studies have suggested that patients with cervical intraepithelial and invasive neoplasia have reduced levels of Th1 cytokines, and increased levels of Th2 cytokines. Thus, the aim of this study was to delineate the immunological profile associated with lesion progression. Biopsies were obtained from 28 patients with low grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), 53 patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), 25 patients with invasive cancer (CA), and 20 healthy controls. Levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were then assayed by RT-PCR and ELISA for each biopsy sample. For LSILs, higher levels of Th1 cytokines were detected, while HSILs were associated with a Th2 cytokine profile. In contrast, CA tissues were associated with the strongest expression of a Treg cytokine profile. In conclusion the most important contribution of these work is identification of the Treg cytokine profile in HPV progression lesions and in combination, these results suggested that tumor progression is dependent on suppression of cellular immunity.
