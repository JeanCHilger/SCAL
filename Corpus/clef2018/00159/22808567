An assessment of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour regarding the human papillomavirus. This report is based on a study conducted in February 2010 that assessed the knowledge and attitudes toward cervical cancer and human papillomavirus (HPV) in Grenada which has a high incidence of cervical cancer.The participants were 71 students at the St George's University. There were 58 females and 13 males who participated in the study, a ratio of 4.5:1. Participants were asked to complete a survey on their knowledge and attitudes about HPV cervical cancer and the associated risk factors. Other evaluations of their levels of risk and Pap smear practices were also assessed.The data reflected low knowledge and infrequent screening practices, from a public health perspective, when compared with developed countries. The data showed a significant deficit in knowledge of both males and females. Almost 95% of the women surveyed were able to correctly identify the purpose of a Pap smear as compared to 69.2% of the men surveyed. When the participants were asked what was the cause of cervical cancer 63.8% of women and 53.8% of males were correctly able to identify the HPV.Enhanced educational programmes are needed to reduce the burden of cervical cancer that exists in Grenada.
