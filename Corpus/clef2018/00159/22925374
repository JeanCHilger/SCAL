A prospective study of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to resolve uncertainty in colposcopy. UK colposcopy services are seeing increased workloads, a large proportion of which are follow-up appointments. The English Cervical Screening Programme HPV Special Interest Group identified five subcategories of colposcopy clinic patients who often require prolonged follow-up regimes for low-grade abnormalities. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has a high negative predictive value, meaning that HPV-negative women are at very low risk of underlying disease. Our objectives were to quantify the number of HPV-negative women in each study subcategory and to evaluate the number who could potentially be discharged from colposcopy on the basis of their results.Four colposcopy clinics prospectively identified women according to five categories over 12 months. All women underwent cytological testing and high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing using the Hybrid Capture 2 test. Management outcomes and decisions based on a knowledge of the HPV status were recorded.Data available on 755 women showed that 422/755 (55.9%) and 260/755 (34.4%) had persistent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) (Category 1) or a minor abnormality following treatment (Category 2), respectively. In Categories 1 and 2, 51.7% and 60.2%, respectively, were hrHPV negative. The rates with biopsies of CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) across the two categories were 3/355 (0.8%) and 21/291 (7.0%) for hrHPV-negative and hrHPV-positive women, respectively.The incorporation of hrHPV testing within organized cervical screening programmes has been widely accepted. hrHPV testing for the clinical scenarios outlined in this study detects women who are hrHPV negative and therefore at low risk of underlying disease, potentially reducing anxiety and inconvenience for women and costs to colposcopy services.
