The mRNA-HPV test utilization in the follow up of HPV related cervical lesions. The biomolecular follow up of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is widely investigated in patients treated for HPV related cervical lesions, since the HPV-mRNA test is more specific and have a higher positive predictive value for CIN2-3 in triage of high risk (HR) women and in follow-up of women treated for CIN2/3.We investigated, during a 5 years' study, a cohort of patients divided in: group 1, patients at high risk for HPV-infections, and group 2, women diagnosed for CIN2/3, Cervicocarcinoma in situ (CIS) and Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and surgically treated. The overall scheduled follow up was repeated each 6 months by: Pap Test, HPV-DNA test, m-RNA-HPV test and, in case of CIN2/3, CIS and AIS, also by colposcopy and biopsy.The follow up involved a total of 203 women: 85 women with mRNA-HPV positive test and 118 patients surgically treated for CIN2/3, CIS and AIS. In the group 1, the long term follow up detected, after one year, 32 positive mRNA-HR HPV women and, of these, after more than 2 years, 37.5% developed CIN1 and 21.8% developed CIN2/3. Similarly, in the follow up of group two, women with abnormal Pap test showed positivity of mRNA HR-HPV in 71.4% of cases even after 6 months 65% of these developed a CIN1 within 2.5 years and 20% had CIN2/3 after 2.3 years.Study results indicate either that patients with mRNA HR-HPV positive controls, on average, after 12 months are all at risk of progression to CIN1 and CIN2/3, or the higher specificity of mRNA-HPV test than Pap Test in follow up of surgical treated patients. This investigation confirmed a strong association between HR mRNA-HPV presence and risk of neoplastic progression.
