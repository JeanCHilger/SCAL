Cervical cancer: a missed health priority in Tanzania. Cervical cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the cervix uteri. It is the second commonest cancer in women worldwide and is among the largest causes of global cancer mortality. Human papilloma virus (HPV) which is transmitted sexually, particularly subtypes 16 and 18 are responsible for causing majority of cervical cancer cases worldwide. The disease is one of the most preventable and curable carcinomas if detected and treated at an early enough stage. The effective prevention and control of the disease depends on, among others, the effective screening program coupled with knowledge and awareness of women population on the disease's risk factors and available screening services. Pap-test screening that is widely used in Western countries and proved to be effective in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer is not so popular in Tanzania, and so is HPV vaccine. This review examines the literatures on cervical cancer situation and explores various evidence-based cost-effective strategies and approaches that could be employed to confront the rising cervical cancer burden in the country.
