Crosssectional survey of human papilloma virus subtype distribution and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in Shenzhen. To investigate the prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and pathogenecity of  the HPV subtyping and virus loads in Shenzhen district.In the study, 10 000 sexually active women from Shenzhen city and rural areas around  were screened for cervical cancer, and all the cases were examined with cytology tests and several kinds of high risk HPV (HR-HPV) tests. Those with  cytology ≥atypical squamous cells of undetermined sign (ASC-US) or positive HPV results underwent colposcopy with biopsy for a pathological  diagnosis.The average age of this study population was 38.9 years. The total prevalence of HPV infection was 16.6%, with age-specific  prevalence increasing with age. The morbidity rate of the low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN1 was 17.0%, but that with those aged ≥55 years  showed a sharp drop. The morbidity rate of the high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN2/3 was 2.6%, and was higher in the 45 to 59 years age  group than in the 25 to 44 years age group. HR-HPV infection was an obvious relevant factor of CIN1 and CIN2/3, and the OR values increased as the  virus loads increased, but they had different relevant HPV subtypes. We found that HPV-16, -58, -31, -33, -18 were the first five ones for CIN2/3 while  HPV-39, -58, -59, -52, -66 for CIN1.There is a high level of HPV infection and CIN in Shenzhen district. The prevalence of HPV  infection has a trend to increase with age, and the people aged 45 years and more are key objects for CIN2/3 screening, with the virus load and subtyping  of HR-HPV infection as indicative factors.
