Comparison of single-, double- and triple-combined testing, including Pap test, HPV DNA test and cervicography, as screening methods for the detection of uterine cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a serious disease that threatens the health of women worldwide. This study compared the sensitivities and false-positive rates of cervical cytology (Pap smear), human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA test, cervicography, first double-combined testing (cervical cytology and HPV DNA test), second double-combined testing (cervical cytology and cervicography) and triple-combined testing (cervical cytology, HPV DNA test and cervicography). The study included 261 patients screened for uterine cervical cancer. All women simultaneously underwent cervical cytology, HPV DNA test and cervicography for uterine cervical cancer screening and colposcopically directed biopsy for diagnostic evaluation. The triple-combined testing was consistently the most sensitive among the cervical screening tests. The second double-combined testing, with a sensitivity rate of 98.1% was more sensitive than the first double-combined test (92.3%). However, cervical cytology was most specific (93.5%) and showed the highest positive predictive value (77.8%). The sensitivity of cervical cytology was markedly improved in combination with HPV DNA test and cervicography. Thus, the triple-combined testing, which improves the high false negativity of cervical cytology, may be an effective tool in uterine cervical cancer screening, pending confirmation of the effectiveness in a mass screening study.
