Management of abnormal cervical cytology screening in adolescent and young women in a canadian colposcopy centre: a descriptive analysis. To describe and analyze the management of young women referred for colposcopy at a Canadian comprehensive cancer centre for evaluation of atypical squamous intraepithelial lesion of unknown significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL).We conducted a retrospective descriptive study by searching the eCancerCare Colposcopy Database at our centre for 15- to 29-year-old females with referral cytology of ASC-US and LSIL who were seen between January 2000 and January 2009. Women in three age cohorts (15 to 19 years, 20 to 24 years, and 25 to 29 years) were reviewed for risk factors and relevant medical history, cytology and histology results, treatment, and follow-up visits.A total of 407 women met the entry criteria, with 36 women in the group aged 15 to 19, 173 in the group aged 20 to 24, and 198 in the group aged 25 to 29. Ten excisional procedures were performed among the 36 participants in the group aged 15 to 19, with normal histology found in two (20%), low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in four (40%), and high-grade CIN in four (40%). An excisional procedure was performed in 52 of 173 participants in the group aged 20 to 24, with normal histology in 15%, low-grade CIN in 37%, and high-grade CIN in 48%. Among the group aged 25 to 29, 74 of 198 participants had an excisional procedure, with normal histology in 12%, low-grade CIN in 27%, high-grade CIN in 59%, and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma in one woman (1%).Many women under the age of 25 who were referred with low-grade abnormal cervical cytology underwent treatment(s) and many did not have significant pathology. One case of microinvasive cervical cancer was identified in a patient in the group aged 25 to 29 over the nine years of our study. Our results support the safety of developing a more conservative and coordinated approach to cervical cancer screening in adolescent and young women in Canada.
