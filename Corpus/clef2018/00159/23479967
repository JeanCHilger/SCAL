The optimal screening of cervix cancer: combination of polymerase chain reaction technique in real time (Cobas 4800 device) with liquid cytology. The study was organized to assess the sensitivity of combined technique of diagnostics of pre-cancer and cervix cancer consisted of liquid cytology and detection of clinically significant amount of Human Papillomavirus DNA in cervical samples of cervix. The cervical samples of 62 women were collected to into medium for liquid cytology and Papanikolau's stained in the system B&D TriPath. The results were evaluated according the Bethesda classification. Concurrently with the same material, the polymerase chain reaction technique in real time was applied using the Cobas 4800 device. To specify the cytological diagnosis ASC-US and under L-SIL and H-SIL the immunocitochemical detection of oncomarkers p16INK4a and Ki-67 was implemented using additionally prepared glass of the same material obtained by the liquid cytology technique. The study detected Human Papillomavirus DNA of oncogenic types in 12 cases out of 13 H-SIL (92.3%) < and in 3 cases out of 4 L-SIL (75%). In 31 female patients with ASC-US no clinically significant amount of Human Papillomavirus DNA was detected. This result correlated with the results of immunocitochemical analyses where expression of marker p16INK4a was not present. In 5 out of 9 female patients (55.6%.) aged 21-24 years with cytological diagnosis NILM Human Papillomavirus DNA was detected. The cytological analysis detected in 53 out of 63 female patients the atypical cells of cervix pavement epithelium (85.5%). The combined technique detected pathology in 58 female patients (93.5%). The cytological analysis of Human Papillomavirus was complemented by testing with Cobas 4800 device because this system permits to detect 14 highly oncogenic types of Human Papillomavirus with separate genetic typing of Human Papillomavirus of 16 and 18 types.
