An update review on HPV testing methods for cervical neoplasia. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has a strong causal relationship with cervical cancer. Previous prevention strategies were based on cytology and colposcopy, and were limited by their low sensitivity. METHODS for HPV DNA or RNA detection have been developed that are expected to improve cervical cancer screening protocols.The aim of this paper was to review the HPV testing methods that are used and their clinical applications.A MEDLINE search was performed and the references of the retrieved articles were hand-searched for any missed studies.The main HPV testing methods that have well-defined clinical applications at present are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Hybrid Capture II. Real-time PCR and mRNA testing are techniques of growing interest. The main clinical applications are in the triage of borderline Pap smears and in the follow-up after treatment for cervical pre-malignant lesions. Other applications such as use in primary screening are under consideration.
