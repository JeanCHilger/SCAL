Immunostaining of p16(INK4a)/Ki-67 and L1 capsid protein on liquid-based cytology specimens obtained from ASC-H and LSIL-H cases. Atypical squamous cell cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) and low-grade intraepithelial lesion cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL-H) are ambiguous diagnostic entities for the prediction of high-grade cervical lesion. Objective and reproducible tests for predicting high-grade cervical lesions are needed to reduce unnecessary colposcopic referrals or follow-ups.We aimed to identify an adequate set of adjunctive markers to predict cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) in residual liquid-based cytology specimens (LBCS).We conducted p16 (INK4a)/Ki-67 and L1 capsid protein immunostaining and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA typing on 56 LBCS diagnosed with ASC-H or LSIL-H, all of which were subjected to histologic confirmation or follow-up cytologic examination.Positivity for p16 (INK4a)/Ki-67 was associated with a histology of CIN2+ (P=0.047) and CIN3+ (P=0.002). Negativity for L1 capsid protein was associated with CIN2+ confirmed at follow-up (P=0.02).Positivity for high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) was associated with CIN2+ confirmed at follow-up (P=0.036) and a histology of CIN2+ (P=0.037). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for predicting follow-up CIN2+ were 76.2%, 51.4%, 48.5%, and 78.3%, respectively, for p16 (INK4a)/Ki-67 immunostaining 95.2%, 34.3%, 46.5%, and 92.3%, respectively, for L1 capsid proteinp16(INK4a)/Ki-67 and L1 capsid protein immunostaining and HR-HPV testing of residual LBCS diagnosed with ASC-H or LSIL-H are useful objective biomarkers for predicting CIN2+. Immunostaining for p16(INK4a)/Ki-67 and L1 capsid protein are sufficient to predict CIN3+.
