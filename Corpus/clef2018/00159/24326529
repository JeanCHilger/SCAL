Evaluation of stationary colposcope and the Gynocular, by the Swede score systematic colposcopic system in VIA positive women: a crossover randomized trial. This study aimed to evaluate cervical lesions by the Swede coloscopy system, histologic finding, liquid-based cytology, and human papillomavirus (HPV) in women who resulted positive for visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) by using a pocket-sized battery-driven colposcope, the Gynocular (Gynius AB, Sweden).This study was a crossover, randomized clinical trial at the colposcopy clinic of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with 540 VIA-positive women. Swede scores were obtained by the Gynocular and stationary colposcope, as well as samples for liquid-based cytology, HPV, and cervical biopsies. The Swede scores were compared against the histologic diagnosis and used as criterion standard. The percentage agreement and the κ statistic for the Gynocular and standard colposcope were also calculated.The Gynocular and stationary colposcope showed high agreement in Swede scores with a κ statistic of 0.998, P value of less than 0.0001, and no difference in detecting cervical lesions in biopsy. Biopsy detected cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ (CIN2, CIN3, and invasive cancer) in 38 (7%) of the women, whereas liquid-based cytology detected CIN2+ in 13 (2.5%) of the women. Forty-four (8.6%) women who were tested resulted positive for HPV 20 (3.9%) women had HPV-16, 2 (0.4%) had HPV-18, and 22 (4.3%) had other high-risk HPV.Our study showed that few VIA-positive women had CIN2+ lesions or HPV infection. Colposcopy by Swede score identified significantly more CIN2+ lesions than liquid-based cytology and could offer a more accurate screening and selection for immediate treatment of cervical lesions in low-resource settings.
