Comparison of serum and tissue levels of trace elements in different models of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death by cancer among women worldwide. It is necessary to develop and refine cervical cancer models to more accurately reflect human tumor type. The relevance of cervical cancer to trace element was studied in this paper. By means of quantitative trace element analysis in models and patients with cervical cancer, the tissue and serum levels of trace elements in papillomaviruses-induced cancer models were more similar to that of patients than the levels in models induced by HeLa cell and methylcholanthrene. The results reflect papillomaviruses model most accurately mimic in vivo carcinogenesis of patients with cervical cancer. It will have a superior predictive value over HeLa cell and methylcholanthrene models in pre-clinical trials. The papillomaviruses-induced cervical cancer can provide more reliable models for testing the efficacy of drugs in treating human cancers.
