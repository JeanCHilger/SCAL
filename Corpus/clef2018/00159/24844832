Analysis of human papillomavirus infection and typing in Shanxi province. To investigate human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and typing in 7 640 cases of women in Shanxi province in order to provide theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of the cervical cancer.Totally, 7 640 cases of cervical cell specimens in Shanxi provincial tumor hospital, screening and physical examination from 2012 January to 2013 May and 23 HPV genotypes were analyzed by PCR and reverse dot blot gene chip technology.A total of 1 441 cases of patients with HPV infection were to be found in 7 640 cases of women with an average age of (42.26 ± 19.15)years old. The total infection positive rate, infection rate of high-risk HPV, infection rate of low-risk HPV and infection rate of mixed high and low risk were 18.86% (1 441/7 640), 16.03% (1 225/7 640, including multiple high-risk of HPV infection), 4.88% (373/7 640, including multiple low-risk of HPV infection) and 2.05% (157/7 640) respectively. The rate of high-risk HPV infection was 85.01% (1 225/1 441) in total infection positive women. The most common subtype was HPV16 (34.70%, 523/1 507) and followed by HPV58 (11.48%, 173/1 507), HPV18 (7.43%, 112/1 507), HPV33 (7.10%, 107/1 507), HPV56 (6.04%, 91/1 507) and HPV52 (5.51%, 83/1 507) respectively in tested 18 high-risk HPV subtypes, and there was no HPV82. The most common subtype was HPV43 (38.13%, 151/396) and followed by HPV42 (22.22%, 88/396), HPV81 (20.45%, 81/396), HPV6 (11.87%, 47/396) and HPV11 (7.32%, 29/396) respectively in tested 5 low-risk HPV subtypes. The HPV infection positive rates were significantly different in different age groups and HPV total infection rate, high-risk infection rate in 41-50 year-old age group was the highest, 23.23%. The infection rates of single subtype of HPV and single high-risk subtype of HPV were 75.71% (1 091/1 441) and 61.35% (884/1 441) respectively in all cases of infection women and single high-risk subtype infection rate was 81.03% (884/1 091) in all cases of single subtype infection women. The infection rate of multiple subtype of HPV was 24.29% (350/1 441) in all cases with HPV infection. The double infections was most common (18.18%, 262/1 441) in which the women of double high-risk infections of HPV were 151 cases (10.48%, 151/1 441). The rates of double infection, triple infection and quadruple or more infection of HPV were 74.86% (262/350), 20.29% (71/350) and 4.89% (17/350) respectively in all cases with HPV multiple infection. The positive rates of HPV infection in different age groups were obvious difference. The positive rate of single infection of HPV was 17.80% (574/3 224) in cases of 41-50 years old group which higher than that in other groups(χ² = 20.18, P < 0.05).The more common high-risk HPV subtype is HPV16, HPV58, HPV18, HPV33, HPV56 and HPV52 and low-risk HPV subtype is HPV43, HPV42 in Shanxi province. HPV infection is most common in the age group of 41- 50 years old female.
