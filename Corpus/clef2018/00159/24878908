Cancer of cervix in Chile. Too much vaccine amid a neglected Papanicolau. The Chilean Ministry of Health announced the incorporation of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervix uterine cancer (CUC) into the national immunization program during year 2014 This decision was adopted despite of two opposing documents and a significant decrease in cervical cancer associated mortality due to cytological cervical screening. The burden of disease attributed to CUC has declined in Chile and current cost-effectiveness studies should be reviewed considering this decreasing trend, the progressive decrease in coverage rates observed during the past years, the potential need for aditional doses and lower vaccine costs if vaccine is acquired through the PAHO revolving fund. Moreover, serious adverse events associated with these vaccines, which in some countries are more frequent than CUC associated mortality, have not been thoroughly evaluated and are probably underreported. The decision to incorporate the vaccine occurs in a context of progressive weakening of the national cervical screening program leading to a reduced population coverage. This situation jepeordizes the achievements already obtained and poses a challenge to vaccine introduction considering that not all the high-risk viral subtypes are included and thus the risk for CUC does not disappear making cervical screening a vital component of the program that needs to be maintained. This governmental resolution requires a more solid scientific foundation and should not be implemented without resolving current cervical screening shortcomings.
