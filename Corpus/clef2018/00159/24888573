Human papillomavirus testing in young women: clinical outcomes of human papillomavirus triage in a UK cervical screening program. In the United Kingdom, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is used to triage women with borderline cytology or mild dyskaryosis however, in young women, the value of triage is limited by the high HPV prevalence rate. The current study examined the impact of HPV triage on colposcopy referral, colposcopy procedures, and patient outcome in a cervical screening population that included women aged < 25 years.Women aged 18 to 65 years attending for cervical screening in Northern Ireland were tested for HPV if their cytology result demonstrated borderline cytology or mild dyskaryosis. Of the 866 women eligible for HPV triage, those who tested negative for HPV were returned to routine screening and women who tested positive were referred to colposcopy.HPV prevalence was 82.07% in women aged < 25 years and 54.69% in women aged ≥ 25 years. Colposcopy referrals increased by 42.67%. The odds of undergoing a large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) compared with punch biopsy increased by 0.056 per year above the age of 31 years. LLETZ performed in women aged ≥ 25 years and those aged < 25 years yielded rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of type 2 or higher (≥ CIN2) of 57.04% and 80.00%, respectively. The positive predictive value of HPV triage for detecting ≥ CIN2 was 29.92% in women aged < 25 years and 27.51% in the older age group.HPV triage substantially increased colposcopy referrals. The positive predictive value of a positive HPV test to detect ≥ CIN2 was not affected by age. LLETZ performed in women aged < 25 years yielded higher rates of ≥ CIN2 compared with the older age group.
