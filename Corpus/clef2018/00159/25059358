Distribution of serum antibodies against human papillomavirus 16 and 18 among high-risk women to cervical cancer. To explore the distribution of serum antibodies against human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 among women at high-risk for cervical cancer.All women when tested positive for anyone of the cervical cancer screening programs, from Xinmi county of Henan province in 2011, were recruited as the subjects of this study. Cervical exfoliated cells were collected, using cervical brush for HPV DNA testing, and 10 ml venous blood was drawn for HPV-16, 18 serum antibodies testing, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Among the 952 women under study, 230 cases (24.2%)showed HPV DNA positive, with positivity rates of HPV16 and 18 L1 virus-like particle (VLP)antibodies as 23.2% and 6.5%, respectively. The overall positivity rate of any type of HPV16, 18 VLP antibodies was 26.8% . Geometric means of HPV16, 18 VLP antibody titers were 79.1 (Yangshengtang Unit,YU/ml) and 125.0(YU/ml). Positivity rate of HPV16 antibody was significantly associated with age, viral load of HPV DNA, and cervical lesion severity (P < 0.05). Seropositivity of HPV18 was also increasing with the increase of viral load (P < 0.01) with different cervical lesion significantly showing different titer of HPV18 antibody (P < 0.01). Based on the results of HPV DNA detection among the two years of study, women with HPV persistent infection showed significant higher positive rate of HPV16/18 antibodies than women who did not have HPV infection or emerging infection (P < 0.001). When comparing to those women without HPV infection, the ones with transient infection showed higher seropositivity rates on both HPV16 antibodies and titer of HPV16 antibody (P < 0.001).Seroprevalence rates on HPV16 and 18 among the unvaccinated high-risk women in Henan were high. Prevalence of both HPV16 and 18 antibodies were correlated with age, viral load, cervical lesion and history of infection.Women with high viral load, high grade cervical lesion or history of infection would more likely to be seropositive.
