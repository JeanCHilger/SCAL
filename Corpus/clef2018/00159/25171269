Human papillomavirus viral load on careHPV testing of self-collected vaginal samples vs. clinician-collected cervical samples. To compare viral load on careHPV DNA testing in self-collected vaginal (VHPC) and clinician-collected cervical (CHPC) samples for the detection of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN).Cross-sectional study. Ever-married women aged 30-59 years were targeted for cervical screening. On attendance for screening, vaginal self-sampling was performed by the woman, and an auxiliary nurse midwife subsequently performed a per-speculum examination, collected a CHPV sample and a Pap smear, and made a visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid. The ratio of viral load expressed in relative light units to positive controls set at a cut-off of 1pg/ml was used for careHPV quantitative assessment. The median viral load was compared using non-parametric tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for the detection of CINII+ and CINIII+ in CHPV and VHPV samples.Overall, the median viral load in the 4658 women screened was higher in CHPV samples compared with VHPV samples (9.8-fold higher in cases of high-grade CIN). The median viral load was significantly higher among Pap-positive women compared with Pap-negative women in both CHPV and VHPV samples (p<0.01). Assessment by ROC analysis for the detection of high-grade CIN did not differ significantly between CHPV and VHPV samples.Viral load on careHPV testing was comparable between self- and clinician-collected samples for the detection of high-grade CIN. The self-sampling approach may be an option for screening in low-resource countries.
