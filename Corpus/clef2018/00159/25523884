Human papillomavirus prevalence and type-distribution among women in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China: a cross-sectional study. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main etiological factor for cervical cancer and premalignant lesions of the cervix. The purposes of the present study were to determine the prevalence of type-specific HPV infections and the association of different HPV types with cervical dysplasia among women in Zhejiang province, Southeast China.A total of 15,267 women presenting to a gynaecological outpatient clinic were enrolled in this study. Women were screened for HPV in addition to routine cervical cytology testing. Microarray hybridization and liquid-based cytology tests were used to detect HPV genotypes and cervical cytology, respectively.Based on the population attending a gynaecological outpatient clinic, overall prevalence of any 23 HPV type was 22.8% and multiple HPV infection was found in 4.0% of all the outpatients. HPV prevalence showed bimodal age distribution, with a peak (55.7%) at the ≤20 age group and a second one (35.5%) at >60 age group. In total samples, the five most frequent types were HPV 16 (4.4%), 58 (2.9%), 52 (2.7%), 33 (2.2%) and 11 (1.9%). Overall HPV prevalence increased with the severity of the cytologic result. Analysis through crude odds ratios (ORs) revealed that the cervical lesion risk of HPV-infected women increased to about 26-fold of uninfected women (OR 26.1, 95% CI 22.4 to 30.3). The five most risky HPV types associated with abnormal cytology were HPV 73, 16, 82, 45 and 51.This study provided baseline data on HPV prevalence in women attending a gynecological outpatient clinic in Zhejiang province. Our data will supply guidance for the primary screening and vaccination program for cervical cancer in this area.
