Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection in Guangdong Province, China: a population-based survey of 78,355 women. The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the distribution of different HPV genotypes vary greatly within different geographical and ethnic populations, especially in Asia. The HPV infection data based on regional population are extremely important for researchers to develop new efficient HPV screening assays and estimate the effect of vaccines on preventing from cervical cancer.A total of 78,355 women from Guangdong Province, China, whose ages were from 18 to 75 years were enrolled in this study. All epidemiological data were obtained by face-to-face interview. Cervical exfoliated cells were collected, and HPV-DNA test was conducted with the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry.The overall HPV infection prevalence in the study population was 7.3%. The top 6 HPV genotypes were HPV16 (1.5%), HPV52 (1.2%), HPV58 (1.0%), HPV18 (0.7%), HPV45 (0.5%), and HPV6 (0.5%), accounting for 69.7% of all detected HPV infection types. Two peaks of HPV infection were detected in the population of old age group (>50 9.6%) and young group (<25This study provides useful epidemiological information on cervical HPV infection prevalence in general female population from Guangdong Province, China. In this population, HPV infection prevalence was 7.3%, and genotypes HPV16, HPV52, and HPV58 showed a relatively high prevalence.
