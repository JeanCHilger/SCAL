Comparison of detection sensitivity for human papillomavirus between self-collected vaginal swabs and physician-collected cervical swabs by electrochemical DNA chip. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is an effective method to screen for precancerous changes in the cervix. Samples from self-collection rather than Pap smear can potentially be used to test for HPV as they are more acceptable and preferred for use in certain settings. The objective of this study was to compare HPV DNA testing from self-collected vaginal swabs and physician-collected cervical swabs.A total of 101 self-collected vaginal and physician-collected cervical swabs of known cytology from Thai women were tested by electrochemical DNA chip assay. The specimens were divided into 4 groups: 29 with normal cytology, 14 with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 48 with low- grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and 10 with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).Positive detection rates of HPV from self-collected swabs were similar to those from physician-collected swabs. Among specimens with abnormal cytology, HPV was found in 50% of self-collected swabs and 47.2% of physician-collected swabs. In specimens with normal cytology, 17.2% of self-collected swabs and 24.1% of physician-collected swabs were positive for HPV. Concordance was relatively high between results from self- collected and physician-collected samples. The most common HPV genotype detected was HPV 51.HPV DNA testing using self-collected swabs is a feasible alternative to encourage and increase screening for cervical cancer in a population who might otherwise avoid this important preventive examination due to embarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety.
