Study of integrated state of HPV-16 infection in cervical cancer and precancerous tissues. To investigate the prevalence of physical state of HPV-16 DNA in cervical cancer and cervical precancerous carcinoma.Multiplex PCR was adopted to detect the physical state of HPV in samples from 252 patients with cervical carcinoma, including 48 samples of cervical cancer, 204 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN ) (125 CIN I, 46 CIN II and 33 CIN III) and 20 normal samples from the subjects with hysteromyoma undergoing hysterectomy, respectively.Among 48 patients with cervical cancer, 31 (65.6%) were infected with HPV-16. Eighteen among 31 (58.1%) HPV-16 infected patients with cervical cancer were found to have integrated infection of HPV-16. The positive rates of HPV-16 infection in the patients with CIN I, CIN II and CIN III were 19.2%, 34.8% and 42.4%, and the integrated infection rates of HPV-16 were 16.7%, 18.8% and 35.7%, respectively. Compared with patients with different grades of CIN, the integrated rate of HPV-16 infection in those with cervical cancer was significantly elevated.Among the patients with HPV-16 infection, the integrated state of HPV-16 is positively correlated with the severity of cervical lesions. Combined HPV typing test and detection of integrated viral state contribute to predicting the prognosis of patients with cervical precancerous lesions and increasing the accuracy of screening cervical cancer on the basis of HPV DNA detection.
