Pap Smear Combined with HPV Testing: A Reasonable Tool for Women with High-grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Treated by LEEP. To evaluate HPV testing by Hybrid Capture II (HCII) in conjunction with cytology in detecting the residual/recurrence disease after treatment of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II-III) with loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).A retrospective review of 158 patients with histologically confirmed CIN II-III who underwent LEEP between January 2011 and October 2012 was conducted. Post-treatment control was scheduled at the 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th month. All patients were followed up by Pap smear and HR-HPV genotype and viral load testing.Pre-treatment, HR-HPV DNA, was detected in all specimens of the patients. At follow-up, 25 patients were diagnosed as the residual/recurrent disease during the FU visit, among whom, 16 patients with positive margin: 13 patients (52%) with HR-HPV DNA+/cytology+, 2 patients (8%) with HR-HPV DNA+/cytology-, 1 patient (4%) with cytology+/ HR-HPV DNA- 9 patients with clean margin--5 patients (55.6%) with HR-HPV DNA+/cytology+(1) The persistence HR-HPV DNA is the root cause of the residual/recurrent disease for the women treated for high-grade CIN the pre-treatment viral load and margin can be seen as the predictor. (2) The FU visit beginning at the 6th month post-treatment and lasting at least 24 months with the combination of cytology and HPV testing. (3) Patients with high pre-treatment HPV load, which is considered as one risk of developing the residual/recurrent disease, should be paid more attention (especially above 500 RUL/PC) to by clinicians.
