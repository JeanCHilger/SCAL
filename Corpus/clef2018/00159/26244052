HPV infection and cervical neoplasia: associated risk factors. Behavioral risks such as age at first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners and partner's sexual behavior are associated with an increased risk of HPV infection, persistence of the infection and the development of neoplastic precursor lesions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with HPV positivity and with a diagnosis of cervical neoplasia in women referred with an abnormal cervical smear.This study evaluated a series of 198 women referred with an abnormal cervical smear. Risk factors for HPV infection were investigated using a questionnaire. All cervical specimens were tested for 27 HPV genotypes using the Roche polymerase chain reaction reverse line blot assay.The overall prevalence of HPV was 87 %. First sexual intercourse before 16 years of age was significantly associated with a positive HPV test (OR 4.41 95 %CI: 1.20 - 19.33The age at which a woman begins to be sexually active is associated with HPV infection and with a diagnosis of cervical neoplasia.
