Application of a Thulium Laser for Treatment of Cervical Neoplasias and Condylomas: A Feasibility Study. Evaluation of safety, feasibility, and possibilities of the thulium laser, Vela(®), with a wavelength of 1.9 μm for laser treatment of the portio, vagina, and/or vulva.Laser techniques have been used for many years in the gynecological setting for the treatment of cervical, vaginal, and vulval intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN, VAIN, VIN) and also for the treatment of condylomas. To date, the most commonly used laser for this treatment is the CO2 laser.After indication was made for laser treatment, the patients were treated using the thulium laser, Vela. Follow-up examination usually took place after 1-2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, when colposcopy and, where necessary, a cytological smear were performed.During the period from January 2012 to January 2014, 18 patients were treated using the thulium laser. Three patients had a CIN I, 12 had condylomas, two had CIN I and condylomas, and one had CIN II and condylomas. During the follow-up, 40% (n = 6) of patients had a relapse of condylomas. No relapse occurred in cases of CIN. Itching, burning, pain, bleeding, discharge, and skin irritation were listed as side effects of the procedure.This feasibility study shows that the use of the thulium laser for the treatment of cervical neoplasias and condylomas offers a good alternative to the standard treatment using a CO2 laser.
