DNA methylation and detection of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions using molecular methods. Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer disease affecting the female population, and a key factor in the development of the disease is the human papillomavirus infection (HPV). The disease is also impacted by epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, which causes activation or exclusion of certain genes. The aim of our review is to summarize and compare the most common molecular methods for detection of methylated promoter regions in biomarkers occurring in cervical carcinoma and also show the importance of connections of HR-HPV testing with methylation analysis in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Insight into genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with cervical cancer development can offer opportunities for the molecular biomarkers that can be useful for screening, diagnosis, and also as new ways of treatment of cervical cancer precursor lesions.
