Human papillomavirus type-specific persistence and reappearance after successful conization in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To assess the relationship between pre- and postoperative high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) genotypes and hrHPV type-specific persistence and reappearance of abnormal cytology after successful conization.A retrospective analysis was performed of 211 patients who were undergoing conization after hrHPV genotype testing at Tottori University Hospital between July 2009 and June 2013. Of the 211 women, 129 underwent pre- and postoperative hrHPV genotype testing and were diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades 1-3 with negative margins.The postoperative pathological diagnosis was CIN 1 in 8 patients, CIN 2 in 12, CIN 3 in 108 and adenocarcinoma in situ in 1 patient. Before conization, the most frequent hrHPV genotypes were HPV16 (n = 52 40.3 %), followed by HPV52 (n = 32Postoperative hrHPV infection was a significant positive predictor for the reappearance of abnormal cytology and HPV16 infection-induced HSIL after treatment. Therefore, our study suggests that hrHPV genotype testing may be useful to follow-up CIN patients.
