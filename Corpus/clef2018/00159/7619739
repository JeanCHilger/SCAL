Identification of antibodies against human papillomavirus type 16 E4 and E7 proteins in sera of patients with cervical neoplasias. Sera from 35 women (patients with various clinical diagnosis: cervical dysplasia, benign and malignant tumors of the uterine cervix) were tested by immunodot blot for the presence of antibodies to E4 and E7 HPV16 proteins. A number of 26 sera displayed positivities for at least one antibody type. The mean absorbance for anti-E antibody in positive cases was higher in cancer patients (15 from 16 sera) as compared with other diagnoses (2 from 5 in dysplasia or one from 4 in uterine fibroma). Interestingly, most sera were reactive for both proteins. The high prevalence rates and high absorbance values for HPV16 E7 antibodies in association with malignant transformation suggest that the detection of these antibodies may be a useful diagnostic aid for cervical cancer--associated HPV16.
