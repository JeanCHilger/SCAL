A possible prognostic role of immunoglobulin-G antibody against recombinant Epstein-Barr virus BZLF-1 transactivator protein ZEBRA in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Epstein-Barr virus BZLF-1 replication activator (ZEBRA) is involved in the switch from viral latency to a productive cycle. Previous immunofluorescent study has shown that patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have elevated immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibody titres against recombinant ZEBRA protein (ZEBRA/IgG).The prognostic role of ZEBRA/IgG was further investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 110 NPC patients under long period of clinical follow-up.Ninety-seven percent (85 of 88) of the patients with NPC had significantly higher ZEBRA/IgG titres (geometrical mean titre, i.e., GMT = 8397) than normal Chinese individuals (GMT = 233 and P < 0.0001). Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, the actuarial survival in patients with high ZEBRA/IgG titres (25%) after radiotherapy was significantly lower than that of those with low (76% P = 0.0008) or intermediate titres (62%The postradiotherapy ZEBRA/IgG titre could be a potentially useful marker for differentiating NPC patients with poor prognosis from those at high risk for the development of distant metastasis to the lung or liver.
