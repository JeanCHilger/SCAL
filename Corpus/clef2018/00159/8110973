Borderline nuclear abnormality in cervical smears: a cytological review of 200 cases with histological correlation. The cervical cytology and histology specimens from 200 patients referred to colposcopy with borderline nuclear abnormality were reviewed. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated changes were identified in 103 of 200 (53%) referral smears and in 139 of 150 (91%) biopsy specimens. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was less frequently diagnosed on review compared with the original histopathology reports (30.7% vs 45.4%) the discrepancy was largely attributable to a lower incidence of CINI. There was agreement in the grading of borderline nuclear abnormality in 161 of 200 referral smears following review. Twenty-three smears were upgraded to mild dyskaryosis, whereas 16 were reclassified as negative.
