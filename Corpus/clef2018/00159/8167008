Human papillomavirus infection in Norwegian women with cervical cancer. The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in Norwegian women with cervical cancer. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot techniques to assess the prevalence of HPV in cervical biopsies of 133 women admitted to the Norwegian Radium Hospital for treatment of cervical cancer. At the time of sampling (from February 1988 to April 1989) about 85% of Norwegian women with cervical cancer were treated at the Norwegian Radium Hospital. HPV was found in biopsies of 91 (68%) of women with cancer 70 (53%) biopsies contained HPV type 16, 19 (14%) HPV type 18, 4 (3%) HPV type 33, 2 (1.5%) HPV type 11, and 3 (2%) HPV DNA of unknown type (HPVX). Five percent of biopsies were doubly infected, chiefly with HPV 16 + 18. We found a significant association between HPV 18 and low age, poorly differentiated tumors and adenocarcinomas. Our results show that there is an association between HPV types 16 and 18 and cervical cancer also in a Norwegian setting. PCR was more sensitive than Southern blotting for detection of HPV. Thirty-six (27.5%) of cancer biopsies were positive by PCR but negative by Southern blotting, as against 49 (73.5%) positive by both methods
