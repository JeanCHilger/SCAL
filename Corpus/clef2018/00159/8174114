Interferon and retinoic acid suppress the growth of human papillomavirus type 16 immortalized cervical epithelial cells, but only interferon suppresses the level of the human papillomavirus transforming oncogenes. In the present study, we examine the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and interferons-alpha and -gamma (IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma) on the growth of HPV16-immortalized cell lines, ECE16-1 and CaSki. Treating proliferating ECE16-1 cells with RA causes a concentration-dependent decrease in cell number. At 1 microM RA, cell growth is suppressed by 65% and the level of mRNA encoding cytokeratin K5, a biochemical marker of retinoid action, is also suppressed. In contrast, the level of transcript encoding the HPV16 oncogenes, E6 and E7, is reduced by only 5 to 10%. IFN-alpha at 1000 IU/ml or IFN-gamma at 200 IU/ml suppresses growth by 70%. This growth suppression by IFN-gamma is correlated with a > 90% reduction in E6/E7 mRNA levels. Additional growth suppression is observed upon simultaneous treatment with retinoid and interferon. Optimal suppression is observed in the presence of 200 IU/ml IFN-gamma and 1 microM RA. The rank order of effectiveness is IFN-gamma/RA > IFN-alpha/RA = IFN-gamma > RA > IFN-alpha. In contrast to the suppression of ECE16-1 cell growth, RA causes a concentration-dependent increase in CaSki cell number (50-60%) which is optimal at 1 microM RA. Cytokeratin K5 mRNA levels are markedly suppressed, and E6/E7 mRNA levels increased by 5% under these conditions. IFN-alpha at 1000 IU/ml or IFN-gamma at 200 IU/ml decreases CaSki cell growth by 20 and 45%, respectively, and 200 IU/ml of IFN-gamma reduce E6/E7 expression to undetectable levels. Addition of RA (1 microM) partially counters the IFN-dependent suppression of growth and E6/E7 mRNA levels. Our results suggest that retinoid-dependent changes in human papillomavirus-immortalized cervical cell proliferation are not always correlated with changes in E6/E7 transcript levels.
