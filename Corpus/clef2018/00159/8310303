Preinvasive cervical neoplasia. The HPV has been identified as the causative agent for cervical neoplasia. The transforming mechanisms appear to be through inactivation of p105Rb or p53 by the oncoproteins E6 and E7 of HPV types 16 and 18. Because 2% to 24% of normal women test positive for these viral types and the incidence of neoplasia is less than 1%, co-factors must play an important part in carcinogenesis. A search for these co-factors is underway.
