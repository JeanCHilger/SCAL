Cervicography as an adjunct to cytologic screening. Cervicography is not a surrogate for colposcopy. Its easy availability and economy maximize the predictive potential of the existing screening test, the Pap smear. It can also be used as a triage tool for women "at risk" for cervical HPV infections, such as women with a history of vulvar condylomata. It is not colpophotography, as the magnification and focus are stable, and the operator cannot manipulate the position of the cervix and change focus and light settings. Cervicography cannot replace Pap smears in detection programs, but can augment the predictive value of screening when used in tandem. Stafl cautions gynecologic practitioners to use the two in partnership and that the duo can push cervical cancer detection rates closer to 100%. What Cervicography does provide is a screening tool with great potential and a way to attack the troubling death rates from cervical cancer still facing us in the 21st century.
