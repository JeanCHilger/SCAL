Absence of mutation in the p53 and the retinoblastoma susceptibility genes in primary cervical carcinomas. Previous biochemical and structural studies using established cell lines have led to a hypothesis that the cellular p53 and the retinoblastoma susceptibility (Rb) proteins may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis process of cervical carcinoma. To further test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the structure of the p53 and Rb genes in 38 primary cervical carcinoma samples with known HPV status using the polymerase chain reaction-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) approach. All 11 exons as well as 500 bp of the 5'-noncoding region of the p53 gene and exons 13-23 of the Rb gene were analyzed. None of these exons in all the samples analyzed showed band shift in the SSCP gel indicative of the presence of mutation. In the same experiments, however, all known exon mutations as well as previously unreported mutations in the intron sequences of the p53 and Rb genes in the HPV-free C33-A and HT-3 cell lines were detected. The absence of mutation in the p53 gene in all five HPV-negative samples was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. It appears that p53 and Rb mutations are a very rare event in cervical cancer and their occurrence is apparently not strictly correlated with HPV status.
