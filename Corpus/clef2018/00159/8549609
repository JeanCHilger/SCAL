Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and human papillomavirus related lesions of the genital tract in HIV positive and negative women. Two hundred and twenty one women at high risk for HIV (intravenous drug users and/or those with infected partners) were investigated, through a self-filled questionnaire and gynaecological examination, to define the relationship between genital Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infections, preneoplastic cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) and behavioural risk factors. In the 121 HIV positive women, 58 (47%) had HPV lesions at colposcopic and/or cytologic examination and, out of these 58, 23 (40%) had CIN 1, CIN 2 or CIN 3. Six out of the 16 cases with CIN 1 and CIN 2 (37%) followed-up showed a rapid progression of the lesion to CIN 3 in 3 women the interval was 6 months, in the other 3 about 12 months. Only 5 (7%) of the remaining 66 women without HPV lesions had a CIN lesion, with an obviously significant difference on comparison with HPV positive subjects. Sixty two women out of the 121 (52%) had a previous diagnosis of condylomata. In the 100 HIV negative women, 23 (23%) had HPV lesions and, among these 23, 6 (26%) had CIN 1, CIN 2 or CIN 3
