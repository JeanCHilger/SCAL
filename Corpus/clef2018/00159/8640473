Antibodies prevalence against HPV-6b and -16 recombinant fusion proteins in Korean patients with cervical neoplasia. This study was to investigate the adjunctive diagnostic utility of HPV fusion proteins from the sera in the patients with cervical neoplasia. Immunologic researches on host factors in HPV infection could contribute to better understanding of patho-physiologic mechanisms of cervical carcinogenesis, and provide valuable information for HPV vaccine development.Prevalence of antibodies against human papillomavirus (HPV) in sera of the patients with carcinoma (n = 81), precancers (n = 25) of uterine cervix and normal controls (n = 40) in Korean women were investigated by Western blot immunoassay using partially purified TrpE fusion recombinant proteins for HPV-6b and HPV-16.In 81 patients with cervical cancer, 15 (19%) and 54 (67%) patients were positive for antibodies to at least one of the tested recombinant proteins related to HPV-6b or HPV-16, respectively. And in 25 patients with HPV-related squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) of cervix, 10 were positive for at least one of the tested antibodies for HPV-6b gene products (40%) and 11 were positive for HPV-16 related antibodies (44%). The prevalence rates of antibodies for HPV-6b in the sera of SIL patients were significantly higher than those from the sera of cervical cancer patients (p < 0.05). There was an inverse correlation between increasing the positivity against HPV-16 E6 protein and progression of cervical lesions, but there was no significant correlation between the positivities of the other antibodies to HPV-16 and the severity of disease.These results suggest that the recombinant proteins related to HPV-6b and HPV-16 could be useful in evaluation of the patients with HPV-related cervical lesions and these might play an adjunctive role in diagnosis and management of cervical neoplasia.
