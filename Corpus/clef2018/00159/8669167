Polymerase chain reaction amplification of human papillomavirus DNA from archival, Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears. To test the applicability of four protocols in recovering DNA suitable for amplification with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in archival, Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears.The most efficient method was used to isolate DNA from 11 archival, Papanicolaou-stained smears with cytopathic changes due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to confirm the presence of HPV DNA.beta-Globin was successfully amplified in all smears, while HPV DNA was detected in 6 of 11. Four of the four HPV DNA-negative smears were classified as high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Failure to detect HPV DNA might have been due to the low copy number of HPV DNA or deletion of the L1 region.High cellularity and the method of recovering DNA from the smear are important determinants of successful amplification of HPV DNA in archival cervical smears.
