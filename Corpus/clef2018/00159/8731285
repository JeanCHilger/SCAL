Papillomavirus in cervicovaginal smears of women infected with human immunodeficiency virus. It has been described that women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) present more frequent cytological abnormalities in cervicovaginal smears, generally related to infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). The present work is a study of cervicovaginal smears of 147 HIV-seropositive women submitted to routine gynecological examinations. The smears were stained by the Papanicolaou method. Cytopathic effects of HPV were found in 38 (25.8%) cases. Nuclear atypias of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were evident in 36 (24.5%) of these cases: 27 (18.4%), CIN I 6 (4.0%), CIN II and 3 (2.0%) CIN III. Also 2 (1.4%) invasive carcinomas and one (0.7%) endocervical dysplasia were found. Other agents observed were: Candida sp, 19 (12.9%) cases, Gardnerella vaginalis, 19 (12.9%), Trichomonas vaginalis, 13 (8.4%), Chlamydia trachomatis 5 (3.4%), Mobiluncus sp 2 (1.4%) and Herpes simplex virus 1 (0.7%). This study emphasizes the high frequency of HPV/CIN cervicovaginal abnormalities in HIV-seropositive in our population. It is possible that immunological factors and sexual promiscuity are involved in this phenomenon.
