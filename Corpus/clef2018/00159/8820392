Incidence of HPV and CIN in HIV positive women. Cervical intraepithelial lesions associated with genital human papilloma virus (HPV) infection occur with increased frequency and severity among women with immunodeficiency. In this study, we considered 24 HIV-seropositive and 12 HIV-seronegative women. Each woman was interviewed and underwent a cytologic and colposcopic evaluation. Then colposcopic and cytologic findings were correlated with histologic and differences between HIV-seropositives and seronegatives were analyzed. Ten (41%) of 24 HIV-seropositive and one (9%) of 12 HIV-seronegative women had human papilloma virus infection. Among seropositives, eight (34%) had cervical intraepithelial (CIN): of those eight, 5 had CIN I, 2 CIN II and 1 CIN III. There (24%) of the 12 HIV-seronegative had CIN: two had CIN I and one CIN II. Six of the HIV-seropositive women were found to have multicentric disease (two or more sites). The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papilloma virus infection, sexual habits, reproducive history, and risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The results of this study suggest that cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a common finding in HIV-infected women. Papanicolaou tests should be effective for detecting cervical disease in this population.
