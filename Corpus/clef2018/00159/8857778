HIV infection in women: an escalating health concern. The proportion of women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to increase. Over one-half of women acquire the virus through heterosexual contact. The diagnoses that define the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the use of antiretroviral therapy are similar in men and women, except in pregnancy. However, management decisions differ significantly regarding contraceptive and gynecologic care. Besides abstinence, use of the latex condom continues to be the most effective way of preventing transmission of HIV. The management of human papillomavirus-associated disease, pelvic inflammatory disease and vaginal candidiasis is especially challenging in women with HIV infection. A positive status for the virus does not appear to affect pregnancy outcome. Each year, up to 2,000 infants are born infected with HIV. Transmission can occur by transplacental or intrapartum spread or through breast milk. Since 1994, prophylaxis with zidovudine has been shown to be an effective method of limiting transmission to infants. It is important to offer all pregnant women a test for HIV, with counseling provided both before and after the test, even if testing does not become mandatory under the law.
