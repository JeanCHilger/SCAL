Tissue effects and host response. The key to the rational triage of cervical neoplasia. Genital HPV infections are associated with a spectrum of lesions ranging from benign condylomata to invasive cancer and its precursor lesions. The transformation zone of the cervix is the most frequent target of the high-risk HPV types. Depending on the nomenclature used, cancer precursors are subdivided on the basis of their morphologic presentation into dysplasias (mild, moderate, and severe) cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN I, II, and III)
