Clinical role of HPV testing. The subjectivity of morphologic methods contributes to a "swamping" of colposcopic services, excessive costs, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. HPV DNA testing provides the objectivity required to clarify difficult patient management issues, including follow-up, for low-grade cytologic abnormalities (ASCUS and LSIL), noncorrelating (nonconfirmed) Pap smears, evaluation of nondiagnostic lower genital tract lesions, and cytology and histology laboratory quality assurance. Additionally, favorable preliminary data on HPV testing as a primary screen raise the exciting prospect of potentially lowering costs of cervical cancer-screening programs, while further decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer.
