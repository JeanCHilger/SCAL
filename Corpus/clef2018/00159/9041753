Workshop on screening for cancer of the uterine cervix in Central America. This article describes the objectives and content of a workshop held in Managua, Nicaragua, during November 1995, on screening for cervical cancer.  The aims were to discuss cost-effective models of screening in countries with a high incidence of cervical cancer and to reach a consensus on principles for screening that is balanced with a country's resources.  The workshop aimed to develop a planning framework and to identify program strengths and weaknesses by country.  In 1990 there were 25,000 deaths due to cervical cancer in Central America even so, most countries attach a low priority to cervical cancer screening.  Workshop plenary sessions were devoted to discussions about the natural history of cancer of the cervix and the implications for screening, the high costs of human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, approaches to national registries of cervical cancer, screening issues in Central America, downstaging, laboratory quality control issues, treatment of abnormalities, recruitment of women, and IEC.  This report includes individual country program reports for Nicaragua, Panama, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, and St.  Vincent and the Grenadines.  Participants concluded that priority should be placed on education about cancer and cancer of the cervix and education of primary health care professionals.  It was agreed that all participating countries should begin pilot programs adapted to resource availability, with the idea of a later nationwide expansion.  Health care professionals who treat women during the prime reproductive years should use the opportunity to identify women at high risk of invasive cancer.  There is overcoverage of women aged under 35 years and insufficient coverage of women aged 35-64 years.  Health programs need to enlist the help of women's groups in creating a need and demand in communities.  Cytology laboratories need to provide quality services.
