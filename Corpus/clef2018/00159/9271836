Human papillomavirus type 18 DNA sequences in adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences were detected by Southern blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10 out of 19 patients (52.7%) with adenocarcinoma [15] and adenosquamous [4] carcinoma of the uterine cervix. HPV 18 DNA was detected in 8 of these 19 patients (42.1%), HPV 16 DNA in 1 patient (5.3%) and HPV type X (unknown) in another (5.3%). Of the 10 HPV positive samples HPV 18 was found in 6 out of 6 pure adenocarcinomas (100%), and in 2 of 4 (50%) adenosquamous carcinomas. HPV 16 and HPV X were each detected in 1 out of 4 (25%) adenosquamous carcinomas. The physical state of the viral DNA was investigated in 5 of the 10 HPV-positive cases. All the specimens from these 5 cases showed HPV to be integrated into the host genome, except for one adenosquamous specimen, which showed both episomal and integrated forms of HPV 16. Six of 8 HPV 18 DNA positive specimens were from cases of pure adenocarcinoma and it was found by PCR that five of these 6 specimens retained fragments of E6/E7, LCR/E7 and early sequence of E1 fragment (sequence: 1188-1373) but deleted most part of E1.
