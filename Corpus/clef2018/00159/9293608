Clearance of cervical human papillomavirus infection by treatment for cervical dysplasia. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) after treatment for cervical dysplasia.The presence of HPV was investigated in cervical scrapes of 91 patients, before and after treatment, using consensus primers in the polymerase chain reaction.Before treatment for cervical dysplasia, 89 of 91 patients (98%) were HPV-positive compared with 28 of 91 patients (31%) after treatment. The HPV type present before treatment was found in the scrapes of only 9 of 89 patients (10%). Detection of HPV after treatment was associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and incomplete conization.The HPV type present before treatment was frequently cleared by treatment for cervical dysplasia.
