Two distinct human uterine cervical epithelial cell lines established after transfection with human papillomavirus 16 DNA. We have established two distinct human cervical cell lines, NCC16 and NCE16, after transfecting human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA into normal human ecto-cervical and endo-cervical epithelial cells, respectively. Both lines expressed HPV16 E6 and E7 as detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and northern blot hybridization. These cells have been passaged for over 100 population doublings and express strong telomerase activity. Neither cell line was tumorigenic in athymic nu/nu mice. However, both NCC16 and NCE16 developed abnormally stratified architectures following implantation with a silicon membrane sheet in the back of athymic nude mice. The former cells were pathohistologically similar to carcinoma, while the latter produced Alcian-blue positive cells, suggesting the occurrence of metaplastic changes. These distinct cell lines offer a useful model system for the study of cervical carcinogenesis and of its regulatory mechanism after HPV infection in different regions of the uterine cervix.
