Determination of the proliferative activity of the cervix uteri epithelium in papillomavirus infection. The results of examinations of 35 patients aged 17 to 42 years who had abnormalities in the cervix uteri were analyzed. Colposcopy detected an atypical epithelium in 100% of cases. To verify the diagnosis, biopsy specimens from the cervix uteri were morphologically studied prior to and following treatment. Before treatment, there was a slight proliferative activity of the epithelium in 45% of cases and its high proliferative activity in 15% in uncomplicated papilloma viral infection (PVI). A follow-up of complicated PVI indicated increases in the expression of a proliferative nuclear antigen (PVA) with higher dysplasia: a moderate response in 75% of D3 + PVI cases and a higher response in 60% of preinvasive cancers. Analysis of PCNA-immunological reactivity of biopsy specimens taken after treatment estimates the efficiency of the chosen complex of treatments: there was a negative result of immunohistochemical responses.
