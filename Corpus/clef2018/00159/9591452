Use of the Digene Hybrid Capture System for identification of the human papillomavirus (HPV-Human Papillomavirus) in women with cervical dysplasia. The study was performed to assess prevalence of HPV-DNA infections using the Hybrid Capture System (Vira Papl Vira Typ ). In a group of 228 female patients with Papanicolaou smear grade I and II, high oncogenic risk HPV infections were found in the 15.78% and low oncogenic risk--in 7.01% of the investigated patients. In a group of 324 women with diagnosed CIN, the high oncogenic HPV infection were found in 70.4% of them (CIN I/II-60%, CIN III-87.11%), and the low oncogenic risk HPV infections in 11.1%.
