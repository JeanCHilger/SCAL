Cytologic correlation between the Bethesda system and colposcopic biopsy. Bethesda system is useful in the citologic diagnosis of premalign diseases of cervix. It was determined the correlation between citologic report using Bethesda system and combined colposcopic index (CCI) or Reid, to diagnose premalign diseases of cervix by histologic diagnostic of punch biopsy by colposcopy. A total of 118 patients come to the colposcopy clinic having smear anormal citology to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), only o associated to HPV. It was taken to all of them a new cervical smear, colposcopy and punch biopsy. We analized the findings for citology with Bethesda system and colpospic with CCI of Reid, using histologic diagnosis of punch biopsy by colposcopy. Diagnosis correlation between Bethesda system and the punch biopsy by colposcopy was 98.5% for 82 patients with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions with a concordance of 100% for HPV and 97% for CNI I (p < 0.05). In the other hand 92% from 36 patients classified as high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions with a concordance of 84% to CIN II and 100% to CIN III (p < .05) Sensibility of 93%, especifidad and positive predictive value of 96% and negative predictive value of 98%. We conclude correlation between citologic report with Bethesda system and the Combined Colposcopic Index of Reid which are effective to diagnose premalign disease of cervix.
