Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in adolescents: study of cytological findings between 1987 and 1995 in SÃ£o Paulo State-Brazil. The purpose of the present study was to ascertain the frequency of Pap smears abnormalities (SIL/carcinoma) in two populations in the State of S. Paulo (Brazil) who were screened for cervical cancer during the last nine years: adolescents (up to the age of 21) and adults (over 21). Statistical analysis showed a tendency to linear increase in frequency of abnormal Pap smears in both groups (adolescent: slope = 0.118 +/- 0.56 adult: slope = 0.079 +/- 0.021), being greater in the adolescent group (slope 0.039 +/- 0.038) than in the adult group. Between 1987 and 1995 the prevalence of abnormal smears tripled in the adult group (from 0.37 to 1.18) and almost quadruplicated in the adolescent group (from 0.64 to 2.10). Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) were the most frequent findings in cervical cytology in both groups: 92.3% in the adolescent group and 69.8% in the adult group. Few cases of high grade squamous intrapeithelial lesions (HSIL) (7.7%) and no cases of carcinoma were found in adolescent population. We suggested that sexually active adolescents should be included in cervical screening programs.
