Distinct cytogenetic alterations in squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix revealed by laser-assisted microdissection and comparative genomic hybridization. It has been established that comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears can be used to identify chromosomal imbalances.In this study, the authors identified normal and dysplastic squamous epithelial cells cytologically, eliminated surrounding bacteria or leukocytes by a ultraviolet laser microbeam under microscopic control, and scraped out the cell groups of interest by a microdissection system. In 3 cases of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), a total of 9 samples of dysplastic (n = 6) and nontumorous cells (n = 3) were investigated, each of them consisting of 3-40 cells. The DNA was amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide primed PCR (DOP-PCR) and used for CGH.Analyses of all nontumorous cell groups resulted in fluorescence ratio profiles that showed no deviation from the normal range, confirming that no methodologic artefacts have been produced. The CGH profiles from dysplastic cells, however, showed various chromosomal imbalances affecting six to nine different chromosomes. The most frequent gains in DNA were observed on chromosomes 1p, 2q, 4, and 5, whereas losses were found on chromosomes 6q and 13q.The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of CGH on microdissected cell samples of routinely processed cervical smears. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of CGH on cervical routine smears. This approach offers the opportunity to investigate sequence copy number changes in small, morphologically well-defined groups of dysplastic cells. It may, therefore, serve as a cytogenetic screening test for identifying chromosomal aberrations in precancerous lesions that are associated with a high risk for progression to invasive cancer.
