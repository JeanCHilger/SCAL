Consensus polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human papillomavirus detection and typing in cervical specimens. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is common in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). This study investigates HPV detection and typing assay based on polymerase chain reaction amplification of L1 open reading frame with general primers GP5/GP6, followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection with type-specific DNA probes. To determine the sensitivity of this assay, formalin-fixed CaSki cells were used as reference cell lines. Fifty copies of viral DNA diluted in DNA from 100,000 noninfected cells could be detected. This assay was also investigated for HPV detection and typing of 67 cervical specimens diagnosed with with CIN III or carcinoma in situ (CIS) and their adjacent squamous epithelium. The CIN III lesions were infected in approximately 80% of the samples, 81% in the neighboring CIN II, and 68% in CIN I. The HPV infection was even detectable in 54% of nondysplastic epithelium located near a CIN III lesion.
