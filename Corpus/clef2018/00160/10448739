Merkel cell carcinoma of the lower lip: a case report and histopathologic study. Merkel cell carcinoma of the lower lip is a rare clinical entity. It is generally thought to be more aggressive than the more common skin cancers of the lips and oral cavity. The literature reveals that delayed diagnoses and poor survival are common among patients with these malignancies. Recommended treatment is surgical excision with wide margins and treatment of cervical metastases with either surgery or radiotherapy or both. Unlike other malignant neoplasms, the occurrence of Merkel cell carcinoma in a relatively older population makes comorbid conditions a key factor in treatment planning.
