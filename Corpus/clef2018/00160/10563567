Audit of cervical screening and colposcopy in HIV-positive women at a central London teaching hospital. The purpose of this audit was to assess the prevalence of cervical pathology and clinical outcome in HIV-infected women as well as adherence to local screening guidelines. As there are no national screening guidelines for HIV-positive patients, recommendations vary widely. At St Stephen's Centre, these included annual cytology and a baseline colposcopy. We audited this recommendation by a clinical notes review using a computer database. Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Two hundred and twenty-two patients were eligible for analysis, their mean age was 33.6 years, median CD4 count was 239 and median viral load was 7836 RNA copies. Cytology was undocumented in 72 women (32.4%), while overall 42 (28%) smears of the remaining 150 patients were abnormal: borderline 17.3%, mild dyskaryosis 4.6%, moderate dyskaryosis 4%, severe dyskaryosis 2%. The results were normal in 64% and unsatisfactory in 4.6%. Colposcopy was offered to 93 (42%) women who attended at least once in 71 cases (32%). Thirty-one women had biopsies taken (43.6% of all colposcopies). Twenty-four (77.4%) had a histology more severe than HPV and 15 (48.4%) more severe than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1. Overall, 49.7% had management not complying with the guidelines. This audit led to a critical literature review and of local screening guidelines. A computer aided reminder program has now been installed and re-auditing of the management of HIV-positive women is planned.
