Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of a novel human papillomavirus (Type 82) associated with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. The genome of a novel human papillomavirus (HPV-82) was cloned from a vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade I. In our series of 291 biopsy specimens, HPV-82 was identified in one case each of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II and grade III by blot hybridization. The histological localization of HPV-82 DNA in the three lesions was confirmed by in situ hybridization. The results indicated that HPV-82 is an etiologic agent for vaginal and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. By nucleotide sequence similarity of L1 open reading frame (ORF), HPV-82 was closely related to HPV-26, -51, and -69. To know the precise relationship between the HPVs, we determined the complete sequence of HPV-82, as well as that of HPV-69. Sequencing revealed that the four HPVs had no initiation codon in the E5 ORF and had extensive nucleotide sequence similarities in all ORFs. In addition, they exhibited unique frame position patterns for ORFs, different from those of the other genital HPVs.
