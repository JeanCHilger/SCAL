Analysis of prevalence of point mutations in codon 12 of oncogene K-ras from non-cancerous samples of cervical cytology positive for type 16 or 18 PVH. Ninety-one non cancerous samples from genital specimens positives for VPH 16 or 18 and 27 non-infected samples as controls were studied. Mutations at codon 12 in K-ras gene was analyzed using enriched alelic PCR technique. Among the samples studied 17.58% showed mutations in this codon. Significant differences were observed between the control group (negative DNA-HPV) and positives DNA-HPV samples (p < 0.01). No differences were found between both viral types in relation to the mutation frequency. The presence of mutations in the K-ras gene in non cancerous cytological samples point out new questions about the role of mutations in proto-oncogenes and the development of cervical cancer.
