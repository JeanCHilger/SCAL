Outcome of women referred to colposcopy for persistently inadequate smears. The outcome of referral to colposcopy of 240 women who had persistently inadequate smears was investigated. Of 232 women who attended colposcopy, 214 (92.2%) had a normal outcome, 12 (5.2%) had low grade abnormalities, and six (2.6%) had high grade abnormalities. This group of women therefore has a negligibly increased risk of harbouring cervical neoplasia. Although not directly comparable, women with a history of previous abnormal cytology did not have a higher risk than those without such a history. Unnecessary colposcopy could have been avoided in the majority of cases if a good quality repeat smear had been taken. Improved smear taker training could decrease the number of referrals. A hospital cytology clinic is proposed as a cost-effective alternative to colposcopy at the first attendance.
