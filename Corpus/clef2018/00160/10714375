Cervical disease in women referred to colposcopy following inadequate smears. The aim of this audit was to determine if inadequate cervical smears are associated with significant cervical pathology. Case records for 52 women with three consecutive inadequate smears referred for colposcopy to the Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) were retrieved. Sixteen women underwent large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was identified in six cases. There were no cases of inadequate smears initiating the diagnosis in 100 consecutive women with invasive cervical cancer. Inadequate smears are associated with high rates of treatment for a low yield of CIN. To reduce morbidity associated with colposcopy it may be acceptable to repeat an inadequate smear after 6 months rather than arranging immediate recall.
