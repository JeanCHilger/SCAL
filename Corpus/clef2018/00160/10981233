Test for human papillomavirus: no added value by inclusion in improved population screening for cervical cancer at this point. There is convincing evidence that high risk types of human papilloma virus (hrHPV) infection are strongly associated with the development of (the majority of) cervical carcinomas. The tumour-biological model will undoubtedly provide several potential cellular progression markers in the near future. As it is, there is not sufficient evidence to include the detection of hrHPV in the Dutch population screening programme. The population screening programme has in the recent years been reorganized, with many favourable effects in effectiveness and efficiency. It is proposed to start research projects at the regional level of the screening programme to test the applicability of newly developed molecular markers.
