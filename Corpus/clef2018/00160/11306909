Effect of p53 polymorphism on the susceptibility of cervical cancer. Using PCR amplification followed by confirmation with BstU I restriction enzyme digestion, the p53 Pro sequence was determined in tissues from 88 normal cervices, in 184 cervical swabs with mildly abnormal Pap smear, in 50 squamous cell cervical carcinoma specimens, and in 30 cervical adenocarcinoma samples. The frequencies for homozygous proline (Pro-72), homozygous arginine (Arg-72), and heterozygous proline/arginine (Pro/Arg-72) were 23% (n = 20), 28% (n = 25), and 49% (n = 43), respectively, in normal cervices 24% (n = 45), 28% (n = 51), and 48% (n = 88), respectively, in samples with mild dyskaryotic changes in Pap smears
