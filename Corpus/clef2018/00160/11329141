Comparative analysis of human papillomavirus infections in cervical scrapes and biopsy specimens by general SPF(10) PCR and HPV genotyping. Human papillomavirus (HPV) can be detected by DNA amplification from clinical samples. The aim of the present study was to compare the HPV status in both cervical scrape and biopsy specimens obtained from 174 patients, using the recently developed broad spectrum SPF(10) PCR-LiPA method. The detection rate of HPV in these materials was determined and the spectrum of HPV genotypes was compared. Cervical scrapes and biopsy specimens were obtained, either on the same day (group I), or with an interval of up to almost 2 years (group II, mean interval 97 days, range 1-469 days). HPV DNA was amplified by SPF(10) PCR and detected in a microtitre plate hybridization assay. Of the HPV-positive cases, the genotype was determined by reverse hybridization of the same SPF(10) amplimer on a line probe assay (LiPA), discriminating between HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33-35, 39, 40, 42-45, 51-54, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, and 74. The results showed that the detection rate and the spectrum of HPV genotypes in cervical scrapes and the corresponding biopsy specimens were highly comparable in both patient groups, even when multiple genotypes were present. In both groups, multiple HPV genotypes were more frequently detected in cervical scrapes than in the corresponding biopsy specimens. In conclusion, HPV infection can be diagnosed in cervical scrapes and biopsy specimens using the SPF(10) PCR-LiPA system. Analysis of cervical scrapes accurately reflects the spectrum of HPV genotypes in the patient's cervical region, even with a sampling interval between the cervical scrape and the biopsy specimen.
