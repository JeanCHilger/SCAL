Prevention and treatment of dysplasia and cervical cancer. Dysplasia, an abnormal development of the cervix, can be caused by the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus. Dysplasia occurs more often in women who smoke or who have nutritional deficiencies. HIV-positive women have a higher risk of developing dysplasia and cervical cancer than those who are HIV-negative. A pap smear can detect abnormal cells in the cervix. HIV-positive women are encouraged to get a pap smear each month. Those with dysplasia can prevent cancerous growths through regular medical attention. Cervical dysplasia can disappear, remain unchanged, or become malignant. Cervical cancer can be removed by biopsy or by hysterectomy.
