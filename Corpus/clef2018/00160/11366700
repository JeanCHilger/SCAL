Annual colposcopies and pap smears recommended for women with HIV. A new study presented by Annekathryn Goodman of Massachusetts General Hospital indicates that HIV positive women should receive annual colposcopies, along with Pap smears, to detect abnormal cell growth early. The recommendation is due to the fact that HIV positive women are more likely to have false-negative Pap smears than HIV negative women. In a related development, the FDA approved a new DNA-based blood test to detect human papillomavirus, which is associated with cervical and anal cancer. In addition, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) notified physicians that it has changed its recommendation for cervical cancer treatment. NCI now recommends both chemotherapy and radiation therapy for women with metastasized cervical cancer.
