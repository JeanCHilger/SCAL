Establishment and characterization of a new cell line (SKS) from neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix and its chemosensitivity. A new cell line (SKS) established from ascites of a patient with neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix had a good tumorigenicity and caused marked peritoneal dissemination, and was also highly sensitive to gemcitabine in an in vitro chemosensitivity test. SKS cells were small round cells with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio and grew into colony-like aggregates, forming spherical aggregates of floating cells. The population doubling time was 44 h. The number of chromosomes ranged from 50 to 56. On examination of the ultrastructure, membrane-bound dense-core neurosecretory-type granules were observed in the cytoplasm. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was immunocytochemically positive in the cytoplasm, and 9.3 ng/ml of NSE was detected in the cell culture supernatant. Human papillomavirus was not detected. In the p53 gene, a 3-bp deletion, AAC (Asn), was detected at codon 131 in exon 5. SKS exhibited good tumorigenicity, and the tumor doubling time was 11 days. Intraperitoneal injection of the cells caused peritoneal dissemination, and marked ascites formation was observed. SKS was highly sensitive to gemcitabine, and the 50% growth inhibitory concentration was 30 nM. SKS cells are useful as a model of neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the cervix, and chemotherapy using gemcitabine may possibly be effective in this malignancy.
