Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the young female. Diagnosis and management. The prevalence of HPV and CIN in young women has increased in recent years. During a 5-year period (1996-2000), 78 sexually active young females, aged 15-20 years, were referred to the Colposcopic Unit of the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Athens in the major University-appointed hospital in Greece, because of an abnormal cytology or a suspicious cervical abnormality in the presence of negative cytology. Colposcopic examinations were found to be within normal limits in 12/78 (15.4%) of cases. Cervical pathology was related in 22 cases (28.2%) to HPV infection, 23 (29.5%) cases to CIN 1, 18 (23.1%) cases to CIN II and 3 (3.8%) to CIN III. No relation between oral contraceptive use and cigarette smoking with HPV infection was found. Our findings strongly confirm the necessity of obtaining cervicovaginal smears on all sexually active gynecologic and obstetric teenage patients.
