Expanded cytological referral criteria for colposcopy in cervical screening: comparison with human papillomavirus testing. The goal of this study was to investigate whether expanded cytologic referral criteria for colposcopy or the addition of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing on cervical screening could improve the rates of detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).HPV testing by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction/ELISA was performed in 1000 women who were self-referred for routine Pap smear. They underwent colposcopy following an abnormal smear result or a positive HPV test. As abnormal smear results were considered reports of low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and even HPV-associated reactive cellular changes (mild koilocytosis, mild dyskeratocytosis, hyperchromatic nuclei, bimultinucleation, and cleared cytoplasm). Loop excision of the transformation zone was performed in women with cytology and colposcopy indicative of CIN, as well as in women with normal cytology but positive HPV test and colposcopic impression of CIN.The Pap test was abnormal in 89% of the cases of CIN 1 (34/38) and 96% of CIN 2/3 (27/28) diagnosed in our population. HPV testing picked up four additional cases of CIN 1 (11%) and one case of CIN 2/3 (4%). Overall the HPV test detected 95% of the cases of CIN 1 (36/38) and 89% of the cases of CIN 2/3 (25/28).HPV testing does not appear to add significantly to cytology in terms of positive predictive value or detection rate, if extended cytologic indications for colposcopy are used.
