Primary screening for human papillomavirus infection. As human papillomavirus infection is now known to be a necessary risk factor for at least 95% of cervical cancers, the medical community has a responsibility to assess and evaluate how this knowledge should best be used for the prevention of cervical cancer. Organized screening strategies combining cytological screening with human papillomavirus testing in older age groups could theoretically be more sensitive than current screening programmes in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. If it is possible safely to extend the screening interval in human papillomavirus-negative women, such programmes could also both be more effective and more cost-efficient. Although some modelling studies have indicated that this could indeed be the case, evidence from clinical trials evaluating the long-term protective effect of primary human papillomavirus screening is still lacking. The key issues on the research agenda for primary human papillomavirus screening are reviewed.
