Human papillomavirus as a form of risk assessment. There is a huge amount of interest in the use of human papillomavirus testing to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of cervical screening. Although oncogenic human papillomavirus subtypes are recognized to be the most important factor in the development of cervical disease, only a minority of such infections results in invasive cancer. Given our current, albeit limited, knowledge of the natural history of human papillomavirus infection and the development of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, it may be possible to identify well-defined high-risk groups of women. Such groups may benefit from intensive surveillance, or indeed new developments in immunoprophylaxis, while allowing low-risk women less screening intervention. Known high-risk groups include those with chronic immunosuppression and previous treatment for high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. Lowering the upper age limit for cervical screening is already under consideration because of the low incidence of both human papillomavirus infection and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in older women, and human papillomavirus testing could rationalize the screening programme.
