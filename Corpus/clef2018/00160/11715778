Can human papillomavirus testing and vaccination prevent cervical cancer?. Cervical cancer is the third most frequent cancer among women worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a necessary risk factor and the first step in cervical carcinogenesis.This article reviews the current literature concerning the possibility of preventing cervical cancer by HPV testing and vaccination.HPV testing cannot replace cytology, but will reduce false negative cytology and may improve the screening programme for cervical neoplasia. It has not yet been incorporated in any national cervical cancer screening program, but trials are ongoing in Scandinavia and in the Netherlands. The cost-effectiveness of HPV testing in screening has to be proven and whether it can affect the recommended screening-intervals. Therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for HPV associated disease are in progress. Evaluating the clinical trials that are ongoing will take several years. Several anti-HPV vaccines are now in clinical trials Norway will also participate. Therapeutic vaccines against cervical cancer have so far not been successful, but anogenital dysplasias and condylomas may be more susceptible. Prophylactic vaccines against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 have been evaluated in clinical phase I and II trials, and phase III trials are in progress.HPV testing improves the specificity and sensitivity of cervical cytology and it can be used to clarify cases with atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. In the near future it may also be included in the cervical cancer screening programme for women above the age of 30. The first results in clinical vaccine trials are encouraging, and final conclusions about the effectiveness of these vaccines may be achieved in five years' time.
