Utility of the in situ detection of HPV in Pap smears diagnosed as within normal limits. To determine the clinical significance in normal Pap smears of HPV detection as determined by Hybrid Capture (HC) and in situ hybridization analyses.We studied 135 consecutive Pap smears as well as 46 other smears from high-risk patients each initially diagnosed as within normal limits.The 135 "normal" Pap smears were rescreened, and 6 (4%) where found to be either ASCUS or SIL. In the remaining 129 cases, HPV DNA was detected in 0% and 9%, respectively, using in situ hybridization and HC I. Upon rescreening the high-risk patients, nine (20%) were reclassified as having SIL/ASCUS each was in situ hybridization positive, and eight were HC positiveIn situ hybridization rarely detects HPV in Pap smears diagnosed as within normal limits after manual rescreening. In situ hybridization is very effective in detecting rare, atypical cells in Pap smears diagnosed as within normal limits and, in a high-risk population, is predictive of SIL on clinical follow-up.
