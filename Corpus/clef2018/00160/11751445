Association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism C677T and dietary folate with the risk of cervical dysplasia. Epidemiological studies have been inconsistent regarding a role for folate in the etiology of cervical dysplasia. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is involved in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. A common variant of this enzyme, resulting from a 677C-->T (Ala-->Val) substitution in the gene, has been shown to have reduced activity and is associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia. A multiethnic case-control study was used to examine the association of dietary folate and MTHFR genotype with the odds ratios (ORs) for cervical dysplasia among women identified from several clinics on Oahu, Hawaii, between 1992 and 1996. We collected blood samples for DNA extraction, cervical smears for cytological diagnosis, exfoliated cervical cells for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, and personal interviews from 150 women with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and from 179 women with cytologically normal (Pap) smears. We found a positive, monotonic trend (P = 0.02) in the ORs for cervical SILs associated with the number of variant MTHFR T alleles, after multivariate adjustment. Women with the heterozygous CT genotype had twice the risk of cervical SILs [OR, 2.0 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-3.7], and women with the homozygous TT genotype had almost three times the risk of SILs (OR, 2.9
