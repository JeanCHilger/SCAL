Immunohistochemical investigation of p-53, C-NEU and EGFR expression in HPV-related epidermoid endometrial carcinoma. Epidermoid carcinoma (PSCC) of the endometrium is a rare form of endometrial cancer that constitutes about 0.1% of all malignant epithelial tumors of the uterus. The diagnosis of PSCC is based on strict criteria and is made in the absence of a glandular component of the tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium should enter the differential diagnosis in postmenopausal patients in the presence of atypical squamous cells in the uterine curettage, while the cervical biopsies are negative for malignancy. The presence of HPV should be investigated as well, so that its pathogenetic relation is clarified. While no significant relation was found to p-53, C-NEU and EGFR expression this investigation must be continued because. HPV may interact with tumor suppressor genes.
