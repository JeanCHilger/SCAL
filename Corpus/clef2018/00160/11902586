Immune evasion in human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer. Tumour-associated viruses produce antigens that, on the face of it, are ideal targets for immunotherapy. Unfortunately, these viruses are experts at avoiding or subverting the host immune response. Cervical-cancer-associated human papillomavirus (HPV) has a battery of immune-evasion mechanisms at its disposal that could confound attempts at HPV-directed immunotherapy. Other virally associated human cancers might prove similarly refractive to immuno-intervention unless we learn how to circumvent their strategies for immune evasion.
