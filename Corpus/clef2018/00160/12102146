Active and passive smoking, high-risk human papillomaviruses and cervical neoplasia. Few studies have evaluated the role of passive smoke exposure and cervical neoplasia risk. We assessed the role of active and passive cigarette smoke exposure and risk of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) in a case-control study based in a South Carolina Health Department 59 high-grade SIL (HSIL) cases, 313 low-grade SIL (LSIL) cases and 427 controls were recruited and interviewed. Passive cigarette smoke exposure was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with high grade SIL (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.2) and low-grade SIL (aOR = 1.4). Active smoking was associated with SIL only among White women (aOR = 1.8). High-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) appear to interact with active cigarette smoking to increase HSIL risk. HSIL cases compared with LSIL cases were significantly more likely to be HR-HPV positive current smokers (aOR = 3.0
