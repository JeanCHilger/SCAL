Cervico-vaginal dysplasia--papillomavirus-induced and HIV-1 infection: role of correlated markers for prognostic evaluation. Sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) can facilitate the progression of HIV-1 infection. Among them, as we have previously demonstrated, cervico-vaginal dysplasia-papillomavirus (HPV)-induced, together with HSV-2 co-infection, seems to be correlated with a more evident immunodepression in HIV-positive women, compared with other sexually transmitted diseases. Here we have analysed some of the main correlated markers of HIV-1 infection progression: CD4 + T lymphocyte concentration, CD4 +/CD8 + T cells ratio, HIV-1 RNA loads and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in 30 HIV-1 positive women co-infected with HPV, and suffering from cervico-vaginal dysplasia, in different stages. In particular, we noticed a positive correlation, evaluated by Spearman's test, between the degree of progression of dysplastic stages (CIN1 --> 3) until invasive carcinoma (IC) and HIV-1 RNA loads (C(s) = +0.78 p < 0.001), and in contrast, a negative correlation between the same stages of progression and respectively CD4 + T cell concentration (C(s) = -0.54
