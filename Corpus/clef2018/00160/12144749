Human papillomavirus prevalence, viral load and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-infected women. HIV-infected women from S o Paulo city were enrolled in a cross-sectional study on Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) prevalence and their association with laboratory markers of AIDS, namely HIV viral load and CD(4)(+) cell counts. A cervical specimen was collected and submitted to Hybrid Capture, a test for HPV viral load determination. HPV-DNA was detected in 173 of 265 women (64.5%). Twenty (7.5%) women were infected by one or more low-risk viruses, 89 (33%) by one or more high-risk viruses, and 64 (24%) harbored at least one HPV type from each risk group. Abnormal smears were observed in 19% of the patients, though there were no invasive carcinomas. Severely immunosuppressed patients (CD(4)/microL <100) were at the greatest risk of having a cytological abnormality and a high high-risk HPV viral load.
