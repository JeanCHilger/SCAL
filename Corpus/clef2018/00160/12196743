Penile lesions and human papillomavirus in male sexual partners of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Genital human papillomavirus infection (HPV) is causally associated with cervical carcinomas and premalignant lesions. Limited information is available about the prevalence of HPV and penile lesions in male sexual partners of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).The aim of this study was to identify the presence of penile lesions and HPV in penile scrapings from male sexual partners of women with CIN.One hundred seventy-five male sexual partners of women with CIN were screened by peniscopy after acetowhite staining and HPV testing on penile scrapings.Penile lesions were seen in 68% of the male sexual partners. More than one lesion type was diagnosed in 15%. Flat lesions, papular lesions, and condylomata acuminata were seen in 83%, 29%, and 4%, respectively. HPV was detected in 59% of the penile scrapings, containing mainly oncogenic HPV types. When penile lesions were present at peniscopy, 67% of penile scrapings were positive for HPV, whereas 37% were HPV-positive when no lesions were visible.Penile lesions are frequently found in sexual partners of women with CIN. Most of these lesions are subclinical (ie, only visible after acetowhite staining) and are often associated with the presence of high-risk HPV, indicating that male sexual partners of women with CIN might constitute a reservoir for high-risk HPV.
