Polymorphism in codon 72 of the p53 gene and cervico-uterine cancer risk in Mexico. A polymorphism at codon 72 in the p53 gen has been reported as a potential risk factor to cervical cancer (CC) because human papillomavirus (HPV) is more effective at degrading p53 Arg-72 than p53 Pro-72, making individuals homozygous for p53 Arg-72 seven times more likely to develop HPV-associated CC. As In Mexico the CC is a health public problem, we designed this study to determinate whether the p53 codon 72 polymorphism represent a risk factor to CC in our population. A case-controls study was performed. DNA was obtained from paraffin-embedded cervical fixed tissue samples. Analysis of the p53 genotype at position 72 was performed by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers and Accll digestion. Among cases with CC the proportions of the p53 genotypes at codon 72 were 0.05 to proline homozygous, 0.5 to heterozygous, and 0.45 to arginine-homozygous. In controls the proportions were 0.08, 0.62, and 0.31. X2 test showed no significant difference In the proportions. We conclude than In our population, as other worldwide countries, the homozygous for arginine at codon 72 of the p53 gene is not a risk factor to cervical cancer.
