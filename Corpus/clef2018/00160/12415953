High-risk human papilloma virus and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women at 2 hospitals in Mexico City. To determine the high risk HPV (HR-HPV) association with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) in women of two Dysplasia Clinics in Mexico City.Prolective case-control study was done. Women with and without security affiliation attended in Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Hospital 1) and Hospital General de MÃ©xico (Hospital 2) were included in the study. Cases were women with histopathologic diagnosis of CIN and controls were women with negative dysplasia in cytologic study (Pap). Information was obtained by direct interview. HR-HPV was determined by Hybrid Capture II assay, in cervical samples. Bivariate and logistic regression analysis was done.One hundred and two cases and 192 controls from Hospital 1 and 89 cases and 66 controls from Hospital 2 were included. 83.3% and 77.3% of women from Hospital 1 and 2 respectively were positive to HR-HPV. The association HR-HPV and CIN in Hospital 1 was ORa = 40.6, C.I. 95% = 17-96.8 while in Hospital 2 there was not association. Age was an effect modifier in the HR-HVP and CIN association, in Hospital 1. It was observed a correlation between viral load and CIN degree.The HR-HPV infection frequency in controls and CIN I was higher than the reported in other studies. Age was a modifier in the HR-HPV association and CIN. In dysplasia clinics without medical referral system of patients is possible to observe similar risk factors to cervical cancer.
