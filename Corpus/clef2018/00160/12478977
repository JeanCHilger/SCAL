Value and limits of cytology in the diagnosis of cervico-vaginal lesions at the Mahajanga University Hospital Center: 465 cases. Cervix neoplasms are the most frequent of female neoplasms in Madagascar. The authors reported a prospective study carried out at the Hospital Center of the University of Mahajanga for ten months (January-October 1993). 500 patients were investigated. 465 results of cervix and vaginal smears were considered. The Bethesda group classification was used to interpret lesions. 333 specific pathological lesions were listed. Bacterial infections and trichomoniasis were their principal causes. 4 cases were presumed as human papillomavirus condylomata. 39 SIL low-grade and 24 SIL high-grade were detected. 5 cervix neoplasms were diagnosed. Only few patients had consultation to perform cervix and vaginal smears because these exams are expensive. It may be an explication to the chronicity of lesions, a favourising factor of cancer. The role of viruses, especially human papillomavirus, in the development of cervix neoplasms is mentioned. The authors conclude that the low number of cervix neoplasms they founded is misleading. Cervix neoplasms are the first female cancers in Madagascar. A systematic surveillance of all female genitalia diseases must be programed. While its settling, cervix neoplasms control must be centred on Information--Education--Communication.
