The incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in patients with cervical carcinoma from Gdansk region. We have estimated the incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in cervical smears of patients with cervical carcinoma, treated in 1997-1998 at the II Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.We have examined 107 patients suffering from cervical cancer. The HPV DNA was detected with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using two primer pairs located in the E6, E7 open reading frames. HPV typing was executed by restriction fragments length polymorphism PCR (RFLP-PCR) method.HPV DNA was detected in 75 (70.1%) patients. A group of patients with Ib (43%) and IIa (19.6%) clinical degrees made the highest percentage within the research group. We found no statistically significant differences between various clinical degrees of cervical cancer in the group of patients both HPV positive and negative.The frequency of HPV especially HPV 16 type infection incidence in cervical carcinoma is lower in Gdansk region than currently published.
