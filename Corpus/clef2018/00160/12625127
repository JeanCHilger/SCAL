Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting at Manson House, London 17 January 2002. Cervical cancer in developing countries. The public health importance of cervical cancer is now increasingly appreciated as a means to improve the general health of women in many developing countries. Developing countries account for 80% of the world burden, mostly due to the lack of effective control programmes. Infection with oncogenic types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) has been established as the central cause for cervical cancer. Thus, vaccination against HPV is a potentially useful strategy for prevention, but this may take several years to become a reality. Currently, early detection and treatment is the most effective approach to control cervical cancer. Cervical cancer may be controlled through improving awareness and accessibility to diagnostic and treatment services. Cytology-based screening is beyond the capacity of health services in many developing countries, hence, alternative methods to cytology are being investigated. Visual inspection of the cervix after application of 3-5% acetic acid (VIA) seems to be a promising screening test, with a similar sensitivity to that of cytology, but lower specificity. Currently, it is being evaluated for its cost-effectiveness in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality in randomized trials. Information from the ongoing studies will be valuable for evolving cervical cancer control policies and programmes in low-resource settings.
