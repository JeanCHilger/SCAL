Oncogenic human papillomavirus DNA loads in human immunodeficiency virus-positive women with high-grade cervical lesions are strongly elevated. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA loads of six oncogenic HPV types were measured by real-time PCR in cervical scrapes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and uninfected women. In both groups, HPV loads increased with the grade of cervical disease. HIV infection did not affect HPV loads in low-grade lesions but was associated with significantly higher HPV loads in severe dysplasia highest loads were found in advanced HIV disease. Our data reflect the aggressive course of HPV infection in HIV-positive women.
