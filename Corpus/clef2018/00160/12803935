Attitudes about human papillomavirus vaccine in young women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are under investigation, but little is known about attitudes regarding vaccination. The aims of this study were to identify attitudes about and intention to receive an HPV vaccine in young women using a theory-based model. Young women (n=52, mean age 25 years, range 18-30 years, 35% Black/Non-Hispanic) completed a survey assessing knowledge, attitudes about HPV vaccination, and risk behaviours. Associations between attitudes and intention to receive the vaccine were assessed using Mann-Whitney U or chi-square tests. Subjects reported positive attitudes about receiving an HPV vaccine and high intention to receive the vaccine both for themselves and their daughters. Variables associated significantly with intention included knowledge (P=0.004), personal beliefs about vaccination (P=0.004), belief that others would approve of vaccination (P=0.005), and higher number of sexual partners (P=0.028). Information on attitudes about HPV vaccination and predictors of intention to receive a vaccine may guide immunization initiatives for young adults.
