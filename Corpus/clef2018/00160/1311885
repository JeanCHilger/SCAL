Human papillomavirus DNA detection in Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears with a nonradioactive, in situ hybridization assay. Archived Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears from women with different cervical pathologies were processed for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection and typing with an in situ hybridization (ISH) assay that employed commercial biotinylated HPV DNA probes. Two HPV DNA probes were utilized: one included HPV genotypes 6/11 and the other, 16/18. The method yielded positive results for HPV DNA 6/11 in 5 cases with condylomata acuminata (100%) and in 2 of 47 with flat warty lesions (4.2%), whereas HPV DNA 16/18 was detected in 29/47 of the latter group (61.7%). In cases with cervical intraepithelial III or invasive squamous cell carcinoma the yield was lower: positive results for HPV DNA 16/18 were obtained in only one of the five cases with one or the other cervical pathology (20%). An analysis of the results showed that the sensitivity of the assay correlated with evidence in the Papanicolaou specimens of pathognomonic cell injury from HPV infection. In the presence of such cytologic features, HPV DNA typing was possible in 37/52 cases (65.4%). In view of the modest difficulty and relatively quick execution of the nonradioactive ISH assay, the authors believe that Papanicolaou cervical smears with cytologic changes of HPV infection could be processed by this method in order to acquire information on the HPV type or types involved in the cervical infection.
