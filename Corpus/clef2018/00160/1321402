Functional interaction of p53 with HPV18 E6, c-myc and H-ras in 3T3 cells. Wild-type (wt) p53 has been suggested to be the product of a tumor-suppressor gene. Recently, it has been shown that the E6 oncoproteins of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, like the SV40 large T antigen, are physically associated with wt p53. We have investigated the functional interaction of wt p53 with the viral oncogene products of HPV16 and 18 and with cellular oncogenes by transfection of NIH3T3 cells with p53 wt alone or with several oncogene(s). We found that over-expression of HPV18 E6, c-myc or activated H-ras, like SV40 large T, can partially overcome the growth-inhibitory effect of wt p53 in NIH3T3 cells, while HPV16 E6 and E7, HPV18 E7, k-fgf, c-fos and mutant (mt) p53 do not. Further studies indicate that HPV18 E6 and c-myc can overcome the antiproliferative effect, but not the antitransforming effect, of wt p53, while activated H-ras can overcome both the antiproliferative and antitransforming effects of wt p53. These data show evidence of a functional interaction between HPV18 E6 and wt p53, and suggest that the cooperation of HPV E6 and cellular oncogenes c-myc and H-ras, which are activated in several cases of human cervical cancers, may be necessary to overcome completely the anti-oncogenic function of p53 in the development of these tumors.
