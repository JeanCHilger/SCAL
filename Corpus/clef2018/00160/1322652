Screening for Epstein-Barr and human cytomegalovirus in normal and abnormal cervical smears by fluorescent in situ cytohybridization. Using the routine Papanicolaou test for grouping, 35 normal and 148 abnormal cervical smears were screened by fluorescent in situ cytohybridization for Epstein-Barr (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Viral presence was detected in 55% of all hybridized smears while routine Papanicolaou tests exposed no morphological evidence for HCMV or EBV. Thus in situ cytohybridization is necessary and suitable for direct identification of EBV and HCMV. The prevalence of viral infection for women with normal cervical smears was 29% for HCMV and 34% for EBV. Even smears of three of the four virgins were positive for HCMV and two had a mixed infection with EBV. The infection rate with at least one of these two herpesviruses was 51% in the control group, 56% in smears with reactive and reparative cell changes, 54% in mild (slight) dysplasias and 56% in moderate or severe dysplasias. Thus infection with HCMV and EBV did not differ significantly in controls and prevention groups. Both viruses were most frequently found in the age group 20 to 29 years. These data suggest that HCMV and EBV are not involved in the etiology of intraepithelial neoplasias and carcinomas of the uterine cervix.
