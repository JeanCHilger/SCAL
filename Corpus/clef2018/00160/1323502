Cervix cancer in HPV16-associated Bowenoid papulosis. In a 38-year-old female patient with bowenoid papulosis of the anogenital region and an extensive carcinoma in situ of the cervix uteri, HPV16 DNA was found in the biopsy specimens and HPV16/18 DNA was detected in the cervical swab. The known coincidence of both these diseases indicates the necessity for careful regular gynaecological check-ups of patients with bowenoid papulosis.
