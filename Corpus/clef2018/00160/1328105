A study of possible causal relations between squamous cell carcinoma of the penis and carcinoma of the cervix uteri. The authors investigated 26 regular sexual female partners of 24 men with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. Neoplasms were diagnosed in 6 (23.1%) of the total of 26 women. STDs were found in 6 (23.1%) women. In 2 the cytologic findings on the cervix were classified as PAP III (PAP IIIa-CIN I, PAP IIIb-CIN III). Squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix was found in 2 women (1 case PAP IV-CIN III 1 case PAP V-suggestive of invasive carcinoma). Endometrial adenoacanthoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the right hand and non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (centroblastic) were found in 1 case each.
