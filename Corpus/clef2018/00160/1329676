In situ hybridization for human papillomavirus as a method of predicting the evolution of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Twenty-four women with cervical condylomata which were immunohistochemically positive for human papillomavirus (PV-Ag) (15 with CIN 1 and 9 with CIN 2) were followed for a period of 2-65 months. Fifty-seven biopsies were studied by the in situ hybridization (ISH) procedure for the detection of HPV 6/11 and 16/18 DNA. ISH positivity was found in 13/24 cases (54.2%) HPV 16/18 was evident in 7/9 CIN 2 (77.8%) as against 3/15 CIN 1 (20%) (P = 0.017) and in 8/13 cases with koilocytosis affecting up to 2/3 of the epithelial thickness (61.5%) as against 2/11 cases with koilocytosis affecting more than 2/3 of the epithelial layer (18.2%) (P = 0.03). Progression to CIN 3 occurred in 4 cases (2 CIN 1 and 2 CIN 2), the degree of dysplasia remained static in 5 cases (1 CIN 1 and 4 CIN 2) and regression occurred in 15 cases (9 CIN 1 and 6 CIN 2). The immunoperoxidase (IP) positive staining for PV-Ag persisted in 5/24 cases and disappeared in 19/24
