Invasive cervical cancer in young women. Clinicopathologic correlation and demonstration of human papillomavirus by in situ hybridization. It has been suggested that invasive cervical carcinoma is biologically more aggressive in young patients than in older patients. The clinicopathologic characteristics and human papillomavirus (HPV) status of women < or = 35 years of age with invasive cervical carcinoma treated at Emory University Hospital from 1985-1989, were evaluated in a retrospective study. The group consisted of 23 patients, 35% of all patients with invasive cervical carcinoma. Age at diagnosis, clinical stage, histologic classification, lymph node status, treatment and clinical follow-up were obtained from medical records. HPV status was evaluated by colorimetric in situ hybridization for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor material available from 16 of the patients. This study found that the young patients had lower survival and greater extent of disease than predicted by clinical staging. The rate of detection of HPV (69% positive) and HPV typing (type 16 predominated) in these young patients showed no difference from other series of cervical carcinomas from all age groups. Although a higher proportion of patients who died of disease had HPV-negative tumors (3/7, 43%) than those patients who were alive and free of disease (2/9, 22%), this difference was not statistically significant (P = .73, Fisher's Exact T-Test).
