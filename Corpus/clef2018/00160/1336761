Detection of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA by PCR and other conventional hybridisation techniques in male partners of women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears. To study the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, using several different hybridisation techniques, in men whose female sexual partners had cervical HPV and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).The male genital area was examined colposcopically and areas suspicious of HPV changes were biopsied. Each biopsy was subjected to histological examination and HPV DNA analysis by conventional DNA analysis such as Southern, reverse and dot blot as well as with polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Colposcopic examination of men showed 133 to be normal whilst 82 (38%) had clinical or subclinical lesions. Of 55 colposcopically directed biopsies from the male lesions taken, detection of HPV DNA by hybridisation with conventional techniques and by PCR showed HPV DNA in 29 (53%) and 47 (85%) of biopsies respectively. Overall HPV types 6/11 were the predominant types. In 18 (33%) biopsies positive by PCR, multiple types were found.HPV DNA was present in the majority of biopsy specimens taken, with HPV 6/11 being the predominant type. Among methods for HPV DNA detection, PCR was the most sensitive and useful technique.
