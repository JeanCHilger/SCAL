Efficiency of the hybrid capture 2 HPV DNA test in cervical cancer screening. A study by the French Society of Clinical Cytology. The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2 Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) human papillomavirus (HPV) assay for the detection of cervical neoplasia. Of the 1,785 patients recruited, 462 (25.88%) were referred for colposcopy owing to previously detected cytologic abnormalities, and 1,323 (74.12%) were voluntary candidates for screening. For all patients, a Papanicolaou smear and a monolayer smear (ThinPrep, Cytyc, Boxborough, MA) were done. HPV DNA was detected on the residual liquid-based material. False-positive results were observed in 111 cases and comprised 34 cross-reactions (1.90%) and 77 false-positive cases (4.31%) owing to a contiguous strong chemiluminescence signal. Interestingly, all these samples had a relative light units value of 1 to 3 and were contiguous to a sample with a very high HPV DNA load. The final results showed that high-risk and low-risk HPV DNA were detected in 480 samples (26.89%) and 135 samples (7.56%), respectively. Although HC2 can be considered a reliable and sensitive test for HPV DNA detection, we do not advocate its use for large-scale screening for cervical neoplasia.
