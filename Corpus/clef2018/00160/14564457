Postmenopausal bleeding: squamous cell carcinoma of cervix with coexisting endometrial tuberculosis. A case of squamous cell carcinoma of cervix co-existent with endometrial tuberculosis presenting as postmenopausal bleeding is being reported for its rarity. The atrophic postmenopausal endometrium is thought to be poorly supportive of tubercle bacilli. Following a radical Wertheim's hysterectomy patient had a hectic postoperative period, which responded to antitubercular treatment. Diagnosis of tuberculosis in this case was made on histopathology postoperatively and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on scrapes from the granulomas obtained by microdissection.Tuberculosis complicating malignant disease may occur in regions with a high prevalence of disease with a resurgence of tuberculosis worldwide this association may not be uncommon. The diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in a patient with cancer assumes importance as a high mortality has been seen in patients with co-existent disease.
