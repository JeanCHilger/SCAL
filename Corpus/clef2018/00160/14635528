Cervical cytological screening and human papillomavirus DNA testing in Flanders. The causal relationship between genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical dysplasia/carcinoma has been recognised for some time. The aim of this study was to document the occurrence and distribution of HPV infection in the five provinces of the Flemish region in Belgium and to correlate the HPV DNA test results with the cytological results on simultaneously performed thin layer preparations of cervical cells. Out of a total screened group of 105107 samples, 1978 samples with cytological abnormalities were tested for HPV DNA using the MY09/MY11 consensus PCR. The mean age of the whole group was 36.9 years. The LSIL group, with a mean age of 33.6 years, was significantly younger than the other groups. There was no significant difference in HPV prevalence among the provinces. In four out of five provinces the HPV prevalence reached 100% in high-grade lesions. There is a significant increase in predominance of high-risk HPV types, with increasing abnormal cytology (17.9% WNL < 51.1% ASCUS < 83.8% LSIL < 97.2% HSIL). Three peaks of HPV DNA positivity were observed, a first at 22 yrs (82%), a second at 47 yrs (60%) and a third in women older than 65 yrs (52%). These results shed more light on HPV prevalence in Flanders and show that the MY09/MY11 consensus primer based detection system is very suitable for the detection of HPV infections in Flanders.
