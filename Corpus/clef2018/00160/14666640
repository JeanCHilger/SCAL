Human papilloma virus typing at large loop excision of the transformation zone of the cervix uteri. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether human papilloma virus (HPV) testing at LLETZ for CIN can be useful to identify patients with high risk of recurrent disease.In 62 women treated with LLETZ for CIN the status of the resection margins was recorded and related to the HPV status as assessed with Hybrid Capture II immediately after surgery. A control typing was repeated 3-9 months later. In all cases, a ThinPrep thinlayer cytology was further performed.In 19 of the 62 surgical specimens (30.6%) the resection margin was positive for dysplasia or dysplastic epithelium was close (< 0.5 mm) to the margin (RM+), while in 43 cases (69.4%) the margins were negative (RM-). At surgery, 21 out of 62 cases (33.9%) were HPV+ (47.4% RM+, 27.9% RM-) and 13 turned HPV- at the control typing. From the 41 out of 62 (66.1%) initially HPV-cases, 12 turned into HPV+. Cytological follow-up was abnormal (ASC+) in 65% HPV+ cases, whereas all HPV- were WNL.Post-operative HPV testing with HC-II is well-suited to detecting women with residual HPV infection, even in cases with negative surgical margins. Furthermore, HPV testing at surgery could replace endocervical curettage and help in distinguishing true residual disease from reinfections.
