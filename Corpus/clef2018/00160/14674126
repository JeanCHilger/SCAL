Quantity estimation of the E2/E6 HPV gene products ratio can be a prognostic marker for the stage of the cervical cancer carcinogenesis. Cervical cancerogenesis is presently considered to be connected with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of cervical epithelial cells. Genomic integration of an HPV DNA into epithelial cells is a probable factor increasing cervical carcinoma incidence.Of the study was to evaluate the calculated ratios of HPV 16 gene amplification products with multiplex PCR. We estimated quantitive ratios of HPV 16 genes: E6, E1, E2, and L1.Ninety three cervical carcinoma cases were included into the analysis after detecting DNA HPV16 presence in primary lesion. We isolated DNA from cervical smears.We discovered statistically significant difference in low E2/E6 (< 0.4) amplification ratio patients staged IIa and in stages more advanced than IIa (p = 0.03). Moreover, we observed high E2/E6 amplification ratio in patients negative for lymph-node metastases (according to postoperative pathological report).
