Can human papillomavirus DNA testing substitute for cytology in the detection of high-grade cervical lesions? High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causal factors of cervical carcinomas.To evaluate the sensitivity and efficiency of HPV DNA testing in comparison with conventional cytology for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer.Both testing procedures were administered to 593 women, aged 14 to 88 years (average, 41.7 years), who were referred for abnormal cytology from January 2000 through December 2001 at Korea University Guro Hospital (Seoul, Korea). After histologic confirmation by either colposcopically directed biopsy or endocervical curettage, the efficiency of the detection methods for high-grade cervical lesion was evaluated for the following 3 data sets: HPV DNA testing, conventional cytology, and the 2 tests combined.The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive, and negative predictive values for the detection of CIN 2 or higher were 92.4%, 52.4%, 49.3%, and 93.2% for HPV DNA testing 76.3%, 65.8%, 52.8%, and 84.7% for cytologyHuman papillomavirus DNA testing for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions was more sensitive than cytology alone. In addition, the screening sensitivity can be further improved by combining cytology with HPV DNA testing. This approach is especially beneficial in detecting cancer precursors in women older than 60 years.
