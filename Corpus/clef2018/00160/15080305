High-risk human papillomavirus detection: a split-sample comparison of hybrid capture and chromogenic in situ hybridization. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) has proposed high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as the "preferred" triage for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. We studied 401 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance liquid-based cervicovaginal cytology split samples for HPV by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and by Hybrid Capture (HC) II (Digene, Gaithersburg, MD) 202 underwent HC II followed by CISH, and 199 underwent CISH followed by HC II. Of 401 vials, 101 (25.2%) were positive for HPV by 1 or more methods. HC II labeled 83 of 401 (20.7%) samples as positive, while 38 of 401 (9.5%) were positive by CISH. Positive attributes of CISH include the provision of a cytomorphologic link in assessing HPV positivity and comparative ease of use in laboratories without trained molecular diagnosticians. Greater efficacy and quantitative design are advantages of HC II. Comparing data by sequence of testing showed a lower likelihood of positive test results on the second ancillary test than on the first ancillary test, regardless of age or testing method (odds ratio, second/first = 0.58
