Reports: plasma and dietary phytoestrogens and risk of premalignant lesions of the cervix. A number of epidemiological studies have observed an inverse association between phytoestrogens and risk of certain hormonally dependent cancers. We undertook an exploratory analysis of the relationship between specific phytoestrogens and premalignant cervical lesions. A case-control study of 122 women with histologically confirmed cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) of the cervix and 183 cytologically normal controls was conducted from 1992 to 1996 in Honolulu, Hawaii. A cervical cell sample was obtained for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. Dietary information was collected using a structured survey, and a fasting blood sample was taken for measurement of five isoflavonoids (genistein, glycitein, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin, and equol), two flavonoids (hesperetin and naringenin), and two lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone). Plasma levels of equol and enterodiol were positively associated with cervical SIL risk: odds ratio, OR = 6.5 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.4-29.2
