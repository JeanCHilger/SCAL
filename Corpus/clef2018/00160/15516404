Natural history of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women with human immunodeficiency virus. We sought to estimate rates of progression and regression of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) among women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).In a multicenter prospective cohort study, HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative women were evaluated colposcopically after receiving an abnormal cytology test result between November 1994 and September 2002. Women with CIN 1 were included, except those who had undergone hysterectomy, cervical therapy, or had CIN 2-3 or cervical cancer. Those women who were included were followed cytologically twice yearly, with colposcopy repeated for atypia or worse.We followed 223 women with CIN 1 (202 HIV seropositive and 21 HIV seronegative) for a mean of 3.3 person-years. Progression occurred in 8 HIV-seropositive women (incidence density, 1.2/100 person-years 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-2.4/100 person-years) and in no HIV seronegative women. Regression occurred in 66 (33%) HIV-seropositive women (13/100 person-years, 95% CI 10-16/100 person-years) versus 14 (67%) seronegative women (32/100 person-years, relative risk 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.66Grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia infrequently progresses in women with HIV. Thus, observation appears safe absent other indications for treatment.II-1.
