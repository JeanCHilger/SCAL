Reflex high-risk human papillomavirus testing for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance in cytologic smears: effects since implementation in a large clinical practice. Reflex high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing often is used in the management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance identified in cervicovaginal screening. Following implementation of reflex testing, our laboratory processed 8,022 specimens during a 20-month period sufficient material was available for testing in 7,334 specimens. High-risk HPV was detected in 34.10% of these specimens. Detection rates varied with age, with positive rates as high as 58.46% in women 20 years old or younger, decreasing to 14.58% in women older than 35 years. The detection rate, categorized in 5-year age increments, showed a significant decrease until after 35 years, when the rate remained fairly constant (P < .0001). The detection rate decreased over the time of the study. These results demonstrate that high-risk HPV detection might vary according to the age mix of the population tested and the interval after implementation of testing.
