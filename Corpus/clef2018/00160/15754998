Human papillomavirus infection in relation to mild dyskaryosis in conventional cervical cytology. To establish the prevalence and distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in Slovene women with repeat mild dyskaryosis, and to evaluate three molecular methods for the detection of HPV that could be used as a complementary method to cervical cytology.In this prospective study 148 women with three subsequent cervical cytologic tests within two years showing mild dyskaryosis were enrolled. HPV infection was determined using three molecular tests: Hybrid Capture II and two variants of polymerase chain reaction (PCR-PGMY11/PGMY09 and PCR-CPI/CPIIG).HPV was detected in 17 of the 45 women aged < or =30 years and in 21 of the 103 women aged >30 years (37.8% vs 20.4%, p = 0.04). The most common genotype was HPV 16 detected in eight (21.1%) women, the next were HPV 53 and HPV 51, each detected in five (13.2 %) women. The three molecular methods matched in 92.9%.Low prevalence of HPV infections indicates that cervical screening programmes in Slovenia are overburdened with mild dyskaryosis. Repeat cytology is not reliable HPV testing might be useful as a complementary method.
