High levels of HPV-16 DNA are associated with high-grade cervical lesions in women at risk or infected with HIV. To examine associations between levels of episomal and integrated human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA and the grade of cervical disease.Cross-sectional data were obtained from a cohort of women with and without HIV infection and with high-risk sexual behaviour.Episomal and integrated HPV-16 DNA loads were measured in cervicovaginal lavages collected from 75 women (58 HIV seropositive, 17 HIV seronegative) using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays, controlling for cell content and the presence of inhibitors.HPV-16 viral loads were significantly higher in women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (n = 6) than in women with normal cytology (n = 44), whether total (10(8.28) versus 10(5.10) HPV-16 DNA copies/microg DNA), episomal (10(7.99) versus 10(4.61)) or integrated (10(7.95) versus 10(4.77)) HPV-16 viral loads were measured (P < 0.02 for each comparison). Thirty-nine women had colposcopy [11 normal cervix, 16 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, six CIN 2, six CIN 3] and 24 additional women had three consecutive normal cytology smears. Controlling for age, race, CD4 cell count and HIV status, total (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.4 P = 0.02), episomal (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-7.4Higher HPV-16 DNA loads are associated with cervical lesions detected by either histology or cytology. No additional information is gained by measuring integrated or episomal over total HPV-16 DNA loads.
