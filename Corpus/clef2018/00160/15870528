Should liquid-based cytology be repeated at the time of colposcopy? To evaluate the usefulness of repeated liquid cytology at the time of colposcopy.We screened 5,100 women with liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. Women with any abnormal cytology result including atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or a positive high-risk HPV DNA test result were referred for colposcopy. One thousand three hundred thirty-three women returned for colposcopy with repeated cytology and cervical biopsy.Twenty-one women had less than high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) screening cytology and cervical biopsy results however, their repeated cytology at the colposcopy visit revealed HSIL, and excisional treatment was recommended. Repeated cytology at colposcopy significantly changed the clinical management for 1.6% (21) of 1,333 women.As an adjunct test to colposcopy, liquid cytology was similar to conventional cytology. Given current practice patterns, repeated liquid cytology at the time of colposcopy is rarely clinically useful.
