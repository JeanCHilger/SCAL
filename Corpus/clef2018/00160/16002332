Quantitative analysis of human papillomavirus type 16 in cervical neoplasm: a study in Chinese population. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was recognized as a major causal factor for the development and progression of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). It is possible to use HPV test for the detection of cervical lesions as an adjunct to cervical cytology.To evaluate the relation between HPV 16 viral load and the severity of cervical lesions in a Chinese population.Study population was recruited from the colposcopy and general outpatient clinic. The presence of HPV 16 E6 and E7 in cytological specimens was detected using HPV 16 specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The viral load in the specimens that were positive for HPV 16 specific PCR, was quantified by using real-time PCR assay.The study recruited 394 women, in which 148 were high-grade SIL (HG-L), 121 were low-grade SIL (LG-L) and 125 were Normal. Sufficient DNA integrity was proven in 347 samples. Among 121 positive cases for HPV 16, 70 were HG-L, 34 were LG-L and 17 were Normal. Using quantitative real-time PCR, the percentages of samples with greater DNA copies were found to increase with the severity of diseases. There was also a significant difference in DNA copies among the three groups (HG-L versus Normal, p<0.001 HG-L versus LG-L, p<0.001). Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the HG-L versus LG-L and Normal was 0.836 indicating that quantitative PCR had a good diagnostic value in differentiating HG-L from the LG-L and Normal groups.Our data suggested HPV 16 viral load was significantly related to the severity of cervical lesions. Evaluation of viral burden could be a potential clinical tool in management of cervical lesions.
