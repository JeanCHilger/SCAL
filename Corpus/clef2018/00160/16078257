Anal cytology: is there a role for reflex HPV DNA testing? There is an increased incidence of anal squamous carcinoma and its precursor lesions (anal intraepithelial neoplasia [AIN]) among persons who engage in anal-receptive sex. Analogous to cervical cancer screening, anal Papanicplaou (Pap) smears currently are used to screen these high-risk populations. Human papilloma virus (HPV) has been implicated in anal carcinoma pathogenesis and this study was performed to assess the potential role of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to anal cytology. We correlated cytological diagnoses and HPV DNA (Digene Hybrid Capture [HC II] assay) in anal specimens collected in SurePath liquid medium from 118 patients 54.8% of cases diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and 87.8% diagnosed as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or above tested positive for high- risk HPV DNA (B+). High-grade SIL (HSIL) was present in 31 of the 51 patients with follow-up. Although a cytological diagnosis of ASC-US or above was a reliable indicator for AIN, cytology frequently did not accurately predict the grade of SIL in subsequent biopsy. Our findings suggest that reflex HPV DNA testing would be helpful in triaging patients diagnosed with ASC-US. However, patients diagnosed with LSIL or above should go directly to ansocopic biopsy.
