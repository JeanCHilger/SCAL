Occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in generally healthy women with exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata. To disclose possible association between exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in generally healthy, sexually active women.This retrospective study included 74 patients (study group) who were referred for laser vaporization therapy of exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata, and 88 asymptomatic volunteers without evidence of exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata (control group) who were referred for screening Papanicolaou (Pap) test cervical evaluation including colposcopy. The diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was based on Pap smear, colposcopy and/or biopsy.On Pap smear, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were found in 10 (13.5%) women with exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata and in 2 (2.3%) asymptomatic volunteers (p < 0.05). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was found in 8 women with exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata and in none of the asymptomatic volunteers (p < 0.05).An association was found between exophytic vulvar condyloma acuminata and abnormal Pap smear or positive cervical biopsy, in generally healthy women.
