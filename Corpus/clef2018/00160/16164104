Pap tests and HPV infection. Advances in screening and interpretation. The natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) is not yet completely understood. But over the past decade, there has been an explosion in knowledge about the virus and its relationship to precancerous and cancerous changes in the genital tract. Recent research in the management of Pap testing, new technologies for Pap screening, and easy access to HPV tests have changed the treatment recommendations in patients with abnormal cytologic results. In this article, Dr Buechler explores these advances and explains how they affect the clinical management of patients with abnormal Pap test results.
