Outcome of women with index smear showing mild dyskaryosis: effects of age and evidence of HPV infection. Recent national guidelines (NHSCSP Document 20) recommend colposcopy referral after one mildly dyskaryotic smear, compared with the current practice of cytological surveillance and referral if the abnormality persists. The aim of this study was to identify the percentage of women whose first abnormal smear, showing mild dyskaryosis, returned to normal with cytological surveillance. Colposcopy could therefore be avoided in this group. This study also assessed whether age or human papillomavirus (HPV) status affected this outcome and the impact of non-attenders on the reliability of surveillance.This was a retrospective study examining the follow-up of 1484 women whose first abnormal smear showed mild dyskaryosis between 1996 and 1998. The possible outcomes were: persisting abnormality referred to colposcopy, follow-up by cytology alone (negative follow-up), lost to follow-up or moved out of the area. Results were further assessed in terms of age (over or under 35 years) and cytological evidence of HPV effect.In this study 50.9% of women, presenting with a mildly dyskaryotic smear, returned to normal without colposcopy within the follow-up period of 6-8 years. Age (over/under 35) or cytological evidence of HPV did not significantly affect this figure.Immediate colposcopy would overtreat 50% of the study group resulting in 159 extra colposcopies in this unit per year. High-grade abnormalities were twice as prevalent (22% versus 11%) in the younger age group, suggesting that younger rather than older women would benefit from immediate referral.
