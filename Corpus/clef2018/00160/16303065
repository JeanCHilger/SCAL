Self-sampling versus physician-sampling for human papillomavirus testing. We evaluated the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection using two sampling methods of cervical exfoliated cells, consisting of self-sampling of vaginal cells and cervical sampling performed by the physician. Women included were 379 patients of the general population attending outpatient clinics in Northern Greece for routine cytological cervical dysplasia screening. HPV DNA detection was similar with both sampling techniques. The HPV prevalences in self-collected samples were 4.7% and 3.7% in the physician-collected samples (P>0.05). The Kappa statistic for HPV DNA agreement between the two methods was 0.54 (95% Confidence interval = 0.33-0.75). Self-sampling of cervico-vaginal exfoliated cells could be used as an alternative option to test for HPV infection.
