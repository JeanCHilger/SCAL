Colpo-cyto-histological correlations in intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficiency of colposcopic findings as diagnostic tests for intraepithelial lesion using the analysis of colpo-cyto-histological correlations. The results of 3340 colposcopic tests performed in the Colposcopy Unit of the Second Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology between March 1990 and May 1991 were analysed, taking into account 326 (9.7%) cases of Abnormal Transformation Zone (ANTZ). The colpo-histological correlation in ANTZ 1 cases (52 cases of white epithelium, 92 standard mosaic, 42 standard dotted and 61 mixed cases) was 65.2% (52.3%) for HPV 12.9% for CIN). The colpo-histological correlation in ANTZ 2 cases (30 cases of thickened white epithelium, 5 irregular mosaic, 4 irregular dotted, 2 atypical vessels, 4 thickened gland outlets and 6 mixed cases) was 70.5% (43.3% for HPV
