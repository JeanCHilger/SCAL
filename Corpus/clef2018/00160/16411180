Role of P16(INK4a) expression in identifying CIN2 or more severe lesions among HPV-positive patients referred for colposcopy after abnormal cytology. p16 is strongly overexpressed in dysplastic cervical cells because of the transforming activity of the E7 oncogene of all high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types and may be easily revealed by immunochemistry: p16 may, therefore, be considered a surrogate marker for the activated oncogene expression of HR-HPV in dysplastic cervical cells.HPV and p16(INK4a) testing were performed in a consecutive series of 283 patients with abnormal cytology referred to colposcopy assessment or follow-up. Triage of patients to colposcopy by HPV or HPV and p16 testing was simulated, and the relative sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of HPV and p16 testing for > CIN2 lesions was determined as well as the cost balance of the two triage types.Compared to current protocol, triage by HPV testing reduced the number of colposcopies by 44.2%, but also reduced the > CIN2 detection rate by 10.7%, and was associated with a cost of euro 54.16 per assessed woman and of euro 613.20 per > CIN2 detected. Compared with current protocol, triage by HPV and p16 testing combined reduced the number of colposcopies by 73.1%, but reduced > CIN2 detection rate by 21.5%, and was associated with a cost of euro 54.73 per woman assessed and of euro 704.09 per > CIN2 detected.Triage by HPV and p16 improves considerably the PPV of diagnostic assessment, but decreases > CIN2 detection rate, and is associated with substantially higher costs. Further decrease of molecular immunochemistry testing due to technological progress may allow HPV and p16 testing to become a cost effective procedure in the future.
