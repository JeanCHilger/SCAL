Evidence of human papillomavirus infection, enhanced phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, and decreased apoptosis in sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix. Sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma (SSCC) of the uterine cervix, characterized by biphasic components of sarcomatoid and squamous neoplastic cells, is a rare entity with uncertain pathogenesis. To date, less than 20 cases have been mentioned. Although the rarity of this diagnosis makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from limited data, it does seem that SSCC is an aggressive tumor. In this study, we present a 31-year-old patient with abnormal vaginal bleeding. The diagnosis of SSCC was confirmed through pathologic examinations from hysterectomy specimen. Its epithelial origin was demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies. The expression of p53, HER2/neu, and c-kit was not enhanced in this tumor. Importantly, it was human papillomavirus type 16, positive by polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization studies. Enhanced immunostaining for phospho-retinoblastoma protein and decreased apoptosis compared with the squamous cell carcinoma counterpart were observed. This report characterizes the first description of molecular features in SSCC that may account for its aggressive behavior.
