Cervical cancer screening: state of the art. The objective of cervical cancer screening is to prevent the occurrence of and death from cervical cancer by detecting and treating high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. A significant decline in occurrence and mortality from cervical cancer in developed countries has been associated with the application of organized cervical screening programs. The use of the available local health methods in cervical cancer screening can be adjusted in different countries. This review discusses the recent results in traditional and alternative cervical cancer screening.The current recommendations of both the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concerning clinical practice guidelines for cervical cancer screening are commented upon. New methods and new technology for cervical cancer screening are described. Attributable failure factors in the screening process, particularly in the coverage, are analyzed. A critical assessment of the suitability of local cervical cancer screening resources is discussed.Screening is clearly a complex multifactorial process, not a test. Nowadays, with the human papillomavirus vaccine on the horizon, screening is the best strategy for cervical cancer control. Good screening programs, with high coverage, quality control and follow-up included, are the basis of obtaining better results. The Papanicolaou test and its variants are the best methods of cervical cancer screening in high-resource settings. Alternative visual inspection using cervical dyes could be the most useful method in low-resource settings. The challenge for the future may be less of a technical nature and more dependent on local finances and screening policies.
