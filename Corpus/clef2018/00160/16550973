The level of antibody against E6 HPV 16 oncoprotein in blood sera of women with chronic HPV 16 infection and cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to estimate of the role of chronic HPV 16 infection and the presence of anti E6 HPV 16 in the initiation of the cancerogenesis process of cervical cancer.The study included two groups of patients. The first group comprised 323 women observed for three consecutive years (1998-2000), in whom the presence of HPV 16 viruses was estimated by PCR, and the level of anti E6 HPV 16 antibodies was estimated in the plasma with ELISA. A similar test was performed in a group of 46 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 91 patients with invasive cervical cancer and 22 women after hysterectomy and RTG-therapy.In 32 patients, chronic HPV 16 infection showed a steady rise in the mean absorbance level of anti E6 HPV 16 antibodies from 0.04 in 1998 to 0.06 in 2000, while in HPV-negative women the mean absorbance value was 0.03-0.04. Mean absorbance value in patients with CIN III and invasive cancer rose with advancing stage of the cancer process and lowered after completion of oncological treatment. The values were 0.14, 0.33 and 0.13, respectively.The persistence of chronic HPV 16 infection and accompanying steady rise in absorbance index caused by an increase in the level of antiviral antibodies are a clear warning signal preceding in time the histological process of cancerogenesis.
