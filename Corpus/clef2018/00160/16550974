Immunohistochemical detection of HPV proteins and c-erbB receptors in cervical lesion specimens from young women. The intention of the present study was to assess immunohistochemically the expression of c-erbB receptor family in cervical carcinoma specimens of young women. Simultaneously, HPV was detected in the same specimens using immunohistochemical assays. Seventy-five cervical intraepithelial and invasive cancer specimens were assessed retrospectively. Positive c-erbB-2 immunostaining was revealed in 11.7% of tumor specimens, while for c-erbB-3 and c-erbB-4 receptor the corresponding figures were 32% and 49.3%, respectively. Concerning HPV infection-markers, positive immunostaining was found in 31% of cases, while coilocytes were detected in 64% of patients. The correlation of c-erbB receptor expression with malignant aggressiveness in cervical cancer cells concurs with similar data regarding other neoplasias, thus rendering these receptors an important predictive factor and future therapeutic target.
