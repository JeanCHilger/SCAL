Uterine cervical lesions during pregnancy: diagnosis and management. To define a practical attitude for the management of pregnant women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.Review of the literature indexed in Medline.The prevalence of the HPV infections is unchanged among pregnant women with infection by low risk viruses. The viral load increases at the time of the pregnancy, and decreases in the post-partum period. Cervical cytology is easily to perform with reliable results: among the 5% of pathological cervical smears, low grade lesions predominate. The high grade smears require colposcopic exploration, usefully completed by directed biopsies to rule out invasive lesions. Surveillance of high grade CIN is required during pregnancy with post-partum control most regress. In France during the year 2000, 189 cancers of the uterine cervix were detected during 774.782 pregnancies. Clinical diagnosis is delayed by the non specific clinical signs and the histological aspects of the lesions which are identical with those observed in young woman. The intrinsic outcome of cancer is not modified by pregnancy, and the cesarean section is often preferred (vaginal delivery likely facilitates vascular dissemination). For fetal reasons, a therapeutic delay can be proposed for small sized lesions with a favourable histological subtype and no progression after 20 weeks of gestation.Pregnancy offers the opportunity to perform cervical smears in women not regularly followed. A conservative attitude with a revaluation in postpartum can be proposed in the event of diagnosis of CIN during pregnancy. Pregnancy has little influence on invasive cervical cancers. Management decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis.
