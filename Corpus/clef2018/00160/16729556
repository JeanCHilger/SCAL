Fostering acceptance of human papillomavirus vaccines. Multivalent prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines currently in the late stages of clinical testing are safe, immunogenic, and efficacious and phase 3 tests of a quadrivalent vaccine show that it is 100% effective at preventing HPV types 16 and 18-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, and cervical cancer through 2 years of postvaccination follow-up. These vaccines promise to reduce the burden of HPV-related disease. Realizing the full benefit of these vaccines will require a vaccination program that addresses the needs and concerns of healthcare providers, parents, and young adolescent patients who will be involved in the vaccine decisionmaking process. Osteopathic physicians, by virtue of their dedication to holistic care, are in an optimal position to play a key role in facilitating acceptance of these vaccines among potential vaccinees and their parents and guardians.
