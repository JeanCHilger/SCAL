Molecular cytogenetic characterization of human papillomavirus16-transformed foreskin keratinocyte cell line 16-MT. Anogenital cancers are closely associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), and HPV-infected individuals, particularly those with high-grade dysplasias, are at increased risk for cervical and anal cancers. Although genomic instability has been documented in HPV-infected keratinocytes, the full spectrum of genetic changes in HPV-associated lesions has not been fully defined. To address this, we examined an HPV16-transformed foreskin keratinocyte cell line, 16-MT, by GTG-banding, spectral karyotyping (SKY), and array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) these analyses revealed multiple numerical, complex, and cryptic chromosome rearrangements. Based on GTG-banding, the 16-MT karyotype was interpreted as 78-83,XXY,+add(1)(p36.3),+3,+4,+5,+5,+7,+8,+i(8)(q10)x2,+10,?der(12),der(13
