Efficiency of three surgical procedures in eliminating high-risk human papillomavirus infection in women with precancerous cervical lesions. To establish the efficiency of laser vaporization (LV), large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) and cold knife conization, done for precancerous cervical lesions, in eliminating high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Additionally, we determined whether the same HPV genotype persisted after surgery.A total of 214 women were tested for HPV infection by the Hybrid Capture II (HCII) test prior to surgery. HPV-positive women were followed by HCII test ten months after surgery. In persistently HPV-positive women, HPV genotypes were determined by PCR - PGMY09/PGMY11.The HCII test showed elimination of HPV infection after LV, LLETZ and cold knife conization in 67.6%, 86.3%, and 100% (p < 0.05) of women, respectively. In seven (38.9%) women a different HPV genotype was found to be present after surgery, the corrected efficiency thus being 79.4%, 92.7% and 100% (p = NS), respectively.The three analyzed surgical procedures are effective in eliminating high-risk HPV infection. HPV testing is useful at follow-up, since it can identify a small proportion of women requiring close surveillance and potential treatment.
