Pilot study of a commercialized human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping assay: comparison of HPV risk group to cytology and histology. We evaluated a commercialized PCR assay, Linear Array, that detects 37 human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, using a sample of liquid cytology specimens (n = 534). We found a strong association of an increasing level of HPV risk (HPV type 16 [HPV16] > HPV18 > other carcinogenic types > noncarcinogenic types > negative specimens) with increasing severities of cytologic interpretations (P(Trend) < 0.0005) and histologic diagnoses (P(Trend) < 0.0005).
