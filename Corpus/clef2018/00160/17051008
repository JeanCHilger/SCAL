Human papillomavirus testing and conventional pap smear cytology as optional screening tools of women at different risks for cervical cancer in the countries of the former soviet union. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and the single most important etiological agent of cervical cancer. In parallel with the increase of STDs and because of the lack of any organized cancer screening in the new independent states of the former Soviet Union, the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are rapidly rising. This is the first report from an ongoing European Commission-funded (INCO-Copernicus Program) cross-sectional and cohort study (focused on the key issues of this major health problem in the new independent states) analyzing the performance of the HPV DNA (Hybrid Capture II) test as a potential screening tool for cervical cancer in these countries.A series of 3,175 women (screening, gynecological, or STD patients) from six clinics in Russia, Belarus, and Latvia received routine cytology and HPV testing with Hybrid Capture II (HCII). All women with HPV-positive results or abnormalities in cytology were subjected to colposcopy and biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristics, as well as positive (PPV) and negative predicting values (NPV), were determined for HCII and quality-controlled cytology in detecting significant pathology (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 3 and cancer).Significant pathology was strongly associated with high-grade cytology (odds ratio [OR] = 8.5 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-17.8HCII assay is a sensitive tool in detecting significant pathology, but less specific than the Pap test. A negative HCII test practically precludes high-grade CIN (NPV, >95%). Because the performance characteristics of the HCII test depend on the prevalence of HPV and CIN in the study population, the cost-benefit issues in different settings will be the limiting factor for the application of this test as a screening tool.
