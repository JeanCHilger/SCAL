Predictive value of HPV DNA in lymph nodes in surgically treated cervical carcinoma patients--a prospective study. High-risk types of HPV are etiological factors in cervical cancer. Lymph node involvement in cervical cancer patients reduces 5-year survival rates by 25-60%. However, the influence on survival of HPV DNA positivity in histopathologically negative lymph nodes remains unresolved.The study included 116 of 148 patients who underwent Piver type III radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who showed HPV DNA positivity in the primary lesion. Lymph node tissues were tested for the presence of HPV DNA, using a PCR technique.We found the presence of HPV DNA sequences in lymph nodes dissected intraoperatively in 81 (69.83%) cases. In analysis, we compared patients from 3 groups: HPV- and metastatic-negative (LN HPV-M-) HPV-positive metastatic-negative (LN HPV+M-)We conclude that the presence of HPV DNA in lymph nodes is an early sign of metastasis and should be treated as such in prognostic outlook and planning the therapeutic strategy.
