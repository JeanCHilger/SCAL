Multiple biomarkers in molecular oncology. I. Molecular diagnostics applications in cervical cancer detection. The screening for cervical carcinoma and its malignant precursors (cervical neoplasia) currently employs morphology-based detection methods (Papanicolaou [Pap] smear) in addition to the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus. The combination of the Pap smear with human papillomavirus testing has achieved significant improvements in sensitivity for the detection of cervical disease. Diagnosis of cervical neoplasia is dependent upon histology assessment of cervical biopsy specimens. Attempts to improve the specificity of cervical disease screening have focused on the investigation of molecular biomarkers for adjunctive use in combination with the Pap smear. Active research into the genomic and proteomic alterations that occur during human papillomavirus-induced neoplastic transformation have begun to characterize some of the basic mechanisms inherent to the disease process of cervical cancer development. This research continues to demonstrate the complexity of multiple genomic and proteomic alterations that accumulate during the tumorigenesis process. Despite this diversity, basic patterns of uncontrolled signal transduction, cell cycle deregulation, activation of DNA replication and altered extracellular matrix interactions are beginning to emerge as common features inherent to cervical cancer development. Some of these gene or protein expression alterations have been investigated as potential biomarkers for screening and diagnostics applications. The contribution of multiple gene alterations in the development of cervical cancer suggests that the application of multiple biomarker panels has the potential to develop clinically useful molecular diagnostics. In this review, the application of biomarkers for the improvement of sensitivity and specificity of the detection of cervical neoplasia within cytology specimens will be discussed.
