Anogenital warts knowledge and counseling practices of US clinicians: results from a national survey. To examine messages US clinicians use when counseling patients diagnosed with anogenital warts.In mid-2004, we conducted a confidential mail survey of nationally representative samples of physicians practicing internal and adolescent medicine, family/general practice, obstetrics/gynecology, urology, or dermatology nurse midwivesAfter adjusting for survey eligibility, 81% responded. Most (89%) were aware that human papillomavirus (HPV) causes anogenital warts, but only 48% were aware that oncogenic and wart-related HPV genotypes usually differ. Most (>95%) clinicians reported telling patients with warts that warts are an STD, are caused by a virus, or that their sex partners may have or may acquire warts. Many clinicians (>/=85%) also reported discussing STD prevention or assessing STD risk with such patients. Most reported addressing ways to prevent HPV (89%), including using condoms limiting sex partners or practicing monogamyMost surveyed clinicians appropriately counseled patients about the cause and prevention of anogenital warts. However, many clinicians were unaware that oncogenic and wart-related HPV types usually differ, and this may explain why many reported recommending more aggressive cervical cancer screening for female patients with warts.
