Genital human papilloma virus infection in mentally-institutionalized virgins. Human papilloma virus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer. Risk factors for HPV infection are primarily related to sexual behavior. We determined the prevalence of HPV infection and abnormal cervical cytology in institutionalized women with no previous sexual experience.The study subjects were 251 patients who sought screening for cervical cancer (45.9+/-9.4 years, mean+/-S.D., range, 14 to 66). They were institutionalized for psychosomatic disorders since childhood, and had no previous sexual experience. In addition to screening for cervical cancer, specimens for HPV testing were collected.No women who were positive for HPV DNA was detected, though 251 women without sexual experiences were screened by the hybrid capture 2 test including 26 types of HPV-DNA.Transmission through means other than sexual intercourse may not exist because we could not detect HPV DNA in 251 women with no previous sexual experience.
