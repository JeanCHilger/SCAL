Cost-utility analysis of vaccination against HPV in Israel. Using WHO-CHOICE methodology, we calculated cost-utility ratios for various interventions (PAP smear, HPV-DNA testing, VIA and vaccination against HPV) at various frequencies to reduce the burden of cervical cancer and condyloma (in the case of the HPV vaccination) in Israel, which has a low prevalence of cervical cancer. Assuming non-waning efficacy, HPV vaccinations will become cost-effective, very cost-effective and cost saving when the cost per dose falls below $96.85, $50.42 and $27.20, respectively. Attempts should be made to raise compliancy with PAP smears from the current opportunistic 12.2-20.0% per annum either before and/or after the vaccination is introduced.
