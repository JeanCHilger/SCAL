The clinical significance and management of cervico-cytologically diagnosed ASCUS/LSIL. To investigate the clinical significance and management of ASCUS/LSIL.254 patients who were examined with cervical cytology in the Cancer Institute and Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were ASCUS/LSIL, of whom 136 cases underwent colposcopy, Data were analyzed retrospectively according to the golden criterion of pathology outcome.140 cases were ASCUS, and 114 cases were LSIL. Cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) were diagnosed in 51.5% of patients with ASCUS, compared with 59.6% of patients with LSIL (P>0.05). High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were diagnosed in 22.9% of patients with ASCUS, compared with 30.7% of patients with LSIL (P >0.05). In the 136 patients examined with colposcopy, inflammation was found in 47 cases, low-grade intraepithelial lesion in 53 cases, High-grade intraepithelial lesion in 36 cases. The pathological results show inflammation in 55 cases, low-grade intraepithelial lesion in 41 cases, High-grade intraepithelial lesion in 40 cases (Kappa=0.314, U=0.064, P less than 0.05). CIN were diagnosed in 79% (67/84) of HPV-positive patients identified by pathology, compared with 43.5% (74/170) of HPV-negative patients (chi2=29.88 P less than 0.05). 83.5% of 254 patients were between 35 to 55 years old, and that was consistent with HPV-positive women age peak.Patients with ASCUS should be paid the same attention with LSIL patients and colposcopy examination should be done immediately to avoid missed diagnosis and missed follow-up examination, especially for HPV positive patients between 35 to 55 years old.
