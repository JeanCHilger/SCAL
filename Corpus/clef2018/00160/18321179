The prevalence of cervical HPV and cytological abnormalities in association with reproductive factors of rural Nigerian women. To estimate the prevalence of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytological abnormalities while addressing demographic and reproductive variables in a sample of rural Nigerian patients.In March 2004, a medical project was conducted in Okene, Nigeria. The obstetrics/gynecology team collected demographics of 231 patients and 199 ThinPrep Pap smears (Cytyc, Marlborough, MA), which were analyzed cytologically and for the presence of HPV DNA.Of 231 patients (mean age 32.2), 76% had seen a physician four times or less. From 199 Pap smears performed, 21.6% had high-risk (HR) HPV, low-risk (LR) HPV, or both. HR HPV was present in 16.6% of the women. There were 13 (6.5%) abnormal Pap smears, of which 9 (4.5%) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 1 (0.5%) had atypical glandular cells (AGC), 2 (1%) had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 1 (0.5%) had a high-grade SIL (HSIL). Other findings were Trichomonas vaginalis in 18 patients (9%) and Candida in 27 patients (13.5%).The prevalence of cervical HPV and SIL in Okene, Nigeria, is consistent with reports from other African regions. Improved access to healthcare and cervical cancer screening programs may help to decrease transmission of HPV and subsequent cervical cancer in underprivileged areas.
