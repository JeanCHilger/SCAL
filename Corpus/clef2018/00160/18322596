Effect of Nocardia rubra cell wall skeleton (Nr-CWS) on oncogenicity of TC-1 cells and anti-human papillomavirus effect of Nr-CWS in lower genital tract of women. To detect the effect of Nocardia rubra cell wall skeleton (Nr-CWS) on tumorigenicity induced by TC-1 cells and to clinically study anti-human papillomavirus effect of Nr-CWS in lower genital tract of women.Tumor model was established by injecting TC-1 cells subcutaneously in SCID mice, then divided them into 3 groups randomly and injected with isovolumetric physiological saline, 60 micrograms/ml Nr-CWS and 120 micrograms/ml Nr-CWS respectively, the growth of tumors was measured one week later. Nr-CWS was applied on 45 HPV positive women whose TCT test was normal and without cervical erosion 2-3 days after menstruation. HPV was detected again 3 months later to explore the effect of Nr-CWS on HPV infection in female lower genital tract.The animal experiment showed the weight of transplanted tumors in treated group was less than that of control group (chi2=12.5, P= 0.002). The tumor inhibition rate was 59.1 percent and 84.2 percent in the groups treated with Nr-CWS 60 and 120 micrograms/ml Nr-CWS the results of HPV detection in 23 out of the 45 cases (51.1 percent) became negative after the 3-month treatmentNr-CWS has an inhibitory effect to TC-1 cell tumorigenesis and clinical application of Nr-CWS may eliminate the HPV infection in lower genital tract of a considerable proportion of women with HPV infection.
