Detection of human papillomavirus genotypes with liquid bead microarray in cervical lesions of northern Chinese patients. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. Blending multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and multiplex hybridization to liquid bead microarray (LBMA), we detected and identified 25 common HPV genotypes using type-specific primers for HPV E6 and E7 genes in cervical lesions of northern Chinese patients. Of the 511 cervical samples, 349 (68.3%) were found to be HPV positive by HPV-LBMA. The distribution was 22 HPV positive of 100 in the control group (22%), 41 of 80 with chronic cervicitis (51%), 80 of 99 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I (81%), 46 of 56 with CIN II (82%), 67 of 74 with CIN III (90%), and 93 of 102 with invasive cervical carcinoma (91%). HPV-16 was the most frequent genotype in the CIN and cervical cancer groups. The most common genotypes were HPV-16 (28%), HPV-58 (14%), HPV-52 (14%), HPV-18 (8%), and HPV-33 (7%) in the CIN group, and HPV-16 (63%), HPV-52 (9%), HPV-18 (7%), HPV-58 (7%), and HPV-33 (5%) in the cervical cancer group. HPV-LBMA found multiple genotypes in 1 of 22 control (4%), 64 of 193 CIN (33%), and 22 of 93 cervical cancer (24%). The HPV-LBMA results were compatible with those of PCR and DNA sequencing. HPV-LBMA is a simple, high-throughput method that provides useful information on viral genotype and multiple HPV infections in cervical lesions. In northern China, the most common high-risk HPV genotypes seem to be HPV types 16, 58, 52, 18, and 33. Genetic information on HPV in cervical specimens could provide particular benefits in the management of cervical lesions.
