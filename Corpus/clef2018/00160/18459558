Unusual histologic finding in tissue obtained from voluntary pregnancy termination: a case report. An unusual histologic finding in tissue obtained from voluntary pregnancy termination (VPT) is reported to demonstrate the utility of pathologic examination of this specimen.A 30-year-old woman with a history of depression was referred to the gynecology clinic for VPT in the eighth week of gestation. Material obtained from uterine cavity curettage was macroscopically and histologically examined. Based on the histological findings, a molecular study by polymerase chain reaction amplification (PCR) was performed to evaluate the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA. For DNA extraction, 4-microm-thick histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and examined under a stereomicroscope. The PCR amplification was performed with the L1 consensus primers Gp5+/Gp6+, giving an expected PCR product size of 150 bp: these primers have been developed to allow the detection of a broad spectrum of mucosotropic HPV genotypes.Histological examination of tissue obtained from the VPT showed immature villi with post-abortive hydropic degeneration and the presence of a small fragment of cervical mucosa with a squamous intraepithelial lesion characterized by mild to moderate nuclear atypia (SIL). PCR revealed that this lesion was related to HPV. Subsequently, the pap smear and cervical biopsy revealed a high-risk squamous intraepithelial lesion due to high-risk HPV.This report demonstrates that tissue obtained from VPT cannot be considered normal "a priori" and that a histological study can be useful to provide new information regarding a woman's gynecological health.
