Frequency, persistence and recurrence of HPV lesions of the uterine cervix in HIV-seropositive women. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, persistence and risk of recurrence of human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions of the uterine cervix in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women.To determine the frequency of such lesions, we compared 148 HIV-positive patients with 4862 HIV-negative patients who had a cervical smear test in Toulouse university hospital. To determine the persistence and recurrence rate of the lesions, we prospectively followed 63 of the HIV-positive patients. Their follow-up was compared with that of 227 of the HIV-negative patients.Abnormal smears were much more frequent in HIV-positive patients (42 versus 5%, P<0.001). Persistence or aggravation of the lesions was also greater in HIV-positive patients (82 versus 43%, P<0.001). Lastly, the recurrence rate of dysplastic lesions after treatment was significantly higher in HIV-positive patients (64 versus 11%, P<0.001).As the frequency, persistence and risk of recurrence of cervical HPV lesions are very high in HIV-positive women, close gynecological surveillance of these patients is indispensable. Surveillance must not be restricted to the uterine cervix because of the frequency of multifocal lesions: vagina, vulva, perineum and anus. It must also be adapted to the severity of immunodeficiency and the patient's history.
