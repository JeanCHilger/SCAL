Correlation of high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes persistence and risk of residual or recurrent cervical disease after surgical treatment. The evidence on genotype-specific risk in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) with normal cytology and the importance of the distinction of high-risk (HR)-HPV genotypes in the management of low-grade lesions suggest that the distinction of HR-HPV genotypes has the potential to improve the follow-up of patients treated for high-grade cervical lesions. The aims of this study were to define the persistence of the different HR-HPV in the follow-up of surgical treated women, to detect the changes of genotypes from the pre- to the post-operative status, and to evaluate whether genotype-specific persistence can predict the development of residual or recurrent disease during the follow-up. HR-HPV detection and genotyping was carried out by the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test on cervical cytological samples from 72 women treated by surgery. The 6-month post-operative HPV status was correlated with the pre-operative HPV genotype and with the residual or recurrent disease within 24 months. It was observed that the residual or recurrent disease in women with persistence of HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 was higher (82.4%) than in women with persistence of at least one HR-HPV type of group 2 (HPV 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58) (66.7%) and at least one type of group 3 (HPV 39, 51, 56, 59, 68, 26, 53, 66, 73, and 82) (14.3%). These data defined HR-HPV groups for the risk of progression of disease and suggested that the identification of persistent infection with different HR-HPV genotypes has the potential to improve the management of these patients.
