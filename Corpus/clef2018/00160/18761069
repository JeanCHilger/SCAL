Inhibition effect of Guizhi-Fuling-decoction on the invasion of human cervical cancer. Guizhi-Fuling-decoction (GZFLD), a traditional Chinese medical formulation, exerts an anti-tumor effect, but the mechanisms of its action on invasive tumor inhibition have not been documented. The aims of this study were to identify the inhibitory effect of GZFLD on the invasive of cervical cancer and to elucidate the extensional mechanisms of its action.The invasive ability of HeLa cells was tested with Transwell chamber. The expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) were measured by zymography/reverse zymography, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Establish tumor-bearing mice model to assess the ability of GZFLD to inhibit tumor growth and angiopoiesis in vivo.We have found that GZFLD suppressed the invasive ability of HeLa cells, inhibited MMPs expressions and activities, increased TIMPs expressions and activities, and furthermore restored the MMPs-TIMPs balance in HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile in vivo, GZFLD had significantly inhibited tumor growth and angiopoiesis.In general, our results showed that GZFLD had inhibited the invasion of cervical cancer both in vitro and vivo. The inhibitory effects may be associated with restoring the MMPs-TIMPs balance, and then suppressing the degradation of extracellular matrix.
