Informational needs and the experiences of women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears. To describe the experience of women with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears with a particular focus on their informational needs.The small purposive sample consisted of 10 demographically diverse women with a history of at least one abnormal Pap smear, who attended one Women's Health outpatient clinic that typically serves a multiethnic, low-income population. Individual 30- to 60-min tape-recorded interviews were conducted, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed according to Colaizzi's eidetic method of phenomenological analysis. A manual categorizing strategy and a computer software (Qualrus, version 2.0) strategy were used for data management and coding.Six major themes emerged from the data: initial response to the diagnosis dealing with stigmaPatient education regarding abnormal Pap smears and HPV should address the concerns of those affected and should use message framing that informs but decreases stigmatization. Women should be offered the option of individualized informative and supportive counseling resources after initial disclosure of an abnormal Pap smear to adequately address concerns such as information for partners, the nature of HPV, an appropriate concept of cancer risk, and reassurance regarding potential effects on sexuality and fertility. Public information forums should address issues specific to high-risk HPV rather than generalization as an STD.
