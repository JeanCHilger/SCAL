Epidermoid anal carcinoma. Epidermoid carcinoma of the anus is a rare cancer, and conventionally affects elderly women. Its incidence is on the increase, at a younger age of onset, particularly within the male homosexual population. Main predisposing factors are sexually transmitted diseases and particularly human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, variety of sexual partners, smoking, homosexuality, history of uterine cervix cancer, and immunodepression. Warning signs of anal cancer are often non-specific. Therefore any atypical lesion should be systematically biopsied for histology. The evaluation assessment should include lung X-ray, abdominal CT scan, and often pelvis MNR or anal endosonography. Key prognostic factors are infiltration of the initial tumour and presence of lymph node metastasis. First-line treament of anal epidermoid carcinoma is radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy for extensive forms.
