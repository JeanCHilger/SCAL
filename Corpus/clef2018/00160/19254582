Type-specific prevalence and persistence of human papillomavirus in women in the United States who are referred for typing as a component of cervical cancer screening. The purpose of this study was to report type-specific prevalence and persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women who underwent cytologic screening.We examined HPV prevalence in 73,371 women who had type-specific HPV testing in 1 of 23 clinical laboratories in the United States. Persistence was evaluated in 963 women who were tested within 8-16 months of their index test.HPV was detected in 31% of the women, and high-risk HPV was detected in 23% of the women. HPV-16, -53, -52, and -31 were the most prevalent types. Of the 953 women with 2 tests, 39% of the women had persistent HPV infection. High-risk HPV persistence was detected in 34% of the women who were positive initially for high-risk HPV.Approximately one-third of our sample had HPV of those women who were retested within 8-16 months, more than one-third had persistent infection. Among women with high-risk HPV infections, the likelihood of persistence was highest with HPV genotypes that were phylogenetically similar to HPV-16.
