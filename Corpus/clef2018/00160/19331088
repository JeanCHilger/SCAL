Cervical cytology screening and management of abnormal cytology in adolescents. The consensus guidelines recognize adolescents as a special group and allow for more conservative follow- up of abnormal cytology and histology. The guidelines recognize the role of high rates of HPV infection and reinfection in teens, along with high rates of clearance of HPV and low rates of invasive cervical cancer. Risks of treatment are balanced with risk for disease progression. The cervical cancer vaccine is now recommended for teens. The approved vaccine protects against HPV related disease caused by four subtypes of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the vaccine as routine for 11- and 12-year-old girls. The vaccine is most effective prior to HPV exposure or before the sexual debut. In South Carolina only 4.8% of high school girls indicate having sexual intercourse before age 13. Vaccination provides an opportunity to review risky behaviors with adolescent patients and to encourage healthy, safe lifestyles. Vaccination is not protective for sexually transmitted infections and this can be emphasized at vaccination visits as well. The importance of cancer screening can also be reviewed with patients at vaccination visits.
