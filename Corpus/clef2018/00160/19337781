Functional implication of sequence variation in the long control region and E2 gene among human papillomavirus type 18 variants. Cervical cancer incidence remains highly frequent in developing countries. It is possible that populations of these countries are exposed to more oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) variants. Functional differences among high-risk HPV variants have been described, suggesting repercussions on their oncogenic potential. In this report, we demonstrate that the long control region (LCR) of HPV18 variants has distinct transcriptional activities in different cervical cancer cell lines. African (Af)-LCR possessed the lowest transcriptional activity its sequence harbors the highest number of nucleotide changes among the HPV18 variants analyzed. Some of these embedded in identified transcription-factor-binding sites, suggesting a less aggressive biological activity possibly involved in a slower progression of cervical lesions. Asian-Amerindian LCR showed distinct activities among cell types, while European LCR activity was similar in cell lines tested. Despite multiple nucleotide substitutions found in HPV18 E2 variant genes, their repressive activities over homologous LCRs were not distinct among variants.
