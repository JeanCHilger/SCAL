Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate and combined oral contraceptive use and cervical neoplasia among women with oncogenic human papillomavirus infection. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and combined oral contraceptive (COC) use with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).Two case-control studies of women who presented for gynecologic care and underwent cytologic and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing were performed. The first included oncogenic HPV-positive women grouped based on histology: negative (n = 152), CIN1 (n = 133), and CIN2-3 or greater (n = 173). For the second, 2 groups were identified: negative HPV/negative histology (n = 107) and positive oncogenic HPV/negative histology (n = 152).Among oncogenic HPV-positive women, DMPA use was inversely associated with CIN2-3 or greater (adjusted odds ratio [OR(adj)], 0.4 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-1.1) and CIN1 (OR(adj), 0.1Among women with oncogenic HPV, hormonal contraceptive use was not associated with an increased risk of CIN2-3 or greater. Longer-term DMPA use may attenuate the colposcopic and histologic features of CIN because women reporting such use were more likely than others to have cervical oncogenic HPV without evidence of CIN.
