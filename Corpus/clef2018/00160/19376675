Detection of human papillomavirus infection in women attending a colposcopy clinic. Infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of and a necessary factor for cervical cancer. There are more than 100 known HPV genotypes, although HPV genotypes do not all have the same risk of inducing cervical cancer. The main aim of this study is to know the distribution of different types of HPV in women attending a colposcopy clinic for cervical dysplasia.We prospectively identified and enrolled a cohort of women followed for cervical dysplasia who were referred to the colposcopy clinic of University Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u in Barcelona, Spain, from April 2003 to April 2007. Two cervical scrape samples from each patient were collected for routine cytology and for identification of HPV DNA. During the study period, 2 techniques (Line Probe assay and microarray assay) were used consecutively.HPV DNA was detected in 68% of patients (338 of 496 women) with statistically significant differences in positive results according to the cytologic category. Overall, the type distribution showed a predominance of genotype HPV-16 (27% of the total patients) followed by HPV-53 (9.4%), HPV-51 (8%), and HPV-51 (8%). Multiple genotype detection was observed in 35.5% of the patients with HPV infection. HPV-16 was mainly associated with the probable high-risk genotypes: HPV-53 and HPV-66.The higher prevalence of high-risk nonvaccine genotypes should be considered to increase vaccine efficiency.
