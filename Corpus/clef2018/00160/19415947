Current concepts in cervical pathology. The correct diagnosis and reporting of cervical in situ and invasive carcinoma are essential for the appropriate clinical management of patients with human papillomavirus-associated disease.To review common mistakes made in the diagnosis of cervical dysplasia and invasive carcinoma, describe variants and benign mimics of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and adenocarcinoma in situ, and discuss available ancillary studies that can be useful in making the distinctions as well as to review important factors related to prognosis that should be included in the pathology report.Review of current literature.There are many mimics and variants of cervical squamous and glandular lesions that can be resolved with ancillary studies and careful histologic examination. Prognostically important features, such as tumor size, presence of vascular invasion, and margin status, should always be included in the pathology report.
