The significance of marked nuclear atypia in grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Approximately 10% to 15% of cases of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are found to have progressed to a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or higher at follow-up, and there are presently no reliable morphological predictors of this subset. It has recently been reported that cases of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia that display marked nuclear atypia (defined as cases with at least 5 epithelial cells with nuclear enlargement of at least 5 times the size of an intermediate cell, and/or multinucleation of at least 5 nuclei.) have a substantially higher rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on short-term follow-up and may, therefore, require more aggressive initial management. We report herein our experience with a cohort of such cases. After a review of consecutive cervical biopsies, 352 cases with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were classified into group 1 (grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with marked atypia, n = 31) and group 2 (grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia without marked atypia, n = 321). The average follow-up rates for groups 1 and 2 were 93.55% (29/31) and 90.65% (291/321), respectively. Average follow-up durations were 14.3 and 17.9 months, respectively. The follow-up high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion rate of the cases with marked atypia was 10.34%, as compared with 11.68% for cases without marked atypia. The follow-up interpretive frequency (in cytologic samples) of "low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion" was significantly higher in group 1(19/29 versus 114/291, P = .009). However, no significant differences were identified between groups 1 and 2 regarding the interpretive frequencies of either high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (3/29 versus 34/291, P = 1) or "negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy" (6/29 versus 56/291, P = .8) in follow-up cytologic samples. In subsets of both groups in which high-risk human papillomavirus testing was performed in the Papanicolaou test sample that immediately preceded the index cervical biopsies, no significant differences in viral load were found. In conclusion, grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with marked atypia does not have a higher follow-up high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion rate than grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia without marked atypia in our patient population. Further studies are required to address the significance of marked atypia in grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and whether patients with this finding should be managed differently.
