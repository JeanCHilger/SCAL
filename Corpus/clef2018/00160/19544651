Clinic value of combination of high-risk human papillomavirus test and cervical cytology test in diagnosing cervical lesions. To investigate the clinic value of combination of high-risk human papillomavirus test and cervical cytology test in diagnosis of cervical lesions.Patients underwent physical examination at our department were checked by high-risk human papillomavirus test, cervical cytology test and colposcope from October 2004 to December 2006. Abnormal patients with cervical abnormalities were asked for pathological test.The diagnostic value of cervical lesions among these different methods were compared.Based on the criteria of histopathology, the sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value and negative-predictive value of high-risk human papillomavirus test for detecting all cases of CIN II and CIN III were 94.83%, 31.06%, 55.22% and 87.02% respectively, and those of the cervical cytology were 92.10%, 31.06%, 54.50% and 81.43% respectively.Those values changed to 99.65%, 18.55%, 61.46% and 97.62% respectively if two methods were combined.Human papillomavirus test and cervical cytology test combined with pathological test can improve the detective rate of cervical lesions and facilitate the treatment.
