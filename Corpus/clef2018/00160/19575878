Significance of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA in atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. To explore significance of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing in atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H).Presence of HR-HPV DNA was examined in 45 patients with ASC-H using hybrid capture II (HC-II) test. Colposcopic examination and biopsy were taken all results were evaluated.Overall, 33 of 45 (73.3%) ASC-H cases were biopsy proven cervical intraepithelial lesion (CIN). 36 of 45 ASC-H cases were HPV-DNA positive, including 19 cases of HSIL and over lesion whereas no HSIL or over was found in 9 HR-HPV negative cases. Sensitivity and negativity predictive value of HR-HPV in ASC-H with HSIL and over lesion were both 100%.ASC-H strongly predicts the presence of HSIL, HR-HPV may serve as a predict select whether a patient with ASC-H should take colposcopic examination immediately, patients with positive HR-HPV should undergo immediate colposcopic examination, while negative HR-HPV is an excellent predictor of the absence of HSIL.
