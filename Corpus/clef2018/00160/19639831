Human papillomavirus genotype profile in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo: implications for vaccination. Proposed anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, i.e., Cervarix (Glaxomith-Kline) and Gardasil (Merck), are designed to prevent infection by two high-risk HPV types, i.e., 16 and 18, for which estimation mainly in Western Europe and North America have demonstrated a prevalence 60 to 70%.The purpose of this study was to determine the genotype profile of HPV strains encountered in the women of childbearing age in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo and discuss the implications of this profile for anti-HPV vaccination.Data and specimen collection was carried out at a voluntary HIV screening and treatment facility. Genotyping of HPV was performed in 55 patients presenting dysplastic lesions of the uterine cervix including 47 (85.5%) who were HIV-seropositive. Detection and typing of HPV were performed using the Inno-Lipa technique (Innogenetics Line Probe Assay) from Glaxo-Smith-Kline.Tests for HPV were positive in 54 patients (98.2%). A total of 153 HPV strains were isolated. Twenty-three HPV types were identified including 83.0% with high oncogenic activity. In order of frequency the oncogenic types were as follows: 68, 35, 51, 52, 16, 31, 18, 17, 33, 45, 56, 58 and 59. Strain frequency per patient ranged from 1 to 8 (mean +/- standard deviation, 2.8 +/- 2,0). Types 16 and 18 accounted for 11.8% of the isolated strains (18/153) and were observed in 33.3% of patients (18/54).The findings of this study suggest that the HPV genotype profile in Kinshasa differs from the profile observed in Western Europe and North America. If confirmed by larger-scale studies, this result bodes poorly for the efficacy of anti-HPV vaccines in Kinshasa.
