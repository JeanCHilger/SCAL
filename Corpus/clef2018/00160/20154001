Women's knowledge about cervical cancer. The human papillomavirus-infection is one of the most frequent sexually transmitted disease it is detectable in nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Nowadays, the incidence of cervical cancer is unacceptable high.Our aim was to evaluate women's knowledge about the human papillomaviruses and cervical cancer. We tried to determine the possible connection between the higher mortality rates, the low participation rate of screenings and the knowledge about cervical cancer.The related questionnaire contained 18 questions and was filled in by 422 women in certain cities and villages. The completed questionnaires were classified by age, place of residence, qualification, children in family, and human papillomavirus vaccination in anamnesis.The results showed that almost half of the women had a basic knowledge, but the number of correct answers to functional questions (e.g. "How can one decrease the risk of infection?") were less than it was expected according to the international literature. 56% of the women knew that the cervical cancer mainly caused by viruses, but only 17% of them named the right combination of the risk factors. The rate of correct answers was much lower in high school circles and 42% of the women knew that males can be infected by human papillomaviruses. Only 44% of them participate on cervical cancer screening once a year and 43% of them thought that cervical cancer and precancerous lesions do not mean serious risk and danger. 80% of the women knew that screening involves smear taking. The significance of knowledge level differences between groups was estimated by chi 2 -probe.On the basis of the results, half of the women said to be familiar with the basic questions. In our opinion, it can be a beneficial consequence of educational campaigns. Although there were several issues, which were implemented by not more than 20% of correct answers.
