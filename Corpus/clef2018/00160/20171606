Amplification of the chromosome 3q26 region shows high negative predictive value for nonmalignant transformation of LSIL cytologic finding. The chromosome 3q26 region is a biomarker for cervical cancer. Women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) currently are referred for immediate colposcopy. The objective of this study was to determine the negative predictive value of the 3q26 amplification test for the persistence or regression of LSIL.Archival thin layer cytologic slides of 47 women (14-67 years old) with LSIL were linked to histologic and cytologic end points. To determine 3q status, the slides were hybridized for the chromosome 3q26 region and for the centromere of chromosome 7, as a control, with the use of the standard fluorescent in situ hybridization methods.The negative predictive value of 3q26 gain for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 within 1 year was 93% (95% confidence interval, 68- 100) after 21 months, its negative predictive value was 100% (95% confidence interval, 29-100).The 3q26 gain might help identify women with LSIL who do not need colposcopy.
