p300 expression is related to high-risk human papillomavirus infections and severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia but not to viral or disease outcomes in a longitudinal setting. To evaluate the role of the expression of the transcription factor p300 as an independent predictor of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections and outcome of the cervical disease.Cervical biopsy samples taken at enrolment from 225 women of the Latin American Screening study cohort were analyzed for p300 using immunohistochemistry to assess its value as predictor of (a) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade, and (b) HR-HPV at baseline, as well as (c) outcomes of HR-HPV infections, and (d) development of incident CIN as surrogate endpoints of progressive disease.There was a significant linear trend in increasing upregulation (=pattern shift) of p300 (P=0.0001) in parallel with increasing grade of CIN. When dichotomized (normal/moderately increase vs. strong-intense), upregulated p300 expression predicted CIN3+ with odds ratio=4.16 (95% confidence interval: 1.95-8.86) (P=0.0001) and CIN2+ with odds ratio=3.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.86-6.48) (P=0.0001). p300 was upregulated more often in HR-HPV+ lesions than in those remaining negative. Semiquantitative viral loads were also directly related to upregulation of p300 (P=0.036), but p300 was not a significant predictor of disease progression to either CIN1+ or CIN2+.p300 expression was upregulated in CIN lesions and related to detection and viral load of HR-HPV but not to their outcome or to incident CIN.
