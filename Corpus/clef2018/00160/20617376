A pilot study of HPV DNA and cytology testing in 50,159 women in the routine Mexican Social Security Program. We present a large feasibility evaluation of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) DNA testing and cervical cytology as a primary screening strategy for cervical cancer precursor lesions in Mexican women, as part of a routine cancer control program (CCP).A community-based study was carried out in 50,159 women aged 20-70 years who visited the CCP in 12 federal entities located in Northern, Central, and Southern Mexico, including a total of 48 primary health care units of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). Cervical specimens for cytology and HR-HPV tests were collected at baseline. Women with cytological abnormalities (ASCUS or greater) were referred to colposcopy for further evaluation and treatment if necessary. A subset of HR-HPV-positive women without cervical lesions, in Morelos state, were tested again for HR-HPV DNA within a year, and repeat-positive women were referred to colposcopy.HR-HPV prevalence among all women was 8.6% (95% CI: 8.3-8.9). Prevalence by age group was 12.2% (95% CI: 11.0-13.3) before 30 years of age and decreased to 7.4% (95% CI: 6.7-8.0) between 46 and 50 years of age. A second minor prevalence peak (8.1% 95% CI: 7.2-9.0) was observed in women more than 55 years of age. Overall prevalence of cytological abnormalities was relatively low (2.2%Population-based programs using HR-HPV testing can improve cervical cancer prevention and control in Mexican and other populations where cytological screening is inadequate for detecting precursors of cervical cancer.
