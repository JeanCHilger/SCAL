Assessment of optoelectronic method and molecular test usefulness for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer detection. Biophysics and molecular biology are disciplines dynamically entering the area of cervical cancer prevention. The combined test, comprising optoelectronic and molecular diagnostics, may play a significant role in the decrease of cervical cancer incidence and mortality.Assessment of the combined test usefulness--optoelectronic method and HPV test for the presence of oncogenic HPV types, in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer.From August 2006 to October 2008 the study included 250 patients from the Laboratory of Pathophysiology of Uterine Cervix in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Hospital of Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences. The patients underwent the following diagnostic tests: optoelectronic method, PCR test for the presence of DNA HPV HR, colposcopic examination and histopathologic biopsy.Sensitivity of the combined test for low-grade intraepithelial changes in the area of squamous epithelium (CIN 1) was 81%, while for high-grade changes (CIN 2, CIN 3) and carcinoma planoepitheliale together with adenocarcinoma was 100%.Optoelectronic and molecular diagnostics methods are useful in detecting neoplastic cervical changes. Both methods may become a key diagnostic tool of basic and advanced level of cervical screening. The advantage of the combined optoelectronic method and molecular diagnostics method over prevention based on cytodiagnostics and colposcopy has its source in the possibility of test automation and standardization.
