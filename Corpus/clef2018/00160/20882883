p16INK4a and low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the evolution of a LSIL associated with p16INK4a overexpression and on the basis of this association, identify patients who would benefit from immediate treatment rather than a later follow-up. Two hundred and forty-five cervical biopsies were studied: 199 (81.2%) were classified CIN 1, 18 (7.4%) CIN 2/3 while 28 (11.4%) were not pathological. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 22 of the 217 CIN samples (11%) were positive for the p16INK4a antigen. The results of the PCR-ELISA for the research and typing of the HPV in these 22 cases were: 14 (63.6%) HPV 16 three (13.6%) HPV 31
