The prevalence of leptotrichia amnionii in cervical swabs of HPV positive and negative women. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Leptotrichia amnionii in cervical swabs of women and its possible correlation with HPV infection and the stage of cervical cancer.A total of 139 cervical swabs from healthy women with normal cytology, with dysplastic changes and with cervical cancer were tested for the presence of L.amnionii and high-risk HPV DNA by PCR methods.L. amnionii was found in normal vaginal flora and in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), which suggests that it may be oportunistic pathogen. L. amnionii infection was diagnosed in 13.7% (19/139). Statistical analysis showed that there was positive association (p < 0.01) between the presence of L.amnionii in women with cervical cancer (38.5%) and its presence in women without cancer (11.1%). On the other hand, there was no statistically significant association between L.amnionii and HPV infections.The data presented in this study show for the first time the prevalence of L. amnionii infection in cervical specimens collected from 2004-2006 in Poznan and Lublin, Poland, and its association with HPV infection and the stage of carcinogenesis of the cervix.
