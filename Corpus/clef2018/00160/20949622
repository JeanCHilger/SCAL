Unique variants of human papillomavirus genotypes 52 and 58 and risk of cervical neoplasia. Human papillomavirus (HPV) 52 and 58 are oncogenic HPV types prevalent in Asia. Our study aims to explore intratypic variants of HPV 52 and 58 in Taiwan. A total of 11,923 women were enrolled from seven townships in 1991-1992. HPV DNA in their cervical cells was detected and typed by EasyChipÂ® HPV blot. Among 424 participants infected with HPV 52 and/or 58, nucleotide variations were determined in cervical cell samples of 406 participants by the polymerase chain reaction sequencing of the long control region, E6 and E7 genes. Nonprototype-like variants including lineages B and C were detected in 278 (99.3%) of 280 HPV 52 samples. The prototype and prototype-like group (lineage A) of HPV58 was found in 132 (98.5%) of 134 HPV 58 samples, with sublineage A1, A2 and A3 variant in 14.2, 27.6 and 56.7%, respectively. Among women infected with single HPV 52 type, the C variant (vs. B variant) was associated with an increased prevalence of cytologically diagnosed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse lesions showing an age-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) of 5.2 (1.0-27.6) and an increased prevalence of histologically confirmed high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or more severe lesions with an age-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 7.6 (1.3-43.8). It was concluded that frequency distributions of HPV 52 and 58 variants in Taiwan were different from those in European and American populations. The association between C variant of HPV 52 and prevalence of cervical neoplasia needs further validation.
