Overexpression of the hBiot2 gene is associated with development of human cervical cancer. The novel gene human Biot2 (hBiot2) was first reported by our laboratory. Previously, we indicated its function of proliferation and carcinogenesis in human endometrial cancer. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether hBiot2 played a similar role in human cervical cancer. We tested hBiot2 expression profile in cervical cancer, the corresponding adjacent normal tissues, normal cervix and the cervical cancer cell lines by RT-PCR and compared the mean value of hBiot2 expression between cervical cancer and normal cervix, and cervical cancer with or without lymphatic metastasis by real-time PCR. The location of hBiot2 in normal cervix and cancer tissues together with the corresponding adjacent normal tissues was determined by RNA-RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). hBiot2 expression in the cervical cancer (20/25), the corresponding adjacent normal tissues (3/12), normal cervix (17/18) and the cervical cell lines (2/3) was shown by RT-PCR. The mean value of hBiot2 expression was higher in the cervical cancer than in the normal cervix (0.478±1.612 vs. 0.091±0.107, P=0.0004), higher in the lymphatic metastasis than in the non-lymphatic metastasis in the cervical cancer (1.117±2.483 vs. 0.052±0.071, P=0.014). hBiot2 expression location was mainly in the parenchymal cells of the cervical cancer and normal cervix rather than in the stromal cells. Overexpression of hBiot2 is associated with early and interim development of human cervical cancer.
