Indication and outcome of repeat large loop excision biopsies of the cervix. To investigate the indications for performing a second large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) biopsy and to compare the associated colposcopic and pathological findings and treatment morbidity compared with 1 LLETZ.This is a case-control study that reviewed case notes and histology reports on women who had undergone 1 LLETZ biopsy (control group) and women who had undergone 2 biopsies (index group). A comparison of referral cytology, colposcopic findings, and pathological and clinical outcomes was performed.Of the women who went on to have 2 LLETZ biopsies, 88% had histologically proven high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasion on their first biopsy. A significantly greater proportion of high-grade cytologic and histologic diagnoses were associated with the first LLETZ compared with the second LLETZ biopsy, 76.5% and 69.1% versus 39.5% and 30.9%, respectively. A significantly greater proportion of women in the control group were referred with low-grade cytology (28.0%) and were diagnosed with human papillomavirus/low-grade CIN on histology (31.7%) compared with the first cytologic and LLETZ results in the index group, 9.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Complications were low in both groups the immediate complication rate was 4% after the first LLETZ compared with 1% after the second LLETZ.Most second LLETZ biopsies are performed in women with a history of biopsy-proven high-grade CIN and are not associated with an increased risk of immediate complications.
