Clinical performance of the CLART human papillomavirus 2 assay compared with the hybrid capture 2 test. Persistent infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is a cause of cervical cancer. The use of HPV detection in cervical screening programs may improve the ability to identify women at risk of cervical cancer. Therefore, the development of appropriate methods for the detection of HR-HPV is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of the CLART Human Papillomavirus 2 assay (CLART) in comparison with the Hybrid Capture 2 test (HC2), using a clinical cut-off of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse. Discrepant results were analyzed further by the PapilloCheck HPV genotyping system. In the 425 studied women, HR-HPV positivity rates were similar by both tests (CLART-13 HR-HPV: 63.1% CLART-17 HR-HPV: 64.7%
