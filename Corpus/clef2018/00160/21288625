Type-specific human papillomavirus DNA testing with the genotyping array: a comparison of cervical and vaginal sampling. To compare the detection and typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) between vaginal and cervical specimens by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based reverse-blot genotyping arrays.Two hundred and fifty-two women were referred to colposcopy clinics because of suspicious or positive results in a community-based cervical cancer-screening program. Genital tract cells were sampled from the cervix and self-collected from the vagina and tested with the HPV Blot kit.The HPV Blot kit identified HPV infection in 24.7% of vaginal specimens and in 30.2% of cervical collections. Cervical sampling detected significantly more infections compared to vaginal sampling only for HPV type 52 cervical sampling also detected significantly more high-risk HPV infection overall. The sensitivities of detecting histology â‰¥ cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 using the HPV Blot in vaginal and cervical specimens were 75.0% (95% CI, 47.6-92.7%) and 87.5% (95% CI, 61.6-98.4%), respectively (P=0.48). Both sampling methods were thus statistically effective at detecting high-grade lesions and cervical cancer (P<0.0001).The HPV Blot yielded similar results for both vaginal sampling and cervical sampling in the detection of CIN grade 3 or worse. These findings indicate that self-sampling for HPV testing is a viable cervical cancer screening option.
