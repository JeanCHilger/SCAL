Expression of Fas in female reproductive tract tumors. Fas, a cell surface receptor, mediates cell death by means of apoptosis in a variety of cell types. We attempted to detect Fas within plasma membrane isolated from surgically removed female reproductive tract tumors. Eight of 9 endometrial carcinomas and all ovarian carcinoma tested expressed Fas mRNA as assessed by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers according to published sequences. Immunoblotting of membrane proteins with the specific antibodies detected an immunoreactive Fas in 15 of the 16 tumors tested. In contrast, none of 9 uterine cervical carcinomas demonstrated Fas expression. Fas was expressed in a wide range of the carcinomas originating from the uterine endometrium and ovary, but not in the uterine cervix-derived tumors. Despite a poorly understood processes of apoptosis at present, this may suggest frequent expression of Fas in adenocarcinoma histologic types.
