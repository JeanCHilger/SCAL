Human papillomavirus infection among women with cytological abnormalities in Switzerland investigated by an automated linear array genotyping test. Limited data are available describing human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution among females with cytological abnormalities in Switzerland. Cervical cell specimens obtained from 5,318 women were screened routinely by liquid-based Pap smear. All specimens with cellular abnormalities were analyzed subsequently for HPV DNA by the Linear Array HPV genotyping test. Cellular abnormalities were found in 202 (3.8%) specimens, of which 150 (74.3%) were positive for high-risk (HR) HPV. HR-HPV was detected in 20 (60.6% 95% CI, 43.7-75.4%) of 33 specimens with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance compared to 98 (72.1%
