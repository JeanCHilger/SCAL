Performance by cytology and hybrid capture II in screening for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in women with HIV. HIV-infected women are at increased risk of developing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), the precursor lesions for cervical cancer. This study estimated and compared the performance of cytology and hybrid capture II in screening for precursor lesions of cervical cancer among HIV-infected women. The study population consisted of women from the open prospective cohort at the Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IPEC/Fiocruz). Colposcopy and histology were considered jointly in defining the gold standard. Cytology showed 31.8% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity, while hybrid capture II showed higher sensitivity (100%) and lower specificity (52%). The positive likelihood ratio was 7.1 for cytology and 2.1 for hybrid capture II, while the negative likelihood ratio was 0.7 for cytology and 0.0 for hybrid capture II.
