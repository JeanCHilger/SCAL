HPV genotyping in neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix in northern Thailand. To determine the distribution of HPV genotypes in cervical neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECA) in northern Thailand, and evaluate the correlation between HPV genotype and clinicopathologic features.Samples from 111 women treated for cervical NECA at Chiang Mai University Hospital between 1992 and 2009 were tested for HPV genotype. Samples were formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and tested via nested PCR and dot blot hybridization.Ninety-seven of the 111 samples were adequate for DNA analysis. HPV DNA was detected in 93 samples, of which 76 (81.7%) were single, 14 (15.1%) were multiple, and 3 (3.2%) were untyped infections. HPV18 was the most common subtype (70 cases, 75.3%), followed by HPV16 (28 cases, 30.1%). Other genotypes included HPV58 (3.2%), HPV52 (2.1%), and HPV33 (1.1%). Collectively, HPV16 and/or HPV18 were found in 83 cases (89.3%). Women with HPV18 infection were significantly younger (42.0years) than those with non-HPV18 infections (54.1years) (P=0.003). Associated adenocarcinoma in situ was more frequently seen among women with HPV18 infection (P=0.034).HPV18 infection was predominant in cervical NECA. Variations in HPV genotype may be related to the clinicopathologic features and pathogenetic pathways of NECA. Vaccination against HPV16 and HPV18 might provide protection against cervical NECA in almost 90% of cases.
