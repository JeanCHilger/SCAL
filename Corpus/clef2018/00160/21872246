Distribution of human papillomavirus genotypes in archival cervical tissue from women with cervical cancer in urban Sri Lanka. To identify the contributions of various human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes in tissue samples from women diagnosed with cervical cancer in Sri Lanka.In a retrospective study, archival cervical tissues samples (n=108) obtained from Sri Lankan women diagnosed with histologically proven invasive squamous cell carcinoma between 2006 and 2007 were tested for HPV. Genotyping of HPV DNA was performed using an INNO-LiPA assay.Overall, 93% of tumor samples tested positive for HPV DNA. HPV types 16 and 18 accounted collectively for 83.4% of the positive samples.The findings suggest that the HPV genotypes responsible for causing cervical cancer in Sri Lanka are similar to those reported elsewhere worldwide. Consequently, women in Sri Lanka could benefit from currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines should they be implemented.
