Involvement of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphism in the development of cervical carcinoma. Although infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) is crucial to the development of cervical cancer, it is not considered a sufficient isolated factor to cause this malignancy. The association of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln (rs25487) polymorphism with cervical cancer has been demonstrated in some populations.The XRCC1 Arg399Gln genetic variants were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in patients with advanced cervical cancer (n=189) and controls (n=308).We observed that patients with advanced cervical cancer having the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg vs Arg/Arg genotype displayed a 1.726-fold increased risk of cervical cancer (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.158-2.572, p=0.007). The odds ratio (OR) for Gln/Gln vs Gln/Arg or Arg/Arg was 1.742 (95% CI=1.073-2.827 p=0.0236). We also found a significantly higher frequency of the XRCC1 399Gln allele in patients with cancer than in controls, with OR=1.489 (95% CI=1.148-1.930, p=0.0026). The p value of the chi-square test for the trend observed for the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism was also statistically significant (ptrend=0.002). The statistical power of this study amounted to 78% for the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg genotypes and 61% for the Gln/Gln genotype.Although the statistical power of our study did not reach 80%, we found a statistically significant association between the XRCC1 399Gln variant and the incidence of cervical cancer.
