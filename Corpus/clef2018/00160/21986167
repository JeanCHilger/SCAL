Usefulness of CINtec速 PLUS p16/Ki-67 double-staining in cytological screening of cervical cancer. This study evaluated the usefulness of p16(INK4a)/Ki-67 as a new biomarker in the diagnosis of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical lesions.From 69 women with previous positive cytology, clinician-collected (CC) samples were obtained using a Cervex-Brush速. One month later, self-collected (SC) material was acquired using a Rovers速 Viba-Brush. Liquid-based cytology specimens were prepared from both samples, and then the grades of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) were determined following immunostaining with CINtec速 PLUS, HPV status was analyzed using a linear array.The mean double-positive cell scores (SCORE) in the CC samples were 3.2 in samples negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy, 1.3 in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 87.1 in low-grade SIL, and 367 in high-grade SIL. According to HPV risk type, the mean SCORE was 16 in samples negative for HPV, 8.4 in low-risk HPV, 143 in high-risk HPV other than type 16, and 420 in HPV16 - with a statistical significance between high-risk HPV and type 16 (p < 0.05). The SCORE of the SC group was lower than that of the CC group because of the limited number of cells collected.The SCORE showed a significant correlation with HPV16 compared with lesser-degree lesions. CINtec PLUS is useful as a diagnostic marker of progression of lesions and a surrogate marker of an elevated risk of high-grade lesions with HPV16.
