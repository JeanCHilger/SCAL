Evaluation of the combination of cytology and hybrid capture to safely predict the high-grade lesion status of patients treated with conization with large loop excision of the transformation zone. This study aimed to verify whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing after conization treatment has some potential usefulness for predicting patients' outcome.One hundred and twenty women were treated for HSIL by conization with large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). Cytology, colposcopy-guided biopsy, and hybrid capture 2 (HC2) HPV DNA tests were performed before the surgical procedure and every 6 months for 2 years at follow-up.More than 90% of the patients tested positive for high-risk HPV prior to the surgical intervention. Six months after the cervical conization, 74.75% of the patients tested negative for high-risk HPV DNA, and 19.41% were positive. Of the women who were HC2 negative, 72 showed normal cytological smears, 3 ASC-US, 2 LSIL, and 1 HSIL. Of those who were HC2 positive, 8 showed normal smears, 2 ASC-US, 2 ASC-H, 5 LSIL, and 1 case had HSIL, AGC, and squamous cells invasive carcinoma. Clinically, the HSIL case with a negative HPV test did not show any sign of high-grade lesions, and the clinical follow-up did not show residual lesions.Negative HPV tests correlated with freedom from high-grade disease after 2 years of postconization follow-up, which strongly suggests that negative HPV tests predict the absence of cervical disease.
