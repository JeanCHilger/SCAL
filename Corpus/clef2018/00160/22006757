Recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias with negative cone margins: risk factors. The percent of young patients treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) has been increasing, thus it is very important to define patients in high risk for relapse. The aim of this study was to establish any possible association of persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, age, smoking, parity, use of oral contraceptives, and Chlamydia infection, with relapse of CIN.Between March 2006 and March 2009 a prospective clinical study was performed at the Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Nis, with the study group comprising the first 35 patients with disease relapse after conization and the control group consisting of 30 patients with more than one year after treatment without relapse. HPV typization was done at the Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Cytogenetics of the Clinical Centre Nis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).A statistically significant higher percentage of recurrences with lower pathologic stage (CIN I) was found in younger women (below 29 years) (p<0.01). Women in the control group were more commonly non smokers (56.66 vs. 40%) but without statistical significance (p>0.05). The distribution of smoked cigarettes in the study and control subjects showed no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). Patients with recurrences were more commonly HPV-positive compared to controls (68.57 vs. 6.66% p <0.05). In the study group, HPV-positive smokers recurred with more advanced grades (CIN III and microinvasive carcinoma/MICPersistent HPV infection, smoking associated with HPV infection and more advanced age were demonstrated to be of statistical significance for CIN recurrence. Parity, use of oral contraceptives, Chlamydia infection, and smoking as independent etiologic factors were not significantly associated with CIN relapse.
