Type-specific human papillomavirus DNA detected in atypical glandular cell Pap tests. To evaluate the presence of type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in atypical glandular cells (AGCs) from cervical liquid-based cytology and to report the relationship between HPV types and cervical histological abnormalities.We used a nested multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay to test AGC Papanicolaou (Pap) tests for the presence of 14 high-risk (HR) HPV types.HR HPV types were detected in 33 of 161 AGC Pap tests (20.3%). Types 16 and/or 18 were detected in 13 samples (8%). Eight other HPV types were detected in 1-4 samples each. HPV-associated disease was diagnosed in 8 AGC cases (8%) with available histology results. The sensitivity and specificity of the HR HPV test were 87.5 and 90%, respectively, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99%. For a test that can isolate HPV types 16 and 18, the sensitivity and specificity were 62.5 and 100%, respectively, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 100% and the NPV was 97%.HPV 16 and 18 were the most common types detected in AGC Paps. We found high specificity, PPV and NPV with a test that can isolate these 2 HPV types. These results indicate a possible role for type-specific HPV testing in the management of AGC Pap tests.
