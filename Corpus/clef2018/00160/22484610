High-risk human papillomavirus E6/E7 mRNA and L1 DNA as markers of residual/recurrent             cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The aim of this study was to assess the use of human papillomavirus (HPV)             E6/E7 mRNA testing in the follow-up of women treated for cervical intraepithelial             neoplasia (CIN) by conization and to compare the prognostic value of HPV E6/E7             mRNA to HPV L1 DNA and cytology. One hundred and forty-three women underwent cytological/histological             testing, HPV DNA genotyping by Linear Array, and HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing by APTIMA             HPV assay during follow-up after surgical treatment for histologically verified             CIN. High-grade residual/recurrent disease (CIN2+/HSIL+) was identified in 7 (4.9%)             women, and low-grade disease (CIN1/LSIL) in 25 (17.5%). At the inclusion visit             33 (23%) women were HPV DNA-positive 13 (9.0%) were HPV E6/E7 mRNA-positive.             HPV E6/E7 mRNA did not identify three women with high-grade disease. Presence             of high-risk HPV DNA at the inclusion visit predicted 100% (95% CI 64.6-100) of             high-grade residual/recurrent disease, with a specificity of 80.9% (95% CI 73.5-86.6)
