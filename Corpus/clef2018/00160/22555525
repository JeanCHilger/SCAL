Detection of high-grade lesions on cell blocks from residual fluids of Pap smears diagnosed as low-grade abnormalities: a preliminary pilot study. To investigate the feasibility of the technique of cell blocks (CBs) from residual fluids of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears diagnosed as low-grade abnormalities in the detection of high-grade lesions on biopsies.In the present pilot study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of 70 CBs from liquid-based cervicovaginal smears of women with atypical squamous cells (ASCs) of undetermined significance (ASCUS n = 39), ASCs that cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-HOf the 70 CBs, 22 were diagnosed as negative, 27 as CIN1 and 21 as CIN2+. The sensitivity and specificity of CB preparation for the diagnosis of CIN2+ lesions were 50 and 100%, respectively, in ASCUS, 92 and 100%, respectively, in ASC-H, 100 and 100%, respectively, in LSILs.Our study confirms that CB preparation is a simple and reproducible technique with a good specificity that could be added advantageously to Pap smears to detect CIN2+ lesions in women with ASCs and LSILs.
