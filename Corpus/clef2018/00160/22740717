Identification of novel cellular transcription factors that regulate early promoters of human papillomavirus types 18 and 16. The long control region (LCR) of human papillomavirus (HPV) regulates early gene transcription by interaction with several viral and cellular transcription factors (TFs).To identify novel TFs that could influence early expression of HPV type 18 (HPV-18) and HPV type 16 (HPV-16), a high-throughput transfection array was used.Among the 704 TFs tested, 28 activated and 36 inhibited the LCR of HPV-18 by more than 2-fold. For validation, C33 cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts of selected TF expression plasmids in addition to LCR-luciferase vectors of different molecular variants of HPV-18 and HPV-16. Among the TFs identified, only GATA3, FOXA1, and MYC have putative binding sites within the LCR sequence, as indicated using the TRANSFAC database. Furthermore, we demonstrated FOXA1 and MYC in vivo binding to the LCR of both HPV types using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.We identified new TFs implicated in the regulation of the LCR of HPV-18 and HPV-16. Many of these factors are mutated in cancer or are putative cancer biomarkers and could potentially be involved in the regulation of HPV early gene expression.
