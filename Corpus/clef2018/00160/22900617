Screening test results associated with cancer diagnoses in 287 women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. The limitations of newer cervical screening tests are still being studied.To investigate those limitations, we conducted a retrospective review of 287 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).A search through 5 years of records identified 287 women with cervical SCC diagnoses. Clinical history, histopathology, and liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep) and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) results were documented. Polymerase chain reaction HPV tests were performed on SCC tissues with prior negative HC2 results.Of 287 women, 156 (54.4%) had abnormal cytology results, and 75 (26.1%) had abnormal clinical findings triggering tissue diagnoses of SCC. Among 156 patients with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test results, more-seriously abnormal Pap test results were reported in 142 women (91.1%). Among 31 women with Pap and HC2 HPV cotesting within 1 year of SCC diagnoses, 28 (90%) were Pap⁺/HPV⁺, 2 (15.5%) were Pap⁺/HPV⁻, and 1 (3%) was Pap⁻/HPV⁻. Two of 3 women with negative HC2 results before SCC diagnosis had abnormal Pap results 1 had negative Pap reports with questionable lesional cells mimicking atrophy. In all 3 cases of SCC with negative HC2 results, HPV-18 was detectedAlthough abnormal cytology preceded most SCC diagnoses, about one-third of patients were referred for diagnostic testing because of clinical suspicion alone. Among 31 SCC cases with liquid-based cytology and high-risk HPV cotest results less than 1 year before SCC diagnoses, 2 patients (6.5%) had Pap⁺/HPV⁻ results, and 1 patient (3.2%) had Pap⁻/HPV⁻ results. Polymerase chain reaction detected high-risk HPV DNA in tumor tissues of 3 SCC cases with recent HC2⁻ results.
