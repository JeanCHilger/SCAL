Factors influencing cervical cancer screening in women infected with HIV: a review of the literature. The purpose of this article is to review and compare factors that influence cervical cancer screening behavior in HIV-infected women and uninfected women. The research literature revealed that age, ethnicity/race, tobacco use, weight, education, economic issues, and risky behaviors such as substance abuse were factors that influenced cervical cancer screening among all women. HIV viral load and CD4+ T lymphocyte count were serologic factors that affected cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected women. Clinicians can use this information to identify patients at risk for poor Pap test adherence. Future interventions to reduce potential barriers for cervical cancer screening are needed in HIV-infected women.
