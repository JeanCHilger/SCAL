Intratypic changes of the E1 gene and the long control region affect ori function of human papillomavirus type 18 variants. A persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) constitutes the main aetiological factor for cervical cancer development. HPV16 and 18 are the most prevalent types found in cervical cancer worldwide. It has been proposed that HPV intratype variations may result in differences in biological behaviour. Three different HPV18 variants belonging to the Asian Amerindian (AsAi), European (E) and African (Af) branches have been associated with specific histological types of cervical cancer with different relative prognoses, suggesting that HPV18 genomic variations might participate in disease evolution. The E1 viral protein plays a critical role in controlling viral replication and load, requiring interaction with the E2 protein to bind to the long control region (LCR). In this work, we analysed if intratype variations in the LCR and E1 and E2 genes of HPV18 impact ori replication. While the changes found in E2 genes of the tested variants were irrelevant in replication, we found that variations in E1 and LCR in fact affect ori function. It was demonstrated that nucleotide differences in the LCR variants impact ori function. Nevertheless, HPV18 E1 Af gene was mainly involved in the highest ori replication, compared with the E and AsAi E1 variants. Immunofluorescence analysis showed increased levels of Af E1 in the nucleus, correlating with the enhanced ori function. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that at least two positions in the N-terminal domain of E1 could impact its nuclear accumulation.
