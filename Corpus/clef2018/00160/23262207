HPV-type has no impact on survival of patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. To review and characterise by clinical evaluation, immunohistochemistry and HPV typing a group of adenocarcinomas initially diagnosed with primary localisation in the cervix. Furthermore, to assess the prevalence and prognostic significance of HPV genotypes in a large series of HPV positive cervical adenocarcinomas (AC).One hundred and seventy-one cases of adenocarcinomas (AC) with a primary localisation in the cervix and diagnosed between 1989 and 2008 in the region of Rotterdam, the Netherlands were retrieved. Slides and blocks were reviewed and immunohistochemically stained for CEA and vimentin. HPV testing for high-risk HPV (hrHPV) by PCR (GP5+/6+) and genotyping by reversed line blot were performed.In 113 of 171 patients HPV evaluation was possible. 101 were HPV-positive (89%) and 11 were HPV-negative (11%). The 5-year disease free survival was 80% in the HPV-positive group versus 74% in the HPV-negative group (ns). The distribution of HPV types was type 18 in 55 patients (54%), type 16 in 37 (37%), type 45 in 7 (7%), types 53 and 39 were found in 2 respective patients. 5-year overall-survival in patients with HPV-18 was not significantly worse than in patients with HPV-16 (81 versus 87%). Patients with HPV-45 had a worse 5-year survival, 57%.AC is hrHPV related in most cases (89%) and HPV-18 is the most frequent type (54%). With the exception of HPV-45, HPV-positivity or type in endocervical AC has no significant influence on survival.
