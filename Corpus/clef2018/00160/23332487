Is there an association between maternal pap test use and adolescent human papillomavirus vaccination? To identify the association between mother's recent receipt of a Pap test and daughter's uptake and completion of the three-shot human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series.We used cross-sectional data from the 2008 to 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 9 U.S. states and Puerto Rico and logistic regression models to examine the association between mother's receipt of a Pap test in the past 3 years and daughter's uptake and completion of the three-shot HPV vaccination series among adolescent girls aged 9-17 years (N = 4,776).Approximately one-quarter of adolescent girls began the HPV vaccination series, and 13.6% completed the three-shot series. Uptake and completion were more likely among girls whose mothers had obtained a Pap test within the past 3 years-for HPV uptake, odds ratio: 1.342, 95% confidence interval: 1.073-1.692 for HPV completion, odds ratio: 1.904HPV vaccination uptake and completion were more likely among adolescent girls whose mothers obtained a recent Pap test. Interventions designed to educate mothers on the importance of HPV vaccination and to facilitate relationships between physicians and mothers may prove successful at increasing HPV vaccination among adolescent girls.
