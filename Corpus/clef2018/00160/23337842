Abnormal cytology in 2012: management of atypical squamous cells, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical cancer and human papillomavirus-related diseases continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. As we begin to understand the natural course of human papillomavirus infection, and the consequences of both its detection and treatment, changes have been made to our clinical approaches. The purpose of this review is to outline the management guidelines for the management of abnormal cytology. Successful triage of abnormal cytology in 2012 will allow for continued detection of precancerous lesions reducing the incidence of cervical cancer and increasing the detection of early stage disease.
