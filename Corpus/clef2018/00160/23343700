Use of electronic medical record-based tools to improve compliance with cervical cancer screening guidelines: effect of an educational intervention on physicians' practice patterns. This study aimed to determine whether electronic medical record (EMR)-based tools influence providers' compliance with guidelines for cervical cancer screening in adolescent (<21 y) patients.Three EMR-based tools to educate providers on cervical cancer screening guidelines were implemented midyear in 2010. Charts of adolescents with Pap and/or human papillomavirus results from January to December 2010 were reviewed. Physicians' demographic data were collected. Appropriateness of the index Pap and follow-up were determined using American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines.A total of 380 Pap tests were completed on 374 adolescents. Fewer Pap tests were done after the EMR interventions (229 vs 151, p < .0005). The proportion of Pap tests ordered by primary care providers was significantly higher than obstetrician-gynecologists (Ob/Gyns) (70% vs 30%, p < .0005). The number of Pap tests done by Ob/Gyns decreased 60% after EMR interventions (from 82 to 33, p < .0005) and that done by primary care physicians decreased 20% (from 147 to 118, p = .08). Indicated Pap tests were more often ordered by Ob/Gyn than by primary care, especially after EMR changes (31.4% vs 7.6%, p < .0005). Reflex human papillomavirus testing (if atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) was high (74%) and did not improve after the EMR changes (72% vs 76%). The rate of co-testing in adolescents decreased in the primary care department after the EMR changes (13% vs 6%, p = .049).Electronic medical record prompts improved compliance with cervical cytology guidelines for adolescents, suggesting that EMR may be an important tool to enhance compliance with changing recommendations.
