Human papillomavirus-unrelated gastric type of cervical adenocarcinoma presenting with a metastatic ovarian tumor: report of a case. Gastric type of adenocarcinoma (GAC) is a newly reported, morphologically distinct, mucinous subtype of cervical adenocarcinoma and is distinguished by aggressiveness and fatal outcomes. The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical carcinoma is well known however, GAC is almost always HPV negative.We report an unusual case of cervical GAC in a 41-year-old woman with a metastatic ovarian mass. The histological morphology of both tumors consisted of irregular glands lined by mucous cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia and containing abundant cytoplasmic mucin.Immunohistochemical studies of the tumor cells revealed positive reactivity for CK7 and carcinoembryonic antigen but negative reactivity for p16 and HPV DNA usually expressed in cervical adenocarcinoma. Further staining for mucin with monoclonal antibody HIK1083 showed positive reactivity in both cervical and ovarian tumors. A gastric type of cervical carcinoma is considered. The patient is free of detectable disease at a 12-month follow-up.P16 staining and HPV DNA test result are usually positive in usual mucinous type of cervical adenocarcinoma, but they are negative in GAC. HIK1083 is becoming more commonly used for the diagnosis of GAC. Differentiation of GAC from usual mucinous type of cervical adenocarcinoma is important because GAC was related to a significant risk of recurrence and decreased 5-year disease-specific survival. We suggest applying HIK1083 in the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma, especially in a small biopsy specimen.
