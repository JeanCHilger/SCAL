Copy number variation of the antimicrobial-gene, defensin beta 4, is associated with susceptibility to cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate association between copy number variation of the defensin beta 4 gene (DEFB4) and susceptibility to cervical cancer in a population at high risk of persistent oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The study subjects comprised 204 women with cervical cancer, a population having a high risk of persistent oncogenic HPV infection (cervical cancer group), and 200 healthy women from the general population (control group). Copy number variation of DEFB4 in each test sample was determined by relative quantitation using the comparative CT ((ΔΔ)CT) method. Differences between the two groups were evaluated. The median DEFB4 copy number in the cervical cancer group was four and in the control group was five (P=2.77e-4, t-test). The odds ratio of cervical cancer in individuals with four DEFB4 copies or less was higher (odds ratio 2.02 95% confidence interval odds ratio 1.36-3.02), compared with that in individuals with five or more copies (odds ratio 0.49
