TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and risk of cervical carcinoma in Serbian women. It was shown that individuals homozygous for the Arg-encoding allele of codon 72 TP53 gene may have an increased risk to human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical carcinomas. However, many studies have failed to confirm this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to investigate a role of the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism in cervical carcinoma development in Serbian women.In comparative, prospective study, we analyzed 49 wild type TP53 gene cervical carcinomas samples and 74 cervical smears of gynecologically healthy women. DNA was extracted by salting-out procedure. Codon 72 polymorphism was assessed by Restriction Fragment-Length Polymorphism method. Presence of HPV infection was detected through amplification of one part of L1 viral gene. Ï‡(2) and odds ratio were used for statistical analysis.The distribution of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, and Pro/Pro genotypes of codon 72 of TP53 gene was: 63.3, 34.7, and 2.0 % in the cervical carcinomas and 58.1, 33.8, and 8.1 % in the control group. We observed an increased risk for the development of cervical carcinoma for Arg homozygotes in relation to heterozygotes plus Pro homozygotes (OR 1.24 95 % CI 0.59-2.61) and higher one for Arg/Arg plus Arg/Pro genotype in relation to Pro homozygotes (OR 4.24The results indicate that carriers of Arg allele of codon 72 TP53 gene have an increased risk for development of cervical carcinoma in Serbian women. However, the influence is not statistically significant and requires analysis of larger case-control group.
