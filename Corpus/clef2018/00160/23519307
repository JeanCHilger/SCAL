Five-year risk of CIN 3+ to guide the management of women aged 21 to 24 years. Current US national guidelines recommend beginning screening at age 21 using Pap tests only, with cotesting starting at age 30. To inform the management of Pap test abnormalities among women aged 21 to 24 years, who have extremely low cancer risks, we compared risks of CIN 3+ among women aged 21 to 24 versus 25 to 29 years or 30 to 64 years.We estimated 5-year risks of CIN 3+ given different Pap test results, with human papillomavirus (HPV) triage of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), among 133,947 women aged 21 to 24 years, compared with 135,382 women aged 25 to 29 years and 965,360 women aged 30 to 64 years, between 2003 and 2010 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California.There were 3 cancers diagnosed during follow-up in women aged 21 to 24 years. After high-grade Pap results (0.6% of Pap results), the 5-year CIN 3+ risks among women aged 21 to 24 years were comparable to those aged 25 to 29 and 30 to 64 years (atypical glandular cells, 6.9% vs 14% vs 8.5%, p = .8 atypical squamous cells cannot rule out high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 16% vs 24% vs 18%, p = .8Women aged 21 to 24 years had almost zero cancer risk, and positive Pap test results predicted low CIN 3+ risk except for the 0.6% of women with high-grade Pap results. The generally low risk supports conservative management of women aged 21 to 24 years.
