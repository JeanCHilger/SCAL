Clinical prediction based on HPV DNA testing by hybrid capture 2 (HC2) in combination with liquid-based cytology (LBC). Primary screening by HPV DNA testing is an effective method for reducing cervical cancer and has proven more sensitive than cytology. To advance this approach, many molecular methods have been developed. Hybrid capture 2 provides semi-quantitative results in ratios of relative light units and positive cutoff values (RLU/ PC). Twenty-five thousand and five patients were included in this study to analyze the correlation between the ratio of RLU/PC and stage of cervical dysplasia. The results show that the RLU/PC ratios ranged from 0-3500 while almost normal cases, ASC-US and ASC-H, had values below 200. Of those samples negative for cytology markers, 94.6% were normal and their RLU/PC ratios were less than 4. With an RLU/PC ratio greater than 4 and less than or equal to 300, the percentages in all age groups were normal 53.6%, LSIL 20.2%, ASC-US 17.2%, HSIL 6.13%, ASC-H 2.72%, and AGC 0.11%, respectively. In contrast, 64.0% of samples with a RLU/ PC ratio greater than 300 and less than or equal to 3500 were LSIL. These results should contribute to cost effective cervical cancer management strategies. Further studies of associations with particular HPV genotypes would be useful to predict the risk of progression to cancer.
