The follow up of the women vaccinated against HPV. HPV vaccine decreases significantly the risk of cervical cancer in women. However, continuing screening strategies in vaccinated women remains relevant as there is a small residual risk of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions even after prophylactic vaccination. The follow-up strategy to adopt has been the object of reflection by many experts, and especially since the vaccination catch-up population concerning women until 23Â years of age will soon become the target screening population following recent guidelines. Finally, the arrival of HPV vaccines forces us to think about screening organization and optimization in a broader way so as it benefits all women concerned, whether vaccinated or not, and not only barely half of them as is the case now. The aim of this work was to clarify the issue and to make proposals for management.
