LSIL: definition and management. The management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) has changed greatly over the past 2 decades. The most recent recommendations propose avoiding treatment while continuing to monitor patients for clearance of disease or a change to a more severe diagnosis. Knowledge of the correct way to manage LSIL is important because LSIL is a relatively common diagnosis found on cervical cytology. Especially since the introduction of liquid-based cytology, the diagnosis of LSIL has become more frequent. The College of American Pathologists estimated in 2003 that the reporting rate for LSIL was 2.9%.
