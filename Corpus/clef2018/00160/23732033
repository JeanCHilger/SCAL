Treatment options for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The introduction of testing for high-risk HPV types and P16 immunostaining of CIN2 histologic specimens allows for determination of the risk of progression versus regression for a woman with a particular cytologic or histologic specimen. Observation with serial cytological or colposcopic examinations is now appropriate for women with low-grade histologic lesions as well as pregnant and young women with certain high-grade histologic lesions. Current recommendations for management of high-grade lesions, the efficacy of treatment options (cryotherapy and LEEP), and the immediate (bleeding, infection) and longer term complications (cervical incompetence, preterm delivery) of cervical dysplasia treatment are presented.
