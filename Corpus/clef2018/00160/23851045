Mitochondrial DNA variation analysis in cervical cancer. This study was undertaken to investigate the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in non-malignant and malignant cervical tissue samples. We have identified 229 and 739 variations non-malignant and malignant tissues respectively distributed over 321 locations in the D-loop (50 in non-malignant and 166 in malignant 216 variations), coding region (139 in non-malignant and 455 in malignant
