Cervical cancer--possibilities of detection of human papillomavirus. To describe the possibility of detection of HPV DNA in cervical cancer.Review.Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Palacky University and University Hospital Olomouc.Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of many cancers, especially cervical cancer. Current cervical cancer screening is based on cytological examination, which is followed by HPV DNA diagnostics only in cases with abnormal results of uncertain significance. Methods used for HPV detection are often based on PCR reaction followed by genotyping (complete or partial). HPV DNA diagnostics isnÂ´t currently included into the primary cervical cancer screening in the Czech Republic although it has higher sensitivity than cytology.Inclusion of HPV DNA testing into the primary cervical cancer screening would significantly increase its sensitivity and thus would help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease in Czech population.
