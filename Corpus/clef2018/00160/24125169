Loss of LDOC1 expression by promoter methylation in cervical cancer cells. Cervical cancer lacks reliable prognostic factors for both progression and chemotherapeutic responsiveness. The expression of the LDOC1 tumor suppressor candidate was therefore investigated. In four of six cervical cancer cell lines tested, expression of LDOC1 was silenced. Downregulation of LDOC1 could also be shown in biopsies of cervical cancer specimens. PCR-based promoter methylation analysis revealed a significant association between promoter methylation and the loss of LDOC1 expression, which could be reverted by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. This indicates that silencing of LDOC1 is a frequent event in cervical cancer and may be of interest as a molecular marker in cervical cancer.
