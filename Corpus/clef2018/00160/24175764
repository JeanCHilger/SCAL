Comparison of p16INK4a immunocytochemistry with the HPV polymerase chain reaction in predicting high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. To compare p16INK4a immunocytochemistry with the HPV polymerase chain reaction in predicting high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions.This diagnostic case-control study was conducted from January 2010 until December 2010. We obtained 30 samples, classified according to the degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN): 11 samples for CIN 1, 9 samples for CIN 2, and 10 samples for CIN 3. HPV PCR, p16INK4a immunocytochemistry, and histopathological examination were performed on all samples. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 20.0.In predicting CIN 2-3, we found p16INK4a to have similar specificity and positive predictive value as HPV PCR (95%, 97.2% vs 96.7%), but better sensitivity (87.5% vs 72.5%) and negative predictive value (82.1% vs 67.6%). The most prevalent types of high-risk HPV in our study were HPV 33, 35, 58, 52, and 16.p16INK4a has better diagnostic values than HPV PCR and may be incorporated in the triage of ASCUS and LSIL to replace HPV PCR. Genotype distribution of HPV differs in each region, providing a challenge to develop HPV vaccines based on the epidemiology of HPV in that particular region.
