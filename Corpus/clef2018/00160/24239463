Implications for human papillomavirus in penile cancer. Human papillomavirus infection (HPV) has been implicated in penile cancer, and although the annual incidence is estimated to be 1,570 in the United States, there are areas of the world in which the incidence is as much as 20-fold higher. Ample data in the literature support testing and vaccination against HPV-related cervical cancer, but for men and penile cancer, these data are lacking. However, some preliminary data would suggest that HPV not only plays an important role in a significant subset of patients with penile cancer but also may be a target for penile cancer prevention as well via initiation of a vaccination program in high-risk male populations.
