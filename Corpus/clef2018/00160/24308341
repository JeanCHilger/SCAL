cobas 4800 HPV Test, a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of human papillomavirus in cervical specimens. Cervical cancer screening incorporating high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) detection has become the preferred screening strategy in some countries and is increasingly more widespread in other countries with organized or opportunistic screening programs. Given knowledge that high-risk HPV genotypes differ in their oncogenic potential, commercial HPV assays with genotyping capabilities have been developed and have garnered attention in the recent literature. The cobas 4800 HPV Test is a qualitative multiplex assay that provides specific genotyping information for HPV types 16 and 18, while concurrently detecting 12 other high-risk HPV genotypes as a pooled result. It is currently the only clinically validated, US FDA-approved assay with this capability. Since HPV types 16 and 18 have been designated as conferring the greatest risk for cervical disease, their detection may prove useful in guiding patient management.
