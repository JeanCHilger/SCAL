Distribution and location of Daxx in cervical epithelial cells with high risk human papillomavirus positive. To provide the basis for further exploring the effect and its mechanism of Death domain associated protein (Daxx) on the progress of cervical carcinoma induced by human papillomavirus (HPV), the distribution and location of Daxx in cervical carcinoma with high risk HPV(HR-HPV) positive was analyzed.The samples of normal cervical epithelial cells, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (CINI), CINII CINIII and cervical cancers were collected. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to analyze the distributions and locations of Daxx in the cervical tissue. Indirect immunoinfluorescence test was utilized to observe the locations of Daxx in Caski cells with HPV16 positive.Under the light microscopy, the brown signals of Daxx distributed in the nuclei of normal cervical epithelial cells Daxx mainly distributed in nuclear membrane and there were a small amount of Daxx in the nuclei in CINI. Daxx intensively distributed in the cytoplasm and cell membrane in CINII, CINIII and cervical cancer. Under fluorescent microscopy, the distribution and location of Daxx in Caski cells was similarly to that in cervical cells of CINII, CINIII and cervical cancer.In the progress of the cervical cancer, Daxx gradually translocates from nucleus into nuclear membrane, cytoplasm and cell membrane. Daxx locates in the cytoplasm and cell membrane in CINII, CINIII and cervical cancer.The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here:http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/4671548951113870.
