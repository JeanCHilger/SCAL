High-risk cervical human papillomavirus infections among human immunodeficiency virus-positive women in the Bahamas. High-risk (HR) HPV genotypes other than 16 and 18 have been detected in a significant proportion of immunocompromised females. We aim to evaluate the frequency of HR HPV genotypes in a population of HIV-positive Caribbean women.One hundred sixty-seven consecutive, non-pregnant, HIV-positive females ≥18 years were recruited in this study. Each participant received a vaginal examination, PAP smear, and completed a questionnaire. DNA was extracted for HPV testing in 86 patients.Mean age was 39.1 years for women positive for HR HPV and 43.1 years for women negative for HR HPV (P value  = 0.040). 78% (130/167) of the women had HR HPV infections the prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology was 38% among women who were HR HPV-positive compared to women who were HR HPV-negative (22%). Fifty-one percent of the 86 women with available genotype carried infections with HPV 16 and/or HPV 18HR HPV infections in HIV infected females may consist of more than just HPV 16 and 18, but also HPV 52 and 58. Further studies are needed to determine whether HPV 52 and 58 play a significant role in the development of cervical cytological abnormalities in HIV+ women.
