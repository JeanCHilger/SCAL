Post-treatment human papillomavirus status and recurrence rates in patients treated with loop electrosurgical excision procedure conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection clearance after loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) procedure conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and the factors related to such clearance and to assess the relation between HPV and recurrence.A total 141 patients who underwent LEEP owing to high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) associated with CIN were involved this study. All patients with negative margins on LEEP specimens were followed up with HPV testing and cervical smear after three, six, nine, and 12 months post-treatment. If necessary, cervical biopsy under colposcopy was performed.LEEP can effectively eliminate HPV infection. Most patients cleared HPV infection within six months. The persistent HPV infection rates were 44.6%,10.6%, 5.7%, and 2.1% after three, six, nine, and 12 months, respectively. The clearance rates were significantly slower in patients with HPV 16 infection, and not differ significantly by age, parity, and pathologic degree. Patients with persistent HR-HPV infection after treatment had a significantly higher risk for recurrence/residual after LEEP compared to patients with negative HPV infection.The authors concluded that patients who were positive for HPV infection, especially for HPV 16, should be followed up closely after treatment.
