Intermediate heparan sulfate binding during HPV-16 infection in HaCaTs. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States and can cause cancer with persistent infection. The most common cancer caused by HPV is cervical carcinoma with an average of 12,000 cases reported every year in the United States. Worldwide, over 500,000 cases of cervical cancer are reported yearly with over 250,000 deaths attributed to the disease. Although much is known about the serious health risks associated with HPV infection, there is still much to be discovered about how HPV binds and enters target cells. Understanding is required on how HPV infections will lead to strategies and therapies for reducing the number of infections and HPV-related diseases, including cancers. The HPV viral particle is composed of 2 viral proteins, L1 and L2. Data suggest that binding of the viral capsid to cells is dependent on the L1 protein. We hypothesize that this initial binding to a heparan sulfate is composed of 2 independent events: the first results in a structural change that exposes a hidden portion of the L1 protein leading to a second binding event on the heparan sulfate. Our experiments tested if this "hidden" portion of L1 is necessary for infection and explored the nature of this binding. We generated a peptide with the sequence of the "hidden" portion of L1. Infection of HaCaT cells in the presence of this peptide is highly reduced. Our results suggest that the binding of the L1 C-terminal domain is dependent on amino acid sequence and is necessary for infection.
