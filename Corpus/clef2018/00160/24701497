Nested Multiplex (NMPCR) Detection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 in Pre-invasive Lesions and its Implication in Screening of Carcinoma Cervix (CaCx). Carcinoma cervix (CaCx) is a preventable disease and is caused by certain high risk Papillomaviruses. In the present study, our aim was to investigate the utility of Nested Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (NMPCR) in detecting Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 in cervical scrapes/biopsy samples and to correlate with cervical cytology/ histopathology findings.A total of 119 females were subjected for Papanicolaou smear examination of cervical scrapes and/or histopathological examination of cervical tissues. These samples were also subjected to nested multiplex PCR targeting HPV 16/ 18 specific E6/7 gene sequences.HPV 16/18 were detected in 33.6% (40/119) cases included in the study. The overall HPV 16/ 18 positivity among cases with Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, Low grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion, and High grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion was observed to be 20.8%, 44%, and 66.7% respectively. Positivity for HPV 16 in cases with Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) was found to be 80%. HPV positivity among subjects reported with reactive cellular changes, a sub category of Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, was observed to be 26.6%.HPV 16 and 18 positivity in cases reported with different stages of pre invasive lesions of CaCx, particularly in the subcategory reactive cellular changes of Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, indicates that NMPCR detection of HPV 16/ 18 may be used as a screening tool for CaCx in conjunction with Papanicolaou smear examination.
