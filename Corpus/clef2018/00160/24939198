Developing a hand-held Pap test card to improve cervical cancer screening. We identified an educational deficit among clients at a community health clinic regarding the latest cervical cancer screening recommendations. A literature search on Pap testing and problems with compliance or screening indicated multiple barriers to cervical cancer screening. Education, health promotion and the use of a hand-held health card/record were identified as methods to educate women regarding cervical cancer prevention. We developed a hand-held Pap test card to be similar to an immunization card. The card was designed to fulfill the needs of both clients and practitioners.
