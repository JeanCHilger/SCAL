Frequency of L-SIL and H-SIL Findings in HPV Positive Women. Cervical carcinoma is one of the leading health issues for women throughout the world. In 90% of the cases cervical carcinoma develops after development of invasive lesions of the uterine cervix or 10-15 years before they are diagnosed using cytological screening-Papanicolau test. Infection with human papilloma virus is considered to be the basic etiological cause of development of CIN and cervical carcinoma.Of this research was to determine frequency and type of abnormal cytological results in HPV positive and HPV negative patients.Research is descriptive analytical, comparative and partly epidemiological, of mostly clinically applicable character. Used data included information on total number of examinations, type of exam, results of cytological and pathohistological diagnostics, HPV findings in cervix smear and HPV type in the period between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011.During the period of analysis total number of Pap tests was 6376 (43.33%), in comparison to other exams 7828 (56.67%). For this period total number of L-SIL and H-SIL (PAPA III) was 395 (6.20%), in comparison to other results 5894 (92.44%). After analysis largest subset of HPV positive patients had pathohistological diagnosis of CIN I that is 250 (43.10%) of them, then CIN II with 162 (27.93%) patients, CIN III with 149 (25.69) and 3 (0.52%) patients had CIS while 16 (2.76%) had a clear test result. We can conclude there is a statistically significant margin of frequency between positive HPV results in relation to diagnosis. Highest percentage of L-SIL and H-SIL (PAPA III) test results was in 2010 and was 9.5%, and lowest in 2009 with 4.34%. Largest number of patients, 43.0%, with HPV positive results after cervical smear had pathohistological diagnosis of CIN I.
