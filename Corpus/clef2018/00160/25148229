High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Cytology With Negative High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Tests Rarely Diagnoses Endometrial Cancer. We hypothesized that women with cervical cytologic results of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and negative high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) test results would have a high risk of having endometrial cancer and would benefit from routine endometrial biopsy.Reports of women with cytologic results of HSIL and negative HR-HPV test results were found in an electronic colposcopy database their charts were reviewed. Rates of endometrial cancer for cytologic results of HSIL and negative HR-HPV test results were compared to a historical series for cytologic results of HSIL with positive HR-HPV and cytologic results of atypical glandular cells (AGCs) and negative HR-HPV test results.Between August 10, 1998, and April 20, 2013, 56 women were evaluated in our colposcopy clinics for cytologic results of HSIL and negative HR-HPV test results of these 56 women, 1 (1.8%) was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. No endometrial cancer was diagnosed during the follow-up (median = 63 mo) after colposcopy. The risk for endometrial cancer with cytologic results of HSIL and negative HR-HPV test results (1.8%, 1/56) did not differ from that of a historical series from 2007 to 2009 from the same colposcopy clinic in 223 women with cytologic results of HSIL and positive HR-HPV test results (0.0%, 0/223Women with cytologic results of HSIL and negative HR-HPV test results are more like those with cytologic results of HSIL and positive HR-HPV test results than those with cytologic results of AGC and negative HR-HPV test results and would unlikely to benefit from routine endometrial biopsy at the time of colposcopy.
