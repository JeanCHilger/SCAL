HPV genotyping 9G membrane test: a point-of-care diagnostic platform. The results of HPV detection in 550 cervical samples by cervical cytology were compared with the sequencing analysis and HPV genotyping 9G membrane test. The HPV genotyping 9G membrane test can efficiently identify and discriminate five HR-HPV genotypes. The 100% identical results of HPV genotyping 9G membrane tests with the sequencing results in 550 clinical samples ensure its wide clinical applicability. The simple handling steps and the portable scanning device make the HPV genotyping 9G membrane test applicable in point-of-care settings. Moreover, the HPV genotyping 9G membrane test allows one to obtain final results in 30 min at 25 Â°C by simply loading the hybridization and washing solution and scanning the membranes without any drying steps or special handling. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the HPV genotyping 9G membrane test was found to be 100%, which is much higher than cervical cytology.
