Persistent papillomavirus type-31 and type-45 infections predict the progression to squamous intraepithelial lesion. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recognized as the major etiologic agent of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. However, it has been demonstrated that HPV infection is usually a self-limited process and does not lead to significant epithelial lesions or cancer. Recent data indicate that persistent high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections have a significantly increased risk of developing incident high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. Our aim, therefore, was to assess whether there exist HPV genotypes whose persistence can be considered powerful surrogates of a progressive disease. We retrospectively selected all patients with a negative cytological diagnosis or with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, with a positive test for HR-HPV, different from HPV types 16 and 18, and assessed the significance of the risk of progression based on the persistence of the specific HR-HPV.We retrospectively queried the database of our Colposcopy Clinic for all patients with a negative cytological diagnosis or with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and a positive test for HR-HPV, and we calculated the incidence of progression to lesions greater than or equal to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions after 6 months, according to the HPV type.A progression rate of 48.27% was found in patients tested positive for HPV-31 (Group 1), 38.46% in patients tested positive for HPV-45 (Group 2), and 5.73% in patients tested positive for HPV types other than HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, and HPV-45 (Group 3).Our data demonstrate that the persistence of HPV-31 and HPV-45 is strongly associated with the occurrence of squamous intraepithelial lesion.
