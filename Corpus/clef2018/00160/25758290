Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 in liquid-based cervical cytology samples. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is replacing cervical cytology as a primary cervical cancer screening tool. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of occurrence of HPV types 16 and 18 in liquid-based cytology (LBC) cervical samples in our set-up. This study comprised of 302 LBC cervical samples. HPV 16 and HPV 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the results were compared between normal (n = 155), inflammatory (n = 99), squamous (n = 37) and glandular abnormalities (n = 11). Of our patient cohort, 73.8 % was ≤40 years old. We found HPV 16 DNA in 91/302 (30.1 %) cases and HPV 18 DNA in 21/302 (6.95 %). HPV types 16 and 18 were detected in 25.8 and 4.5 % cytologically normal samples, respectively. HPV 16 was positive in 29.3 % of inflammatory samples. Squamous cervical abnormalities were more often HPV positive (HPV 16 in 48.6 % HPV 18 in 29.7 %) than glandular abnormalities (36.4 and 18.2 %, respectively). We found high-risk HPV DNA in more than one third of the tested women. A good number of these HPV-positive cases were negative in cervical cytology.
