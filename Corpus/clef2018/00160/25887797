Prevalence and correlates of HPV among women attending family-planning clinics in Thailand. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women of reproductive age in Thailand. However, information on the prevalence and correlates of anogenital HPV infection in Thailand is sparse.HPV genotype information, reproductive factors, sexual behavior, other STI and clinical information, and cervical cytology and histology were assessed at enrollment among one thousand two hundred and fifty-six (n=1,256) HIV negative women aged 20-37 from Thailand enrolled in a prospective study of the natural history of HPV. The type-specific prevalence of HPV was estimated using cervical swab specimens from healthy women and women with a diagnosis of CIN 2/3 at baseline. Prevalence ratios (95% CI) were estimated using Poisson regression to quantify the association of demographic, behavioral, and clinical correlates with prevalent HPV infection.Overall, 307 (24.6%) and 175 (14.0%) of women were positive for any HPV type and any HR-HPV type, respectively the most common types were 72, 52, 62, and 16. Among women diagnosed with CIN 2/3 at enrollment (n=11), the most prevalent HPV types were 52 and 16. In multivariate analysis, HPV prevalence at enrollment was higher among women with: long-term combined oral contraceptive use, a higher number of lifetime sexual partners, a prior Chlamydia infection, and a current diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis.The study findings provide important information that can be used in the evaluation of primary and secondary interventions designed to reduce the burden of cervical cancer in Thailand.
