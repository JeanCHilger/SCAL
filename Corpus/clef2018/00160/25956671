High-risk HPV detection and genotyping by APTIMA HPV using cervical samples. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) detection and genotyping is critical for cervical cancer screening. Testing of 967 cervical cytology specimens in PreservCyt preservative revealed similar positivity rates for HC2 (13.8%) and APTIMA HPV (AHPV) tests (13.5%, p=0.89) and high overall agreement (94.6%, Îº=0.77). A trend towards higher HPV16 positivity rates by the Cobas HPV test (23.0%, 26/113) compared to the AHPV genotyping assay (19.5%, 22/113 p=0.125) was noted. No cross-contamination was detected with AHPV in a challenge experiment.
