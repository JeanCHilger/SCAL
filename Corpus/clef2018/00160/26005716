Cervical cytological abnormalities and HPV infection in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents. Behaviourally HIV-infected adolescent females are at higher risk for abnormal cervical cytology and HPV infection compared to those who are uninfected, but data on perinatally HIV-infected adolescent females are lacking.Cervical cytology, HPV infection and E6/E7 mRNA were assessed in sexually active 12-24-year-old adolescent females: perinatally HIV-infected (group 1, Median age was lower in group 1 (18 years) than in groups 2 (24 years) and 3 (20.5 years) (Despite the younger age and shorter time since sexual debut, cervical cytological abnormalities and HPV infection were as common in perinatally HIV-infected as in behaviourally infected and uninfected adolescents. HPV vaccination, pre-cancer screening and antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected female adolescents should be implemented to minimise the risk of cervical cancer.
