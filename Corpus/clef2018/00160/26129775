High performance of combined HPV testing and genotyping for HPV16/18/52/58 in triaging women with minor cervical cytological abnormalities in northern Thailand. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an important cause of cervical cancer. Screening with cytology or combined cytology and HPV testing helps to detect early cervical cancers and precancerous lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse [HSIL+]). Minor cytological abnormalities (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) account for the majority of abnormal cervical cytology results, but only 10-20% of women with minor cytological abnormalities have histologic HSIL+. Triage tests are useful to identify the high-risk patients and reduce the colposcopy burden. This study was aimed to evaluate the triage performance of combined HPV DNA testing and genotyping. Cervical samples from women with minor cytological abnormalities, who underwent colposcopy at Chiang Mai University Hospital in northern Thailand between October 2010 and February 2014, were tested for HPV DNA using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2). Genotyping was performed using Linear Array assay. Of 223 women with cervical histology confirmation, histologic HSIL+ was detected in 25 women (11.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 3 triage methods for histologic HSIL+ were 100%, 47.5%, 19.4%, and 100% by HC2 only
