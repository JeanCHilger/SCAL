Human papilloma virus genotyping in women with abnormal cytology. To assess presence of HPV infection and identification of the most common HPV types in patients with abnormal cytology based on the Bethesda system (atypical squamous cells).81 women with abnormal cytology based on the Bethesda system (atypical squamous cells) were qualified for the study. Material was taken from the cervical canal, the vaginal portion of the cervix and the vagina onto a liquid medium to detect HPV DNA and genotyping of 19 most common oncogenic types of high and medium risk was performed with the Papillomastrip method and for HPV types 6 and 11 with the PCR method.HPV was detected in 53 out of 81 examined women, which accounted for 66%. The most common HPV types were: 6/11 - 23 cases (43% of women with infection), 16 - 23 cases (43% of women with infection), 18 and 33 with 9 cases each (17% of women with infection). Coexistence of 6/11 with 16 or 18 - 13 concerned 15 patients (28% of women with infection) and presence of HPV 16 or 18 was detected in 28 cases (53% of women with infection). Positive HPV type contained in the quadrivalent vaccine against human papillomavirus 6/11 and 16 or 18 was detected in 38 patients (72% of women with infection). 40% of HPV positive women were infected with only one type of the virus, 26%--with two types and 23% with three types.In 81 women with abnormal cytology based on the Bethesda system (atypical squamous cells) within 66% of HPV positive results the most common were type 6/11 (of low oncogenic potential but responsible for anogenital warts) and type 16 of high oncogenic potential.
