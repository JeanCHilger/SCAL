Deregulation of miR-93 and miR-143 in human esophageal cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the second and third most common malignancy in Iranian males and females, respectively. Treatment of ESCC is largely ineffective due to lack of detection at early stages of the disease. In recent years, miRNA, a small RNA molecule, has drawn much attention to researchers as a potential biomarker for esophageal cancer. miR-93 and miR-143 are two miRNA molecules reported to be frequently deregulated in various cancers, including prostate, stomach, cervix, and etc. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression levels of these miRNAs and evaluate their diagnostic and therapeutic potential in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, total RNA was extracted from 30 tumor tissues and 30 nontumor tissues of esophageal tumor margins, using RNX-plus solution. After validating the quality and quantity of total RNA, cDNAs of interest were synthesized using microRNA-specific cDNA Synthesis Kit. The expression level of miR-93 and miR-143 was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR with miRNA-specific primers. Finally, the obtained data was analyzed by SPSS ver.20 software and paired t test was performed to observe the significance of difference between groups. The expression level of miR-93 was significantly increased and of miR-143 was significantly decreased in most of the examined tumor tissues, compared to nontumor tissues. Also, our findings did not detect correlation between mir-93 and mir-143 expressions in regard to stage and grade of the samples. These findings suggest that the deregulation of these miRNAs may play an important role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Both miR-93 and miR-143 might be used as potential biomarkers in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, more studies with large population of samples are necessary.
