Development of a fluorescence-based multiplex genotyping method for simultaneous determination of human papillomavirus infections and viral loads. Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is correlated with an increased risk of developing intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM). The aims of the current study is to establish a method named BioPerfectus Multiplex Real Time (BMRT) HPV assay for simultaneous typing and quantifying HPVs, and to evaluate it by comparison with HPV GenoArray test and PCR-sequencing method, as well as histological status.A total of 817 cervical specimens were evaluated by BMRT method and HPV GenoArray test, using PCR-sequencing method as the reference standard simultaneously, high-risk HPV-16 and -18 DNA loads were assessed in 443 specimens to investigate the correlation with infection outcomes.The overall detection coincidence rate between BMRT assay and HPV GenoArray test is 96.6 % and the Kappa value is 0.760. In addition, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of BMRT is 98.4 % and 95.7 % compared with the results detected by PCR-sequencing method, respectively. HPV-16 viral load has a correlation with CINs or worse lesions. By comparing with infected women presenting NILM /cervicitis, the cutoff value for HPV-16 from patients with CINs was 0.827. With this cutoff value, 74.6 % sensitivity and 72.5 % specificity for prediction of HPV-16 infected patients with CINI and higher CIN were achieved. High significance was obtained when comparing the infected women presenting NILM/cervicitis with women either with CIN and cervical carcinomas (p < 0.001).The BMRT assay seemed to be a good alternative approach for HR-HPV testing, due to its high level of automation and ability to quantify HPV-16, HPV-18 and other HR-HPVs.
