Pathologic findings in the uterine cervix--diagnostic aspects. The study presents results of routine bioptic diagnoses. 651 lesions of cervix uteri have been diagnosed during a five-year period. The presented number represented a summary of 26% of the absolute number of 2513 registered neoplastic and precancerous lesions of the female genital. The group of patients yielded dominance of precancerous lesions of exo and endocervix, namely in 445 cases, i.e. 68%. Malign tumours of exo and endocervix uteri constituted a group of 185 cases, i.e. 28%. The study proves the world's trends of the development of pathological changes in cervix uteri where HPV infection represents one of the most significant factors. The two-year lasting evaluation of 27,093 cytologically examined patients revealed HPV infection in 748 female patients, i.e. in 2.8%. Summarization of the findings detected on the basis of cytologic and bioptic examinations proved the histologic correlation of HPV infection in 124 patients out of 467 patients afflicted with dysplastic or malign lesion of exocervix.
