Morphological correlation of human papillomavirus infection of matched cervical smears and biopsies from patients with persistent mild cervical cytological abnormalities. Human papillomavirus (HPV) analysis of cytological material has been advocated for determining those patients with low-grade cervical cytological abnormalities who have current high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). In this study, we analyzed concurrent cervical smears and biopsies from 167 patients with Papanicolaou (Pap) smears showing persistent atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS) or low grade SILs (1) to compare the detection of HPV by nonisotopic in situ hybridization (NISH) on matched smears and biopsies (2) to analyze the type and distribution of NISH signal within lesions
