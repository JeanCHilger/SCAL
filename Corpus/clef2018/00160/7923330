Epidemiological study on risk factors of cervical cancer. The relationship between cervical cancer and risk factors including virus infection of cervix was studied with methods of molecular and serological epidemiology. DNA extracted from cervical biopsies taken from 57 cases and 51 controls were tested for HPV6/11, HPV16/18 by Dot-blot hybridization and for HSV-2 by PCR. Sera were detected for HCMV-IgM by ELISA. The results and risk factors were analyzed by logistic regression model. The multiple logistic regression model results showed that HPV16/18 infection was an important risk factor, the infection rate was significantly higher in the group of cervical cancer, the OR was 31.96. Other risk factors were the educational level and the number of birth, the OR were 0.57 and 1.85, respectively. The difference of HSV-2 infection of cervix and HCMV-IgM in serum was not significant between the two groups.
