Role of colposcopy in high-grade CIN (CIN II-III). We have considered the colpo-cytologic characteristic of 83 patients with CIN II-III histologic lesions over 900 colposcopic biopsies carried out at our Department from 1990-1992. In particular 38 cases were classified as CIN II of which 23 associated with HPV cytopathic feature, while 45 cases were, classified as CIN III, of which 13 associated with HPV c.f. 29% of CIN II were evident in women under 30 years of age in this group the age decreased with the presence of HPV. 31% of CIN III were present in women under 35. A good correlation between cytologic and histological analysis on the same patient was observed particularly in CIN with the higher grade. Also a good correlation between colposcopy grading and CIN was observed. In CIN II, grade I images were present, while in CIN III, punctuation and white epithelium were the most common features. Our study shows also the impossibility of distinguishing between the images of simple viral infection and their related CIN morphologic patterns. Colposcopy represents a basic test for the definition of CIN, particularly for those with higher grade, and a complementary test for the definition of the topography of the lesions with the correct choice of the therapeutic treatment.
