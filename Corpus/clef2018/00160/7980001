Cellular proteins involved in papillomavirus-induced transformation. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with at least 80% of cervical carcinomas and are classified as high-risk or low-risk based on whether or not they are commonly found in cervical cancers. The high-risk HPVs have early gene products (E6 and E7) that immortalize human keratinocytes and are at least partially responsible for causing cervical carcinoma. E6 and E7 from the high-risk viruses interact strongly with the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb those from the low-risk HPVs do not. Transformation involves a multi-step process and requires additional factors besides high-risk HPV infection. High-risk HPVs are capable of immortalizing primary human keratinocytes in tissue culture, but such cells become transformed only after certain chromosomal changes take place, possibly having to do with oncogene activation. The DNA of high-risk HPVs is frequently (if not always) integrated into the genome of cancer cells
