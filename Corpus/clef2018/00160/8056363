Typification of a subgroup of cervical papilloma by in situ hybridization. Preliminary study. The purpose of this study was to analyze 19 patients infected with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), in order to determine the most frequent subtype. Subjects were patients of the National Institute of Perinatology (INPer), between 1991-1992. All the patients had positive cytology, cervical biopsy was done through colposcopy control. Sample characteristics were: Mean age 29 years, married most of them multiparous (9/19) and 7 were monogamous. Six out of 12 cytologies were positive for HPV, 12 out of 19 had an inespecific inflammatory reaction and one patient had NICIII. The histopathologic study showed in 15 cases a positive reaction to HPV, 2 out of 19 had both dysplasia and condyloma, two cases had moderate and severe dysplasia. All the cases were studied with in situ hybridization with biotinilaty probes, two cases were positive to Subtype 18 and one to Subtype 16. Positive cases were selected for electron microscopy in order to confirm viral particles. This study suggests that subtype 18 and 16 positivity must be considered as high risk of cancer.
