p53 antigen in cervical condylomata, intraepithelial neoplasia, and carcinoma: relationship to HPV infection and integration. It has been proposed that wild-type p53 cell-regulating functions are annulled in human cervical carcinomas, either by mutations in the human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cases or as a consequence of their complexing with HPV E6. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis on 39 fresh cervical biopsies by p53 immunocytochemistry (ICC) with antibody PAb 240 and with NISH (non-isotopic in situ hybridization) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for HPV detection. p53 protein was present in the basal layer of pure wart virus infection the basal to middle third of CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia)
