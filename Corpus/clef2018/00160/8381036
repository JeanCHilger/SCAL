Current status and future clinical potential of human papillomavirus infection and intraepithelial neoplasia. Human papillomaviruses are closely related to genital squamous precursor lesions and invasive carcinomas. This close association has spawned various technologies and efforts to use molecular testing to provide information that may affect patient care. This review summarizes the potential role of papillomavirus DNA testing in the prediction of subsequent disease, management of abnormal Papanicolaou smears, and therapy of documented disease. Although there is some promise for human papillomavirus testing, particularly in certain patient groups or for quality control, its ultimate value awaits the development of uniform criteria for lesion recognition and diagnosis and universally accepted guidelines for patient evaluation and removal of potential cancer precursors.
