High-risk genital papillomaviruses and degree of dysplastic changes in the cervix: a prospective study by fast multiplex polymerase chain reaction in Belgium. The epidemiologic studies with the least selection bias do not support the hypothesis that HPV types 16 and/or 18 are strongly associated with cervical cancer. In this preliminary report, we describe our findings regarding type 16, 18, and 33 detection rates in 323 normal and 71 dysplastic or neoplastic cervical scrapes using fast multiplex PCR. This modified PCR technique has been shown to be the most sensitive, specific, and reproducible DNA detection method for large epidemiologic studies. The results indicate a high relative risk of increasingly severe cervical abnormality associated with the presence of high-risk HPV DNA. The analysis of the prevalence and age data according to CIN status by non-parametric statistic tests highlights the importance of other factors inversely correlated with age in the cervical transformation process.
