Chronic plasma cell cervicitis simulating a cervical malignancy: a case report. Only one case of plasma cell cervicitis, a rare variant of chronic cervicitis, has been reported. We report a second case and present data supporting the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) outside of epithelial tissues.A 67-year-old woman was found to have a large cervical tumor. Extensive diagnostic evaluation failed to reveal a suspected cervical cancer subsequently, a hysterectomy was performed. Light microscopic studies confirmed plasma cell cervicitis. Standard virologic tests were used to confirm the presence of HPV 16 in cervical sections. Retrospective study of the first reported case also demonstrated HPV.Fulminant cases of chronic cervicitis, presenting with clinical features similar to cervical cancer, are unusual. Even more interesting is the detection of HPV outside of the epithelium this is the first case that clearly demonstrates HPV in plasma cells.
