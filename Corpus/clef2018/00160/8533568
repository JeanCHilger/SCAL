Carbon dioxide laser miniconization for treatment of human papillomavirus infection associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The effect of the carbon dioxide laser miniconization for treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with concomitant human papillomavirus infection was evaluated.One hundred and eighteen women with cytologically proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 1 and/or 2 were investigated with repeat vaginal smear, colposcopy and human papillomavirus DNA sampling. Seventy-five out of 118 women were subjected to laser miniconization or punch biopsy and cervical curettage.Out of 118 patients 37 proved to have positive human papillomavirus DNA with one or more oncogenic types (31.4%). Of these, 32 women were miniconized and five subjected to punch biopsy or cervical curettage. On the first follow-up after miniconization all 32 patients were HPV negative. With follow-up up to five years no recurrences of HPV or dysplasia were seen.A miniconization procedure with carbon dioxide laser for treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia proved useful also for simultaneous therapy of concomitant human papillomavirus infection of the uterine cervix.
