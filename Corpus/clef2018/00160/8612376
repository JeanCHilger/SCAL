The pathology of cervical cancer. The significant changes over the last decade in the CIN/cervical carcinoma area have involved the increasing recognition of many cervical carcinomas as adenocarcinomas, rather than squamous cell type, and their propensity for arising in young women. Another area of interest is the deployment of new molecular techniques that are unveiling the role of oncogene co-factors (e.g. HPV, p53) in the biologic evolution of CIN and hopefully glandular dysplasia.
