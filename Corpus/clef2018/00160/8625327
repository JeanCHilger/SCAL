Tumor necrosis factor alpha interferes with the cell cycle of normal and papillomavirus-immortalized human keratinocytes. We have shown that normal and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 immortalized human foreskin keratinocytes are growth inhibited by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), whereas HPV-18- and SV40-immortalized keratinocytes are resistant to this cytokine (1). In this report, we investigated the expression of mitotic regulatory proteins, such as cyclin A, cyclin B, and p34cdc2. After exposure to TNF-alpha, normal and HPV-16-immortalized cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in the expression of these proteins. In contrast, no alteration in the levels of these proteins was observed after treatment of the resistant cell lines, as well as two HPV-positive cervical carcinoma cell lines. Expression of cyclin E does not seem to be modulated by TNF-alpha in any of the cells tested. On the other hand, cyclin D1, expression is slightly increased in normal keratinocytes and in the HPV-16-immortalized cells, whereas no alteration was observed in the HPV-18-transfected cells. The phosphorylation state of pRb correlated with cell growth sensitive cells, which accumulate in G0-G1, after exposure to TNF-alpha, exhibited an accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb, whereas no effect on pRb phosphorylation was observed for HPV-18-immortalized cells. These results clearly correlate with TNF-alpha-induced growth arrest in G0-G1.
