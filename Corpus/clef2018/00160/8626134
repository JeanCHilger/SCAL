Human papillomavirus detection of endometrioid carcinoma with squamous differentiation of the uterine corpus. Many studies have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical carcinoma. However, studies on the association of HPV with endometrioid carcinoma of the corpus uteri are sparse and controversial. In this study, 33 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of endometrioid carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation in grade 1 (adenoacanthoma) and 10 additional samples of endometrioid carcinoma with less squamous cell differentiation in grade 2 or 3 (adenosquamous carcinoma) were examined by the hybrid capture system for the presence of the 14 most common anogenital HPV types, consisting of low-risk HPV types 6, 11, 42, 43, and 44, and intermediate- and high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, and 56. No evidence of high-risk HPV DNA types was found in any of these samples. The low- risk HPV DNA types were found in three samples and showed borderline results (+/-) in 6 samples by the hybrid capture system. The 43 samples were tested by dot blot hybridization with HPV probes 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Only 1 sample was positive for HPV 6/11. The results of this study did not indicate an association between HPV infection and endometrioid carcinoma with squamous cells, though the endometrial mucosa of the corpus uteri is anatomically connected to the endocervical epithelium, and in some cases HPV has been postulated to possibly cause squamous cell differentiation of the endometrium. Our findings are in accord with the concept that HPV infection leading to malignancy is highly site- and tissue-specific. In conclusion, the endometrium may not be a suitable host epithelium for HPV replication and maturation.
