Chemoprevention trials and surrogate end point biomarkers in the cervix. Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy in women worldwide and remains a significant health problem for women, especially minority and underserved women. Despite an understanding of the epidemiologic risks, the screening Papanicolaou smear, and morbid and costly treatment, overall survival remains 40%. New strategies, based on the clinical and molecular aspects of cervical carcinogenesis, are desperately needed. Chemoprevention refers to the use of chemical agents to prevent or delay the development of cancer in healthy populations. Chemoprevention studies have several unique features that distinguish them from classic chemotherapeutic trials these features touch on several disciplines and weave knowledge of the biology of carcinogenesis into the trial design. In the design of chemoprevention trials, four factors are important: high risk cohorts must be identified
