Precancerous and cancerous involvement of the uterine cervix. Results of a survey conducted by the "Genital Cancers" group of Ile-de-France, May 1990-May 1992, based on 8,805 biopsies. Results of a study conducted by the "cervix cancer group" of PETRI, in Ile-de-France, from May 1990 to May 1992, and based on 8,805 biopsy specimens. In the absence of Cancer Registry in the Ile de France, no reliable data on invasive and preinvasive neoplasia of the cervix are available concerning this area. The aim of this survey, performed between May 15th, 1990 and May 15th, 1992 in 62 laboratories of pathology under the aegis of the Petri Association (Prévention et épidémiologie des tumeurs en Ile-de-France), was to obtain a better knowledge of this pathology, in which one of the major risk factors is the infection of the cervical epithelium by specific types of human papillomavirus. Over the course of these two years, 8,805 biopsy specimens, taken from neoplastic lesions of the cervix, were analyzed. Intra epithelial neoplasia represented more than 90% of the registered lesions. The average age at the time of the diagnosis was 32.4 years for the cases of condyloma, 32.7 years for CIN I, 33.8 years for CIN II, 36.3 years for CIN III, 45.7 years for micro-infiltrative carcinoma and 50.8 years for infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma. The breakdown of the different histological types of lesions is presented for three characteristic age groups (20-25, 30-35, and 60-70 years old). Differences observed in the eight departments belonging to the Ile-de-France are discussed.
