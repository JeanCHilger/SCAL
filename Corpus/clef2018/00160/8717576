The significance of mild squamous atypia on cytology. Between January, 1991 and February, 1993 inclusive, 396 Papanicolaou smears were reported to show Mild Squamous Atypia with or without Human Papilloma Virus (MSA +/- HPV). All women with MSA +/- HPV smears were routinely recalled for colposcopy. To determine the significance of MSA +/- HPV on routine smear screening, the records of all patients were reviewed. Three hundred and thirty-seven women (85.1%) attended the colposcopy clinic and are the subjects analyzed for this report. The remaining 59 (14.9%) failed to attend. Intraepithelial neoplasia was found in 61 patients (18.1%), of whom 27 (8.0%) had a high grade lesion (CIN 2 or 3 or GIN 2). No patient had invasive cancer of the cervix. Only 1 of the 45 pregnant women had a significant lesion. It is concluded that all asymptomatic women with MSA +/- HPV on cervical smear may be managed in accordance with the current NH and MRC recommendations (1) and have a repeat smear in 6 months and colposcopy if the abnormality persists at 12 months.
