Serological responses to human papillomavirus type 6 and 16 virus-like particles in patients with cervical neoplastic lesions. Serum samples from 36 cervical carcinoma patients, 33 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 31 cytologically normal women were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using human papilloma virus type 6 (HPV 6) and HPV 16 virus-like particles as antigens. Forty serum specimens from 1-year-old children were used to assign cutoff points. When serum samples from the subjects infected with HPV 16 were tested in an HPV 16 ELISA detecting immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, and IgM binding, 61% showed IgA, 44% showed IgG, and 39% showed IgM reactivity. Of HPV 6- or 11- or HPV 18-infected subjects. fewer than 17% showed IgA or IgG responses and 33% showed IgM reactivity. In contrast, 13% showed IgA, 10% showed IgG, and 16% showed IgM reactivity in the HPV DNA-negative controls. The results suggest that the IgA and IgG responses are HPV 16 specific and the IgM response is cross-reactive to different HPV types. On the other hand, the serological responses to HPV 6 did not differ in the patient and control groups. The percentages of patients positive for both IgA and IgG antibodies were significantly higher in the groups with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (12% [4 of 33] P = 0.04) and cancer (17% [6 of 36]
