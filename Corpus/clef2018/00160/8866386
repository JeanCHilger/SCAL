Squamous intraepithelial cervical lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive women. To evaluate the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, CD4 serum level, cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and risk factors for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related dysplasia in HIV-positive women.All 51 eligible patients who were seen at the Colposcopic Outpatient Service, Aviano Cancer Center, Aviano, Italy, from July 1, 1993, to June 30, 1994, were studied for risk factors for HPV and HIV infection and had cervical cytologic smears, colposcopy with cervical biopsy and a serum CD4 count.Thirty of 51 patients (59%) had cytohistologically confirmed SIL. The prevalence of SIL was higher in HIV Centers for Disease Control stage IV disease than stages II and III (22/29 vs. 8/22 P < .05). There was no significant difference in the CD4 count between women with or without SIL (321 +/- 310 vs. 401 +/- 295/mm3 [mean +/- SD]). No relationship was found between CD4 count and severity of SIL (low grade SIL, 210 +/- 203/mm3 high grade SIL, 580 +/- 357/mm3).In our series there was no relationship between CD4 count and cervical SIL, suggesting that the expression of HPV-related dysplasia is a complex process in which risk factors for genital SIL play an important role, while the role of HIV must be defined again.
