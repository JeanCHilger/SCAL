Primary low-grade endometrial B-cell lymphoma. We describe three cases of primary low-grade B-cell lymphoma of the endometrium and contrast the histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features with two examples of benign endometrial lymphoid infiltrates. The first case was an incidental finding in a curettage specimen, confirmed on a subsequent hysterectomy. The other two cases of lymphoma were incidental findings on hysterectomy procedures performed for prolapse and cervical dysplasia, respectively. All three lymphomas occurred in patients in their sixties none formed gross tumors. Histologic examination revealed lymphoid nodules adjacent to endometrial glands. The lymphoid cells showed mild nuclear enlargement and slight irregularities of the nuclear contour. None of the three patients had evidence of disease outside the endometrium by physical examination, bone marrow biopsy, or sampling of pelvic lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a B-cell phenotype of the lymphoid cells (CD20 positive, CD79a positive) with aberrant coexpression of the T-cell-associated marker CD43. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the VDJ region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain was performed on DNA isolated from paraffin sections. These studies demonstrated a clonal proliferation of B-lymphocytes in two cases. In the third case, a faint band was found superimposed on a background smear, suggesting the presence of a B-cell clone. In contrast, the two examples of histologically benign lymphoid aggregates of the endometrium consisted predominantly of T cells with rare B-lymphocytes
