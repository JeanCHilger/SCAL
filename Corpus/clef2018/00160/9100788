Cytologic atypia. Clinical significance and follow-up recommendations. To assess the evolution of cytologic atypia on cervical cytologic smears as an attempt to better understand the natural history of these lesions and to establish a follow-up protocol.The study group consisted of 76 patients with a diagnosis of cytologic atypia on cervical cytologic smears performed at the gynecology Outpatient Clinic, Hospital del Mar, between December 1989 and June 1993. Patients with inflammatory atypia, a reparative process or findings consistent with human papillomavirus infection had been excluded. Follow-up smears were reviewed. Compliance with follow-up recommendations was also evaluated.Thirty-nine patients returned to the clinic for follow-up after a diagnosis of atypia (51.3%). Progression from atypia to dysplasia was found in 38.5% of patients with at least a follow-up smear. Changes consistent with intraepithelial neoplasia were found in 17 patients: low grade dysplasia was found in 10 patients (mild dysplasia in 8 and atypia in 2) and high grade dysplasia in 7 (moderate in 4 and severe in 3). This progression was most commonly found at the first follow-up visit and within the first year.Patients with cytologic atypia were at higher risk of developing dysplasia than those with reparative atypia. Our results support the theory of progression from atypia to dysplasia in a considerable percentage of patients. Follow-up compliance in our patient population was low. One should emphasize the importance of this diagnosis and encourage close cytologic follow-up, especially within the first year after the diagnosis of atypia.
