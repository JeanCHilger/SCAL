The HPV determinants of CIN I. Correlates of HPV amongst a cohort of women with a CIN I detected by a screening Pap test were investigated. Co-incident CIN II/III lesions were identified and their influence on the HPV status and HPV determinants of screening detected CIN I was assessed. Based on both the colposcopic impression and repeat Pap test, 537 women referred for examination of a Pap test classified as CIN I were triaged into two groups. Group A lesions were assessed as </= CIN I n = 342 (63.7%) and group B as >/= CIN II
