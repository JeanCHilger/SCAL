Content of alpha-tocopherol in blood serum of human Papillomavirus-infected women with cervical dysplasias. The studies were carried out in a group of 228 female patients with normal cytological smear and 324 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The applied method of identification, i.e., the human Papillomavirus (HPV) digene hybrid capture system, made it possible to select a control group consisting of 168 HPV-negative patients with normal Pap smear, as well as a group of 228 HPV-positive patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The high-performance liquid chromatography method was employed to evaluate the level of alpha-tocopherol in the blood serum of the patients who were examined. A statistically significantly lower level of alpha-tocopherol was observed in the blood serum of HPV-positive patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The risk of dysplasia was four times higher for an alpha-tocopherol level < 7.95 mumol/l.
