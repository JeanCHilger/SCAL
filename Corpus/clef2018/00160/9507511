Dietary factors in women with dysplasia colli uteri associated with human papillomavirus infection. The studies were carried out in a group of 228 female patients with normal cytological smear and 324 patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The applied method of human papillomavirus (HPV) identification, i.e., the HPV digene hybrid capture system, made it possible to select a control group consisting of 168 HPV-negative patients with normal Papanicolaou smears, as well as a group of 228 HPV-positive female patients with CIN. By examining the diet of the patients, it was shown that women with cervical dysplasia associated with high oncogenic risk of HPV infections consumed a smaller quantity of foods containing vitamin C, beta-carotene, and folacin. Our studies indicate a relationship between nutritional habits and the development of CIN associated with HPV infection.
