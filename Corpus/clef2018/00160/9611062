Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and HPV infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been recognized as the major cause of cervical cancer [1]. The transformation zone of the cervix is the most frequent target of the high risk HPV types. In our study infection with HPV16 and 18 was investigated in the cervical scrapes of 28 subjects with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The DNAs isolated from the samples were amplified by dot-blot hybridization with fragmented digoxygenin labelled probes. Eighteen of 28 patients (64.3%) were found positive for HPV-16, eleven (39.3%) were found positive for HPV-18 and six patients (21%) were infected with both HPV types. This method is practical and sensitive for determining patients with a higher risk of developing HPV-related cancer.
