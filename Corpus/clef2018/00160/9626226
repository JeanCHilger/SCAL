Telomerase activity as a biomarker for (pre)neoplastic cervical disease in scrapings and frozen sections from patients with abnormal cervical smear. To evaluate the diagnostic value of semi-quantitative telomerase activity assessment in cervical scrapings together with human papillomavirus (HPV) typing for detection of (pre)neoplastic cervical lesions and to compare telomerase activity in cervical scrapings and frozen specimens from the same patients.A cross-sectional study was performed in 161 patients referred for an abnormal cervical cytology report. In cervical scrapings, telomerase activity was determined by modified telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay and HPV typing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with general and type-specific primers. Final diagnosis was made by pathologic examination of biopsy and/or loop excision specimens.Telomerase activity was detectable in assessable scrapings from one of nine (11%) patients without cervical intraepitheleal neoplasia (CIN), in three of 26 (12%) with CIN I, eight of 35 (22%) with CIN II, 18 of 62 (29%) with CIN III, and four of 13 (31%) with cancer. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of the TRAP assay for CIN II/III and cancer lesions were 25% and 28%, respectively, while specificity for no CIN or CIN I was 89%. In representative frozen sections, frequency of detectable telomerase activity was related to grade of CIN/cancer none of 21 normal cervices, none of two CIN I, two of 12 (17%) CIN II, 10 of 31 (32%) CIN III, and 18 of 21 (86%) cervical cancer lesions were telomerase-positive (P < .0005). Telomerase activity levels in paired scrapings and frozen sections appeared to be only weakly relatedTelomerase activity is more frequent in higher grade CIN/cervical cancer lesions. Telomerase activity assessment in cervical scrapings has a low sensitivity for CIN II/III and/or cervical cancer and does not appear to be useful in primary screening for cervical cancer. However, increased telomerase activity in frozen CIN sections may be a possible marker of progressive disease.
