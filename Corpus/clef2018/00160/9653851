Abnormal cervical cytology in pregnancy: experience of 811 cases. This paper reviews our hospital's experience spanning 15 years and involving 811 women referred with abnormal cervical cytology in pregnancy. It supports the safety and accuracy of managing dysplasia in pregnancy with colposcopy, directed punch biopsy and deferral of treatment until the postpartum period. The histologically-proven progression in pregnancy to a higher grade of dysplasia postpartum was 7%. None of the women are known to have developed microinvasive or invasive cancer between antenatal assessment and postpartum review. Of these 811 women, 16% were lost to follow-up, 1 of whom subsequently represented 4 years later with invasive cervical cancer.
