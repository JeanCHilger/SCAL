The in situ polymerase chain reaction for detection of chlamydia trachomatis. The in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that has important applications in the diagnosis of viral and bacterial diseases. This study investigated an in situ PCR assay established to detect the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis in endocervical swabs. In addition, histological sections of endocervical squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed because previous studies had revealed a significant association with C. trachomatis. A total of 20 cervical neoplasms (squamous cell carcinoma in situ n = 10
