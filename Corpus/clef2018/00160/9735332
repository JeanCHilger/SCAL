JC9813-A putative novel human papillomavirus identified by PCR-DS. Papillomaviruses consist of more than 130 viral types described so far. Most of them are human papillomaviruses (HPV) of supergroup A, demonstrating ano-genital tropism and characterized as etiological agents for benign and malignant cervical lesions in women. A PCR-direct sequencing (PCR-DS) approach with P-33 labeled dideoxynucleotides was used to detect and type human papillomaviruses in cervical biopsies. One novel sequence was identified in a LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) specimen from an HIV-positive English Canadian patient. The structure of the viral gene L1 was determined, yielding a putative novel HPV type of supergroup A (clade A8) named JC9813.
