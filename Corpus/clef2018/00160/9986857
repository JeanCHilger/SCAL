Comparative evaluation of first- and second-generation digene hybrid capture assays for detection of human papillomaviruses associated with high or intermediate risk for cervical cancer. In the present study we comparatively evaluated the first- and second-generation Digene Hybrid Capture assays for detection of human papillomaviruses (HPV) associated with high or intermediate risk for cervical cancer in cervical specimens. Concordant results were obtained with 468 of 483 (96.8%) specimens. All 15 specimens which gave repeatedly discordant results were positive by the second-generation test only, and 14 of them tested PCR positive. The enhanced sensitivity of the second-generation assay is mainly a result of the reformulation of hybridization reagents and, to a lesser extent, a result of the addition of new HPV probes.
