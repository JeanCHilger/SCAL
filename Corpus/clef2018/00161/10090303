Soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels and cervical neoplasia: results from a population-based case-control study in Costa Rica. Progression from infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) to cervical cancer in some women is thought to involve a permissive host environment, one in which immune response is mobilized in an inappropriate manner. In a previous study (A. Hildesheim et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 6: 807-813, 1997), increasing levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R), a known proxy for general immune activation, was found to be positively associated with increasing levels of cervical neoplasia. We attempted to confirm this finding by conducting a nested case-control study of 478 women within a 10,000-woman population-based cohort in Costa Rica. We selected for the study all of the women diagnosed (at enrollment into the cohort) with: (a) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL, n = 191) (b) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL, n = 130)
