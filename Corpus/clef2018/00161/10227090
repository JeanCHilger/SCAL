Does a particular risk associated with papillomavirus infections exist in women with lupus?. There is strong evidence that papillomavirus infections (HPV), especially infections with HPV 16/18, are involved in the development of dysplasia and cancers. Cervical cancer is thought to be increased in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).To assess this risk we studied cervical smears from 11 women with SLE and determined the prevalence of HPV infection by in situ hybridization.Dysplasia was found in 9% of women with SLE and in 0.03% of control subjects (non significant difference). Dysplasia was found to be six times more frequent in women with SLE (18% versus 3%, P < 0.01). HPV prevalence in normal smears was 37.5% in women with SLE versus 14.7% in control subjects (non-significant difference). Identified HPV genotypes were those for which intermediate or high risk is well established. No correlation was found between infection or dysplasia risk and the lymphocyte count or a previous treatment with cyclophosphamide.We conclude that women with SLE would be at increased risk of HPV infection, dysplasia and cervical cancer. We suggest that women with SLE should be regularly tested for cervical cancer by colposcopy, especially in case of HPV 16 infection.
