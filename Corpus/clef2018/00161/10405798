Pap smear follow-up of possible role of mucopurulent exudate as a prognosticator of a negative pregnancy outcome. Our objective was to study a cohort of women by various means to detect sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and to correlate the presence of mucopurulent exudate (PEX) on Papanicolaou (Pap) smears with pregnancy outcome. Bacteriologic cultures taken from swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea were correlated with Gen-Probe results. Smears were examined for trichomonas, yeast, HPV, obscuring mucopurulent exudate, and squamous intraepithelial abnormalities. There was no positive correlation between STD and negative pregnancy outcome. Mucopurulent exudate on Pap smears was very high in this population. Continuing study of this population of women is needed to see if larger cohorts will demonstrate any positive correlations between PEX and pregnancy outcome. Placing women with obscuring mucopurulent exudate in a "high-risk" category for complications may prevent adverse side effects to the birth product. The Pap smear works as well as the Gram stain for detection of bacterial vaginosis and cervicitis. Eliminating the Gram stain from routine pelvic exam results in cost savings.
