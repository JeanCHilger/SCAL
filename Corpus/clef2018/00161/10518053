Biology of the papillomavirus infections: V. Vaccine developments. Several genotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPV) are recognised as aetiologic factors for cervical cancer, and viral DNA account for more 99% of cases. Thus, prevention of HPV infection by, for example, types 16 and 18, should reduce the world-wide incidence of cervical cancer. Many strategies are being developed for the control of HPV-associated lesions of the uterine cervix: prophylactic vaccines which elicit neutralizing antibodies to prevent HPV infection, and therapeutic vaccines which induce a T-cytotoxic response to early viral oncoproteins. Experimental trials are being conducted to test mucosal immunization with an ideal antigen delivery system. Vaccination strategies elicit a protective antibody response in animal species, but in humans, strategies which are likely to be effective in the control of HPV-associated preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix are still under investigation.
