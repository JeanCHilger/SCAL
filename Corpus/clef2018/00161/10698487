The p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism, human papillomavirus, and invasive squamous cell cervical cancer. A. Storey et al. [Nature (Lond.), 393: 229-234, 1998)] reported a 7-fold increased risk of cervical cancer associated with having an Arg/Arg polymorphism at codon 72 of p53 compared with the Pro/Arg heterozygotes (odds ratio, 7.4 95% confidence interval, 2.1-29.4). Complementary in vitro studies suggested that the HPV E6 oncoprotein more readily targets the arginine form, as opposed to the proline form, of p53 for degradation. We investigated the impact of this polymorphism in a population-based case-control study of invasive cervical cancer. Using a PCR assay to detect the p53 codon 72 polymorphism, we tested blood samples from 111 women with invasive squamous cell cancer of the cervix identified by a population-based registry and 164 random-digit telephone-dialed controls. The distribution of the genotype among control women was 38% heterozygous, 7% proline homozygous, and 55% arginine homozygous, and among the cases was 38%, 6%, and 56%, respectively. There was no increased risk of squamous cell invasive cervical cancer associated with homozygosity for the arginine allele (odds ratio, 1.0
