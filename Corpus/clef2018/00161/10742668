Adolescents' knowledge of human papillomavirus and cervical dysplasia. This study examined adolescents' knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical dysplasia (CD). Factors associated with knowledge and self-reported change in health-related behaviors were identified.Interviews were conducted at an average of 2.5 years following the diagnosis of HPV/CD. Medical charts were reviewed.The study was conducted at a university-based adolescent dysplasia clinic.Fifty females, ages 15-23 participated in the study: 88% African-American, 12% Caucasian.On average, participants responded correctly to 86% of the questions regarding HPV/CD. However, the following key points were routinely missed: 52% did not know cigarette smoking increased the risk for cervical cancer 42% believed that HPV/CD was always symptomaticAdolescent girls had knowledge of most factors related to HPV/CD, but many did not understand the risks of cigarette smoking and failure to use condoms. To improve understanding and compliance, health care providers should tailor educational strategies to the functional level of adolescents.
