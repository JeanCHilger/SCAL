High risk human papillomavirus in women with normal cervical cytology prior to the development of abnormal cytology and colposcopy. To study the significance of the presence of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with initially normal cervical cytology for the development of abnormal cytology and an abnormal colposcopic impression.Prospective, observational studySixty-eight women with cytomorphologically normal smears and at least one positive HPV test result were evaluated every six months by cytology, colposcopy and HPV testing. The endpoint of the study was abnormal cervical cytology.The median time of follow up from the first positive HPV test was 34 months. A total of 17 women developed abnormal cytology, of whom 16 (94%) had persistence of a high risk HPV infection. Women with persistent high risk HPV were more likely to develop abnormal cervical cytology than women without high risk HPV (hazard ratio 28.2, 95% CI 3.72-215.2) they also had an increased risk of developing an abnormal colposcopic impression (hazard ratio 4.4, 95% CI 1.69-11.7). Among the 17 women with abnormal cytology, high grade dysplasia was histopathologically demonstrated in eight women.Persistent presence of high risk HPV in normal cervical smears is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing abnormal cytology and to a lesser degree with developing an abnormal colposcopic impression.
