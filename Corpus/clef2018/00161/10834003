Human papillomavirus infection in atrophic smears. A case report. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in atrophic smears can be misleading and may produce the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.A routine cervical smear in a 62-year-old female revealed an atrophic smear with nuclear changes suggestive of a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). An estrogen cream for topical vaginal use was prescribed. A new smear was collected seven days later and revealed koilocytosis but no evidence of HSIL.Koilocytosis is a cellular finding of mature epithelial cells. The use of estrogen produces maturation of HPV-infected basal cells, allowing a correct diagnosis of this disease in patients with atrophic smears.
