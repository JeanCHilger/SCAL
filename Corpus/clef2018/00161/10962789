Lesbians and cervical screening. Confusion exists in clinical practice about whether lesbians should be offered routine cervical smears. We found cervical smear abnormalities in a sample of 624 lesbians, including those who had never been sexually active with men. These findings suggest that lesbians should be routinely offered cervical cytology as part of the national screening programme. Evidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in the 'exclusively lesbian' group indicates that sexual transmission of HPV may occur between women. The belief by some lesbians that they have less need for cervical smears, coupled with poor uptake of cervical screening by a significant proportion, demonstrates a need for education of lesbians and health service providers.
