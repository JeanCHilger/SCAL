Improvement of gene transfer to cervical cancer cell lines using non-viral agents. Virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of recombinant capsid protein L1 and L2 of human papillomavirus type 16 were conjugated with polylysine (PL) and gene transfer was performed using VLP-PL conjugates to allow the expression of targeted gene. When HeLa cells were incubated with VLP-PL conjugate coupled with plasmid cytomegalovirus beta-galactosidase (pCMVbeta-gal), about 10% of cells were transfected and demonstrated beta-galactosidase activity. Hence chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was also expressed significantly in VLP-PL-plasmid simian virus 2 chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (pSV2CAT)-transfected cells, VLP-PL conjugate was tested whether it could transfer a tumor suppressor gene, pCMVp53, to HeLa cells and the exogenously provided p53 gene complexed to VLP-PL conjugate was detected from HeLa cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Interestingly, additional increase of transfection efficiency was demonstrated in the presence of poloxamer 407 when C-33A cells were transfected with VLP-PL-pCMVbeta-gal complex. The result support the notion that VLP-PL conjugate may be a promising vector to transfer genetic materials into cancer cells and poloxamer 407 can be used for enhancing the transfection efficiency of VLP-PL conjugate.
