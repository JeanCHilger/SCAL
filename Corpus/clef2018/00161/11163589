Molecular detection of human papillomavirus in women with minor-grade cervical cytology abnormalities. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been shown to be the major risk factor for the development of cervical carcinoma, the second most common cancer among women worldwide. Cervical cytology has been the main screening tool for detection of premalignant lesions in last 50 years.The utility of a molecular assay for detection of HPV in cervical smears was evaluated.A total of 466 women with minor-grade cervical cytology abnormality supposed to be produced by HPV were included. Patients were classified into three groups: Patients with reactive changes, patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN 1), and patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2). In all patients, another cervical swab was obtained and tested for the HPV genome using the Digene Hybrid Capture II. This assay is able to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk HPV types.Based on cytology results, 44 patients showed reactive changes, 250 patients displayed CIN 1, and 172 patients displayed CIN 2. With the molecular assay, HPV was detected in 289/466 (62%) patients. The high-risk HPV type was present in 263 (56.4%) patients and the low-risk type in 26 (5,5%) patients. In 25% of patients with reactive changes, the HPV genome was detected. Corresponding rates for patients with CIN 1 and CIN 2 were 55 and 81%, respectively.Molecular detection of HPV should additionally be used to cytology in patients whose cervical smears display reactive changes, CIN 1, or CIN 2. The employed assay allows identification of patients who are at risk for development of high-grade cervical lesions.
