The antibody response to HPV proteins and the genomic state of HPVs in patients with cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNAs are often found to be integrated into the human genome in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) as well as in invasive cervical cancers. Investigation of the relationship between the genomic status of specific HPV genes and their antibody responses to the virus-like particles (VLPs) of HPV-16 L1/L2 proteins and the in vitro translated HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins may help to illustrate the mechanism of HPV-related cervical carcinogenesis and host immune response. Cervical cancer tissues obtained from 39 patients were studied to evaluate the physical status of HPV genes by Southern blotting, DNA-PCR, and RT-PCR of E2. The antibody response against the HPV-16 L1/L2 VLPs of serum specimens were tested by ELISA and the antibody response against the HPV-16 E6 and E7 proteins were tested by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), respectively. Integrated forms of HPV-16 DNA were found in 23 of the 38 patients (60.5%). The HPV-16 positive cervical cancer patients showed a significantly higher prevalence rate (39.5% 15/38) of antibodies to HPV-16 L1/L2 VLPs than that of the control group (8.7%
