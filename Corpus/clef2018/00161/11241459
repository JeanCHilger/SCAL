Human papillomavirus (HPV) study of 691 pathological specimens from Quebec by PCR-direct sequencing approach. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are etiological agents of cervical cancer. In order to address clinical demand for HPV detection and sequence typing, mostly in pre-cancerous cervical lesions, we applied our two-tier PCR-direct sequencing (PCR-DS) approach based on the use of both MY09/MY11 and GP5 + /GP6 + sets of primers. We tested 691 pathological specimens, all of which were biopsies, 75% of which were diagnosed histologically as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades I-III. In total, 484 samples (70%) tested HPV-positive, yielding 531 HPV sequences from 47 HPV types, including two novel types. Four most frequently found HPV types accounted for 52.9% of all isolates: HPV6, 16, 11, and 31 (21.5%, 20.0%, 7.0%, and 4.5%, respectively). Some interesting results are the following: all currently known high-risk HPV (14 types) and low-risk HPV (6 types) were detected HPV18 was not the 1st or 2nd but rather the 4th-5th most frequent high-risk HPV type
