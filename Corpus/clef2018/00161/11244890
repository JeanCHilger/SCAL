Imiquimod: a new treatment possibility in bowenoid papulosis?. Bowenoid papulosis is a highly characteristic condition of the anogenital region which is histologically similar to bowenoid carcinoma in situ. Some evidence suggests a viral origin on the basis of infection with high-risk oncogenic genotypes of human papilloma viruses (HPV 16/18 and others) and an association with cervical carcinoma. Malignant transformation is rare in bowenoid papulosis. The condition usually shows a good response to immuno-modulatory treatment. In the following we present our first case of successful treatment with imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier which is successfully used in the USA for local treatment of condylomata acuminata. Imiquimod creme (Aldara) proved to be a safe, efficious and practical patient-applied therapeutic option for the treatment of bowenoid papulosis. In view of the oncogenic potential of high-risk HPV infections, irrespective of the treatment used, all patients with bowenoid papulosis and their sexual partners must be included in long-term follow-up and regularly examined for malignant transformation.
