Human papillomavirus-associated cervical cytologic abnormalities among women with or at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Correlates of abnormal human immunodeficiency virus cervical cytologic findings were examined among women infected with human immunodeficiency virus and uninfected women.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data on demographically similar women with infection or risk factors for it.Among 1050 women without hysterectomy, squamous intraepithelial lesions were more common among women infected with human immunodeficiency virus than among uninfected women (18.8% vs 5.3% P <.001). In multivariate analysis the association of squamous intraepithelial lesions with human papillomavirus infection was strongSquamous intraepithelial lesions are more common among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women and are associated most commonly with high- and intermediate-risk human papillomavirus types and secondarily with human immunodeficiency virus-associated immune compromise.
