Poor antibody response against human papillomavirus in adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis. To investigate whether adult-onset laryngeal papillomatosis induces serum antibodies to the human papillomavirus (HPV), 60 patients underwent a clinical examination, and HPV DNA from their laryngeal biopsy was assayed by PCR and HPV serology with virus-like particles as the antigen. Patients and controls (n = 53) showed no differences in their HPV 6 and 16 antibodies. Patients more often had HPV 11 antibodies, female patients more often than female controls or male patients. Of the female patients, 5 of 15 had a history of genital condylomas and, at the follow-up visit, 5 of 9 had cervical cytology consistent with genital HPV infection. The fact that HPV antibodies did not correlate with clinical features of the laryngeal disease or with HPV DNA detected in the larynx, suggests that HPV antibodies in female patients were induced by genital rather than laryngeal HPV infection. The high prevalence of abnormal Pap smears indicates that gynaecological examination of female adult-onset laryngeal papilloma patients is warranted.
