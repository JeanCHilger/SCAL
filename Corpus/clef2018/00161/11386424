Much higher risk of premalignant and malignant cervical diseases in younger women positive for HPV16 than in older women positive for HPV16. Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV16, is strongly associated with premalignant lesions of the uterine cervix and cervical cancer. However, HPV infection is a common sexually transmitted disease and only a few women develop cervical cancer. Although the presence of HPV and abnormal cytology are independent risk factors for cervical diseases, implementing both tests on every woman is argued not to be recommended mainly in terms of cost-effectiveness. During a 20-month period between October, 1994, and May, 1996, cervical swabs from 207 women who were referred for colposcopy because of cervical dyskaryosis (Papanicolaou class IIIa or higher) were examined by PCR for the presence of HPV16. When these women were divided into two groups i.e., group A consisting of women who were 44 years old or younger (n = 111), and group B consisting of women who were 45 years old or older (n = 96), the risk of having premalignant and malignant cervical diseases upon infection with HPV16 was approximately 8 times higher in group A than in group B. Thus, we conclude that HPV-testing should be implemented on every young woman with an abnormal Papanicolaou smear test.
