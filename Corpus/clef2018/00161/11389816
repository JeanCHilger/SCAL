Prevention of cervical cancer with vaccines. Worldwide, cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. This is especially true in developing countries, where Papanicolaou smear screening, an effective preventive measure against cervical cancer, is insufficiently implemented. With growing evidence for human papillomavirus as a central etiologic factor in cervical neoplasia, development of a vaccine against this virus has emerged as an important objective in prevention of cervical cancer. International efforts in vaccine development have culminated in advancement of various vaccine strategies and initiation of human clinical trials. Reports from animal vaccine trials and early phase I human trials indicate markedly enhanced immune response through vaccination. However, the clinical significance of these results requires confirmation from long-term human trials.
