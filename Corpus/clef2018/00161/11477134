What we could do now: molecular pathology of gynaecological cancer. Gynaecological tumours exemplify many of the molecular paradigms of carcinogenesis. The clinical value of many of the molecular abnormalities present is now being tested and it is likely that the identification of at least some of these will become routine in the near future. This may help to refine diagnosis and guide treatment-for example, therapeutic vaccination for human papillomavirus related disease.
