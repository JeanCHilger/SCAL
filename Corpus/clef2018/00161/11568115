Use of up-converting phosphor reporters in lateral-flow assays to detect specific nucleic acid sequences: a rapid, sensitive DNA test to identify human papillomavirus type 16 infection. A lateral-flow (LF) device using the new reporter up-converting phosphor technology (UPT) was applied to DNA (hybridization) assays for the detection of specific nucleic acid sequences, thereby aiming to perform the test outside well-equipped laboratories. The methodology reported here is sensitive and provides a rapid alternative for more elaborate gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. In a preliminary study, it was applied to screen for the presence of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) in a defined series of cervical carcinomas.A LF assay was used to capture haptenized DNA molecules and hybrids, which were immunolabeled (before LF) with 400-nm UPT particles. These particles emit visible light after excitation with infrared in a process called up-conversion. Because up-conversion occurs in only the phosphor lattice, autofluorescence of other assay components is virtually nonexistent.The use of the UPT reporter in LF-DNA tests, as compared with colloidal gold, improved the detection limit at least 100-fold. UPT LF-DNA tests were successfully applied to detect (in a blind test) the presence of HPV16 in DNA extracts obtained from cervical carcinomas. Test results matched 100% with previous characterization of these carcinomas.The use of UPT in LF assays to detect specific nucleic acids provides low attamole-range sensitivity. Hybridization and consecutive detection of PCR-amplified HPV16 sequences were successful in a background of 10 microg of fish-sperm DNA. The sensitivity of UPT detection in these complex mixtures indicates that detection of viral infections without PCR or other amplification technique is achievable.
