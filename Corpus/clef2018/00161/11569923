"Low-risk" and "high-risk" HPV-infection and K-ras gene point mutations in human cervical cancer: a study of 31 cases. To analyze the coexistence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and K-ras gene activation in cervical neoplasia, we investigated 31 (seven pre-invasive and 24 invasive) cervical carcinomas for "low-risk" (types 6 and 11) and "high-risk" (types 16 and 18) HPVs and K-ras point mutations using PCR-based technology. "Low-risk" HPVs were not detected in the group investigated however, 20 of 31 (64%) cases were HPV 16 positive, while HPV 18 was found in only three (9.7%) samples (HPV 6/11 v. HPV 16/18, p < 0.0001
