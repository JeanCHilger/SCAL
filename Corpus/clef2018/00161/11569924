p53 in surgically treated and pathologically staged cervical cancer: correlation with local tumor progression, but not with lymphatic spread. There is only limited information about the prognostic value of p53 immunostaining in cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical significance of p53 and prognosis in operatively treated cervical carcinoma. A hundred and fourteen primary surgically treated cervical carcinomas (CX) were obtained from the so called Wertheim Archive in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Leipzig. These included 105 squamous cell cancer (SCC) and nine adenocarcinomas (AC). No cases received neoadjuvant therapy. For immunohistochemical analysis, the cases were tested with the monoclonal antibody DO-7 (DAKO Diagnostics, Denmark). Two hundred tumor cell nuclei were counted for positive nuclear immunostaining, regardless of staining intensity. Cases were stated as positive when a minimum of 10% nuclei showed positive staining. Fresh frozen tissue was available from 21 CX for p53-mutation analysis (exons 4-9) using PCR-based amplification and SSCP-analysis. Of the squamous cell cancers (SCC), 63.8% showed positive nuclear p53-immunostaining adenocarcinomas (AC) were completely negative (P = 0.0000, Chi2-test). Stage-by-stage analysis revealed no differences in p53-expression. However, combining pT1b- and pT2-cases, the difference in positive immunostaining reached statistical significance (44.4% vs. 71.7%
