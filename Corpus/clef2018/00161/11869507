Research on the oncogenesis of cervical epithelial cells co-induced by human papillomavirus and human cytomegalovirus. The carcinogenesis of the human cervical carcinoma is known closely associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The purpose of this article is to identify whether another sexually transmitted factor, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) plays as a co-factor role in the carcinogenesis.Human cervical epithelial cells immortalized by HPV16 were transfected with IE gene of HCMV. The condition and efficiency of IE gene were examined.It was showed that the cervical epithelial cells could be completely transformed into malignant by HPV 16 and IE gene of HCMV and tumor was formed by injecting the transformed cells in nude mice.The co-operation effect of HPV and HCMV auailed the oncogenesis of human cervical carcinoma and moreover, the cellular and molecular biological mechanism was discussed.
