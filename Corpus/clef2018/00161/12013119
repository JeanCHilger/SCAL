The prevalence of human papilloma virus DNA in women with mucopurulent endocervicitis. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a group of patients with mucopurulent endocervicitis.One hundred and forty-eight patients who came for their routine medical screening and were diagnosed with mucopurulent endocervicitis were enrolled in the study. HPV DNA was sought in cervical swab specimens placed in digene transport medium by use of the Digene Hybrid Capture assay.HPV infection was detected in 5.4% (8/148) of the patients with mucopurulent endocervicitis. The mean age of the patients was 36.4+/-8.2 (18-54) years. Approximately 40% (59/148) of the patients used intrauterine devices currently or in the past, while 16.2% (24/148) used combined oral contraceptives as the contraceptive method. HPV DNA was detected in eight patients: five had infections with low-risk subtypes, one with high/intermediate risk subtypes and one with the combination of high- and low-risk subtypes. The mean age of the HPV infected patients was significantly lower than the HPV negative patients (28.2+/-6.3 versus 36.9+/-8.1 years, p = 0.003). Risk factors for HPV infection did not differ between the infected and uninfected groups.HPV infection should be sought in patients with clinical evidence of mucopurulent endocervicitis even without risk factors for cervical neoplasia.
