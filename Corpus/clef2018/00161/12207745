CD4+ T lymphocytopenia with disseminated HPV. There have been several reports of HIV-negative patients with chronic idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia, the diagnostic criteria for which are: depressed numbers of circulating T lymphocytes (less than 300/ micro l or less than 20%) on more than one occasion no laboratory evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infectionWe report a patient with disseminated human papillomavirus infection associated with idiopathic CD4+ T-cell lymphocytopenia. A 50-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 10-year history of widespread verrucae involving the skin and the cervix.Biopsy from the arm revealed a common wart. PCR analysis performed from the paraffin-embedded block was strongly positive for HPV type 2. Other HPV types (including EV-associated HPV 5, 8, 14, 15, 17) were not found. Further laboratory work up revealed T-cell lymphocytopenia, with an absolute CD4 count of 21. HIV tests were repeatedly negative. She was treated with interferon A 8 million units SQ three times per week with partial improvement. The patient underwent a hysterectomy for cervical dysplasia and a vulvectomy for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. She developed small-cell lung carcinoma and died.The diagnosis of idiopathic CD4+ T-cell lymphocytopenia should be considered in any patient with widespread viral, fungal, or mycobacterial infection whose HIV test is negative, and appropriate evaluation of the absolute CD4+ counts should be performed.
