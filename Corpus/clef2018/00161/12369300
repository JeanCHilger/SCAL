The clinical value of laboratory tests for detection of HPV infection in prevention and treatment of cervical cancer. The retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies were conducted in centres all over the world and showed that the main etiological factor in cervical cancer is human papillomavirus infection. The problem of detection of HPV infection is being currently under discussion. The selection of method of HPV detection in clinical samples and standardisation of laboratory tests allows for determination of diagnostic method in case of HPV infection. There are not clear guidelines for the pattern of HPV detection in our country. It seems that the proper clinical follow-up could be the combination of physical, cytological and histopathological examination with detection of human papillomavirus DNA.
