Detection of human herpes virus type 6 DNA in precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. Human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) DNA has been suggested to be a cofactor to human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between HHV-6 DNA detected in cervical brushings and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), while controlling for genital infection with 27 genotypes of HPV. Of the 320 women recruited from an oncologic gynecology clinic, 50 had invasive cervical cancer, 65 had HSIL, 80 had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 125 were normal. Four of the seven HHV-6-positive women had HSIL. HHV-6 was associated with HSIL after adjusting for age and socioeconomic status (odds ratio [OR] of 10.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-107.1). This association was no longer significant after controlling for HPV (OR = 6.4, 95% CI = 0.3-128.5). HHV-6 was detected in cervical samples from women with precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix, but not significantly more frequently than in normal women.
