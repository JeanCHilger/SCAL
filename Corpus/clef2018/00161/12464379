Human papillomavirus testing for triage of women referred because of abnormal smears. a decision analysis considering outcomes and costs. The objective of this article was to evaluate the utility of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing for triage of women referred for colposcopy because of abnormal smears. We considered women with persistent mild or moderate dyskaryosis and women with severe dyskaryosis who were referred for colposcopy. For both patient groups we evaluated three alternative management policies: (1) conventional management based on histological assessment (2) HR-HPV-triage with direct treatment without prior histologic assessment for HR-HPV-positive women and conventional management for HR-HPV-negative women
