Clinical utility of molecular detection of human papillomavirus in cervical samples by hybrid capture technology. High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the primary risk factor for developing cervical carcinoma. Hybrid capture II HPV Test (HCII) is a standardized test for molecular detection of HPV DNA in cervical swabs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical utility of the HCII when used in combination with conventional cytology in a group of 171 women who were followed-up with both, cytology and molecular testing for 3 years. At the end of the study, only women positive for high-risk HPV at baseline had retained or worsened cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In most women who were negative for high-risk HPV, CIN had resolved within 3 years. These results are in concordance with earlier studies reporting the highly negative predictive value of high-risk HPV testing. Both cytology and high-risk HPV testing provide significant clinical information on the current cervical status of a woman. They should be used in combination for primary screening of CIN, which will provide a more selective and cost-effective follow-up.
