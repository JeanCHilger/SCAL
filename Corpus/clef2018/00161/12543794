Association between human leukocyte antigen polymorphism and human papillomavirus 16-positive vulval intraepithelial neoplasia in British women. Polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been implicated in the risk for developing human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical neoplasia. By comparison with local cadaver controls typed for HLA class I (n = 946) and II (n = 144) antigens, HPV-16-positive high grade vulval intraepithelial neoplasia patients (n = 42) showed significantly different frequencies of HLA-A2 [odds ratio (OR), 2.1 confidence interval (CI), 1.4-3.9], HLA-B7 (OR, 2.6
