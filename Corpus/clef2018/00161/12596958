Colposcopy, cervical cytology and human papillomavirus detection as screening tools for cervical cancer. A cohort of 77 women referred for routine screening or investigation of Pap test abnormality underwent colposcopic examination. Pap-stained liquid-based preparations were diagnosed and categorized according to the Bethesda system. Residual material on the sampling device was used to detect high-risk oncogenic human papillomavirus DNA. Although the colposcopic failure rate was higher than that of cytology, no lesion was missed when both methods were used together. High-risk types were recorded in 24% of patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 45% with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 79% with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions--indicating that the efficacy of cytological screening can be improved by papillomavirus detection.
