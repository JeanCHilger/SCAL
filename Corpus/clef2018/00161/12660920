Human papillomavirus infection in men attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main etiologic agent of anogenital cancers, including cervical cancer, but little is known about the type-specific prevalence of HPV in men. Participants were men aged 18-70 years attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. Penile skin swabs were assessed for HPV DNA using polymerase chain reaction with reverse line-blot genotyping. Of 436 swabs collected, 90.1% yielded sufficient DNA for HPV analysis. Men with inadequate swab samples were significantly more likely to be white and circumcised than men with adequate swab samples. The prevalence of HPV was 28.2%. Oncogenic HPV types were found in 12.0% of participants, nononcogenic types were found in 14.8% of participants, multiple types were found in 6.1% of participants, and unknown types were found in 5.9% of participants. The most prevalent subtypes were nononcogenic 6, 53, and 84. HPV positivity was not associated with age. These results indicate that HPV infection among men at high risk is common but that characteristics of male HPV infection may differ from those of female infection.
