Clonality analysis of archival cervical smears. Correlation of monoclonality with grade and clinical behavior of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To establish a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based clonality assay for archival cervical smears and examine its value in the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and prediction of its clinical behavior.Dyskaryotic cells were microdissected from archival cervical smears of 33 cases and subjected to PCR-based clonality analysis of the androgen receptor gene. High-risk HPV subtypes were screened by PCR.Monoclonal patterns were found in 9/9 CIN 3 and 15/21 CIN 2, while polyclonal patterns were observed in the remaining 6 CIN 2 and 3/3 CIN 1. All patients with monoclonal CIN lesions, including 15 CIN 2, showed recurrence of the disease despite treatment. The original CIN 2 and recurrent CIN lesion in each of the 6 examined cases showed the same monoclonal pattern, suggesting a clonal link. In contrast, the patients with polyclonal CIN 1 or 2 became negative and remained disease free. High-risk HPV subtypes were found in all monoclonal CIN lesions, including 9 CIN 3 and 15 CIN 2, and in 4/6 polyclonal CIN 2 but not in CIN 1 lesions.Clonality analysis of cervical smears is potentially valuable in the identification of true neoplastic cells and prediction of clinical behavior of CIN 2 lesions.
