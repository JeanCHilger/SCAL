Immunocytochemical detection of HPV high-risk type L1 capsid proteins in LSIL and HSIL as compared with detection of HPV L1 DNA. To investigate the prevalence of HPV L1 capsid proteins in HPV-infected HSIL and LSIL.Cervical smears from 74 women with cytologically and histologically confirmed LSIL (n = 32) and HSIL (n = 42) were collected prospectively to detect HPV high-risk (hr) types 16, 18, 33, 35, 39, 45, 56 and 58 L1-DNA by standardized L1-consensus primer PCR (MY 09/11) and L1 capsid proteins by immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies T31 (HPV16) and T16 (HPV hr) in a standardized protocol.In HSIL and LSIL, L1 DNA was found for HPV hr in 93% and 59% and for HPV16 in 69% and 37% of the specimens, respectively. HPV L1 capsid proteins were detected in HSIL and LSIL for HPV hr in 33% and 44% and for HPV16 in 29% and 31% of the specimens, respectively. Expression of L1 capsid proteins was significantly reduced, by 59.6% for HPV hr L1 DNA-positive HSIL (P < .01) and by 40.4% for HPV 16 L1 DNA-positive HSIL (P < .01). In HPV 16 DNA-positive and HPV hr DNA-positive LSIL, no significant reduction of corresponding L1 capsid protein expression could be demonstrated.These data suggest a disturbed viral cellular interaction in HPV 16 and HPV hr-infected HSIL, with loss of viral L1 capsid antigen. In this context there is a possible role of T31 and T16 as prognostic markers to predict the prognosis of CIN.
