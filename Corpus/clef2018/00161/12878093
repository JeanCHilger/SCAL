Molecular detection of human papillomavirus in 594 uterine cervix samples from Moroccan women (147 biopsies and 447 swabs). Uterine cervix cancer is the second most frequent female cancer after breast cancer in Morocco and represents a public health problem. Cervical cancer is highly linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) especially types 16 and 18 which are the highly oncogenic genotypes. To identify the contribution of HPV testing in the prevention of cervical cancer in Morocco, 147 biopsies collected at the Institut National d'Oncologie and 447 swabs from pathology laboratories and gynaecologist offices in Rabat were HPV analysed. HPV testing were made without any presumption of the histopathological diagnosis. A total of 147 paraffin-embedded biopsies and 447 exfoliated cervical samples were included. Based on histopathology results of the 147 biopsies, most cervical lesions were invasive carcinomas and non specific inflammations (NSI). With the molecular assay, HPV was detected in 91/147 (62%) patients. The high risk types 16 and 18 were found in 45% of the cases (41/91) and HPV 18 in 19% of the cases (17/91). Double infection with HPV 16 and 18 was found in 3 cases. Among the 447 swabs tested, 28 were HPV positives. Cytology results showed that 46% were inflammations (13/28). Among them, 10 patients had a NSI and only 3 patients had a cytology diagnosis of HPV infection. Based on these data, HPV testing should be associated to cervical cytology screening according to two algorithms established in function of the age of the patient and viral natural history. Combination of cytology and HPV testing allow identification of patient with high risk for development of high grade cervical lesions and improve cervical cancer prevention.
