Screening for uterine cervical cancer in Belgium in 2003. Squamous cell cancer of the uterine cervix is associated with a high morbidity and mortality worldwide and in Belgium. Its development is related to the infection by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types. Cervical cancer is preceded by dysplasic stages (squamous intraepithelial lesions) which can be detected by a Pap smear. The goal of this paper is to review the screening of uterine cervical cancer in Belgium.
