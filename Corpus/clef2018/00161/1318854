Human papillomavirus detection from the female genital tract: combined vs. separate scrape methods. Because genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections tend to be multifocal, it was studied how effective one combined specimen is in detecting HPV-DNA from the lower female genital tract. The study population consisted of 50 patients referred to a colposcopy clinic for a suspected condylomatous and/or dysplastic lesion. From half of the patients, a separate scrape from the cervix, vagina and vulva was taken first followed by a combined scrape representing all the genital sites, and from the other half, vice versa. HPV-DNA (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) was identified using the AffiProbe hybridisation test. Thirty-six specimens collected from 17 patients were positive for HPV-DNA. A multifocal infection was demonstrated in at least 11/17 (65%) HPV-DNA positive patients. The combined scrape was the most informative specimen, revealing 75% of all HPV-DNA-positive patients. It was concluded that HPV-DNA can reliably be detected from the female genital tract in a simple way from one combined specimen.
