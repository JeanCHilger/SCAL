Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA infections of the uterine cervix. 411 women who had dysplasia, selected from an ambulatory group as well as 240 women from a random control group were examined, by using cervical smears, which were initially diagnosed as human papilloma viruses-DNA (HPV-DNA) of the type 6/11, or 16/18, or 31/33/35. This was achieved by the in-situ nucleic acid hybridisation technique. The results of the HPV-DNA typing were tabulated with the cytological diagnosis (Munich Papanicolaou (Pap.) group-classification). The control group corresponding to Pap.Gr. I, and was HPV-DNA positive in 6 (2.5%) of the 240 cases. The group of 180 patients with a Pap.Gr. II showed a HPV-DNA positive result for 75 cases (41.7%) 57 of 99 cases (57.6%) occurred in Pap.Gr.
