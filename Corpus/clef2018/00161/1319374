Removal of HPV infection of the portio vaginalis by laser therapy of scalpel conization. Between May 1988 and December 1990, 855 patients were submitted to HPV-hybridisation. HPV 16/18 (10.4%) was detected more frequently (p = 0.0024) than HPV 31/33/35 (6.1%) and was more often associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia--CIN--III degrees (p = 0.0014). 42 patients with CIN were examined after treatment with cold-knife conization. PAP-smear, colposcopy and HPV-hybridisation were performed. None of the patients showed signs of CIN after treatment. Only one patient showed an HPV persistence. In three of 7 patients treated with laser conization and four of 12 patients treated with laser vaporization, examination after treatment showed signs of CIN. In 6 cases, an HPV persistence was detected. With regard to results of other authors, cold-knife conization is the most effective treatment of HPV infection of the cervix uteri.
