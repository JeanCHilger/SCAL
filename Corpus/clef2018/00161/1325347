Risk of progression in low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. In order to evaluate the evolution of the low grade dysplasia using colpocytologic follow-up, 150 women, enrolled in this study, were submitted to yearly colpocytologic control for a period of four years. The rate of progression toward more severe forms was very low three cases (2.14%) in the first year, one case (0.7%) in the second and two cases (2.32%) in the fourth. Eighty-eight per cent of the patients had cytologic signs of Human Papilloma Virus infection detected in cytologic and histologic examination.
