Results of treatment of condyloma in the male and its effect on the couple in the presence of intraepithelial cervical neoplasia. Genital papillomavirus is an infection sexually transmitted, besides it is frequently associated with cancer of the uterine cervix. It is controversial if it is useful to treat the sexual partner. The present study analyzes in a comparative way patients with CIN with treated partner and untreated partner. From 1986 to 1991 251 women treated for CIN, were prospectively studied they had completed a one year follow up and during this time they presented, or not, treatment failure. Fifty six were examined and their sexual partners were treated for genital papillomavirus, and the control were 195 women, similar to the study group as to age, race, socio-economical level, CIN histological degree, distribution of lesions and therapeutical methods, in whom the male was not examined nor treated. Statistical methods were Umann-Whitney, homogeneity test, and the fractions difference test to compare the groups. It were obtained the persistence and recidive of the treated couple and untreated couple (41% vs 32.8% with P greater than 0.05) not significant, which shows that papillomavirus treatment of the male partner has no effect on CIN treatment failure in the woman. These statistical results should be considered with caution as it is known that the male is a virus reservoir that together with other cofactors may explain the greater risk for the woman to develop CIN.
