Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: part of a multifocal disease process. Invasive carcinomas of the anogenital epithelium share a common aetiological factor--human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16. Although genital intraepithelial neoplasia may be multifocal, there have been no studies of the prevalence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia in women with intraepithelial neoplasia of the genital tract. We tested the hypothesis that women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are at higher risk of disease in the anus than are control women of similar age with no history of anogenital neoplasia. 29 (19%) of 152 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III had histological evidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia. Of the 29 patients, 11 had grade III anal lesions 2 of those women had concomitant invasive anal squamous-cell carcinomas. Only 7% (8/115) women with high-grade lesions of the cervix alone had evidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia
