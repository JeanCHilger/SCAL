Prevention of cervical cancer in Africa: a daunting task? Africa has a high estimated incidence of cervical cancer, thus requiring the development of an effective prevention strategy. Cytology-based screening is beyond the capacity of many African countries, hence the need for alternatives. Visual inspection of the cervix after application of 3-5% acetic acid (VIA) is a promising screening test, with similar sensitivity to that of cytology but lower specificity. The same accounts for other VIA methods using magnification devices, visual inspection after the application of Lugol's iodine, or human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing, all proposed alternatives to cervical cancer prevention screening tests. Vaccination against HPV is the most promising strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer, but a wider variety of HPV types than currently being investigated must be considered for the development of the multivalent vaccine preparations required in Africa. Other considerations in developing an effective prevention programme include full public sector investment and achieving acceptability of a vaccine against a sexually transmitted infection targeted for adolescents. Unfortunately, however, if HPV vaccines are developed the initial impact of prophylactic vaccines will be delayed for many years. Alternative strategies should, therefore, be promoted in parallel. There are several approaches to cervical cancer prevention and their evaluation should be comprehensive and coordinated to achieve short and long-term public health benefits in different programme settings.
