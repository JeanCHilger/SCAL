Colposcopy: the value of HPV testing in clinical practice. The indications for colposcopy have changed recently because of the new Bethesda terminology, the introduction of HPV testing in clinical practice, and the latest consensus guidelines on management of patients with an abnormal cervical cytological test. Colposcopy remains the reference technique to assess patients with abnormal cytological test results, especially those with ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL, and AGC. In women with an ASC-US result, colposcopic examination of only those who test positive for high-risk HPV increases the specificity of the technique. When liquid-based cytology is used, HPV DNA testing is the preferred approach in these women. In primary screening using combined cytology and HPV DNA testing in women over the age of 30, colposcopy is indicated in patients with normal cytology and two HR HPV DNA positive tests performed at a nine month interval. For the follow up of untreated patients with ASC-US/LSIL and CIN I, colposcopy carried out at one year after a single HR HPV DNA positive test is as sensitive as colposcopy after two or three abnormal cytology tests. After excision or conization in patients with high-grade CIN, colposcopy after a single HR HPV DNA positive test is as sensitive as cytology testing and colposcopy at six months. Therapeutic decisions must not be based solely on the results of HPV DNA testing except in specific cases.
