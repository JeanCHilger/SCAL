Early detection of cervical cancer with visual inspection methods: a summary of completed and on-going studies in India. India is a high-risk country for cervical cancer which accounts a quarter (126,000 new cases, 71,000 deaths around 2,000) of the world burden. The age-standardized incidence rates range from 16-55 per 100,000 women in different regions with particularly high rates in rural areas. Control of cervical cancer by early detection and treatment is a priority of the National Cancer Control Programme of India. There are no organized cytology screening programmes in the country. The technical and financial constraints to organize cytology screening have encouraged the evaluation of visual inspection approaches as potential alternatives to cervical cytology in India. Four types of visual detection approaches for cervical neoplasia are investigated in India: a) naked eye inspection without acetic acid application, widely known as 'downstaging' b) naked eye inspection after application of 3-5% acetic acid (VIA)
