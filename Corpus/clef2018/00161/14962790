High prevalence of human papillomavirus type 58 in Mexican colposcopy patients. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer of the women worldwide. Infection with some genotypes of human papillomavirus is the most important risk factor associated to cervical cancer.To determine the prevalence and genotypes of papillomavirus in biopsies of women with squamous intraepithelial lesion and cervical cancer.Two hundred sequential patients of colposcopy clinic were studied. HPV diagnosis was done by polymerase chain reaction using MY09/MY11 primers, for genotyping line blot hybridization was used.A total of 186 women were beta globin positive 104 (55.9%) had histology diagnosis of low-grade squamous intraepitelial lesions (LSIL), 67 (36.0%) high-grade squamous intraepitelial lesions (HSIL) and 15 (8.1%) invasive cervical cancer (IC). The prevalence of HPV was 56.4% (104/185)The high prevalence of HPV 58 among Mexican women with HSIL and IC, has important implications in prophylaxis.
