Usefulness of combining universal oligonucleotides in detecting human papillomavirus in cervical cancer and premalignant lesions. To determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection at different stages of the natural history of cervical cancer. Also, to optimize its detection by means of different sets of general primers.A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted between January and December 1999. Samples were processed and analyzed at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog√≠a (National Cancerology Institute) in Mexico City. A comparative analysis was performed using Student's t for continuous values and the chi-squared test for proportions. A contingency analysis was made between biopsy and cervical exudates with the Kappa statistic. HPV detection was done by PCR with general primers which recognize different regions of the L1 gene (MY09/11 GP5/6In total, 154 samples were analyzed: 65 (42.2%) of them showed normal cytology 45 (29.2%) high and low grade lesionsThe frequency of high risk HPV is high even in women with reported normal cytology. HPV detection improves when different sets of general primers directed to the L1 region are used. HPV DNA screening in cervical scrapes may be a good alternative HPV diagnostic tool when the samples are appropriately taken.
