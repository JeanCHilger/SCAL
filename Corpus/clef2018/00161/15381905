p16(INK4A) expression is related to grade of cin and high-risk human papillomavirus but does not predict virus clearance after conization or disease outcome. The role of p16(INK4A) as a marker of HR-HPV and in the diagnosis of CIN has been well established, but its predictive value in the clearance of the virus after CIN treatment and its use as a prognostic marker of cervical cancer has not been studied. A series of 302 archival samples, including 150 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 152 CIN lesions, were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for p16(INK4A) and HPV testing using PCR with three primer sets (MY09/11, GP5/GP6, SPF). Follow-up data were available of 88 SCC patients, and 67 of the CIN lesions had been followed-up with serial PCR after conization. HR-HPV types were closely associated with CIN (OR 19.12 95%CI 2.31-157.81) and SCC (OR 27.25
