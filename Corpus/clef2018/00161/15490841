Investigation of human papillomavirus DNA in cervical specimens by hybrid capture assay. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of human papillomavirus DNA (HPV-DNA) in cervical specimens of those randomly selected women, age between 18-62 years and applied to Gynecology and Obstetric Clinics in a six months period. Two hundred and six women were enrolled during the study. HPV-DNA in the cervical specimens were investigated with Hybrid Capture System (Digene Hybrid Capture System, UK) and also the cytologic specimens were examined simultaneously. HPV-DNA positivity was 4.9% overall. HPV-DNA positivity was found to be higher among younger population (30-39 age group: 7.3%), women with lower education level (6.9 %) and with lower income level (11.8%). Additionally, HPV-DNA positivity rate was found higher among women who experienced their first sexual intercourse at lower ages (15-19 age group: 6.3%) and who use oral contraceptives (7.7%). HPV-DNA positivity was found to be 2.1% in women with normal cervical cytology and 42.9% in women with epithelial cell abnormalities, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). The presence of HPV together with high rates of epithelial cell abnormalities leading to cervical cancer, supported the association between HPV and malignancy. Thus, HPV-DNA testing should be included in the cervical cancer screening programmes.
