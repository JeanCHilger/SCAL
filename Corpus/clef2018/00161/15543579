Prevalence of human papillomavirus genotypes in women from three clinical settings. Prevalence of 27 human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes was assessed in 1,331 women in three clinical settings: Family planning clinic (low-risk HIV-, n = 202, 21.3% HPV+), colposcopy clinic (high-risk HIV-, n = 854, 34.3% HPV+), and HIV outpatient clinic (HIV+, n = 275, 48.7% HPV+). Compared to women from both family planning and colposcopy clinics, HIV+ women revealed significantly higher prevalence of infection with oncogenic, non-oncogenic, and multiple HPV types. HPV types 52 and 51 were most prevalent in the low-risk HIV- women, whereas in the high-risk HIV- women, HPV types 16, 52, 58, and 35 were most prevalent. Interestingly, in the HIV+ women, less characterized types 83, 53, and 54 were most prevalent. The distinct profiles of genotype prevalence persisted after stratification by Pap smear status. After adjustment for concurrent infections with other types, HPV type 51 in the low-risk HIV- women, and types 16, 35, 39, 45, 52, and 58 in the high-risk HIV- women were significantly associated with cytologic abnormalities (exact P < 0.05). In HIV+ women across CD4 cell count strata, HPV types 42, 16, and 82 revealed significant decreasing trends with increasing CD4 counts (exact P for trend < 0.05). These data suggest distinct genotypic prevalence profiles in women at diverse risk for cervical cancer. The association of several genotypes with cytologic abnormalities underscores the need for vaccines targeting a wide range of HPV types.
