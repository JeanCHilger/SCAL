HPV, cervical neoplasia and smoking: knowledge among colposcopy patients. To assess colposcopy patients' knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the role of smoking in cervical neoplasia and, if patients were current smokers, their willingness to quit smoking.Between January and June 2001, 250 women seen in a colposcopy clinic for the evaluation of an abnormal Pap smear or previously diagnosed cervical neoplasia participated in a survey designed to evaluate knowledge of HPV infection, smoking and neoplasia. Participants who smoked were questioned regarding their smoking behaviors and readiness to quit. In the analysis, the population was stratified by age (< 25 years versus > or = 25 years) to determine differences in knowledge, perception of risk and behaviors.The study population was in general young and racially/ethnically diverse. Fifty-seven percent (143 of 250) thought that HPV was a risk factor in cervical neoplasia, and 58% (146 of 250) associated smoking with neoplasia. Among smokers who discussed risk reduction with their providers, 75% (50 of 66) were advised to stop smoking. Of the 39% (98 of 250) who were current smokers, 63% (62 of 98) agreed that having an abnormal Pap smear would make them consider smoking cessation, and 58% (57 of 98) reported that they would use medical therapy (nicotine replacement or medication) to aid in that process. There were age-related differences in smoking behaviors and attitudes toward cessation (e.g., younger smokers were less likely to desire nicotine replacement).Given the high prevalence of smoking and a demonstrated desire by many of the colposcopy patients to stop smoking in the context of a cervical abnormality, further efforts at encouraging cessation are warranted.
