HLA-DQB1 and cervical cancer in Venezuelan women. Cervical cancer represents a major health problem in Venezuela as well as in other Latin American countries. High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is known as the major risk factor of cervical cancer. However, whether or not a HR-HPV-infected woman progresses to cervical cancer may depend on the immune system effectors induced by viral antigens presented by her specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles. The role of the HLA system in presenting peptides to antigen-specific T-cells may be critical for genetic susceptibility and genetic resistance to cervical carcinoma.We aimed to investigate the relationship between HLA-DQB1, HPV infection, and cervical cancer in Venezuelan women.Blood samples and cervical swabs were obtained from 36 patients and 79 healthy controls additional cervical biopsies were obtained from all the patients. HPV DNA was detected by PCR and HLA-DQB1 genotyping was performed using a PCR-SSP protocol. RESULTS.: A positive association with cervical cancer was observed for HLA-DQB1*0201-0202 and *0402 alleles, however after Bonferroni correction only HLA-DQB1*0402 remained statistically significant (P value = 0.004, RR = 5.067).This is the first report of HLA-DQB1 alleles associated with cervical carcinoma in Venezuelan women. Larger studies are needed to assess whether these HLA-DQB1*0201-0202 and *0402 alleles have a direct effect on disease susceptibility.
