ASCUS of metaplastic type. Cyto-histopathological correlations. We evaluated the cytopathological changes and the prognostic significance of atypical squamous metaplastic cells in cervical smears. 50 ASCUS cases were divided in two groups: 25 cases in different settings and 25 of metaplastic type. All cases were re-evaluated after 6 months and when necessary, verified by biopsy. The second cytological diagnosis was: group I--13 normal, 2 LSIL, 40 ASCUS group II--6 normal, 2 LSIL, 2 HSIL and 15 ASCUS. The HPV was positive in 5 cases in group I and in 9 cases in group II. In ASCUS persistent cases the biopsy revealed: in group I--3 CIN 1 and 1 CIN 2 cases
