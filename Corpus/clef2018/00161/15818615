Family history as a co-factor for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix: results from two studies conducted in Costa Rica and the United States. Previous work suggests that cervical cancer may aggregate in families. We evaluated the association between a family history of gynecological tumors and risk of squamous cell and adenocarcinomas of the cervix in 2 studies conducted in Costa Rica and the United States. The Costa Rican study consisted of 2,073 women (85 diagnosed with CIN3 or cancer, 55 diagnosed with CIN2 and 1,933 controls) selected from a population-based study of 10,049 women. The U.S. study consisted of 570 women (124 with in situ or invasive adenocarcinomas, 139 with in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix and 307 community-based controls) recruited as part of a multicentric case-control study in the eastern part of the United States. Information on family history of cervical and other cancers among first-degree relatives was ascertained via questionnaire. Information on other risk factors for cervical cancer was obtained via questionnaire. Human papillomavirus (HPV) exposure was assessed in both studies using broad spectrum HPV L1-based PCR testing of exfoliated cervicovaginal cells and in Costa Rica by additional testing of plasma collected from participants for antibodies against the L1 protein of HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 45 by ELISA. A family history of cervical cancer in a first-degree relative was associated with increased risk of squamous tumors in both studies (odds ration [OR] = 3.2 for CIN3/cancer vs. controls 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-9.4 in Costa Rica
