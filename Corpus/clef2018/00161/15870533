Detection of cervical human papillomavirus infection by in situ hybridization in fetuses from women with squamous intraepithelial lesions. To evaluate for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the cervix of fetuses from mothers with documented squamous intraepithelial lesions.Fetal cervical epithelium was obtained from the Human Fetal Tissue Repository as per Institutional Review Board protocol. Fetal cervical epithelium was dissected, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were tested by in situ hybridization using a wide-spectrum HPV DNA probe. Cases were specimens from mothers with low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and controls were specimens from women with no documented squamous intraepithelial lesions.A total of 14 controls and 10 cases were evaluated for HPV DNA. No reactivity was detected in the controls. Two cases showed focal intracellular reactivity with the HPV DNA probe.To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrate fetal cervical HPV infection due to intrauterine exposure. These findings have important implications in understanding the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia and its management.
