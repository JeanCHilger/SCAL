Human papillomavirus testing and screening. Cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease through the detection, treatment and follow-up of its precursors. Traditionally, this has been accomplished through screening women with cervical cytology, and referring women with abnormal cytology for colposcopy, histological sampling and treatment. In organized programmes that achieve wide coverage of the target population at frequent intervals, this approach has resulted in a considerable reduction in cervical cancer. Recently, however, the development of reliable and reproducible tests for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix (which is now accepted to be causally associated with the development of almost all cervical cancers) has led to the evaluation of HPV de-oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing as either an alternative or adjunctive test to cytology for the detection of cervical cancer and its precursors. There is now a large body of data supporting the clinical utility of HPV DNA testing for the prevention of cervical cancer, particularly in the settings of primary screening of women older than 30 years, in the triage of women with equivocal cytology and for the follow-up of women post-treatment.
