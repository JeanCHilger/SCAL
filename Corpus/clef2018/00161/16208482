A study of abnormal cervical cytology in pregnant women. During the 4-year routing study of smears in 2,919 pregnant women, 33 cases of abnormalities of the uterine cervix were detected (1.13%). The patients were followed with uterine cervical cytology and colposcopy, and in case of need, sometimes punch biopsies were performed. As a result of the cytologies, 33 cases with abnormalities were detected. There were 26 cases classified as class IIIa and 7 cases were class IIIb. All cases underwent colposcopy. For the 17 cases that showed lesions by colposcopy, punch biopsies were performed. The results of histologic examination were wide: 5 chronic cervicitis, 1 condyloma, 1 mild dysplasia, 3 moderate dysplasia, 3 severe dysplasia, 3 carcinoma in situ, and 1 microinvasive carcinoma. Only two cases were treated during pregnancy, condyloma underwent Laser vaporization and microinvasive carcinoma underwent Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) conization. Other cases were conservative treatment during pregnancy. Excluding one case for persistence smear class IIIa of histology condyloma, all the other cases with regression of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ with treatment after delivery. We conclude that lesions up to carcinoma in situ do not require intervention during pregnancy but microinvasive carcinoma is suspected, diagnostic LEEP conization is necessary, even during pregnancy.
