Identification of NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex 5 capable to transform murine fibroblasts and overexpressed in human cervical carcinoma cell lines. The human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 proteins play essential roles in HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis. However, cells transformed by E6 or E7 rarely grow into tumors in nude mice, indicating that the carcinogenesis involves additional molecular events. The highly efficient retroviral cDNA expression system derived from HeLa cells identified two cDNA species coding NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex 5 (NDUFA5) and zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9), exhibiting the potential to transform murine fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3. The real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expressions of the NDUFA5 mRNA, but not the ZNF9 mRNA level, were significantly up-regulated in all the tested cell lines derived from HPV-positive cervical cancer, HeLa, SW576, and CaSKi. The NDUFA5 expression may contribute to the multi-step carcinogenesis in human cervical cancer.
