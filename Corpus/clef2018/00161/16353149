Definition of an HPV18/45 cross-reactive human T-cell epitope after DNA immunisation of HLA-A2/KB transgenic mice. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are the most common types associated with cervical cancer worldwide, other related HPV types such as HPV 35, 45 and 58 have significant prevalence in geographically distinct populations. For development of global prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine strategies, it is important to study immune responses against these viruses and to define the degree of cross-reactivity between related HPV types. To investigate the potential for T cell cross-reactivity after vaccination, HLA-A2/Kb transgenic mice were immunised with DNA plasmid constructs containing HPV18 and 45 E6 and E7. Splenocytes from immunised mice were tested in direct ELIspot assays against overlapping pools of HPV 18 peptides. Immunisation with either HPV18 or HPV45 E6 DNA produced dominant T cell responses against an epitope (KCIDFYSRI) that was shared between HPV18 and HPV45. This peptide was shown to bind to HLA-A*0201 but not Db or Kb molecules on the cell surface. Furthermore this peptide was shown to be immunogenic in vitro to human T cells from 2 out of 3 HLA-A2+ healthy donors. Collectively, these results demonstrate that HPV 18 and 45 E6 DNA vaccines are immunogenic in mice and demonstrate that cross-reactive T cell responses against closely related HPV types can be induced in vivo. The use of the HLA-A2/Kb transgenic mice allowed definition of an HLA-A*0201 binding peptide epitope that would have been rejected on the basis of predicted major histocompatibility complex binding affinity.
