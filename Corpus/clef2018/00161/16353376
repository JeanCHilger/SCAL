HPV testing and cervical cancer screening: recommendations and practice patterns. In summary, guidelines for cervical cancer screening continue to evolve, as knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as the role of HPV expands. Oncogenic HPV typing has proven effective in cancer screening and follow-up in certain situations, and its uses will undoubtedly increase. Patients and providers may be reassured with negative HPV testing, but long term management of positive HPV testing (especially in conjunction with negative cytology) is unclear. At present, however, numerous worldwide, prospective studies involving HPV testing and cervical cancer screening will, we hope, provide some of the answers regarding optimal management of women who remain persistently HPV positive.
