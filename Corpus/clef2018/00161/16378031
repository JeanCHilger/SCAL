Distribution of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, 3 and cancer on the uterine cervix. To determine the distribution of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 on the uterine cervix.During two screening studies, 5,060 women underwent colposcopy with biopsy. If a cervical quadrant had no lesion, a random biopsy at the squamocolumnar junction was obtained.Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse was more common on the posterior (426/806 52.9%) than on the anterior (380/806Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse is slightly more common on the posterior cervix. Using colposcopically detected lesions as a surrogate for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse inflates the prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on the anterior cervix.
