Prevalence of histological findings of human papillomavirus (HPV) in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma biopsies: preliminary study. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is considered to be an etiologic agent of cervical cancer and, recently its relation to oral and oropharyngeal cancer has also been investigated. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents 90% of all malignant tumors that affect the oral cavity. The prevalence of HPV in patients with SCC ranges from 0 to 100%. The most known viral cytopathic effect is koilocytosis, considered to be a major characteristic of HPV infection.The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of some peculiar characteristics of HPV--koilocytosis--in oral and oropharyngeal SCC.Transversal cohort.Twenty slides with oral and/or oropharyngeal SCC were examined under microscopy.In 15 of them, koilocytosis was found, amounting to 75%. Although we know that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the method with the best sensitivity for HPV detection, we began this research looking for koilocytosis, which is highly suggestive of HPV infection.This study is a trial project and we will continue this research with PCR measures to confirm this high prevalence of HPV infection in oral and oropharyngeal SCC.
