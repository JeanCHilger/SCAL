Prevalence of mucosal types of human papillomavirus in skin lesions in north part of Iran. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) consist of more than 100 types and are known to be associated with numerous malignant tumors, including carcinomas of the mucosal and cutaneous epithelium. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most frequently occurring malignancy worldwide in the Caucasian population. Some studies have shown that NMSC biopsy specimens harbor cutaneous as well as mucosal human papillomavirus, suggesting that mucosal types may play a role in development and progression of the tumor in skin. To investigate the presence of mucosal HPV types in skin lesions, we performed a retrospective study in which 288 paraffin embedded biopsies from benign and malignant skin lesions (NMSC) were collected. Using nested PCR with MY09/11 and GP5+/6+ primers mucosal HPVs were detected in 25.7% of malignant specimens, but just in 0.7% of benign lesions. Direct sequencing revealed HPV18 as the most frequent type, which was found in 75% of HPV-positive specimens. HPV16 and HPV56 were also detected, 22.3 and 2.7%, respectively. These findings suggest that, high-risk mucosal HPV types recently identified as significant risk factors for cervical cancer, may also represent a risk factor for non-melanoma skin cancer.
