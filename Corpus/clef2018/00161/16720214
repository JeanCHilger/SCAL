HLA-DRB1 alleles and cervical squamous cell carcinoma: experimental study and meta-analysis. Polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been implicated in the risk for cervical cancer. Association of certain class II HLA alleles with cervical cancer has been documented in various ethnic populations. The implications of such an association, however, are controversial. We analyzed 126 Chinese women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and 289 healthy controls to test associations of certain HLA-DRB1 alleles. We then performed meta-analyses combining our own experimental data and data from nine other published studies. We found no significant differences in HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in both CSCC and HPV-16-positive CSCC patients and control subjects. Meta-analysis provided evidence that four allele families (HLA-DRB1*04, *07, *11, and *15) and seven alleles (HLA-DRB1*0403, *0405, *0407, *0701, *1501, *1502, and *1503) were positively associated and two allele families (HLA-DRB1*09 and *13) and four alleles (HLA-DRB1*0901, *1301, *1302, and *1602) were negatively associated with CSCC in all studies or in Caucasian subgroups. In conclusion, our meta-analysis confirms the apparent association between certain HLA-DRB1 allele families and alleles and CSCC, suggesting that oncogenesis in this disease may be related to defects in immunoregulation. Larger studies may be needed, particularly in various ethnic groups, to further substantiate these associations.
