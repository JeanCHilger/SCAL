Detection of carcinogenic human papillomavirus in specimens collected with a novel self-sampling device. We compared the detection of carcinogenic human papillomavirus DNA in cervicovaginal specimens self-collected using a novel device to the detection in physician-collected cervical specimens from 137 women. The kappa value was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.78), with an 83% overall test agreement and a 68% positive test agreement.
