High-risk HPV DNA detection rate in patients with atypical squamous cells and its relationship to the atypical squamous cell: squamous intraepithelial lesion ratio. To determine if there is any relationship between the atypical squamous cell (ASC):squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) ratio and high-risk HPV DNA detection rate.Data on the frequency of various cytologic diagnoses for each pathologist were retrieved from 2002 to 2003. ASC:SIL ratio for each pathologist was calculated. In addition, data related to high-risk HPV detection rate was obtained during the study period. HPV DNA testing was performed using HC II (Digene, Gaithersburg, Maryland U.S.A). Cases with insufficient quantity were excluded.Five pathologists, with experience ranging from 2 to 15 years, reviewed Pap tests during the study period. For the entire laboratory, the ASC:SIL ratio was 2.0, and the high-risk HPV DNA detection rate in ASC specimens was 31%. For individual pathologists, ASC:SIL ratio ranged from 1.2 to 4.0 and high-risk HPV DNA detection rate from 31% to 38%. No significant correlation was noted between the ASC:SIL ratio and high-risk HP DNA detection rate.Our ASC:SIL ratios (except for 1 pathologist) and high-risk HPV DNA detection rates were within an acceptable range. We did not observe any association between ASC:SIL ratio and high-risk HPV detection rate.
