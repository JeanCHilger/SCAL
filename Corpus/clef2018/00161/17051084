Participants at the ASCCP 2000 Biennial Meeting adhere to published guidelines in their management of atypical squamous cells and atypical glandular cells on pap test. To determine practice patterns of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) 2000 Biennial Meeting participants for management of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS).A three-page survey was developed to query participants about their standard practices for managing atypical squamous cells and atypical glandular cells on Pap tests use of human papillomavirus testingThere were 217 completed surveys (47.0% response rate). Responses of 194 qualified surveys are presented here. For women with first-time ASCUS (unqualified) and no previous history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 16.4% of respondents would perform colposcopy. For ASCUS (favor squamous intraepithelial lesion [SIL]), a significantly higher percent, 74.9%, would proceed immediately to colposcopy (p < .001). For ASCUS (unqualified or favor SIL) in a woman with a previous history of CIN, 82.7% and 95.5% would perform colposcopy, respectively (p < .001). For a patient with AGUS, 97.5% would perform colposcopy (with or without endocervical curettage or endometrial biopsy). Human papillomavirus testing was seldom used in the management of ASCUS (10.4%) and AGUS (7.8%).Participants at the 2000 ASCCP Biennial Meeting made clear distinctions between ASCUS and AGUS in managing women with abnormalities on Pap, and management was consistent with guidelines published by the ASCCP, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Cancer Institute.
