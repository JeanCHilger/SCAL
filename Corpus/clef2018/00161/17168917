Test characteristics of various screening modalities for cervical cancer: a feasibility study to develop an alternative strategy for resource-limited settings. To determine test characteristics - sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values - of different screening modalities to detect cervical precancerous and cancerous lesions in order to devise an effective alternative strategy for cervical cancer screening in resource-poor settings.A total of 472 women presenting with nonspecific gynecologic symptoms were screened by cytology, visual inspection with acetic acid application (VIA), VIA with magnification (VIAM) and human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing. Colposcopic examination was performed in all and on-site biopsy was taken if any grade I and above lesion was detected on colposcopy (230). On histopathological examination, 105 showed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II and above lesions. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for each test were calculated taking colposcopy and or directed biopsy as the gold standard. Comparisons were made with cytology in order to assess the feasibility of alternative strategies in resource-poor settings.VIA was less sensitive (86.7% versus 91.4%) but more specific (90.7% versus 86.6%) than cytology at low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) threshold but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.01). HPV testing improved the sensitivity over cytology (97.1% versus 91.4%) but there was a nonsignificant loss of specificity (84.2% versus 86.6%). Results of VIAM were more or less similar to VIA.VIA can be used as a mass screening tool for cervical cancer in resource-poor settings.
