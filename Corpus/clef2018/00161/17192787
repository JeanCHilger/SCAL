Distribution and viral load of eight oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV 16 integration status in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma. Current human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing using pooled probes, although sensitive, lacks specificity in predicting the risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) progression. To evaluate selected HPV genotyping, viral load, and viral integration status as potential predictive markers for CIN progression, we performed HPV genotyping in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical tissue with cervical carcinoma (29 cases) and CINs (CIN 1, 27 cases CIN 2, 28 cases
