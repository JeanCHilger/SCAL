The usefulness of p16INK4a in cytological screening of cervical carcinoma. To evaluate the value of p16INK4a immuncytochemical examination in cytological screening of cervical carcinoma and precancerous lesions.p16JNK4a immuncytochemical detection was performed on 220 specimens remaining from liquid-based cytology, followed up by biopsy histology , and compared with the results of high-risk human papillomavirus ( HR - HPV ) DNA tests . Results In patients with cytological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma( SCC) , high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) , low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) , atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) , and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) , the positive rates of p16INK4a were 100.0% (7/7), 92. 2% (107/116) , 24. 3% (17/70) , 100. 0% (14/14) and 36.4% (4/ 11) , respectively. In 111 of the 150 p6INK4a positive cases, we found 97 (87.4% ) cases which had biopsy diagnosises of > or =CIN2, but none in 18 of 70 p16INK4a negative cases was. The difference in the positive rates for p16INK4a between cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and > or =CIN2 lesions had statistical significance (P < 0. 01) , whereas for HR-HPV DNA test it was not.p16LNK4a is over-expressed in a HSIL, and it may be useful in cytological screening of high risk patients.
