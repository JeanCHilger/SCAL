Should LSIL with ASC-H (LSIL-H) in cervical smears be an independent category? A study on SurePath specimens with review of literature. Cervical smears exhibiting unequivocal features of 'low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion' (LSIL) are occasionally also admixed with some cells suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, 'high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion' (HSIL). Only a few studies, mostly reported as abstracts, have evaluated this concurrence. In this study, we evaluate the current evidence that favors a distinct category for "LSIL, cannot exclude HSIL" (LSIL-H), and suggest a management algorithm based on combinations of current ASCCP guidelines for related interpretations.We studied SurePath preparations of cervical specimens from various institutions during one year period. Cytohisto correlation was performed in cases with cervical biopsies submitted to our institution. The status of HPV DNA testing was also noted in some LSIL-H cases with biopsy results.Out of 77,979 cases 1,970 interpreted as LSIL (1,523), LSIL-H (146), 'atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL' (ASC-H) (109), and HSIL (192) were selected. Concurrent biopsy results were available in 40% (Total 792 cases: 557 LSIL, 88 LSIL-H, 38 ASCH, and 109 HSIL). Biopsy results were grouped into A. negative for dysplasia (ND), B. low grade (HPV, CIN1, CIN1 with HPV), and C. high grade (CIN 2 and above). The positive predictive values for various biopsy results in relation to initial cytopathologic interpretation were: a. LSIL: (557 cases): ND 32% (179), low grade 58% (323), high grade 10% (55) b. LSIL-H: (88 cases): ND 24% (21), low grade 43% (38), high grade 33% (29)LSIL-H overlapped with LSIL and ASC-H, but was distinct from HSIL. A management algorithm comparable to ASC-H and HSIL appears to be appropriate in LSIL-H cases.
