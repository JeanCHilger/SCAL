Immune factors involved in the cervical immune response in the HIV/HPV co-infection. Immune factors influencing the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cancer remain poorly defined. This study investigates the expression of RANTES, MIP1alpha, COX1, COX2, STAT3, TGFbetaRI, IL10R, TNFalphaRII and TLR4 in the cervical immune response in HIV/HPV (human papillomavirus) co-infected women.Cervical biopsies of 36 patients were assayed by immunohistochemistry, and the Ventana Benchmark System was used for HIV-nef detection.Cervices from HIV-positive patients exhibited nef in cells mainly around blood vessels, and showed a decreased expression of all the immune factors tested except IL10R and STAT3, while RANTES (5.54 cells/mm(2)) was highly expressed in comparison with controls (1.41 cells/mm(2), p = 0.028). COX1 was decreased in the HIV/HPV- (0.32 cells/mm(2), p = 0.017) and HPV-infected patients (0.21 cells/mm(2), p = 0.015) compared with controls (3.28 cells/mm(2)).It is suggested that RANTES in HIV/HPV co-infection may influence the development of CIN leading to progression to cervical cancer.
