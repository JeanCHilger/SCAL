Human papillomavirus DNA integration and messenger RNA transcription in cervical low- and high-risk squamous intraepithelial lesions in Austrian women. The human papillomavirus (HPV) plays an important role in the progression of cervical carcinoma. High-risk (HR) HPV types have been mainly identified in cytologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and histologic invasive carcinoma of the cervix. We examined cervical swabs of patients with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, diagnosed as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) including atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance or HSILs. Low-risk (LR) HPV and HR-HPV types were identified by the Digene Hybrid Capture II test. Two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis was used to specify the physical state of HPV DNA sequences. Expression of E6/E7 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Histopathologic results were correlated to the patients' physical status and HPV DNA mRNA transcripts. Pap smears with HPV infections of LR and HR types were correlated to the degree of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). Comparing the physical states of HPV DNA sequences with the expression of HPV E6/E7 mRNA transcripts, all types were identified only as extrachromosomal in benign cervical smears, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I and II. HPV16 showed all physical states in CIN III/carcinoma in situ (CIS), whereas HPV18 only existed in mixed and integrated forms. HPV31/33/52b/58 appeared in all stages of lesions most commonly in extrachromosomal form in integrated form, they were present only in CIN III/CIS. Although integration of some HR-HPV types is not always necessary for progression of SILs, the above-mentioned method is useful to analyze the physical state of HPV DNA sequences and predict the progression of SILs.
