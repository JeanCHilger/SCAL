Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in Jordan: A ten year retrospective cytoepidemiologic study. Occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was studied in 10,659 females attending obstetric and gynecology clinics in Jordan. The frequency rate of intraepithelial neoplasia was 1.1% in 7743 Jordanian females and 2916 non-Jordanian residents of younger age during the period from 1982 to 1991 inclusive. The incidence rate in 2649 Jordanian females, selected because they attended only for routine checkup, was 49 per 100,000. There were 121 CIN cases which were graded into Grade I (21%), II (48%) and III (31%) respectively. Histological grading correlated with cytology in 70% of the cases while in the remaining 30%, cytologic underrating by one grade was noted evidence against any overdiagnosis of CIN in our series. Study of the human papillomavirus (HPV) was outside the scope of this effort. However, circumcision in male partners and marital status were associated with a lower frequency of CIN. Age at marriage and average duration, parity, breast feeding, the contraceptive pill, socioeconomic status and menstrual disorders showed no relationship to the frequency of CIN in our patients. Any differences in the latter between Jordanian and non-Jordanian females are believed due to cultural factors. Conization in 27 cases proved effective at 30 months' follow-up. Occurrence of CIN in Jordanian females appears substantial although much lower than that seen in high incidence zones, while its incidence in the general female population remains to be determined. This study shows for the first time the value of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears in Jordanian females over 20 years of age with special emphasis on those over 35 years of age attending obstetric and gynecology clinics.
