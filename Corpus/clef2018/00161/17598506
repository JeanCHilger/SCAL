HPV technologies advancing public health: discussion of recent evidence. Effective primary and secondary cancer prevention programmes are key to improve public health. Cervical cancer is preventable if high quality screening programmes, diagnosis and treatment are offered to female populations at high coverage. Nevertheless, it continues to be a public health problem, and screening programmes need improvements. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been firmely established as the necessary cause of virtually all cervical cancer cases. To date we count two clinically validated and approved HPV technologies, available to prevent cervical cancer, and other diseases caused by these carcinogenic viruses: Prophylactic vaccines for primary prevention, and HPV DNA tests for secondary prevention, to detect life threatening infections by carcinogenic HPV types, allowing timely diagnosis and clinical management of precancerous lesions. The new technologies will help improve the health of the public if made widely accessible. Similar to vaccination programmes, systematic and well organized cervical screening programmes, with high quality validated HPV tests, can save more lives than ever and improve women's health, in an effective manner.
