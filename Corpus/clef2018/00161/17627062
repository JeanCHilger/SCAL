HPV detection methods. Given the causal relation between a persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection and the development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, hrHPV testing has been advocated in addition to cytology for the detection of clinically relevant cervical lesions. HrHPV testing is thought to improve cervical screening algorithms, the management of women with cytologically equivocal smears, and the management of women treated for high grade CIN. In this chapter we discuss different methods for HPV detection and genotyping and their respective applications.
