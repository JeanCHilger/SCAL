Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the cervix associated with endocervical adenocarcinoma: a case report. Small-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix is an uncommon member of the neuroendocrine group of cervical carcinomas that is frequently intermixed with a non-SCC component in the form of an adenocarcinoma (ADC) or squamous carcinoma.Colposcopy revealed a cervical mass in a 41-year-old woman and a Pap smear the presence of some tumor cells from SCC, which was confirmed by subsequent biopsy. The patient received 3 cycles of chemotherapy and then underwent major surgery. The cervical samples showed areas of endocervical ADC adjacent to and intermixed with the SCC. Reviewing the Pap smear, a previously missed malignancy was recognized. On subsequent molecular investigation to assess clonality by microsatellite analysis, the presence of HR-HPV DNA18 on real-time polymerase chain reaction, p16(INK4a) fluorescence in situ hybridization status and the corresponding immunohistochemical expression supported the hypothesis that the two components of the tumor shared the same cell origin.SCC of the cervix is a rare but distinct HR-HPV-18-related cervical carcinoma often intermixed with a clonally related non-small cell component consisting of an ADC or squamous carcinoma. The presence of SCC tumor cells in a cervical smear should prompt a search for malignant glandular or squamous tumor cells.
