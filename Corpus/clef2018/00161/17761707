Frequency and prognostic significance of HPV DNA in sentinel lymph nodes of patients with cervical cancer. It has been suggested that histologically undetectable or 'occult' metastases in the lymphatic system could explain some recurrences. HPV DNA screening by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been proposed as a method to detect occult metastases. This study was designed to determine the frequency of HPV DNA detection by PCR in sentinel lymph node (SN), and its relation to the clinical characteristics and outcome of women with cervical cancer.The primary cervical tumor and SN were tested for HPV DNA by means of PCR in 59 patients.Fifteen (25.4%) of the 59 women undergoing the SN procedure had an involved SN. HPV DNA was more frequent in positive SN than in negative SN (P < 0.0001). Seven patients had a recurrence, after a mean delay of 17 months (range: 10-26). One of seven patients with a recurrence had an involved SN. HPV DNA was detected in an SN of one of seven patients with recurrence and nine (19.5%) of 46 patients without recurrence (not significant).In women with cervical cancer, HPV DNA screening of sentinel nodes might help to identify patients at risk of lymph node metastases and recurrence.
