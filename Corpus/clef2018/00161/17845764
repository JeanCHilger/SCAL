Retrospective analysis of 15,393 cases of liquid-based cervical cytology, with histologic correlation. To study the rate of concordance between positive cervical cytologic interpretation based on liquid-based preparations and subsequent histologic diagnosis.Liquid-based cervical cytology (SurePath) was carried out in 15,393 patients. Cases with the cytologic diagnosis of epithelial cell abnormality were further investigated by human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing (Hybrid Capture II) for the high-risk HPV DNA, colposcopic examination and multiple cervical biopsies. The 2001 version of The Bethesda System for reporting gynecologic cytology was applied. Positive cytologic diagnosis included atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or above. Histologic correlation was available in some of the patients. The rate of concordance between positive cytologic interpretation and subsequent histologic diagnosis was calculated.Amongst the 15,393 liquid-based cytology cases studied, the cytologic diagnosis of 7 cases squamous cell carcinoma were all concordance with histologic diagnosis, while the rates for high-grade and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were 93.6% (103/110) and 82.0% (443/540), respectively. A positive correlation was also demonstrated between detection of high-risk HPV DNA, positive cytologic interpretation and positive histologic diagnosis.Liquid-based cytologic preparation, when coupled with standardized reporting using the Bethesda System 2001, can achieve a high diagnostic accuracy of cervical epithelial abnormalities.
