The expression and significance of ERK1, ERK2 gene in tongue squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between ERK1, ERK2 gene expression and tumor behavior such as invasion, metastasis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC).The expressions of ERK1, ERK2 at gene level were examined in 45 cases of TSCC by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). Student's t test was used for data analysis using SPSS 12.0 software package.No correlation between the expression intensity of ERK gene and tumor pathological degree of TSCC.A significant relationship was observed between the expression intensity of ERK gene and T stage of TSCC. A significant relationship was observed between the expression intensity of ERK gene and lymphnode metastasis of TSCC.Activation of ERK gene may play a strong role in cervical lymph node metastasis of TSCC. Intensive expression of ERK may be an important presage marker in TSCC patient. Supported by Key Science and Technology Research Project of Liaoning Province (Grant No.2005225013-2).
