Using the rate of positive high-risk HPV test results for ASC-US together with the ASC-US/SIL ratio in evaluating the performance of cytopathologists. We reviewed our experience with 2 indicators of cytopathologist performance: the relative frequency of the interpretations atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) and the frequency of positive test results for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) DNA associated with a cytologic interpretation of ASC-US. Data derived for 9 cytopathologists were reviewed. ASC-US/SIL ranged from 0.99 to 4.02 (mean, 1.77) in 2005 and from 0.82 to 3.68 (mean, 1.81) in 2006. The HR-HPV+ rate for ASC-US ranged from 31.5% to 54.6% for individual cytopathologists (mean, 46.1%) in 2005 and from 29.6% to 61.8% (mean, 45.8%) in 2006. Combined data from both years showed only a slight negative correlation for these 2 variables. Both indicators together provide useful feedback to cytopathologists. We provide a working schema for interpreting perturbations in these indicators to assist in improving the quality of gynecologic cytology interpretations.
