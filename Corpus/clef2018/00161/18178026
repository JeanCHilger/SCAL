Evaluation of accuracy of three assays for human papillomavirus detection and typing: Hybrid Capture 2, HPV Consensus kit and Amplicor HPV. Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus has proved its usefulness in complement of abnormal cervical scrape result. The Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2, Digene) test has proven its efficiency. We have compared this test with HPV Consensus kit (HPVC, Arg√®ne) and Amplicor HPV test (AHPV, RocheDiagnostics) on a panel of 88 samples with low HC2 ratios or discordant results between HC2 and cervical scrape.Cervical samples were tested in parallel by the three methods using a nested amplification of L1 region as reference.Eighty-six samples were suitable for analysis. Results of HC2 and AHPV tests were closely related. The use of a "generic" probe in the HPVC test was responsible for undetermined results, which were not clinically relevant.Despite the low viral load of the samples chosen, the hybridization (HC2) and PCR (AHPV or HPVC) methods gave comparable results, with false positive and false negative results for all tests, but a 75% concordance and a high sensibility to detect HPV infection. However, a complementary study on a larger population with ASCUS diagnosis and biopsy under colposcopy would be necessary to valid these assays for a clinical indication.
