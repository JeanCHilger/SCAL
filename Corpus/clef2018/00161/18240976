Human papillomavirus-related content in state and tribal comprehensive cancer control plans. Oncogenic types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) are firmly established as etiological agents for most premalignant and malignant epithelial lesions of the cervical mucosa. Genital infection with HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the United States. Although most women infected with the virus become HPV negative within 2 years, women with persistent high-risk HPV infections are at greatest risk for developing cervical cancer. Since the development of the Papanicolau (Pap) test more than 60 years ago to screen for cervical cancer, technological advances have occurred in cervical cytology screening and HPV vaccine research. For example, in 2001, high-risk HPV DNA testing was recommended for the management of women whose Pap smears (collected by a liquid-based method) reveal atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration licensed a quadrivalent HPV vaccine for females aged 9-26 years to prevent cervical cancer, precancerous lesions, and genital warts associated with HPV types in the vaccine. New and emerging technologies in cancer diagnosis, management, and prevention are often addressed in comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans developed by states, tribes, and territories. CCC is a collaborative process through which a community and its partners pool resources to reduce the burden of cancer. To assess whether CCC plans include HPV-related content, particularly regarding cervical cancer screening and prevention, we reviewed the most current plans available between October 2006 and January 2007 on an interactive Internet site for CCC programs (n = 53). This paper describes the contexts in which HPV-related content occurs in the plans.
