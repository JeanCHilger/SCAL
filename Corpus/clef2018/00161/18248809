Screening with a primary human papillomavirus test does not increase detection of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia 3. To determine cross-sectional validity of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in comparison to cytological screening.During 2003-2004, 61,149 women were individually randomised to screening with a test for oncogenic HPV DNA or to conventional cytological screening within the Finnish cervical screening programme.For HPV screening, cross-sectional relative sensitivity for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer was 1.58 (95 % confidence interval 1.19-2.09) in comparison to cytology. At the level of CIN 3 or cancer no increase in relative sensitivity was observed. Cross-sectional specificity estimates for the screening arms were comparable, but the specificity of screening with sole HPV DNA test was clearly inferior.Primary HPV screening with cytology triage finds more CIN lesions compared to conventional screening but mild lesions are overrepresented. This is likely to result in overdiagnosis since most mild lesions are regressive.
