Communicating colposcopy results: what do patients and providers discuss? We describe the content of providers' postcolposcopy consultations and women's perceptions of consultations and their conditions.Consultations (n = 47) were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed. Women were interviewed immediately after consultations.Providers often named or described the diagnosis (n = 46), suggested a return appointment date (n = 41), and asked if women understood the diagnosis or had any questions (n = 40). Risk factors and causes of cervical cancer, including human papillomavirus infection, smoking, and sexual activity, were rarely discussed (n = 5). The majority (n = 40) of women were asked if they understood the provider's explanation or had any questions. Women rated quality of their provider's explanation as high and the severity of and worry about their condition as moderate.Postcolposcopy consultations focused on follow-up screening and treatment. Risk factors and causes of cervical cancer were discussed infrequently.
