What are patient preferences for follow-up after low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia? To determine preference for follow-up after low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) among women presenting to a colposcopy clinic and ascertain basic knowledge about the human papillomavirus (HPV).We surveyed 220 women presenting for care to the colposcopy clinic at Magee Women's Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA, between January and May 2007. The results of completed surveys were analyzed using univariate and bivariate analysis.Two hundred two surveys were complete and available for analysis. Forty percent of women knew that HPV is associated with warts, abnormal Papanicolaon (Pap) smears, and cervical cancer. Sixty-seven percent of women stated they would choose Pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months for follow-up after a diagnosis of CIN 1, compared with 19% of women who chose HPV testing at 12 months for the same diagnosis (p < .001). Sixty-four percent of women stated that they would be more likely to follow up for a Pap smear at 6 and 12 months after a diagnosis of CIN 1, compared with 27% who stated that they would be more likely to follow up for an HPV test at 12 months (p < .001).Women's preferences for serial Pap testing at 6 and 12 months rather than HPV test at 12 months may reflect the perception that they may be more likely to comply with and remember about follow-up testing if done in shorter visit intervals. The option of either treatment plan should be discussed with women and preferences assessed.
