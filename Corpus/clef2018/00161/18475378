Detection of human papillomavirus DNA by AffiProbe HPV-DNA test kit in cervical scrapes or biopsies-histopathologic correlates. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of punch biopsies and cervical scrapes in the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA from the cervix and compare the results with the histopathologic diagnosis.The specimens were collected simultaneously, and HPV DNA was detected using a liquid hybridization test.Biopsies and scrapes were equally efficient, but each detected only two-thirds of all HPV-DNA-positive patients. Thus, the positivity rate increased when both tests were used. Overall, 13% of patients with normal histopathology, 38% of patients with benign atypia, and 66% of patients with squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) were HPV-DNA positive. HPV-DNA 16 was found in 54% of HPV-DNA-positive patients with SIL, in 20% of HPV-DNA-positive patients with atypia, and in none of patients with normal histopathology.The liquid hybridization test used in this study detects HPV DNA equally efficiently from both biopsies and scrapes. The test can be performed in 1 working day. However, the sensitivity of the test is low, and it only detects a limited number of HPV types.
