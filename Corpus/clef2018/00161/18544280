The relationship between cervical human papillomavirus infection and apoptosis. Cervical carcinoma is the second most common cancer among women worldwide. Viral infections, especially human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, are important factors in its etiology. Changes in apoptotic regulation are considered to have an important role in the carcinogenesis development. In this study, the relationship between apoptosis and HPV infection was investigated.HPV DNA and HPV DNA type 16 positivity were detected in 110 cervical smear samples with Real Time PCR and sequencing was performed for HPV DNA type 18. The presence of apoptosis was investigated using TUNEL and Annexin V staining methods and analyzed by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry.HPV DNA type 16 was detected in 9 samples (8.1%), HPV DNA type 18 positive in 6 samples (5.4%) and HPV types other than HPV type 16 and HPV type 18 in 9 samples (8.1%). A decrease apoptosis was found in HPV DNA positive samples compared with controls (P < 0.05).The decrease of apoptosis during HPV infection might cause cellular immortality and then malignant transformation.
