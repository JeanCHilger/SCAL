Expression of metastasis suppressor gene KAI1 in cervical carcinoma and infections of HPV16 E6, E7 and HPV18 E6/E7. To investigate the expression of metastasis suppressor gene KAI1 in cervical carcinoma and the impact of human papillomavirus 16 E6, E7, 18 E6/E7 infection on the expression of KAI1.The expressions of KAI1 protein in the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 20 normal cervical epthelium, 15 cervical in situ carcinoma and 70 primary invasive cervical carcinoma were detected by immunohistochemistry SP. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were also undertaken to detect the HPV16 E6, E7 and HPV18 E6/E7 DNA.The expression of KAI1 protein was down-regulated in the invasive carcinoma and in situ carcinoma compared with the controls (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the expression of KAI1 protein between invasive carcinoma and in situ carcinoma. The infections of HPV16 E6, E7 and HPV18 E6/E7 were found in 67.1%, 54.3% and 12.9% of the invasive carcinoma, respectively. However, there was no correlation between the expression of KAI1 and the infections of HPV16 E6, E7 and HPV18 E6/E7.The expression of KAI1 protein is down-regulated in cervical carcinoma, which is not associated with the infection of HPV16 E6, E7 and 18 E6/E7.
