Human papillomavirus-type distribution in women with and without cervical neoplasia in north India. Our objective was to determine the human papillomavirus (HPV)-type prevalence in cervical samples in women with and without cervical neoplasia in an opportunistic hospital-based cancer-screening program. A cross-sectional study of 524 women presenting from January 2003 through June 2005 with symptoms of persistent vaginal discharge, intermenstrual bleeding, and postcoital bleeding or detected to have an unhealthy cervix underwent HPV genotyping by consensus polymerase chain reaction and reverse line-blot hybridization assay, conventional Pap smear, and colposcopy, with directed biopsy from all lesions detected. The prevalence rates of HPV infection among women with normal, low-grade cervical neoplasia (CIN 1) and high-grade CIN (>CIN2) were found to be 7.6%, 42.3%, and 87.5%, respectively. Seventeen high-risk and 6 low-risk HPV types were identified by the reverse line-blot assay. Multiple infections were seen in 20% of women. In normal women, the 6 commonest types were HPV-16, HPV-89, HPV-39, HPV-52, HPV-62, and HPV-18, whereas in high-grade disease, these were all high-risk types HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-33, HPV-39, HPV-35, and HPV-56. HPV-16 was the commonest type in all groups, seen in 49.4% cases overall and in 74.3% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. It was followed by HPV-18 (7.4%) and HPV-33 and HPV-39 (4.9% each). HPV-89 was the commonest low-risk type (9.9%). HPV-16/18 were associated with 34.3% of normal, 45.4% of low-grade and 65.7% of high-grade lesions. A wide spectrum of HPV types is seen in north Indian women, with the majority being HPV-16 in all grades of histology. A vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18 could prevent two thirds of cases of high-grade cervical neoplasia.
