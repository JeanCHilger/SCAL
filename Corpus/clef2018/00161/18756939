Role of p16INK4a as a biomarker in liquid-based cervical cytology screening. In cervical lesions, the overexpression of p16INK4a has been reported to be closely associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study is designed to evaluate the role of p16INK4a as a biomarker in liquid-based cervical cytology screening.Seventy-four specimens from the patients in our hospital were collected for this study. After cytological examination with liquid-based cervical smears, high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) DNA was then detected by Hybrid Capture II assay, and the rest cells were immunostained for p16INK4a.Of the 74 specimens, 10 were diagnosed as negative, 15 as atypical squmous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), 28 as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 5 as atypical squmous cells which could not be excluded as HSIL (ASC-H), 11 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and 5 as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The positive specimens of p16INK4a were 2, 5, 8, 3, 9, 5, respectively, in the above subgroups meanwhile, the positive specimens of HR-HPV were 1, 4, 9, 3, 7, 5, respectively, in the above groups. The positive rate of both p16INK4a and HR-HPV in HSIL, ASC-H and SCC were obviously higher than that in LSIL, ASC-US and negative cases.Positive rate of p16INK4a and HR-HPV is highly correlated with the grade of the cervical lesion. p16INK4a immunocytochemical staining may be used as a biomarker to increase the sensitivity of cervical cytology screening and the specificity of HPV test.
