Original cervical cytology and follow-up biopsy results in positive high risk human papillomavirus DNA tests with high-level resuls. To ascertain Pap test and biopsy results of specimens with high level of human papillomavirus (HPv) DNA and compare atypical squamous cells of undetermined signiqicance (ASC-US) populations with HPV DNA.Positive HPV tests with relative light unit (RLU) values > or =1000 were identified and original Pap test and follow-up biopsy results recorded. Pap test and biopsy results for ASC-US were compared to positive results with RLU <1000.From 1892 total HPV-positive tests, 156 specimens with high RLU were identified 145 had biopsies. The interpretations of the corresponding Pap tests were as follows: negative for intraepithelial lesion and malignancy, 3Compared to low-positive results, high-positive results showed more abnormal Pap tests. CIN 1 was a more likely result for high-positive ASCUS. More transient infections may account for these findings. The results do not argue for different management schemes between the categories.
