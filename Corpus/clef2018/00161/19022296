Confirmation and quantitation of human papillomavirus type 52 by Roche Linear Array using HPV52-specific TaqMan E6/E7 quantitative real-time PCR. Human papillomavirus type 52 is highly prevalent in Asia and Africa and accounts for 2-3% of total cervical cancer burden worldwide. The Roche Molecular Systems HPV Linear Array (RMS-LA uses multiple type (i.e. mixed) probes to detect DNA from HPV 52 infection which limits the assay's ability to determine HPV 52 status in the presence of HPV 33, 35, or 58 infection. This report presents a simple to use and highly reproducible HPV 52 type-specific quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay based on Taqman chemistry for detection and quantification of HPV 52 DNA from cervical swab specimens. Mixed probe positive cervical swab specimens collected from rural and urban women in Thailand (n=68) were used to determine assay agreement and differences in HPV 52 DNA viral load across cytological diagnosis. Forty-eight specimens were determined to be HPV 52 positive by RMS-LA with 94% (n=45) confirmed positive by Taqman assay (kappa: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). Higher median viral load was observed among women with a Pap diagnosis of >=ASCUS vs. normal/inflammation (8510 copies/1000 cell equivalents vs. 279 copies/1000 cell equivalents, p<0.05). Accurate ascertainment of infection status is important in understanding HPV 52's role in the etiology of cervical cancer as well as for the development of type-specific vaccines.
