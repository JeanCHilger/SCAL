Prognostic markers of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions: the role of topoisomerase IIalpha and active caspase-3. To study the relationship between topoisomerase IIalpha, active caspase-3 expressions and HPV DNA in uterine cervices with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL).Forty women with LSIL and 32 without cervical neoplasia diagnosed through cytologic and histopathologic examination were evaluated regarding topoisomerase IIalpha and active caspase-3 expressions and HPV DNA detection using PCR (GP5/GP6) in cervicovaginal smears.The mean percentage of cells immunomarked by topoisomerase in the group with LSIL was 11.62% while in the control it was 4.13% (p < 0.0001). In the presence of HPV DNA, topoisomerase expression was higher in the group with productive viral infection than in nonneoplastic tissue (p = 0.004). Caspase-3 expression was observed in 17 patients with LSIL (42.5%) and in five without cervical neoplasia (15.63%).The use of topoisomerase IIalpha and active caspase-3 in cervical biopsies may help to define the prognosis of HPV cervical infection.
