Anticipated shame and worry following an abnormal Pap test result: the impact of information about HPV. To evaluate the impact of HPV and cervical cancer information on women's anticipated feelings of worry and shame if they received an abnormal cervical screening result.Data were obtained from a British population-based survey of 1081 women aged 25-64 years, carried out in 2006-7. Women were given 'phased' information about HPV and asked whether it would make them feel more or less worried and ashamed if they had an abnormal Pap result.At baseline, 5.5% women anticipated shame if they had an abnormal Pap test but 88.8% anticipated worry. General and prevalence information about HPV led 4.6% and 5.8% of women to say they would feel more ashamed, while 14.2% said they would feel more ashamed following sexual transmission information. About a third of women also said they would feel more worried having read the information. These responses were more common in women with little education and from non-white ethnic groups.HPV information could make women feel more worried about getting an abnormal Pap result, and may make some women feel more ashamed. Worryingly, this may particularly be true for women in groups with low screening uptake rates. Care needs to be taken to ensure HPV information is clear and does not raise unnecessary anxiety.
