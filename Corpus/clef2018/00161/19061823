Cervical cancer screening in pregnancy. Cervical cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed during pregnancy. Nearly 3% of cases of newly diagnosed cervical cancer occur in pregnant women, probably because it is one of the few cancers for which screening is part of routine prenatal care.

In some populations, up to 20% of pregnant women have an abnormal Pap result during pregnancy.
