Malignancies in women with HIV infection. Women with HIV infection have an increased risk of developing certain malignancies. These malignancies are commonly human papillomavirus (HPV)-related, reflecting the high rate of coinfection with HPV in women with underlying HIV infection. These women also have a high incidence of premalignant HPV-related changes, such as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions as diagnosed on Pap smears and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on cervical biopsy. Screening recommendations for HIV-infected women reflect the need for vigilance in detecting and treating these lesions early. In addition, recent interest has focused on the use of cervical cancer screening, employing HPV-testing techniques, and on HPV vaccination in younger women to prevent initial infection and the subsequent development of cervical and other HPV-related cancers. The incidence of other types of malignancies, such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is also increased in HIV-infected individuals. When these lymphomas occur, they tend to be of advanced stage and high-grade histologies. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy has been associated with a marked decrease in the incidence of some of these cancers. The use of therapy has been associated with marked improvement in response rates and overall survival of affected patients.
