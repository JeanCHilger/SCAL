High grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and viral load of high-risk human papillomavirus: significant correlations in patients of 22 years old or younger. High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is recognized as the primary cause for the development of cervical cancers and their precursor lesions. We investigated whether high-grade cervical dysplasia correlates with high viral load of HR-HPV in an age-dependent manner. Cases were retrospectively selected to include patients with a prior cytological diagnosis of ASCUS or higher grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and a positive Digene Hybrid Capture II (HC-II) HR-HPV testing within 2 months before or after cervical biopsy. The quantitative viral load data was classified as negative, low, moderate and high according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cases were then stratified into 4 age groups: </=22 years, 23-30 years, 31-40 years and >40 years. Chi-Square analysis and logistic regression were performed where appropriate. A total of 995 patients were identified. Age categories were significantly associated with HPV loads (p=0.046). Moderate to high viral loads of HPV were significantly related to the histological grade of dysplasia (p=0.029). Logistic regression analysis further confirmed the association of HPV with histological grades, even after adjusting for age factor. In particular, high-grade dysplasia (p=0.011) but not low grade dysplasia (p=0.140) was significantly associated with moderate to high HPV loads. Patients of 22 years old or younger were the only group found significantly correlated with high viral loads of HPV (p=0.015). In conclusion, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and patients' age of 22 years old or younger are significantly associated with a moderate to high viral load of HR-HPV.
