Duration and clearance of anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among women: the Hawaii HPV cohort study. The association of anal cancer with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is well established however, little is known about the epidemiology of anal HPV in healthy women. We investigated patterns of duration and clearance of anal HPV infection in a cohort of healthy women in Hawaii.Viral and nonviral determinants of anal HPV clearance were examined in a longitudinal cohort study of 431 sexually active women. At baseline and at 4-month intervals, interviews were conducted and cervical and anal cell specimens were obtained for detection of HPV DNA.Of the 431 women, 50% experienced a total of 414 incident anal HPV infections, reported at 1 clinic visits from baseline through a follow-up period of average duration of 1.2 years. Of these infections, 58% cleared during follow-up. The clearance rate for a high-risk anal infection was 9.2 per 100 woman-months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9-11.9 per 100 woman-months), with a median duration of 150 days (95% CI, 132-243 days). The slowest clearing high-risk HPV types were HPV-59 (median clearance time, 350 days) and HPV-58 (median clearance time, 252 days). The median clearance times for HPV-16 and HPV-18, the predominant types associated with anal cancer, were 132 days and 212 days, respectively. Nonviral factors that delayed clearance of anal HPV included douching, long-term tobacco smoking, and anal sex.The majority of anal HPV infections resolve in a relatively short time. Although anal HPV is commonly acquired in healthy women, its rapid clearance suggests limited efficacy of HPV testing as an anal cancer screening tool.
