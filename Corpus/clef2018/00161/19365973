Papillary squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, high-risk human papilloma virus infection and p16(INK4a) expression: a case report. Papillary squamous cell carcioma is rare form of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix occurring in women in the sixth decade of life and is frequently misdiagnosed as high-grade intraepithelial lesion. Few reports with cytologic study have been performed, especially with cytology in liquid-based specimens.A 58-year-old woman who had 8 gestations (no abortions) and mitral cardiopathy treated with coumarin medication was referred for transvaginal bleeding of 20 days' duration. Specular examination showed an exophytic, easily bleeding lesion occupying all of the uterine cervix and superior third of the vagina. Liquid-based cytology showed squamous cells, mostly basaloid but some bizarre or in fiber, with clearly atypical nuclei. Second-generation hybrid capture for high-risk human papillomavirus was positive, with a viral load of 404 relative light unit/positive control B, and the tumor expressed p16(INK4a).This report adds further experience with liquid-based cytology to the existing conventional and liquid-based cytologic findings, particularly in the Brazilian female population.
