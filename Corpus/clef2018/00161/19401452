Disruption of the E2 gene is a common and early event in the natural history of cervical human papillomavirus infection: a longitudinal cohort study. Integration of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types into the host-cell genome disrupts the HPV regulatory E2 protein, resulting in a loss of negative feedback control of viral oncogene expression this disruption has been considered a critical event in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia, and a potential biomarker of progressive disease. However, using serial samples taken from a cohort of young women who were recruited soon after they first had sexual intercourse, we show that disruption of the E2 gene is a common and early event in the natural history of incident cervical HPV infections. The E2 gene was significantly more likely to be disrupted in women who tested positive for HPV18 in their baseline sample than in those who tested positive for HPV16 [26% versus 58%
