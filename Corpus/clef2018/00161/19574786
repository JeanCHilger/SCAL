Comparison of the hybrid capture II assay with the human papillomavirus DNA chip test for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 is used as the threshold for treatment decisions. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the Hybrid Capture II assay (HC2) and the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA chip test (HDC) for detecting HPV in high-grade cervical lesions CIN2 or greater, including adenocarcinoma (CIN2+). Seven hundred forty-one women with abnormal cervical cytology were evaluated with the HC2, the HDC, and histological assessment of the cervix. The overall agreement of the 2 HPV tests was 88.8% (kappa value, 0.61). Of 615 high-risk HPV-positive specimens by the HC2, 571 (92.8%) were HDC-positive. Both tests were performed similarly on CIN2+ samples the sensitivities of the HC2 and HDC as predictors of CIN2+ were 93.4 and 92.6%, respectively. In 83 cases of discrepancies between the HC2 and HDC, genotyping of 39 HC2-negative/HDC-positive cases revealed 13 HPV-53, 8 HPV-58, 7 HPV-16, 6 HPV-18, 2 HPV-68, 1 HPV-31, 1 HPV-45, and 1 HPV-66. In 515 patients with CIN2+, HPV-16 (45.0%) was the most common type
