Digene HPV Genotyping RH Test RUO: comparative evaluation with INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Test for detection of 18 high-risk and probable high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes. Standardized and validated methods for the specific detection and identification of a spectrum of high-risk (hr) HPV genotypes will be necessary if HPV genotyping gains an important role in the clinical management of HPV-related precancerous lesions and cancers.The first comparative evaluation of novel HPV genotyping Digene HPV Genotyping RH Test RUO (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with standard INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra CE assay (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium).Seventy hr-HPV positive samples were tested in parallel with both genotyping assays. The results were interpreted taking into account 15 hr-HPV and 3 probable hr-HPV genotypes that can be identified by both assays (assay-common genotypes).Concordant results (a complete match of assay-common genotypes or negative using both assays) and compatible results (at least one genotype in common) were obtained in 42 (60.0%) and 28 (40.0%) samples, respectively. No discordant results for assay-common genotypes were obtained. Of 42 samples with compatible results, the presence of at least one assay-common genotype was detected in 37 samples, while no HPV was detected in two samples by both assays and only a single low-risk HPV was detected by INNO-LiPA in three samples.A novel Digene test is suitable for the detection of hr-HPV genotypes in clinical samples and it provides comparable results to the well established INNO-LiPA assay. Although INNO-LiPA identified significantly more samples with multiple HPV genotypes than the Digene test, the clinical benefit of such a difference is at present unclear.
