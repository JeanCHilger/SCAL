Follow-up findings for women with human papillomavirus-positive and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance screening test results in a large women's hospital practice. Reflex human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been designated in consensus guidelines as "preferred" for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) liquid-based cytology (LBC) results, and colposcopy is currently recommended for patients with HPV-positive ASC-US results. Data from large clinical practices using newer screening methods and current cytology terminology are limited.We analyzed data from patients with ASC-US LBC and positive HPV test results. We also assessed the impact of the presence or absence of an endocervical cell/ transformation zone sample (EC/TZS) on biopsy diagnoses.The information system of a large women's hospital serving an older-than-average population was searched over a 21-month period between July 1, 2005, and March 31, 2007, for HPV-positive cases interpreted as ASC-US (Bethesda System 2001) using computer-imaged LBC. Histologic diagnoses, patient ages, and presence or absence of an EC/TZS were analyzed. The average follow-up period was 7.5 months.Among 4273 women with HPV-positive ASC-US results, the cumulative cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 (CIN 2/3) and CIN 1 rates for 2192 women with available biopsies were 5.1% and 43.6%, respectively. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 and CIN 1 rates for women with HPV-positive ASC-US results were not significantly different for women with and without an EC/TZS.The risk of CIN 2/3 in the study population was significantly lower than reported in widely cited trial data. Neither presence nor absence of an EC/TZS, nor the age of the patient, had a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of biopsy diagnoses of CIN 2/3 and CIN 1 for patients with HPV-positive ASC-US test results.
