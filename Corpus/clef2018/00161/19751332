HPV vaccination in women over 25 years of age: Asian Cervical Cancer Prevention Advisory Board recommendations. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide and is responsible for more than 270 000 deaths every year, the majority of which occur in Asia. The Asian Cervical Cancer Prevention Advisory Board (ACCPAB) was established in 2005 with a mission to raise awareness of the significant disease burden of cervical cancer in Asia and the strategies for its prevention. Persistent infection with oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical cancer. Vaccines against the two most carcinogenic subtypes of HPV (HPV 16 and 18) are available and have the potential to prevent cervical cancer in 70-80% of HPV- na√Øve women. HPV vaccines have been first licensed for use in girls and women aged 9-26 years. However, women over 25 years of age are also vulnerable to HPV infection and are likely to benefit from vaccination. Current evidence shows that even women previously infected with HPV who have subsequently cleared the infection can obtain complete protection against the HPV types contained in the vaccines. Therefore, vaccinating sexually active women aged over 25 years offers significant benefits and may be expected to decrease the incidence of cervical cancer. The ACCPAB advocates the adoption of preventive measures against HPV infection, including vaccination, with a view to protecting women of all ages from developing cervical cancer.
