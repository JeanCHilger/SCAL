Cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies. Despite its low incidence in the developed world, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Screening saves lives. When diagnosed and treated in the preinvasive stage, 5-year survival probabilities approach 100%. This review addresses the cost-effectiveness of the various screening strategies commonly used worldwide. The starting age of screening, interval between screens and age of women at cessation of screening are the most important variables determining cost-effectiveness. While the traditional Pap test is still the most cost-effective screening method in most settings, human papillomavirus testing can improve outcomes at reasonable costs in certain high-risk populations.
