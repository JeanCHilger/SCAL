Up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 is associated with high-risk HPV and grade of cervical lesion at baseline but does not predict outcomes of high-risk HPV infections or incident CIN. Protease inhibitor serpin-B2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 [PAI-2]) protects pRb from degradation in human papillomavirus (HPV)-18+ HeLa cells. Our objective was to assess whether the pRb-mediated HPV-suppressive effect of PAI-2 in cancer cell lines has implications in the outcome of HPV infections. Cervical biopsy specimens from 225 women were analyzed for PAI-2 expression to assess its value as a predictor of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade, high-risk (HR) HPV at baseline, outcomes of HR-HPV infections, and the development of incident CIN. PAI-2 expression increased in parallel with lesion grade. Nuclear PAI-2 expression was significantly related to HR-HPV detection and had a linear relationship with HR-HPV load. PAI-2 expression was of no value in predicting the outcomes of HR-HPV infections. The same was true for PAI-2 as a predictor of surrogate end points (incident CIN 1+, CIN 2+) of progressive disease. PAI-2 expression is up-regulated on transition from CIN 2 to CIN 3. The HR-HPV suppressive effects of PAI-2 were not related to more favorable outcomes of HR-HPV infections or lower risk of disease progression to CIN.
