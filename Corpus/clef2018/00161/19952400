Effect of HPV16E6 on sensitivity of chemotherapy for cervical carcinoma in different p53 genotype cell lines. To investigate the effect of human papillomavirus types 16E6 on the sensitivity of chemotherapy for cervical carcinoma in different p53 genotype cell lines.The apoptosis rates of each group were detected by AO/EB, immunofluorescence and Annexin V/PI stained methods. The expressions of protein HPV16E6 and p53(mt) after the treatments of different concentration of DDP were detected by Western blot. HPV16E6 mRNA in C33A, C33A-E6, C33A-P, and CaSki cell lines under different DDP treatments were detected by RT-PCR.AO/EB and Annexin V/PI stained tests showed that the apoptosis rates of C33A, C33A-E6, C33A-P, and CaSki cells were significantly increased when DDP concentration increased. Western blot showed that the HPV16E6 protein could be detected only in C33A-E6 and CaSki cell lines. The expression of HPV16E6 protein in C33A-E6 and CaSki cell lines gradually decreased and was hardly detected with increased dosage of DDP and the prolonged treatment time (P<0.01), and slightly increased in C33A-E6 and Caski cell lines without the treatment, but there was no significant difference between them (P>0.05). Protein p53(mt) persistently expressed in C33A-E6, C33A, and C33A-P cell lines following the increased dosage of DDP and the prolonged treatment time(P>0.05), while it couldn't be found in CaSki cell line. RT-PCR showed that without DDP intervention, there was no significant difference of HPV16E6 mRNA in C33A-E6 and CaSki cell lines within 24 h.The HPV16E6 mRNA in C33A-E6 cell line expressed much higher than that in CaSki (P<0.05), and HPV16E6 mRNA of 2 cell lines expressed much higher at 48 h than at 24 h (P<0.05).The expression of HPV16E6 mRNA in C33A-E6 and CaSki cell lines gradually decreased with the increased DDP and prolonged treatment time (P<0.01), while there was no significant difference between C33A-E6 and CaSki cell lines under the same DDP concentration (P>0.05).Effect of HPV16E6 on the sensitivity of chemotherapy for cervical carcinoma cell lines is not markedly related with the different p53 genotype forms(p53(mt)/p53wt ). HPV16E6 may affect the proliferation and sensitivity of chemotherapy in C33A cell line through other mechanism.
