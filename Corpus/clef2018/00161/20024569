Successful photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid for five cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of PDT in patients with CIN and high-risk HPV infection.Five patients diagnosed CIN 2 or CIN 3 with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection were included. Each patient had gynecologic examination including cervical cytology, HPV DNA testing, colposcopy and biopsy. Two grams of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) gel (118 mg/g) was topically applied to the cervix and covered with a special plastic cap for 3-4 h, followed by 20 min illumination of both ecto- and endo-cervical canal with red coherent light (wavelength 633 nm) using a PDT laser and a special light catheter. The PDT therapy was repeated with an interval of 1 week. Follow-up examination including biopsy and histology, colposcopy, HPV DNA testing were carried out after 3, 6 and 9 months.Treatment could be accomplished in all cases and no severe side effect was encountered. All the CIN2 patients had a complete response for 9 months and one CIN3 HPV remained positive for 6 months after three or four treatments.PDT seems to be a non-invasive, repeatable procedure for CIN and cervical HPV infection with minimal side effects and can be easily performed on outpatient basis.
