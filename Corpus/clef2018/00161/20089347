The risk of CIN II or greater in a one-year follow-up period in patients with ASC-H interpreted with cytology. To explore the risk of CIN II or greater in patients with cytologically interpreted atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) in a one-year follow-up period.Patients with ASC-H accepted high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (Hybrid Capture II), colposcopy-directed biopsy, and endocervical curettage at baseline. Patients with CIN 1 or less were re-examined with cytology at 4-6-month intervals for up to 12 months only if the cytologic result was ASC-US or worse. Correlation between HPV infection at baseline and the follow-up results was analyzed using Chi-square statistical method and Fisher's exact test.34.0% (50/147) patients were diagnosed CIN II or greater at baseline. Four patients were diagnosed CIN II or greater at repeat colposcopy among the 65.0% (63/97) of patients who were diagnosed CIN I or less at baseline and had completed follow-up. The HPV positive rate was 61.9% (91/144) at baseline. The correlation coefficient of HPV negativity with CIN I or less was 100% (32/32).The risk of CIN II or greater among patients with ASC-H was 40% and all patients (100%) with baseline negative HPV showed CIN I or less by cytology during the one-year follow-up period.
