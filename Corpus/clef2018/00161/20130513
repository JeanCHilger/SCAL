Human papillomavirus DNA presence in pelvic lymph nodes in cervical cancer. This work intends to present a systematic overview of data that have been published so far with regard to methods used for tissue sampling and DNA testing and with regard to the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) and its prognostic significance.The HPV DNA status of LN in women with cervical cancer is being explored as a potential marker of "occult" metastases. Although the presence of HPV DNA in LN usually correlates with its metastatic involvement, there is always a subgroup of HPV-positive but histologically negative LNs.The significance of HPV in negative LNs remains uncertain, although several studies have concluded that HPV is a risk factor of recurrence.A small group size and a short follow-up are the main limitations for drawing any conclusion concerning prognostic significance of the presence of HPV DNA in LNs.
