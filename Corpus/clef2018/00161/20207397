HPV genotyping and HPV16 variant analysis in glandular and squamous neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. The objective of the study was to compare the distribution of HPV genotypes and HPV16 variants in glandular and squamous cervical neoplasia.Cases of endocervical adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS, n=33) invasive adenocarcinoma (ADCA, n=55), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-3 (CIN3, n=130) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, n=60) were collected at the New York Hospital and tested for HPV using SPF(10)PCR-LIPA(25) (version 1) assays and for HPV16 variants using a multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization assay.There was a difference between the spectrum of HPV genotypes detected in glandular and squamous neoplasia: 13 different HPV genotypes were detected in CIN3 as single infections and 11 in SCC, while only 4 single genotypes were detected in AIS and 3 in ADCA. The most common single HPV types in CIN3 were HPV16, 31, and 52 (56.9%, 10%, 8.4%, respectively). In SCC the most common were HPV16, 18 and 31 (70%, 6.5%, 4.9%). In AIS, HPV16, 18, 45 and 35 accounted for 69.7%, 27.2%, 3%, 3% of cases. The three single types in ADCA were HPV16 (43.6%), HPV18 (41.8%) and HPV45 (10.9%). European variants of HPV16 were the most common in CIN3 (83.8%), SCC (71.4%) and AIS (73.9%). In ADCA the Asian American (AA) variant was the most common (41.7%) followed by European variants (33.3%). AA variant was also detected in 17.4%, 4.1%, and 2.4% of HPV16 positive AIS, CIN3 and SCC, respectively.Asian American variant of HPV16, HPV18 and HPV45 are preferentially associated with cervical adenocarcinoma as compared to squamous cell carcinoma.
