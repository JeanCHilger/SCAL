Association between human papilloma virus-type infections with micronuclei frequencies. To determine the association between Human papillomavirus (HPV)-type infections with the frequency of Micronucleus (MN), a hospital-based, unmatched case-control study was carried out. We evaluated and compared the average number of MN/1,000 cells among three groups of Mexican females. Twenty one women ranging in age from 31-56 years and divided into three groups were studied. Group I comprised seven control women without cervical lesions and with HPV-negative, Group II was composed of seven women with Squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) infected with low-risk HPV low-risk, and Group III was made up of seven women with SIL infected with high-risk HPV infection. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test revealed differences among Groups I (5.14+/-3.02), II (13.43+/-3.41), and III (25.43+/-3.41) (F=67.46 P=0.0001). We demonstrated an association between HPV type infection and higher MN frequencies. However, a larger controlled study with sufficient follow-up will be required to further evaluate the usefulness of this test in the clinical management of women with HPV infection.
