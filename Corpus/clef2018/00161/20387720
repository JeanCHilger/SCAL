Diagnostic methods and techniques in cervical cancer prevention Part II: Molecular diagnostics of HPV infection. Clinical diagnostics of HPV infection is based on analytically and clinically validated assays for qualitative detection of HPV DNA from high risk genotypes. New generation of HPV DNA assays combines qualitative detection of 12 high-risk HPV genotypes with HPV-16 and HPV-18 genotyping. New generation of HPV molecular assays designed to increase clinical specificity of molecular testing is based on detection of mRNA for E6 and E7.
