Detection and typing of human papillomaviruses by restriction fragment length polymorphism in women with different cytology. The aim of this study was to determine a percentage of high risk genotypes which are included in the current vaccines in women with different cytology and on the basis of obtained results to evaluate the protective activity of the current vaccines.Endocervical swabs were taken from 70 women with different cervical cytology (25 women with CIN 1, 25 women with CIN 2/3 and 20 women with negative cytology). The samples were tested by PCR method using MY09/MY11 primers to determinate the HPV status, especially the percentage of high risk genotypes which are not included in the current vaccines. Genotyping was done by RFLP method.In as much as 38.8% of all samples high risk genotypes (hrHPV), not included in the current vaccine, were detected in a group of women with normal cytology hrHPV genotypes were found in 29.9% samples. HrHPV were found in 47%, and 64% of samples taken from women with normal cytology and CIN 1, respectively, while in women with CIN 2/3 hrHPV were found in 94%.These results indicate that in more than in one third of tested women the current available vaccines would be of minimal protective activity, but further studies which should include more women are needed.
