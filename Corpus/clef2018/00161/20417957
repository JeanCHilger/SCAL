What is the role of HPV typing in the United States now and in the next five years in a vaccinated population? To review the current state of HPV typing of the vaccinated population in the United States and potential for typing of this population over the next 5 years.An expert forum conducted on September 12-13, 2008, by the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists including 56 experts in cervical cancer and titled "Future strategies of cervical cancer prevention: what do we need to do now to prepare?"In principle, screening with HPV DNA testing for oncogenic genotypes followed by cytologic triage has attractive features that may serve well the screening needs of a post-vaccination era in the US. Particularly in light of the recent FDA approval of a HPV genotyping test, the group focused on how typing could be used to assist clinical decisions and whether its implementation would be cost-effective. Furthermore, it was agreed upon that HPV typing should not be used to determine who should be vaccinated against HPV. There was considerable discussion regarding the potential misuse and overuse of HPV typing in low risk women among healthcare providers.As HPV typing technologies gain traction in the United States, its appropriate use will depend on the evolving natural history of the vaccinated cohort, continued educational efforts of healthcare providers, and most importantly, creating an integrated approach to cervical cancer prevention that will lead to a greater decrease in the incidence of cervical disease in the US while allowing for cost equipoise. On September 12-13, 2008, the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists (SGO) convened a symposium of 56 cervical cancer experts titled "Future strategies of cervical cancer prevention: what do we need to do now to prepare?" to discuss evidence-based strategies in cervical cancer prevention and control, including HPV vaccination. This paper is the second in a series of manuscripts which highlight concepts, information, obstacles and approaches discussed during the Forum's sessions and focuses on the current state of HPV typing of the vaccinated population in the United States and typing of this population over the next 5 years.
