Natural history of infections with high-risk HPV in Chinese women with abnormal cervical cytology findings at baseline. To clarify the natural history of disease in Chinese women with benign cytologic observation and positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV).From September 1, 2004, to June 30, 2008, this prospective study followed up 893 women positive for HR-HPV who also had benign cytologic findings at baseline.After 3 to 57 months, the viral clearance rate was higher for patients younger than 30 years and for patients who had a low viral load at baseline than for those in their comparison groups. Conversely, the occurrence rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 was higher for patients with persistent HR-HPV infection, those who had CIN 1 at baseline, and those whose the second viral load was increased.Age, viral load, and presence of CIN 1 at the first evaluation were the main factors affecting the natural history of HR-HPV infection in women with benign baseline cytologic findings. The result(s) of the second HR-HPV testing were independent indicators of histologic progression.
