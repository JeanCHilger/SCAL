Up-regulation of lipocalin 2 is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus and grade of cervical lesion at baseline but does not predict outcomes of infections or incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Our objective was to assess whether neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)/lipocalin 2 (LCN2) expression in cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) lesions has implications on the outcome of HPV infections or disease progression. Cervical biopsy specimens from 225 women in the Latin American Screening study were analyzed for NGAL/LCN2 expression using immunohistochemical analysis, to assess associations with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade, high-risk HPV, and in predicting outcomes of high-risk (HR)-HPV infections. Expression of NGAL/LCN2 increased with lesion grade (odds ratio [OR], 3.86 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-9.71
