Testing for human papillomavirus and measurement of viral load of HPV 16 and 18 in self-collected vaginal swabs of women who do not undergo cervical cytological screening in Southern France. Self-sampling using vaginal swabs could be a valuable alternative to screen for cervical cancer for women who do not attend regular cytological screening. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of high and low-risk HPV types and of HPV type 16 and 18 DNA load in self-collected vaginal swabs from 35- to 69-year-old Southern French women of low socioeconomic level or migrant populations who do not attend regular cervical screening. A good concordance (93.1%) was found between cervical brush and vaginal swabs in 29 samples. Self-collected vaginal swabs were examined from 120 women. HPV infection was found in 28 women (23.3% median age 48 years), 17 (14.1%) of whom harbored high-risk HPV types. HPV type 16 was the high risk type found most frequently, followed by types 53, 31, 18, 58, and 66. The low-risk type detected most frequently was HPV type 6, followed by types 61, 70, and 81. The mean HPV 16 and 18 load was 6.3 log(10) copies/10(6) cells and 2.4 log(10) copies/10(6) cells, respectively. These results suggest that vaginal self-swabs can be a reliable tool for cervical cancer screening in non-attending and inadequately screened elderly women.
