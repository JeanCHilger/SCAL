Assessment of fluorescence in situ hybridization and hybrid capture 2 analyses of cervical cytology specimens diagnosed as low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion for the detection of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To assess Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN 2+) in patients with a cytologic diagnosis of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL).Residual samples from 115 LSIL-diagnosed cervical cytology specimens were evaluated by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) HC2 testing and FISH using biotin-labeled probes to HR-HPV and chromosomal probes to 3q26 (TERC) and 8q24 (CMYC). A cervical biopsy diagnosis of CIN 2+ was considered as evidence of high grade disease.The positive and negative predictive values of HC2 and FISH for detecting patients with CIN 2+ were 32% vs. 37% and 100% vs. 93%, respectively. The sensitivities of HC2 and FISH for CIN 2+ were not significantly different (100% vs. 90%, p = 0.25), while the specificity of HC2 was significantly lower than that of FISH (28% vs. 48%, p=0.003). FISH diagnosed fewer specimens as positive as compared to HC2 (62% vs. 79%).These preliminary data suggest that FISH testing may be useful for determining which patients with LSIL are most likely to have CIN 2+ on clinical follow-up.
