Human papillomavirus DNA testing for cervical cancer screening: practical aspects in developing countries. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, and the most common cause of death from cancer in women in the developing world. Cervical cancer represents the only gynecologic cancer that can be prevented through regular screening. Although there are established screening programs in the Western world that have effectively reduced the burden of cervical cancer, these programs have relied on insensitive screening technologies that depend on the long preinvasive phase of cervical carcinogenesis. The developing world faces specific additional challenges in implementing a successful cervical cancer screening program. The association between cervical cancers and human papillomavirus (HPV) make testing for the presence of HPV DNA a valuable screening tool. This review focuses on practical aspects of the implementation and delivery of HPV testing as the primary cervical cancer screening strategy in the developing world, and attempts to offer some solutions to the real-world challenges faced in these regions.
