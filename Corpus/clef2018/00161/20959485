Hierarchical clustering of human papilloma virus genotype patterns in the ASCUS-LSIL triage study. Anogenital cancers are associated with âˆ¼13 carcinogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) types in a broader group that cause cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Multiple concurrent cervical HPV infections are common, which complicates the attribution of HPV types to different grades of CIN. Here we report the analysis of HPV genotype patterns in the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance-low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study with the use of unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Women who underwent colposcopy at baseline (n = 2,780) were grouped into 20 disease categories based on histology and cytology. Disease groups and HPV genotypes were clustered with the use of complete linkage. Risk of 2-year cumulative CIN3+, viral load, colposcopic impression, and age were compared between disease groups and major clusters. Hierarchical clustering yielded four major disease clusters: cluster 1 included all CIN3 histology with abnormal cytology cluster 2 included CIN3 histology with normal cytology and combinations with either CIN2 or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology
