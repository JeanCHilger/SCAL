Human papilloma virus genotyping in women with CIN 1. Cervical cancer remains a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic problem in Poland. Despite progress in creating an active cancer prevention program in our country Poland occupies one of the last places in the EU in terms of cervical cancer- morbidity and mortality Supplement of secondary prevention of primary prophylaxis-HPV 16, 18 vaccination, offers hope for improvement of the situation. Epidemiology of individual HPV types differs, depending on the geographical location of the study population. So far in Poland, we have had no reliable data on the participation of selected oncogenic HPV types in the development of cervical pathologyIdentification of the most frequent, oncogenic HPV types in women diagnosed with CIN 1, from the Central and Western Poland.In the course of the conducted studies, genotyping of 13 types of human papilloma virus has been done in 126 HPV DNA-positive women diagnosed with CIN 1.Each cell material in which the presence of HPVDNA identified 13 types of oncogenic human papillomavirus was subsequently subjected to genotyping using the molecular test--Linear Array HPV Genotyping (Roche Diagnostics).In women from the Central and Western Poland diagnosed with CIN 1, HPV 16 (53.97%) was the most common, followed by HPV 33 (21.3%), HPV 18 (16.67%), HPV 31 (10.32%), HPV 45 (7.94%), HPV 52 (1.59%). Current HPV vaccines are designed to protect against two of the three most common genotypes, in women diagnosed with CIN 1 in Central and Western Poland.
