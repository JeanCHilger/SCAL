HPV detection and genotyping in males from the city of CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. A wide range of human papillomavirus (HPV) types can infect the anogenital region of males. Although there is a vast knowledge on HPV infections in women as well as on their association with cervical cancer, the study of HPV infections in males is scarce and controversial. The aim of the present work was to detect and typify HPV infections of the anogenital region in males and analyze the associated risk factors in the population studied. Anogenital samples from 37 patients (30 of whom were HIV carriers) attending the Infectology Service at the Hospital Nacional de Clinicas in C6rdoba, Argentina, were studied. Nine of these patients tested HPV-positive and five out of these nine were found to have mixed infections, being 18 and 61 the most frequent genotypes. There was a significant correlation between the HPV-positive patients and those having an HPV-compatible lesion or AIDS. The present work is the first study in the city of Cordoba which contributes relevant results to the knowledge of HPV infection and to the possible implementation of measures for its prevention.
