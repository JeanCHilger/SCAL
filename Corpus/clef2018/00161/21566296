Human papilloma virus infection in female kidney transplant recipients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of genital human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and cervical intra-epithelial lesions in transplanted patients. Cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear/HPV test and colposcopic examinations were performed in 58 patients who were candidates for renal transplant surgery these tests were repeated one year later. Their age range was 26-53 years (mean, 37.2 years). Hypertension was the most common cause of renal insufficiency (34.4%), while in 41.4% of the patients, the causative pathology was unknown. In 24.1% of the patients, there was no history of dialysis, i.e. they had pre-emptive transplantation. The mean duration of marriage (years since first intercourse) was 16.2 years (range, 1-35). Coitus interruptus was the most common contraceptive method used (37.9%), followed by tubal ligation and condom (10.3% and 6.9%, respectively). All patients had negative Pap tests and normal gynecologic exam before undergoing transplantation. The Pap test remained normal after transplant surgery, although the HPV test became positive in four patients (6.9%). There were five cases of white epithelium on colposcopy, but biopsy showed normal metaplasia. Two cases of extensive anogenital warts were treated by CO 2 laser, and one patient had recurrent warts, which responded well to second laser surgery. None of the study patients had squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SIL) or vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia. Our study suggests that screening with HPV and Pap test should be performed before transplant surgery and should be repeated at regular intervals in order to avoid irreversible situations such as high-grade SILs, which are difficult to treat. Avoiding high-risk sexual relations in this group of patients is highly recommended.
