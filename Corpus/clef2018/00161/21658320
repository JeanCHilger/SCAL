Prognostic implication of high risk human papillomavirus E6 and E7 mRNA in patients with intraepithelial lesions of the cervix in relationship to age. Since the introduction of the cytological screening programs, a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer has been achieved. Almost all of these cancers are related to high-risk (HR) Human Papillomavirus (HPV) cervical infections. However, the natural history of HPV infection seems to be different in younger patients, resulting in a higher rate of regression. There is, therefore, the need to identify HPV-related biomarkers in order to enhance the effectiveness of screening of high-risk cytological lesions, in particular in women over 35 years of age. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of the HR HPV E6 and E7 mRNA expression in women with intraepithelial lesions of the cervix, older or younger than 35 years of age. One hundred and eighty-four HR HPV DNA positive patients with a low squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) were tested for mRNA expressions, included in an observational study, and evaluated at follow-up with standard cytology up to 24 months from the mRNA test. The frequency of HSIL/LSIL cytology in the older cohort of mRNA positive patients was significantly higher compared to mRNA-negative patients, both at 1 and 2 years of follow-up (Chi-square: p 0.007 and p 0.009), but this difference was not found in the younger cohort. According to our results, the E6/E7 mRNA test could be a biomarker for viral activity, useful in identifying patients at higher risk of abnormal cytology, and in implementing the management of HR HPV DNA-positive women over 35 years of age.
