Genotyping of human papillomavirus in triaging of low-grade cervical cytology. The objective of the study was to evaluate whether typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) among women with low-grade cervical cytology can improve the ability to identify women with cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III or worse).A total of 1595 women with low-grade cervical cytology participating in a randomized implementation trial of HPV triaging using Hybrid Capture II were also HPV genotyped and CIN III or worse predictive values evaluated.HPV 16 was detected in 57% of cases with CIN III or worse but only among 24% of all tested women. Testing for the 3 HPV types with highest risk (HPV16/31/33) detected 77% of CIN III or worse, with 36% of women testing positive. Positivity for the other high-risk HPV types had a decreased risk for CIN III or worse.Different high-risk HPV types confer different risks for the presence of CIN III or worse, implying that HPV genotyping could be useful for the optimization of triaging strategies.
