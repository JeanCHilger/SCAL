Cervical screening strategies in resourced and resource-constrained countries. Screening for cervical cancer is well established in resourced countries, but in resource-constrained countries, it is almost non-existent at national level. In resourced countries, the Pap test forms the hallmark of screening, with the human papillomavirus DNA test a recent adjunct. In many resourced countries, however, screening for cervical cancer is still far from ideal. A coverage around 50% prevails in some countries, and few have reached the target of 80% or more. Furthermore, the human papillomavirus test and newly developed biomarkers may lead to the development of a 'super test', which could be applied less frequently compared with present-day cytological screening. In resource-constrained countries, the movement is towards a 'screen and treat' approach. The main screening methods under investigation are the visual inspection after diluted acetic acid application test and the human papillomavirus test. Cryotherapy and large loop excision of the transformation zone have been used most often as treatment methods. The ideal seems to be the human papillomavirus test with large loop excision of the transformation zone, provided a low-cost human papillomavirus test becomes available. Coverage is even a greater problem in resource-constrained countries, a problem in need of urgent attention. Resource-constrained countries, however, must curtail the high incidence of cervical cancer, which is often a lower priority than other pressing healthcare needs.
