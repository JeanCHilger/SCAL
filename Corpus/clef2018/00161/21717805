Mitochondrial DNA mutations in patients with HRHPV-related cervical lesions. High risk human papillomaviruses (hr-HPV) are known to be the etiological agents of cervical cancer disease. On the other hand, other cofactors are considered to be important in cervix carcinogenesis. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as alterations in mtDNA content have been reported in numerous cancers examined to date. The D-loop region has been shown to be a mutational "hot spot" in human cancer. In order to evaluate the role of mtDNA mutations in cervical lesions progression, cervical specimens (from 79 women, 29-65 years old) were investigated. DNA was isolated (High Pure PCR Template, Roche Diagnostics) from cervical cells from patients with different cytology (normal cervical epithelium, ASCUS-Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance, LGSIL-Low-Grade Intraepithelial Lesion, HGSIL-High-Grade Intraepithelial Lesion and SCC-Squamous Cell Carcinoma) and tested for HPV DNA presence (Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test, Roche Diagnostics). To elucidate a causative role of mtDNA in cervical lesions, mtDNA mutations were investigated using Mutector mtDNA kit (TrimGen Corporation). In patients with normal and ASCUS cytology, mtDNA mutations were absent. 16.66% of LGSIL patients presented mutations in D-loop region whereas 28.57% HGSIL cases showed mutations in mtDNA. Mutations were detected in 66.66% cases of SCC cases. These studies provide strong evidence that instability in the D-loop region of mtDNA may be involved in cervical dysplasia. We suggested that mtDNA mutations may play a role in cervical precursor lesions and cancer but their role in the mechanism of carcinogenesis remains to be solved.
