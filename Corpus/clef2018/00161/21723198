Management options for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) needs to protect women at risk from developing cervical cancer and to avoid over-treatment as well as obstetrical complications in women undergoing invasive treatment. Strong evidence shows that CIN3 is a true precursor and must be treated, whereas CIN1 lesions do not benefit from immediate surgery and should be followed conservatively. Although the clinical course of CIN2 differs from CIN3, it should be treated the same way for legal reasons. Colposcopy plays a central role in selection of patients and treatments. Treatment of CIN2 and 3 should be excisional. Large loop excision of the transformation zone, high-frequency-needle or laser conisation are equally good, whereas cold-knife conisation is associated with an excess risk for subsequent obstetrical complications. Human papillomavirus testing and cytology at 6 months seems to be the best post-treatment monitoring, although this needs to be confirmed by randomised-controlled trials. Future research needs to focus more on how the quality of colposcopy and the overall management concept determines the clinical outcome instead of exploring the role of single technical methods. Furthermore, it seems to be necessary to evaluate the best management of CIN2 in young and in vaccinated women.
