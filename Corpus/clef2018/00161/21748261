Subsequent risks for cervical precancer and cancer in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions unconfirmed by colposcopy-directed biopsy: results from a multicenter, prospective, cohort study. To investigate the natural course of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) that cannot be histologically confirmed by colposcopy-directed biopsy.In a multicenter, prospective, cohort study of Japanese women with LSILs, we analyzed the follow-up data from 64 women who had a negative biopsy result at the initial colposcopy (biopsy-negative LSIL) in comparison with those from 479 women who had a histologic diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (LSIL/CIN1). Patients were monitored by cytology and colposcopy every 4 months for a mean follow-up period of 39.0 months, with cytologic regression defined as two consecutive negative smears and normal colposcopy.In women with biopsy-negative LSILs, there were no cases of CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) diagnosed within 2 years the difference in the 2-year risk of CIN3+ between the two groups was marginally significant (0 vs. 5.5%In women with biopsy-negative LSILs, the risk of CIN3+ diagnosed within 2 years was low furthermore, approximately 70% underwent cytologic regression within 12 months, regardless of HPV testing results. Biopsy-negative LSILs may represent regressing lesions rather than lesions missed by colposcopy.
