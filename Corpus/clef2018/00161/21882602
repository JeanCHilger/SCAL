Human papilloma virus and lymphatic metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Our study included 112 patients with squamous cell cervical carcinoma la-lib stages (FIGO). All of them were restaged on the basis of histological evidence after surgical treatment. Ninety-eight were staged at final analysis. Human papilloma virus (HPV) was detected in endocervical smears and paraffin blocks of lymph nodes by PCR and real-time PCR. Oncogenic HPV in primary tumor was detected in 86 (87.8%) two or more genotypes--65 (75.58%): still more--21 (24.4%). In the latter group, the frequency of regional lymph node metastases was significantly higher. HPV DNA was identified in iliac lymph nodes in 29 (26.6%)
