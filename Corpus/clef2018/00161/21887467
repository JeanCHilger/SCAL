Human papillomavirus prevalence in women with normal cytology and with cervical cancer in Natal, Brazil. This study analyzed the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical specimens obtained from women with normal cytology and with cervical cancer, in order to evaluate their correlation with health status and demographic characteristics, as well as sexual and reproductive activity in women treated at a cancer reference hospital in Natal, Northeast Brazil. A total of 158 women were divided into 2 groups according to their health status: group I comprised 110 women with normal cytology, and group II comprised 48 women with cervical cancer. Cervical smears were analyzed by cytological or histopathological examination for the detection of cytological alterations, and by PCR for HPV DNA detection using MY09/11 primers, followed by HPV genotyping by dot blot hybridization. Results showed overall HPV prevalence to be 24.5% in group I, with 19.1% of patients having single infection and 5.4% double infection. The HPV prevalence in group II was 85.4%, with 79.2% of patients having single and 6.2% double infection. We identified 10 different HPV genotypes, most with high oncogenic potential. HPV 16 was the most prevalent genotype in the two studied groups, followed by HPV 58 and HPV 18. High-risk HPV genital infection, chronological age, ethnicity, early onset of sexual and reproductive activities, multiple sexual partners and smoking increased the risk for cervical cancer.
