Effect of xunxi no.1 intervention and radiotherapy on Ia-IIb stage cervical cancer with high-risk human papilloma virus infection. To explore the clinical value of Chinese medical intervention and treatment of high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) infection in patients of cervical cancer (CC) during radiotherapy (RT).Eighty CC patients of the Ia-IIb stage receiving primary RT were assigned to two groups. RT and local intervention by Xunxi No. 1 was given to patients in the test group for 20 days, while patients in the control group were treated with RT alone. Expression of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV, HPV16/18 infection) was detected by in-situ hybridization (ISH) before and after treatment. The 5-year disease free survival rate and pelvic lymph node metastasis rate (with the lymph node diameter >0.9 cm shown by CT) in patients were observed.After treatment, the HR-HPV positive rate was lowered from 67.5% (27/40) to 37.5% (15/40) in the test group (P<0.05), while it was lowered from 72.5% (29/40) to 65.0% (26/40) in the control group (P>0.05). By follow-ups, the 3-year disease free survival rate in the test group was better than that in the control group (33/40 vs 27/40), showing insignificant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). Significant difference was shown in the 5-year disease free survival rate and the pelvic lymph node metastasis rate (65.0% vs 42.5%, 7.5% vs 25.0%) between the two groups (both P<0.05).In early RT of CC, combined application of Xunxi No. 1 could obviously lower the HPV positive rate. The 5-year disease free survival rate was superior to that in the control group, with lower pelvic lymph node metastasis rate. Xunxi No. 1 had better clinical value in clinical application.
