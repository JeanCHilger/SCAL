Molecular detection of human papillomavirus in women with cervical condylomas treated with trichloroacetic acid. 1) To determinate the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with cervical condylomas after the trichloroacetic acid application by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and 2) to validate the colposcopy test versus the PCR (gold standard).A selected sample of 28 women of 18 to 45 years old with cervical condyloma acuminate, without evidence of cervical neoplasic lesion and with positive diagnosis of HPV with PCR was included. beta-globin gene was used as internal control and as DNA integrity marker. Women included in this study were divided in: treated group (n = 14), which were treated just one time with trichloroacetic acid to 90% in the cervix, the cul de sacs and the vagina areas, and placebo group (n = 14), which were treated with physiological saline. After eight weeks of being applied the treatment, each one of the 28 women was HPV diagnosed again by colposcopy and PCR.All women amplified for the beta-globin gene. In the treated group, 11/14 (78%) patients did not show amplification. The colposcopy showed two negative false, five positive false, one positive true and six negative true tests, revealing sensitivity of 33.33% and specificity of 54.54%.From the molecular point of view, this study showed that the trichloroacetic acid application causes physical destruction of the infected tissue, without detecting DNA damage due to the cellular desquamation. On the other hand, the colposcopy regarding the PCR is not an appropriate test for the diagnosis and follow-up of the HPV infection.
