Management of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix of adult women. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, despite having great potential for prevention and cure when early diagnosed and treated, which can reduce the mortality rate among the affected. Since there is no consensus among the therapeutic measures in high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL), we discuss its approach when dealing with adult women who have HGSIL and the follow-up after the adopted procedure. We performed electronic searches of MEDLINE (through PubMed), National Guidelines Clearinghouse, Google Scholar and Lilacs. The guidelines identified were evaluated according to their validity and recommendations. In relation to after-care, the European use cytology every 6 months, the Australians, cytology and colposcopy every 6 months, the Americans advocate the realization of hybrid capture in six to 12 months or cytology every 6 months. The Brazilian Guidelines Project, on its turn, recommends that clinical reassessments and Pap smear should be performed every three or four months during the first two years of follow-up. Studies comparing the method "See and Treat" with the three steps one (histology, colposcopy, biopsy) concluded that the latter is indicated for women ASCUS/LSIL before undergoing the excision of the transformation zone (ETZ), while the "View and Treat" is indicated in women with proven HGSIL in cytology and suggestive in colposcopy, because it presents advantages such as low cost and immediate solution. All the guidelines are unanimous in stating that when facing proven HGSIL, excision of the injury through ablation or conization or ETZ is indicated.
