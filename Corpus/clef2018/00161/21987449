Distribution of human papillomavirus among women with abnormal cervical cytology in Kuwait. This study investigates the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) in women with abnormal cervical cytology in Kuwait. Two hundred and ninety-eight (298) abnormal ThinPreps were taken from women seeking routine gynecological care and screened for HPV DNA by real-time PCR. HPV genotyping was determined by PCR-based sequencing. HPV DNA was detected in 152 women (51%), and 29 different HPV genotypes were detected, comprising 16 high-risk (HR) (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 97), nine low-risk (LR) (6, 11, 54, 61, 74, 81, 90, 102, 106), and four intermediate-risk (IR) (62, 67, 84, 87). HPV16 had the highest prevalence (24.3%), followed by HPV11 (13.8%), HPV66 (11.2%), HPV33 (9.9%), HPV53 (9.2%), HPV81 (9.2%), HPV56 (7.9%) and HPV18 (6.6%). HPV prevalence was 86, 67, and 89% in women with invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), respectively. As for age distribution, 69% of all HPVs were found in women aged 20-29 years, and the HPV incidence rate deceased with increasing age. The proportion of single infections decreased as the severity of the cytological diagnosis increased, while the proportion of multiple infections increased. This study is the first of its type in Kuwait and one of few in the Middle East. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that HPV infection is the primary cause of cervical neoplasia. They support HPV vaccine research to prevent cervical cancer and efforts to develop HPV DNA diagnostic tests.
