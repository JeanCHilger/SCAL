Cytology and clinical spectrum of sexually transmitted infections in Lebanese women as revealed by Pap smear: a cross-sectional study from 2002-2006. To study the cytology profile of cervical smears and the respective prevalence and incidence of certain cervico-vaginal infections detectable by routine Pap smear cytology in Lebanese women from 2002 to 2006.

This study covered 118,230 cervical specimens obtained from Lebanese women attending clinics and hospitals in all the five districts of Lebanon prevalence and incidence rates for infections detectable by routine Pap smear examination were determined. A rise in prevalence of these infections by 2.1 percent (2,555) from 2002 to 2006 was revealed. A doubling of Pap smears showing HPV-associated changes was detected (1.4 percent in 2002 to 2.9 percent in 2006), and a simultaneous almost 7-fold increase of Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS) cytology was detected during this period
