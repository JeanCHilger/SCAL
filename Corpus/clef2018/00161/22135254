Detection of human papillomavirus type 18 E7 oncoprotein in cervical smears: a feasibility study. Persistent infections by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the main etiological factor for cervical cancer, and expression of HPV E7 oncoproteins was suggested to be a potential marker for tumor progression. The objective of this study was to generate new reagents for the detection of the HPV18 E7 oncoprotein in cervical smears. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against recombinant E7 protein of HPV type 18 (HPV18) were generated and characterized using Western blotting, epitope mapping, indirect immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. One clone specifically recognizing HPV18 E7 was used for the development of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was validated using recombinant E7 proteins of various HPV types and lysates from E7-positive cervical carcinoma cells. A total of 14 HPV18 DNA-positive cervical swab specimens and 24 HPV DNA-negative-control specimens were used for the determination of E7 protein levels by the newly established sandwich ELISA. On the basis of the average absorbance values obtained from all 24 negative controls, a cutoff above which a clinical sample can be judged E7 positive was established. Significant E7 signals 6- to 30-fold over background were found in 7 out of 14 abnormal HPV18 DNA-positive cervical smear specimens. This feasibility study demonstrates for the first time that HPV18 E7 oncoprotein can be detected in cervical smears.
