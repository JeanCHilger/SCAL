Perception and psychological impact of an abnormal Pap smear. Results of a comparative European survey. The availability of information on HPV and Pap tests has increased dramatically with the introduction of national HPV vaccination programs. But data on the effectiveness of this information is limited. However, our desire is to reduce patient anxiety and promote better delivery of information.Therefore a questionnaire-based cohort study was conducted to investigate women's experience with the announcement of an abnormal Pap smear result, then the ensuing events, as well as their practitioner's management. This article focuses on the French experience, underpinned by comparative data with Spain and Portugal.It shows that, face with stress reactions and patient's anxiety, the level of information from the medical profession is still seen as inadequate, while the Internet as an information source has its limitations and dangers. The close entourage is most relied on, which supports the need for better public information.Uniformity and standardization of information strategies is not yet on European time.
