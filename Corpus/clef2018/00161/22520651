Risk factors for abnormal anal cytology over time in HIV-infected women. The objective of the study was to assess the incidence of, and risk factors for, abnormal anal cytology and anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 2-3 in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women.This prospective study assessed 100 HIV-infected women with anal and cervical specimens for cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing over 3 semiannual visits.Thirty-three women were diagnosed with an anal cytologic abnormality at least once. Anal cytology abnormality was associated with current CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm(3), anal HPV infection, and a history of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Twelve subjects were diagnosed with AIN2-3: 4 after AIN1 diagnosis and 4 after 1 or more negative anal cytology. AIN2-3 trended toward an association with history of cervical cytologic abnormality and history of STI.Repeated annual anal cytology screening for HIV-infected women, particularly for those with increased immunosuppression, anal and/or cervical HPV, a history of other STIs, or abnormal cervical cytology, will increase the likelihood of detecting AIN2-3.
