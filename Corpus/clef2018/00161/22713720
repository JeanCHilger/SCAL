Prevalence of type-specific human papillomavirus infection among women in France: Implications for screening, vaccination, and a future generation of multivalent HPV vaccines. To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and genotype distribution by age and cervical cytology/histology status among women undergoing routine gynecological examinations, and to discuss the possible impact on preventive strategies. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples were tested for HPV DNA, mRNA, and HPV genotypes. Women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or greater (ASC-US+) and/or at least one positive HPV test were referred to colposcopy. Those with normal colposcopy results had biopsies taken at the 6 and 12 O'clock positions of the normal transformation zone. Of the 5002 women, 515 (10.3%) were <25 and 4487 (89.7%) were ≥25years old. Overall HPV prevalence varied between 10.1% and 16.1% depending on the assay. Risk factors for HPV infection included greater number of recent sexual partners, history of abnormal cervical pathology, age <25years, and smoking. HPV prevalence increased with the cytological and histological severity of cervical lesions. Prevalence of HPV 16/18 was 5.2% and 2.7% in women <25 and ≥25years old, respectively. HPV 16 was the type most strongly associated with a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN3+) (odds ratio=11.64 vs. HPV 16 absent, P<0.001). A high proportion of high-grade cervical lesions (60.6% of genotyping assay-positive CIN2+) were associated with HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, or 58. These data indicate that almost all young women could benefit from HPV prophylactic vaccination, but confirm the need for continued cervical screening and highlight the potential benefit of future vaccines targeting a wider range of HPV types.
