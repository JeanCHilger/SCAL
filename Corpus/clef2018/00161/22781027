Costs associated with management of cervical human papillomavirus-related conditions. Oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been linked to 99.7% of cervical cancer cases worldwide.This retrospective claims-based analysis was conducted to assess patterns of use and costs associated with diagnostic and treatment procedures for disease attributed to HPV performed before the introduction of HPV vaccination (January 1, 2001-May 31, 2006). Percentages of commercially insured health plan enrollees who underwent each procedure of interest were calculated for each year. Annual costs (combined patient and health plan-paid amounts) were calculated from qualifying medical claims. Descriptive statistics were used to assess trends in procedure rates and costs.Data for approximately 14.2 million enrollees were obtained. Hysterectomy was the most commonly administered treatment. With the exception of colposcopy with LEEP, all other treatment procedures experienced a decline in rate of use. The most frequently performed diagnostic procedure was colposcopy with endocervical curettage (ECC). With the exception of ECC, rates of diagnostic procedures reached a peak among 20- to 24-year-olds, and followed a downward trend across older groups. Hysterectomy was the most expensive treatment (median $7,383 mean $8,384) per procedure in 2006.Results reveal high rates of use and high-associated costs of diagnostic procedures and treatments related to disease attributed to HPV.The data presented may be useful in cost-effectiveness analyses and to guide decision makers evaluating how best to optimize prevention strategies.
