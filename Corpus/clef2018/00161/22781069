Analysis of cervical HPV infection in HIV positive Chinese women. To investigate prevalence HPV infections in cervix among HIV-infected Chinese women.From September 2009 to May 2011, 293 women with positive HIV underwent cervical cancer screening as study group matched with 200 women with negative HIV as control group. Questionnaires including demographic information and HIV associated information were collected, Pap smear and 23 subtype of HPV were performed in those women. The women with positive HPV were followed up per 6 months, and the period of following up were more than 12 months. Binary logistic analysis was used for high risk factors of HPV persistent infection.Prevalent HPV infection was 44.4% (130/293) in study group and 20.0% (40/200) in control group, respectively, which reached statistical difference (P < 0.05). The most common genotype of HPV was HPV 16, which prevalence was 13.7% (40/293) in study group and 7.0% (14/200) in control group. The other HPV subtype prevalence was HPV-58, HPV-52, HPV-43 and HPV-18, which was 9.2% (27/293), 8.2% (24/293), 8.2% (24/293), 6.8% (20/293) in study group and 3.0% (6/200), 2.5% (5/200), 1.5% (3/200), 2.5% (5/200) in control group. At time point of 12 months following up, the persistent prevalence of HPV was 47.5% (48/101) in study group and 21.1% (8/38) in control group, which reached statistical difference (P < 0.05). Multiple HPV infections (OR = 6.4, 95%CI: 1.6 - 25.6), abnormal cytology (OR = 18.1, 95%CI: 4.5 - 76.9) and lower CD(4) T cell count (compared with CD(4) > 3.5 × 10(8)/L, if 2.0 × 10(8) ≤ CD(4) ≤ 3.5 × 10(8), OR = 8.1, 95%CI: 1.3 - 56.3 if CD(4) < 2.0 × 10(8)/L, OR = 9.1, 95%CI: 1.8 - 46.9) were independently associated with HPV persistence among HIV-positive subjects.Prevalence and persistence of HPV infections were more common among HIV-positive Chinese women than those in HIV-negative Chinese women. Improving immune function, decreasing multiple HPV infections, treating abnormal cervical cytology could decrease prevalence of HPV infection.
