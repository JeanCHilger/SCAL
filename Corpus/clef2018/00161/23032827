The utility of p16 INK4a and Ki-67 to identify high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion in adolescents and young women. The repair of the immature squamous epithelium following HPV infection may mimic HSIL in adolescent women.to study the utility of p16 INK4a and Ki-67 in diagnosis of cervical squamous lesions in adolescents and young adults.In a cross-sectional study, the evaluation of p16 INK4a and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry was performed on 72 cervical biopsies of adolescents and young adults women diagnosed as negative for malignancy and intraepithelial lesion (NML) (n = 18) or positive for low grade (LSIL) (n = 31) and high grade (HSIL) (n = 23) squamous intraepithelial lesions in two references services in Fortaleza-Brazil. Data was evaluated using Fisher's test and Kappa index.p16 INK4a was positive in 81% of HSIL, 19% of LSIL and in no NML (P < 0.0001). Ki-67 was positive in 74%, 32% and 5.5% of HSIL, LSIL and NML, respectively. p16 INK4a and Ki-67 in the diagnosis of HSIL showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value. Kappa index was very good for p16 INK4a (k = 0.72).In adolescents and young adults p16 INK4a alone or with Ki-67 represents important tool to reduce mistaken diagnosis of HSIL and to avoid overtreatment.
