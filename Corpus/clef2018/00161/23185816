What's new in gynecology and obstetrics. Because of the lack of screening methods, ovarian cancer remains one of the major causes of mortality in gynecological oncology. Prevention by salpingectomy, based on a concept about the origin of serous carcinoma, may be proven effective in the future. Regarding cervical cancer, screening methods are improving and the benefit of HPV-HR testing has been recently demonstrated. Metabolic requirements and exercise are modified during pregnancy. Present recommendations are for pregnant women to practice regular moderate exercise, as in a non-pregnant population. This guideline, despite being reasonable, is not based on strong evidence. A randomised trial is ongoing in our Department to evaluate the effects of exercise in women with gestational diabetes.
