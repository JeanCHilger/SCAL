Human papillomavirus typing in reporting of condyloma. Monitoring of condylomas is an early evidence of population effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs. If reporting could include HPV typing, the contribution by vaccine HPV types to condyloma burden could be monitored.A sentinel site for reporting of condyloma including HPV typing was established at the Centre for Sexual Health in Malm√∂, Sweden. In 2006 to 2009, when there were few HPV vaccines, 621 subjects with condyloma were reported and HPV genotyped.Ninety-four percent of the condylomas contained genital HPV types. Thirty-five different genital HPV types were identified, with HPV6 (62%), HPV16 (13%), and HPV11 (10%) being the most common. At least 1 of the 4 HPV types in the HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine was detected in 77%. High-risk HPV types were more common in females (45%) than among males (27%) (odds ratio, 1.9 confidence interval, 1.3-2.8). Extended testing among subjects initially negative for HPV found 21 patients with cutaneous types of HPV, including a novel type (HPV153).This report provides a baseline distribution of HPV types in condylomas before the introduction of an HPV vaccination program in this population. Human papillomavirus typing is feasible in routine condyloma reporting.
