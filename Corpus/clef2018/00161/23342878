Assessment of frequency of regression and progression of mild cervical neoplasia--LGSIL in women with positive high-risk HPV DNA test result. Assessment of frequency of regression and progression of mild cervical neoplasia in women positive for types of HPV DNA of high oncogenic potential.111 women were studied. One-year-long observation of patients included cervical cytology conducted every three months, and colposcopy conducted every six months. After a period of 12 months all women were evaluated with colposcopy and directed biopsies of abnormal cervical tissue.This study confirms the significant effect of age on both regression and progression of low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.In the age group below 26 years, complete regression of LGSIL occurs significantly more frequently than in older women. Whereas in the over 36 age group, progression to HGSIL occurred more frequently during 12 months of follow-up.
