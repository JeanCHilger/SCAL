Comparison of the clinical performance of restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP) and Roche linear array HPV test assays for HPV detection and genotyping. The need for accurate genotyping of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections is becoming increasingly important as HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer worldwide. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP) assay provides accurate, broad-spectrum, high-throughput genotyping of HPV.We evaluated the clinical performance of the RFMP assay compared to a commercially available Roche linear array HPV genotyping test (LA) for detecting and genotyping of HPV.The RFMP assay and the LA were compared for detecting and genotyping HPV among a cohort of 244 liquid-based cytology samples.Overall, 216 specimens (93.1%, Îº = 0.86) generated concordant results for the presence or absence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) by the two assays. The RFMP assay and the LA assay generated concordant, compatible, and discordant genotyping results for 79.3, 9.9, and 10.8%, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of RFMP and LA for the cervical lesions of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were similar, at 92.9 and 85.0% (RFMP) and 92.9 and 83.8% (LA), respectively. In addition, the odds ratio for SCC with HR-HPV positivity estimated by the RFMP assay (73.7, 95% CI: 8.9-3173.3) was higher than the LA assay (67.0, 95% CI: 8.2-2887.0).The RFMP and the LA assays were highly comparable with regard to detection and genotyping analysis of HPV. The sensitivity and specificity of RFMP assay for the detection of HR-HPV in various levels of cervical lesions seems to be valuable in the monitoring of HPV-associated cervical cancer.
