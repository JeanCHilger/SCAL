Tabacco smoking, HPV infection and changes in cervix. To reduce neoplastic disease-related mortality there are introduced prophylactic programs. One of the most common neoplasm in women in Poland is cervical cancer. Etiopathogenesis of this neoplasm is mainly related to HPV infection. But the persistent infection is not the only sufficient factor in neoplastic transformation. One of the more important additional risk factors is tobacco smoking. In this studies authors analized the changes in histology image in respect of tobacco smoking and immunohistochemistry p16INK4a test. The results revealed directly relate between cigarette smoking, HPV infection and significant increase of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) in histology image. In group of non-smokers females with positive p16INK4a test the preneoplastic lesion low or high grade decreased.
