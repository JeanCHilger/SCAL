Expression of P-glycoprotein is positively correlated with p53 in human papilloma virus induced squamous intraepithelial lesions of uterine cervix: poor prognosis association. This study was conducted to assess the predictive value of p-glycoprotein (p-gp) and p53 immunoexpression in human papillomavirus (HPV) infected cases of cervical dysplasia. Expression of both p-gp and p53 proteins was detected in cervical smears from 177 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) cases along with 183 "atypical squamous cells of unknown significance" (ASCUS) and 150 normal cases. HPV 16 and 18 infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction using type-specific primers for HPV sub-types. There were no significant detectable p53 and p-gp expression in the normal cervix smears (p>0.05). In the ASCUS group 10 cases were positive for both p53 and p-gp immunoreactivity. In cervical dysplasia cases, p53 was positive in 86 (48.58%) while p-gp was positive in 93 (52.54%) and the two markers showed a highly significant correlation (r=0.92, p<0.001). Expression of p53 and p-gp was associated with grade of SIL (p<0.001). A positive correlation between the presence of HPV and expression of proteins p53 and p-gp in smears of patients with cervical lesions was also noted (p<0.001). Thus, p53 and p-gp immunostaining in cervical smears may act as an auxiliary biomarker for detection of HPV-associated cervical lesions. Additionally, a significant positive correlation between ascending grades of SIL and labeling indices of markers suggests that p53 and p-gp can be used as an adjunct to cytomorphological interpretation of conventional cervical Pap smears.
