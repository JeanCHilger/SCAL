Inter-laboratory variability in the presence of human papillomavirus in normal and abnormal cervical cytology samples. Treatment of cervical carcinoma is affected by the stage of the disease, being most likely curable with early detection. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and persistency are necessary to the development of precancerous and cancerous lesions leaving the possibility to detect in time cells progressing in at risk behaviour.This study documents the proportion of HPV DNA positivity in 906 samples with cytological result negative for intraepithelial lesion and malignancy (NILM), 220 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) samples and 211 low grade intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) samples collected from various pathological laboratories in Brussels, Belgium.The proportion of samples harbouring one or more HPV types was 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 8.8-12.8) in NILM, 34.5% (95% CI: 27.6-40.3) in ASC-US, 54.3% (95% CI: 47.5-61.1) in LSIL, with significant variability of HPV proportion in ASC-US and LSIL between laboratories.This study provides an on-site picture, confirming an added value of HPV DNA detection.
