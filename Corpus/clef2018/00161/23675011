Cervical Cancer Screening for the Reluctant - HPV Testing of Air-Dried Vaginal Discharge. Despite the availability of the PAP test, cervical cancer continues to cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Many women default cervical cytology for a variety of reasons. This demands the development of alternative screening strategies, such as HPV testing on self-procured cervical-vaginal specimens in order to capture this group of women. We investigated the self-procured air-dried vaginal discharge for HPV testing. We recruited 82 patients with HPV-associated cervical lesions and 36 patients with normal cervical pathology. Participants were briefed and informed consents obtained. Each was then given a kit containing written instructions, a slim napkin, an empty zip-lock plastic bag for soiled napkin specimen, and a return envelope. After wearing the napkin for the day, the patient removes it, dries it, and returns the specimen by mail. Specimens were batched and a 0.5 cm area of each stained napkin was tested for HPV by PCR. Specimens from all 26 patients with high-grade (CIN 2 or above) HPV-induced cervical lesions and 4 of 36 normal subjects tested positive for HPV, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 88.9%, respectively. We propose offering to women who refuse cervical cytology the alternative screening strategy of testing of self-procured air-dried vaginal discharge for HPV. This method of cervical cancer screening is also suitable for people living in remote regions of the world.
