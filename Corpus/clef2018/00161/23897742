Should cervical cancer screening begin at age 21 for everyone? A quantitative analysis in a high-risk, low-income, African American/Hispanic young-adult population. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended modifying the baseline cervical cancer screening age from earlier of three years after first sexual intercourse or age 21 to age 21. In this study, we tracked abnormal cytologic diagnoses, with an emphasis on high-grade cervical lesions, in a high-risk, low-income, African American/Hispanic young-adult population. The intention was to assess if delaying cancer screening to 21 years of age would be effective in this subpopulation. A search of the cytopathology database between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2009 was performed to identify all women with their first abnormal cytologic diagnosis prior to turning 21 years of age. All of the available follow-up cytologic and/or histologic diagnoses, made both prior to and after turning 21 years of age, were recorded and the results analyzed. Amongst the 8,011 total number of women under 21 years of age screened for cervical cancer at our institution from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2009 the overall abnormal cytology rate was 25%, with a rate of 1% for HSIL, 3% for ASC-H/LG-H, and 22% for LSIL/ASC-US. The youngest subject diagnosed with HSIL was 14 years of age. Not a single study subject developed invasive cervical cancer prior to turning 21 years of age. In spite of the limitations of the study, we found that for patients served by our institution, delaying cervical cancer screening until 21 years of age is effective for the detection of early precancerous lesions.
