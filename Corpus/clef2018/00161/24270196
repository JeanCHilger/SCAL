Triage of women with negative cytology and positive high-risk HPV: an analysis of data from the SHENCCAST II/III studies. To determine a management strategy for women testing negative with cervical cytology and positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV).Using the data from the large population-based Shenzhen Cervical Cancer Screening Trials II and III (SHENCCAST II/III), we compared the risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or cancer (CIN 3+) in women with negative cytology but testing positive for HR-HPV DNA using Cervista HPV HR or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), followed by secondary screening with type-specific Cervista HPV-16/18 or MALDI-TOF. The study aim was to seek the most sensitive and specific triage assay for referral for colposcopy.A total of 8,556 women had complete data. The proportion of women with negative cytology and positive HR-HPV by Cervista HR-HPV (5.30%, 453/8,556) was slightly lower than that of women with negative cytology and HR-HPV-positive tests by MALDI-TOF (5.82%, 499/8,556, p = .015). The proportion of women having negative cervical cytology and a positive HR-HPV by Cervista HR who have HPV-16 and/or -18 by Cervista HPV-16/18 (11.8%, 53/448) was less than that of women with a negative cervical cytology and positive HR-HPV by MALDI-TOF who have HPV-16 and/or -18 by MALDI-TOF (19.4%, 97/499, p = .001). The proportion of CIN 3+ within negative cervical cytology and positive HR-HPV that were HPV-16 and/or -18 for the Cervista 16/18 assay (61.5%, 8/13) was similar to that for the MALDI-TOF 16/18 assay (66.7%, 10/15, p = 0.8).In the cytology-negative HR-HPV-positive population, Cervista 16/18 as the HPV detection method would refer 11.8% of women for colposcopy and diagnose 61.5% of the CIN 3+, while MALDI-TOF16/18 would refer 19.4% and diagnose 66.7% of the CIN 3+. Cervista HPV-16/18 seems to be the superior triage test. However, in resource-limited settings, an assay that includes 16/18 genotyping in the primary result (rather than a second test) may be more cost efficient.
