Would young women attending sexually transmitted disease clinics benefit from human papillomavirus vaccination? An assessment of human papillomavirus DNA and seropositivity from human papillomavirus sentinel surveillance, 2003-2005. There are limited data on the proportion who have been exposed to vaccine-type human papillomavirus (HPV) among women attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics this information could inform the potential benefits of HPV vaccination for women attending this venue.Human papillomavirus surveillance was conducted in STD clinics in Baltimore, MD Boston, MAOne hundred seventy women (19.3%) had HPV 16, 18, 6, or 11 DNA, and 418 (47.5%) were HPV 16, 18, 6, or 11 seropositive. Four hundred ten (46.6%) women were naïve to all 4 types, 570 (64.8%) were naïve to both HPV 16 and 18, and 545 (61.9%) were naïve to both HPV 6 and 11. Almost all (99.3%) women were naïve to at least 1 vaccine HPV type.Almost half of young women age eligible for HPV vaccine and attending STD clinics were naïve to all 4 HPV types, and more than half were naïve to both HPV 16 and 18. This assessment suggests that most young women attending this venue might benefit from HPV vaccination.
