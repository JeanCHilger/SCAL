Validity and reliability of using a self-lavaging device for cytology and HPV testing for cervical cancer screening: findings from a pilot study. Self-sampling could increase cervical cancer screening uptake. While methods have been identified for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, to date, self-sampling has not provided adequate specimens for cytology. We piloted the validity and reliability of using a self-lavaging device for cervical cytology and HPV testing. We enrolled 198 women in New York City in 2008-2009 from three ambulatory clinics where they received cervical cancer screening. All were asked to use the Delphi Screenerâ„¢ to self-lavage 1-3 months after clinician-collected index cytological smear (100 normal 98 abnormal). Women with abnormal cytology results from either specimen underwent colposcopyClinicalTrials.gov NCT00702208.
