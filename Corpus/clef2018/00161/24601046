Correlation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with expressions of p16 and Ki67 in exfoliated cervical cells in fluid-based thin-layer samples. To understand the correlation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with the expressions of p16 and Ki67 in exfoliated cervical cells obtained by fluid-based thin-layer technology.The distributions ofpl6 and Ki67 positive cells in 116 patients with cytologically diagnosed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or human papilloma virus (HPV) positive were examined by immunocytochemistry. Data were analyzed by the rank sum test, crosstab test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.When the thresholds for p16 and Ki67 positive were set as 6.5 and 4.5 positive cells per 100 exfoliated cervical cells, respectively, the expressions of Ki67 and P16 are significantly higher in the exfoliated cervical cells of patients with CIN II or greater compared with those in patients with CIN I or less.Immunocytochemical examination of p16 and Ki67 expressions in the exfoliated cervical cells of fluid-based thin-layer samples could be used for the detection of CIN II or greater.
