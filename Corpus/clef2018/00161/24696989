A pilot study on detection and genotyping of humanpapilloma virus isolated from clinically diagnosed Ethiopian women having cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Human Papilloma virus associated cervical cancers are more prevalent in developing countries compared to developed countries. Cervical cancer is reported as the most frequent malignancy among women visiting hospitals in Ethiopia. This study is a pilot study designed to examine the prevalence and genotypes of HPV in twenty Ethiopian women, clinically diagnosed to have cervical neoplasia, while visiting gynecology unit of a tertiary level referral hospital in Addis Ababa. The objective of this study was to detect the presence of HPV L1 gene and respective genotypes among women clinically diagnosed with different grades of cervical neoplasia.A total of 20 fresh biopsy samples were collected from clinically diagnosed cases, DNA extracted and further amplified using PCR for HPV L1 and beta globin genes. The PCR amplicons were denatured and allowed for hybridization onto a nitrocellulose strip containing the type-specific probes for 27 HPV genotypes representing both high and low risk groups as well as beta globin genes. Socio-demographic characteristics and clinical findings of the participants were recorded on structured questionnaires.Amplification of HPV L1 gene by PCR detected 17 cases out of 20. Based on reverse line blot hybridization assay, the most frequent genotype identified was HPV16 (13/20). Mixed infection of HPV 16 with HPV 33, HPV 35, HPV 45 and HPV 58 was detected from other four study participants.Human papilloma virus type 16 was the most prevalent genotype identified from the subjects screened. Further investigation with statistically sound sample size would help to clearly visualize the existing trend in Ethiopia regarding factors for high risk HPV positivity and multiple gravidity, young age at first coitus and cervical neoplasia.
