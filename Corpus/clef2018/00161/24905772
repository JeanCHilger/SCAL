Accuracy of dry vaginal self-sampling for detecting high-risk human papillomavirus infection in cervical cancer screening: a cross-sectional study. Cervical cancer screening coverage remains insufficient in most countries. Testing self-collected samples for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) could be an alternative to the Pap smear, but costs, sampling methods and transport issues hamper its wide use. Our objective was to compare diagnostic accuracy of 2 vaginal self-collection methods, a dry swab (vsc-DRY) or swab in liquid medium (vsc-LIQ), for detecting HR-HPV cervical infection assessed by a cervical clinician-collected sample in liquid medium (ccc-LIQ).Women 20 to 65 years attending a Pap smear were recruited between September, 2009 and March, 2011. Each sample (3 per woman) underwent HPV DNA testing. Samples were classified as HR-HPV+ with detection of at least one HR-HPV or probable HR-HPV type.Of 734 women included, 722 had complete HPV data. HR-HPV was detected in 20.9% of ccc-LIQ samples. Estimated sensitivity and specificity to detect HR-HPV in vsc-DRY samples were 88.7% and 92.5%, respectively, and in vsc-LIQ samples, 87.4% and 90.9%. Cytology findings were abnormal for 79 women (10.9%): among 27 samples of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 25 were HR-HPV+ in vsc-DRY, vsc-LIQ and ccc-LIQ samples. Among 6 samples of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, all were HR-HPV+ in vsc-DRY samples, 1 was HR-HPV- in vsc-LIQ samples and 1 was HR-HPV- in ccc-LIQ samples.Vaginal self-sampling with a dry swab is accurate to detect HR-HPV infection as compared with cervical clinician-collection and accurate as compared with cytology results. This cheap and easy-to-ship sampling method could be widely used in a cervical cancer screening program.
