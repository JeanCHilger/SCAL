Prevention and screening of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer may be prevented by human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and the treatment of intraepithelial lesions diagnosed using cervical pap smears. HPV vaccines are effective for the prevention of CIN2/3 related to HPV 16, 18 and some other oncogenic HPV subtypes in HPV-na√Øve women. They are very well tolerated and to date, no increase in the incidence of auto-immune diseases has been reported. HPV vaccines primarily target girls aged 11-14 years old and catch-up programs include girls aged 15-19 years old. Vaccination coverage is below 40% in France, which is insufficient to induce herd immunity. Screening via pap smears is performed every three years in women between 25 and 65 years old, after two normal annual smears. However, screening is an individualised decision and is only performed in 57% of women. Abnormal smears require subsequent diagnostic investigations. Apart from high grade intra-epithelial lesions which generally require treatment, these abnormalities may be observed as they often undergo spontaneous regression due to viral clearance.
