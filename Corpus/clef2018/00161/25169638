Clinical value of human papillomavirus genotyping testing in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. To Investigate the value of HPV genotyping in diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).From July 2012 to February 2013, 200 women from Tianjin Medical University General Hospital and 244 women from Affiliated Hospital of the Chinese People's Armed Forces Logistics College were selected to be HPV genotyping test and thin liqid-based cytology test. Consequently, 132 samples were performed colposcopy test and cervical biopsy.HPV prevalence was 26.4% (117/444) in this study. The infection of one type HPV was more common. The top 5 of HPV types were HPV16, 58, 33, 18, and 52. The top 5 of the risk for CIN II and above followed HPV16, 33, 39, 52 and 18. There was no significant difference between age and HPV positive rate (χ² = 0.948, P > 0.05). Multiple infection and cervical lesions rank correlation analysis (r = 0.132, P > 0.05). For CIN II and above disease, cytology positive rate was 90% (44/49), and HPV positive rate was 96% (47/49)cytology combine HPV positive rate was 98% (48/49, χ² = 0.063, P > 0.05).HPV infection should increasing trends with age. Cytology test and HPV genotyping test had good consistency. The combination of them can improve the sensitivity for high-grade lesions.
