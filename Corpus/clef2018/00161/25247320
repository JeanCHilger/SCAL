Vaginal self-sampling is a cost-effective way to increase participation in a cervical cancer screening programme: a randomised trial. Cervical cancer screening coverage remains insufficient in most countries. Our objective was to assess whether in-home vaginal self-sampling with a dry swab for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing is effective and cost-effective in increasing participation in cervical cancer screening.In March 2012, 6000 unscreened women aged 30-65 years, living in a French region covered by a screening programme, who had not responded to an initial invitation to have a Pap smear were equally randomised to three groups: 'no intervention' 'recall', women received a letter to have a Pap smearParticipation was higher in the 'self-sampling' than in the 'no intervention' group (22.5% vs 9.9%, P<0.0001 OR 2.64) and 'recall' group (11.7%, P<0.0001Offering an in-home, return-mail kit for vaginal self-sampling with a dry swab is more effective and cost-effective than a recall letter in increasing participation in cervical cancer screening.
