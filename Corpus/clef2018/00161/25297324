Clinical validation of the Cervista HPV HR test according to the international guidelines for human papillomavirus test requirements for cervical cancer screening. This study demonstrates that both the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Cervista HPV HR test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) detection are not inferior to those of the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test. The intra- and interlaboratory reproducibilities of Cervista were 92.0% (kappa, 0.83) and 90.4% (kappa, 0.80), respectively. The Cervista HPV HR test fulfills all the international HPV test requirements for cervical primary screening purposes.
