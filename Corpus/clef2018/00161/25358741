Feasibility of Cervical Cancer Screening Utilizing Self-sample Human Papillomavirus Testing Among Mexican Immigrant Women in Harris County, Texas: A Pilot Study. Here we evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of self-sample human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (self-HPV) among a sample of predominantly Mexican immigrant women who never or sporadically attend for Pap testing. Immigrant women who had not had a Pap test in the past 3 years (n = 100) were recruited. Participants self-collected a cervical sample for HPV testing. High-risk (HR) HPV-positive women were referred for clinical follow-up. Acceptability of self-HPV was high, with 99% reporting that they would be willing to use self-HPV regularly. Nineteen women (19%) tested positive for HR-HPV. Of these, 50% obtained clinical follow-up within 3 months. For those who did not, the primary barrier to follow-up was difficulty obtaining healthcare coverage. In conclusion, self-HPV is highly acceptable to Mexican immigrant women who otherwise do not attend for Pap testing. While the approach addresses critical barriers to primary screening, questions remain as to whether uninsured HR-HPV positive women are able to attend for clinical follow-up.
