Prevalence and type distribution of human papillomavirus among women older than 18 years in Egypt: a multicenter, observational study. Persistent infection with high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with premalignant lesions and cervical cancer, the third most common cancer amongst women globally and the second most frequent in Egypt. We studied the prevalence and type distribution of HPV and documented HPV infection awareness and health-related behaviours for HPV infection.This was a multicenter, hospital-based observational study of women ≥18 years of age who attended for a gynaecological examination during October 2010-August 2011. Cervical samples were tested using Linear Array HPV genotyping. Two questionnaires on awareness and health-related behaviour were completed.Four hundred and forty-three women with a mean age of 39.3±14.0 years were included in the analysis. HPV DNA was detected in 10.4% of women a single HPV-type infection was found in 6.5% and multiple infections in 3.8%. The most prevalent HR types among HPV-positive women were HPV-16 (19.6%) and HPV-31 and HPV-51 (15.2% each)The overall prevalence of HPV in Egypt was 10.4% and was highest (9.2%) amongst women aged 45-54 years. These data provide important reference information for public health authorities considering HPV prevention in Egypt.
