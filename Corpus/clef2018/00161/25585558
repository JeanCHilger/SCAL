The importance of screening in oncogynecology. Cervical cancer can be greatly prevented by the active search for precancerous lesions, by the effective screening. The DNA detection of high-risk human papillomavirus seems to be suitable primary screening tool, more effective than smear for cervical cytology. Organised mass screening for endometrial cancer is not held. The reason is very low prevalence of atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma in asymptomatic women and relatively low mortality rate, which is not influenced by the detection in asymptomatic stage. It is advisible to instruct all women to seek the gynecologist immediately in case of abnormal uterine bleeding and to emphasize the health education in population. Optimal protocol of the screening for hereditary endometrial malignities is debated currently. There is no effective screening for ovarian cancer in general population. Firstly, the global prevalence of the disease is low. Secondly, there is no screening modality to detect precursor lesions of the majority of malignant ovarian tumors (type II). Different strategies are tested as screening for hereditary ovarian cancer, but they cannot alternate profylactic surgery (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy).
