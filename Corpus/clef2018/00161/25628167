What should be the goal for future development of colposcopy? Cons and pros of sensitivity and specificity. To discuss what features of colposcopy should be developed for the future in different settings.There are cons and pros of aiming sensitivity, negative predictive value and specificity and positive predictive value. In case of diagnosis and intervention, methods increasing the specificity and positive predictive value will help to decrease unnecessary interventions. Besides, HPV test is highly sensitive and has a good negative predictive value. It is usually available before colposcopy.Colposcopy can be used in a screening or diagnostic/interventional scenario. Aims to improve sensitivity or specificity may change according to the aim of colposcopy. However, in the presence of highly sensitive tests which are performed before colposcopy, first goal to improve for colposcopy can be specificity and positive predictive value.
