Small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung do not harbor high-risk human papillomavirus. High-risk subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV) are known to drive the pathogenesis of cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Recent reports have shown that HPV is also associated with small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix and oropharynx. Little is known about HPV as a driver of neuroendocrine tumors at other sites, in particular, small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The aim of this study was to evaluate SCLC for the presence of high-risk HPV to further elucidate the role of HPV in SCLC. Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical resection specimens from 20 primary SCLC from 19 patients were identified from 2004 to 2013. Two cervical small cell carcinomas were included as controls. Small cell neuroendocrine phenotype was confirmed by review of morphology and prior immunohistochemistry staining. Immunohistochemistry for p16 (INK4a) expression was performed in all cases. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens and run on the Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping test and a real-time polymerase chain reaction HPV assay. Pathologic tumor stage was collected from surgical pathology reports. High-risk HPV genotypes were not detected in any of the 20 SCLC specimens, whereas p16 was up-regulated in 14 (70%) of 20. p16 up-regulation can be used as an indicator of disruption of the Rb pathway either by integration of the HPV E7 oncoprotein or other mechanisms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that, unlike some other small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, the pathogenesis of SCLC does not appear to be associated with high-risk HPV infection, a potentially very useful characteristic when determining primary from metastatic tumors.
