Comparing triage algorithms using HPV DNA genotyping, HPV E7 mRNA detection and cytology in high-risk HPV DNA-positive women. High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) DNA positive women require triage testing to identify those with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer (≥CIN2).Comparing three triage algorithms (1) E7 mRNA testing following HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 genotyping (E7 mRNA test), (2) HPV16/18 DNA genotyping and (3) cytology, for ≥CIN2 detection in hrHPV DNA-positive women.hrHPV DNA-positive women aged 18-63 years visiting gynecology outpatient clinics were included in a prospective observational cohort study. From these women a cervical scrape and colposcopy-directed biopsies were obtained. Cervical scrapes were evaluated by cytology, HPV DNA genotyping by bead-based multiplex genotyping of GP5+6+-PCR-products, and presence of HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 E7 mRNA using nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) in DNA positive women for respective HPV types. Sensitivities and specificities for ≥CIN2 were compared between E7 mRNA test and HPV16/18 DNA genotyping in the total group (n=348), and E7 mRNA test and cytology in a subgroup of women referred for non-cervix-related gynecological complaints (n=133).Sensitivity for ≥CIN2 of the E7 mRNA test was slightly higher than that of HPV16/18 DNA genotyping (66.9% versus 60.9% ratio 1.10, 95% CI: 1.0002-1.21), at similar specificity (54.8% versus 52.3%For detection of ≥CIN2 in hrHPV DNA-positive women, an algorithm including E7 mRNA testing following HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 DNA genotyping performs similar to HPV16/18 DNA genotyping or cytology.
