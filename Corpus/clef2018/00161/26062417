Over-expression of cannabinoid receptor 2 induces the apoptosis of cervical carcinoma Caski cells. To construct a eukaryotic expression vector containing human cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R) gene and investigate its expression, location and the influence on the apoptosis of cervical cancer Caski cells.The eukaryotic expression vector GV230-hCB2R was constructed and identified by double enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing analysis. Then it was transfected into HEK293 cells and Caski cells by Lipofectamine(TM) 2000. The expression and cellular localization of hCB2R protein were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescent cytochemistry combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy, the apoptosis rate was tested by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expressions of hCB2R, Bcl-2, Bax and Bad were examined by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively.The gene fragment of 1128 bp was obtained by double enzyme digestion, it had 99% homology with human hCB2R gene nucleic acid sequence reported (NM_001841.2). After transfected into HEK293 cells, hCB2R protein, with the relative molecular mass (Mr) being 40 000, was expressed in both cytoplasm and cellular membrane. The over-expression of hCB2R promoted apoptosis of Caski cells via up-regulating the Bax, Bad expressions and down-regulating the Bcl-2 expression.The up-regulated expression of hCB2R could induce cell apoptosis by enhancing the expressions of Bax, Bad and suppressing the expression of Bcl-2 in Caski cells.
