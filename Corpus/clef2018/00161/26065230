Involved LEEP excision margins as predictor of residual/recurrent disease in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in a low-resource setting. To describe the accuracy of the diagnosis of involved excision margins after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) in a low-resource setting.Cross-sectional study of 176 LEEPs indicated for a cytological report of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL). A total of 72 HIV-positive and 104 HIV-negative women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) ≥ 2 on their LEEP histology report with involved excision margins were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent either a repeat LEEP or a hysterectomy. The specimens were evaluated for residual/recurrent CIN ≥ 2 or less.Persistent/recurrent CIN ≥ 2 was diagnosed in 139 (79.4%) instances and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma in 6 (3.4%). Thirty (17.2%) showed CIN1. The persistence/recurrence rate was 72.2% and 88.5% in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, respectively (χ2 = 7.5, p = 0.006).In > 80% the diagnosis of involved excision margins was confirmed, a positive predictive value of 82.4%. In the absence of more accurate follow-up methods such as HPV testing or co-testing with cytology, a correct diagnosis of margin status, especially when involved, is an important guide to further management and follow-up.
