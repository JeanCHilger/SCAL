Which Colposcopies Should Include Endocervical Curettage? Although endocervical curettage (ECC) is often performed at colposcopy, it remains unclear whether it should be done in all women, only women over a certain age, only women with unsatisfactory colposcopy, or only in women with normal colposcopic impressions. To clarify the indications for ECC, we determined the proportion of colposcopies with CIN 3, or cancer (CIN 3+) detected only by ECC showing CIN 2, CIN 3, or cancer (CIN 2+).Review of electronic medical records from colposcopy clinics.Between March 1, 1996, and April 23, 2013, approximately 18,537 cervical colposcopies with no missing results evaluated women with abnormal cervical cytology and/or positive high-risk human papillomavirus tests. In 7.5% (1,398/18,537) of colposcopies, the final diagnosis, based on the worst biopsy from cervix ECCEndocervical curettage should be performed at colposcopy in women age 25 and older.
