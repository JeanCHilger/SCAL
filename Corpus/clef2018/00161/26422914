Rate of human papillomavirus infection in rural areas diagnosed by direct visualization with acetic acid and lugol. Infection by HPV is a major global health problem and the main risk factor for cervical cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Simple diagnostic methods, such as visual inspection with the naked eye of the cervix with acetic acid application 5% (VAT) or solution of iodine (tincture of iodine) are simple to detect early lesions, sensitivity varies from 87 to 99% and specificity varies from 23 to 87%.To find the proportion of infection by human papillomavirus in a population of extreme poverty.Linear, observational and descriptive pilot study was done in patients of marginalized communities in extreme poverty in Chiapas (Mexico), from 1 to 30 November 2013. The existence of acetowhite lesions suggestive of virus was verified human papillomavirus, and medical history of all patients was formed for the incidence of risk factors.214 women with age limits of 19 and 78 years, median age of 37 years were studied. Of the total, 66 (31%) had acetowhite lesions consistent with human papillomavirus at the time of the study.Marginalized populations have a higher risk of infection with human papillomavirus, consequently high rate of progression to cervical cancer due to sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors and lack of resources in health. Diagnostic tests like the simple display with acetic acid are ideal for people such as this.
