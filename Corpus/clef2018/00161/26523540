Invasive Stratified Mucin-producing Carcinoma and Stratified Mucin-producing Intraepithelial Lesion (SMILE): 15 Cases Presenting a Spectrum of Cervical Neoplasia With Description of a Distinctive Variant of Invasive Adenocarcinoma. Stratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE) is a cervical intraepithelial lesion, distinct from conventional squamous or glandular counterparts, believed to arise from embryonic cells at the transformation zone by transdifferentiation during high-risk HPV-associated carcinogenesis. It is characterized by stratified, immature epithelial cells displaying varying quantities of intracytoplasmic mucin throughout the majority of the lesional epithelium. We identified a distinct form of invasive cervical carcinoma with morphologic features identical to those in SMILE, which we have termed "invasive stratified mucin-producing carcinoma." Fifteen cases from 15 patients (mean 36 y range, 22 to 64 y) were retrieved from the pathology archives of multiple institutions with a diagnosis of either SMILE or invasive cervical carcinoma with a description or comment about the invasive tumor's resemblance to SMILE. Seven cases had solely intraepithelial disease with a component of SMILE (mean 29 y
