A seroepidemiologic study of HPV infection and incident cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. The seroepidemiology of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) and incident cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) was studied in subjects selected from a large cohort monitored for the development of SIL. Serum IgG and IgA responses to 10 epitopes derived from HPV were measured in 21 incident cases of SIL and 56 matched controls. Cases showed elevated antibody (i.e., IgG and/or IgA) seroprevalence to 245:16, a peptide antigen derived from the E2 open reading frame of HPV 16 (OR = 5.76 95% CI: 1.24, 26.81). The type of HPV DNA detected in cervical lavage specimens had no effect on this relationship. Multivariate analysis also showed that IgG to 245:6, an analogous peptide derived from HPV 6, was negatively associated with SIL (OR = 0.12
