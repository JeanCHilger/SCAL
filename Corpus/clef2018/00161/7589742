Clinical application of HPV typing in cervical cancer. Certain human papaillomavirus (HPV) types are major risk factors for the development of cervical neoplasia. The value of HPV DNA testing in the management of patients with disease and in population screening is a subject of controversy. Since the introduction of molecular biology into the HPV field, there have been rapid advances and improvements in HPV diagnosis. The various molecular diagnostic methods for detection of HPV DNA (dot blot hybridization, Southern blot hybridization, in situ hybridization, Hybrid Capture Test, and polymerase chain reaction PCR) could be selected by taking into consideration some factors such as characteristics of sample, sensitivity of HPV test and expenses. The HPV DNA testing would be a clinically useful diagnostic method, when used in conjunction with the Pap smear in population screening or in conjunction with cytology and colposcopy to identify the women infected with high-risk HPVs or women who had equivocal cervical lesions. Despite the confusion, a multitude of reports demonstrate that HPV DNA testing has the clinical utility, and future investigations should be directed at more accurately delineating its role in human health care.
