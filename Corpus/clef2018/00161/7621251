Papillomaviruses as targets for cancer gene therapy. Gene therapy of human cancer is likely to be most effective when it is directed at targets that are expressed in cancer cells but are lacking from other cells. Human papillomaviruses can provide such targets, since these viruses are present in many cervical and oral cancers, and are likely to be etiological agents of the tumor. Continued expression of human papillomavirus genes is probably necessary for the growth of these cancers, and effective gene therapy could consist of antisense or ribozyme molecules directed against these genes. Some human papillomavirus gene products are antigenic, and immunotherapy based upon these antigens might prove clinically beneficial. Human papillomaviruses have specific promoters, are linked to toxin genes, the toxin may be selectively expressed by tumor cells where the virus genes are active. Thus, there are several approaches for the development of specific gene therapy for human cancers that contain human papillomaviruses.
