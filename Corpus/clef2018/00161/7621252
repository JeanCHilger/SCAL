Suppression of tumorigenesis by transcription units expressing the antisense E6 and E7 messenger RNA (mRNA) for the transforming proteins of the human papilloma virus and the sense mRNA for the retinoblastoma gene in cervical carcinoma cells. Human cervical carcinoma cell lines that harbor human papilloma virus (HPV) have been reported to express HPV E6 and E7 proteins at least in the beginning stages if not at all stages of the disease. The HPV E6 and E7 proteins bind to and inactivate the products of the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor genes, which thereby allow the cervical carcinoma cells to circumvent the action of these tumor suppressor genes. We observed that the introduction of the antisense HPV 18 E6 and E7 sequences, as well as a sense cDNA for the human wild-type Rb gene into a human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), which is positive for the HPV 18 provirus, decreased the in vitro and in vivo growth rate of the transfected cells if both antisense transcripts for the HPV 18 E6 and E7 and sense transcripts for human Rb were expressed. In addition, overexpression of a complementary DNA (cDNA) for the Rb messenger RNA was sufficient to slow the proliferation of HeLa cells, and the level of Rb cDNA expression was correlated with the degree to which the rate of growth of the tumor was slowed. The results of our experiments show that the presence of HPV E6 and E7 proteins and the resultant inactivation of Rb in cervical carcinoma cells contributes to the neoplastic phenotype even in highly evolved cervical carcinoma cell lines such as HeLa, which have been derived from a cervical carcinoma patient at an advanced stage of the disease process. These data suggest that the HPV proteins play a role not only at the beginning of cervical cancer, but also at advanced stages of this disease. These experiments may lead to genetic approaches to the control of this disease that involve antisense sequences that downregulate the E6 and E7 genes or lead to expression of the Rb gene.
