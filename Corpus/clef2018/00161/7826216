Detection of DNA and E7 transcripts of human papillomavirus types 16, 18, 31 and 33, TGF beta and GM-CSF transcripts in cervical cancers and precancers. The association of human papillomavirus (HPV) with a high proportion of cervical cancers should allow the efficiency of cytological screening methods to be improved. We report here that quantitative detection of HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33 DNA and the corresponding E7 transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be of value in identifying precancers and cancers. In clinical specimens with major cervical lesions, the level of E7 transcription does not appear to be related to concomitant transcription of either transformation growth factor-beta (TGF beta) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes.
