Management of the abnormal Papanicolaou smear. Screening for cervical neoplasia has been effective in decreasing invasive cervical cancer. As the understanding of the association of HPV with cervical neoplasia increases, new screening interventions may be developed. Classification of cytologic abnormalities and the management of abnormal smears continue to evolve. Ancillary screening techniques such as HPV typing and cervicography may be useful but need further study.
