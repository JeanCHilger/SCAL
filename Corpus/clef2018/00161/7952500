Polymerase chain reaction-assisted papillomavirus detection in cervicovaginal smears: stratification by clinical risk and cytology reports. Seven hundred and twelve patients from cancer screening, pregnancy care, outpatient clinics for patients at risk for cervical dysplasia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were tested simultaneously for cytological aberrations and human papillomavirus (HPV). Classification of these cases, and of all cytology records throughout 1991 and 1992 was performed according to the "Münchner Nomenklatur" and the Bethesda classification. HPV-directed polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out with general primers, patients at risk for cervical dysplasia were tested by subsequent hybridization with HPV 16 and 18 probes. Patients from cancer screening and pregnancy care showed similar HPV prevalences ranging between 19.4%-24.6%. In contrast, patients from dysplasia and HIV units were infected in 56.2%-62.3% and 75.0%-76.9% respectively in centre of disease control stage III-IV, HPV detection rates in patients from dysplasia and HIV units increased gradually from 40.1%-52.9% in non-suspicious smears to 80.8%-100% in atypical smears. High risk HPV 16 and 18 infections were detected in 64% of smears with cytological evidence of HPV infection (koilocytosis) to 84.2% in severe dysplasia. Following the Bethesda guidelines, 2.9%-14.7% of all smears initially reported as Pap 2 K (suggestive of HPV infection) would be qualified as risk lesions (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), although they tested HPV negative in more than a third of cases. Thus, when using the Bethesda system, HPV analysis is needed to prevent overclassification and overtreatment. The "Münchner Nomenklatur" avoids this dilemma by not mixing morphological statements on infection, atypia and cancer risk.
