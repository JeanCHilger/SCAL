Current conservative surgery in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. 5 years (1989-1993) experience of cervical conization including 57 cases, has been reviewed. The mean follow-up was 33 (6-60) months. Mean age was 34.6 (range 21-57) years. Mean height and diameter of the cones were 2.5 +/- 0.3 cm and 1.5 +/- 0.4 cm, respectively. In 55 cases there were free margins of the cones. Cytological diagnosis was CIN I for 8 patients, CIN II for 21 patients, CIN III for 22 patients, CIN+HPV for 6 patients. In 40 of the 57 patients suspected of having a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on cytology and on colposcopy, the histology was confirmative. Bleeding (the most common pre and postoperative complication) was observed in 6 cases (11.7%). In three patients a new conization was necessary and in the other two patients hysterectomy was necessary. No significant differences were noted in the pregnancy outcome following either treatment in five patients.
