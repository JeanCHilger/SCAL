Cigarette smoking and other risk factors for cervical dysplasia in southwestern Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women. To assess smoking-related and other risk factors for high-grade cervical dysplasia in southwestern Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women in New Mexico, we conducted a clinic-based case-control study among attendees at university-affiliated gynecology clinics.

In contrast, former smoking was not associated with cervical dysplasia (odds ratio 0.9
