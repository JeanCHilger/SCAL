Comparison of cytology and cervicography in screening a high risk Australian population for cervical human papillomavirus and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Two different screening methods, the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and cervigram were compared in screening 245 Sydney women over a 6-month period in 1988 at a city sexually transmitted diseases (STD) centre, for cervical human papillomavirus (HPV), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. The Pap smear through the identification of cytologically abnormal cells correctly detected 54% of cases of histologically proven CIN and 39.2% of cases of HPV. The cervigram through the identification of acetowhite epithelium and/or abnormal vessels on the cervix correctly detected 64% of cases of histologically proven CIN and 70.6% of cases of HPV. However, when both tests were used together, 92% of CIN lesions and 82.4% of HPV lesions were correctly identified. Histology of a colposcopically directed biopsy was used as the 'gold standard'. The sensitivity and specificity of the Pap smear after correction for verification bias was 46% and 78% respectively, and for the cervigram was 49% and 60% respectively. Hence neither screening test appears adequate on its own, at least in an STD population.
