Detection and typing of human papillomavirus DNA in the uterine cervix of Japanese women by nonradioactive dot blot and Southern blot hybridization. HPV infection was examined with Cytobrush in exfoliated cervical cells sampled from 347 women. HPV DNA analysis was conducted in two steps. The presence of HPV DNA was demonstrated by dot blotting and typing of HPV DNA was made by Southern blotting using biotinylated probes. Of 167 cases with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma, HPV DNA was detected and typed in 25 cases (15.0%). HPV 16, 18, and 33 were found mainly, and no HPV 6 or 11 was detected. The frequency of HPV DNA was 7.1% of CIN I, 28.6% of CIN II, 54.5% of CIN III, and 50.0% of invasive carcinoma. HPV occurred in patients newly diagnosed as CIN at 25.8% and in those of diagnosed as CIN in the past and followed up, 7.6%. Of 180 healthy women, the screening test of FO8830 was positive for HPV DNA in four women (2.2%). The present system proved to be useful for facilitating large-scale clinical research.
