Comparison between colposcopic, cytologic, and histologic findings in women positive and negative for human papillomavirus DNA. Little is known about the role of detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in exfoliated cells of the cervix in aiding the colposcopic diagnosis of cervical lesions. The purpose of our study was to compare the colposcopic findings of young women who were positive and negative for HPV DNA. Eighty-four women aged 13-22 years attending family planning clinics were examined colposcopically with the aide of acetic acid and Lugol's solution and without knowledge of HPV DNA status. Lesions identified were given scores based on the severity of observed colposcopic changes. Samples for cytology and HPV DNA testing, which included types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35, were obtained at the time of the examination. Biopsies were performed on women with significant lesions identified on examination or with cytology suggestive of neoplasia. Students t-test and chi 2 analysis were performed to compare colposcopic variables and HPV DNA type. Of the 84 women examined, 17 were positive for HPV DNA 9 had type 16/18. The average length of sexual activity was 2.7 years. Women with HPV 16/18 had a mean of 1.7 lesions visible at colposcopy compared to 0.7 lesions visible in those negative for HPV 16/18 (this included HPV DNA negative women and women positive for HPV types 6, 11, 31, 33, and 35) (p < 0.001). Women who were positive for HPV 16/18 also had higher lesional scores than the HPV 16/18-negative group (3.4 versus 1.0, respectively, p < 0.001). All four women who had dysplasia either on cytology or histology were positive for type 16/18.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
