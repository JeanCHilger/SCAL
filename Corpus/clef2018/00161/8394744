Cellular and molecular alterations in human epithelial cells transformed by recombinant human papillomavirus DNA. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) contribute to the development of benign and malignant cervical cancer however, the exact role of papillomaviruses in the multistage carcinogenesis process is unclear. The development of HPV-immortalized cervical and foreskin cell lines represents a useful model for studying the role of HPVs in cervical cancer. Studies with these cells show that HPV genes regulate epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Transfection of HPV types associated with invasive cervical cancer results in immortalization of human epithelial cells, whereas HPVs not associated with cancer are ineffective. The combination of E6 and E7 genes, which are normally retained and expressed in cervical carcinomas, is sufficient for immortalization
