Polymerase chain reaction analysis of human papillomavirus in archival cervical cytologic smears. We used a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in stained, archival cervical cytologic smears, where MY09/MY11 served as outer primers and GP5/GP6 as inner primers. It was found to give a higher positivity rate than PCR using the E1 degenerate consensus primers, where the sensitivity was decreased to 80%. It seemed optimal to use less sample DNA (0.5%) for the reaction larger volumes resulted in decreased reactivity. Similarly, the presence of bovine serum albumin helped to improve the reactivity. The risk of cross-contamination did not seem to be a major obstacle to a valid analysis. The prevalence of HPV in normal smears was 10%, and in the high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion group it was 80%. Smears with cytologic evidence of HPV gave 100% positivity, while those containing cancer cells gave 80%. In patients whose Southern blot had demonstrated the presence of HPV, 87% of the simultaneously taken smears were also positive with nested PCR. Similarly, in those whose Southern blot analysis was negative, the corresponding smear was positive in 41%
