Endocervical cell retrieval following excisional treatment of CIN: a comparison study between large loop excision of the transformation zone and laser cone excision. The purpose of our study was to compare laser cone excision with large loop excision of the transformation zone with particular respect to the retrieval of endocervical cells on follow-up cervical cytology.Retrospective analysis of case records of 368 women who had large loop excision of the transformation zone and 188 women who had laser cone excision for suspected CIN changes at Middlemore Hospital, Auckland.The retrieval of endocervical cells on cervical cytology following large loop excision was 94.7% and 85.2% following laser cone excision. Laser cone excision was associated with a higher chance of normal follow-up cervical cytology.The retrieval of endocervical cells was satisfactory following both large loop excision and laser cone excision. Laser cone excision is recommended with large or more severe lesions.
