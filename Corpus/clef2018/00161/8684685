Association of interleukin 2 and interferon alpha in the management of cervical condylomatosis. At present the therapy of cervical condylomatosis is based on the use of interferon because the HPV types responsable for condyloma inhibit the immunitary system. But many A. studying the effects of IFN have found that at high concentration it has an immunosuppressive action. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if interleukin-2 associated with IFN is useful in avoiding this negative effect by improving the efficacy of cervical condylomatosis therapy. We treated 25 women suffering from cervical condyloma with increasing doses of IL-2 injected intralesionally and associated with natural alpha-IFN injected intramuscularly. The duration of the whole therapy was six weeks. We evaluated the percentage of inflammatory cells in peripheral blood before and after treatment. The per-cent number of lymphocytes, eosinophils and lymphoblasts was increased by 27%, 88% and 40%, respectively. The clinical response to the therapy was total in 14 cases, partial in 9 cases and unsuccessful in 2 cases. These data suggested that combination therapy with interleukin-2 and alpha-IFN for the treatment of patients with cervix condylomatous is successful.
