Preliminary study on low-trait genital infection and cervical epithelial dysplasia in women from the Parakan채 tribe of South America. We evaluated the occurrence of low-trait genital infection and cervical epithelial dysplasia in women from a South-american indian tribe in the Brazilian Amazonia.Cross-sectional study of women older than 10 years from two indian settlements of the Parakan찾 tribe: Paranatinga and Maroxewara. Demographic data and information about sexual behavior as well as obstetric/gynaecological history were recorded. Two gynecologists examined 80 patients (89.9%), and collected vaginal and cervical specimens of 69 indians for further laboratory analysis, by Gram stain and Papanicolaou method. Fourteen (20.3%) women resulted to be pregnant.Parakan찾 women begin sexual activity early, after menarche they have multiple sexual partnersNear all women had some grade of cervical disease. Measure HPV-infection prevalence among Parakan찾 indians with adequate methods may improve our understanding about worldwide occurrence of HPV infections. Established risk factors for cancer of the cervix and sexually transmitted diseases were common in this tribe.
