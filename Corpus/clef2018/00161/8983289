Improved efficacy of chemotherapy by parvovirus-mediated sensitisation of human tumour cells. Increasing resistance of tumour cells towards the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic drugs is a major limitation in the treatment of cancer patients. The non-pathogenic human adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have been reported to sensitise HeLa cervical cancer cells to gamma irradiation in vivo and in vitro. To test whether these parvoviruses might render other human tumour cells more sensitive towards chemotherapeutic drugs, we analysed the effects of AAV type 2 (AAV-2) infection on established cancer cell lines and freshly explanted tumour biopsies treated with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. cisplatin). AAV-2 infection significantly increased the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic drugs compared with uninfected controls. AAV-2 infection without concomitant chemotherapeutic treatment had no significant effect on viability of the cells. In nude mice, combined application of AAV-2 infection and chemotherapeutic treatment significantly increased the therapeutic activity on tumours arising from subcutaneously injected tumour cells compared with tumours treated by chemotherapeutics only. These results indicate that AAV-2 infection sensitises human cancer cells towards the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic drugs.
