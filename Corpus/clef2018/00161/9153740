Factors associated with human papillomavirus infection detected by polymerase chain reaction among urban Canadian aboriginal and non-aboriginal women. To determine the prevalence and correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among women attending an ethnically mixed, predominantly low-income, inner-city primary care clinic.Cross-sectional survey (N = 1,477). Demographic, behavioral, and reproductive history data were collected by questionnaire. Cervical swabs were analyzed for gonorrhea and chlamydial infections, abnormal cytology, and HPV infection assessed by PCR followed by hybridization for types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35.Human papillomavirus was detected in 33% of specimens, with no significant difference between Aboriginal (AB) and non-Aboriginal women. Adjusting for AB status, HPV infection was associated with marital status, condom use, number of sexual partners (last year and lifetime), age at first sexual intercourse, a history of sexual abuse, and current abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. In multivariate analyses excluding abnormal Pap smear as an independent variable, marital status and the number of lifetime sexual partners were found to be significant independent predictors of HPV infection. Comparing individuals with 20+ lifetime sexual partners and those with 1 or fewer partners, the odds ratio (OR) for HPV infection was 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.17) among AB women and 1.54 among non-AB women (95% CI 1.36-1.73). The OR for infection with HPV types 6 and 11 was 1.39 (95% CI 1.22-1.58), whereas for the high oncogenic risk types of 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35, the OR was 1.82 (95% CI 1.65-2.01).No differences were found between AB and non-AB women in the detection of HPV DNA, despite the higher risk for cervical cancer and the prevalence of recognized behavioral and reproductive risk factors among AB women. This study also indicates that the association of sexual activity with HPV infection holds true for both high- and low-oncogenic HPV types.
