Cervical squamous cell carcinoma in situ with intraepithelial extension to the upper genital tract and invasion of tubes and ovaries: report of a case with human papilloma virus analysis. A 55-year-old woman, who was found to have malignant squamous cells on a routine cervical smear, underwent a conization biopsy, followed by hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. No gross tumor was present in the uterus, but both ovaries, which were of normal size, contained multiple cysts filled with light brown, soft material. Microscopic examination showed squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the cervix with contiguous spread to the endometrium, fallopian tubes, and ovaries squamous cell carcinoma extensively replaced the endometrial and tubal epithelium, focally invaded the wall of the fallopian tubes, and involved the parenchyma of both ovaries. Although an invasive cervical carcinoma occasionally spreads to the ovary, this case illustrates that exceptionally an in situ tumor spreads along the epithelium of the upper genital tract and the ovarian surface and invades the ovary and tubes. The detection of human papillomavirus DNA in the cervical, endometrial, tubal, and ovarian tumors by the polymerase chain reaction suggests a role for human papilloma virus infection in this case.
