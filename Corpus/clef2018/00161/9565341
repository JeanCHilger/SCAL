Organotypic culture of HPV-transformed keratinocytes: a model for testing lymphocyte infiltration of (pre)neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. The aim of our study was to establish the relevance of an in vitro model for analysing the ability of human lymphocytes to infiltrate human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (pre)neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. To mimic these lesions, we have used the organotypic raft culture of HPV-transformed keratinocytes (SiHa). The SiHa organotypic raft culture was co-cultured with resting or prestimulated (IL-2 or IL-2+anti-CD3 mAb) allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for 24 and 72 h. The majority of infiltrating cells were T lymphocytes. Occasional NK cells were also identified. The stimulation with IL-2+anti-CD3 mAb induced the highest number of infiltrating cells, with the maximum lymphocyte infiltration observed after 24 h of co-culture. The lymphocyte infiltration was associated with an increased number of apoptotic cells in the organotypic cultures. The ability of PBMC and purified T cell and NK cell populations to lyse HPV-transformed keratinocytes was also investigated on monolayer cultures. As expected in an allogenic model, the highest cytotoxicity was mediated by NK cells activated by IL-2 or IL-2+anti-CD3 mAb. The cytotoxic activity of T cells was weak but, interestingly, increased in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA), assuming that T cells were able to kill HPV-infected keratinocytes when a bridge between T cells and keratinocytes was provided. In conclusion, the organotypic culture of HPV-transformed keratinocytes may provide an effective in vitro model for investigating novel T cell-based immunotherapy protocols for the treatment of HPV-associated lesions.
