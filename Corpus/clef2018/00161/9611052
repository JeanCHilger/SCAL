Serologic profile of some sexually transmitted diseases in women with squamous intraepithelial lesions. The purpose of this study consisted of the evaluation of some sexually transmitted diseases in patients with cervical pathology, namely squamous intraepithelial lesions.a prospective study was performed. Patients with an abnormal cervical smear were submitted to colposcopy, directed biopsy and an immunologic assay for Chlamydia, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, Cytomegalovirus, Treponema pallidum, Hepatitis B and Human Immunodeficiency Virus I and II. The same parameters were evaluated in women with normal cervical cytology in a matched control group. A comparative study was performed evaluating some epidemiological parameters and the referred immunologic assays.118 patients were separated into four groups. Statistically significant differences were observed in the personal history of fungi infections, as well as Chlamydia and HSV 2 IgM.immunologic assays may prove useful in identifying sexually-transmitted diseases, especially Chlamydia and HSV 2 infections, in Human Papillomavirus infected women.
