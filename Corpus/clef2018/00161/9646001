Human papillomavirus detection in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by the second-generation hybrid capture microplate test, comparing two different cervical specimen collection methods. The second generation Hybrid Capture microplate-based human papillomavirus (HPV) test (HC II) was examined to determine its sensitivity for identification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) by two different cervical specimen collection methods.A cohort of 115 women with a mean age of 34.6 years (SD 9.1), referred to colposcopy with a history of abnormal cytology, was studied to compare HPV prevalence and viral load in low grade CIN vs. high grade CIN.Prior to the application of acetic acid, cervical specimens were obtained by either method 1 or 2, as follows: method 1: A cotton-tipped swab was applied to the ectocervix and endocervix for a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. Next, a special cone-shaped cervical brush was applied to the endocervix, the ectocervix, and to the posterior vaginal vault and suspended in 1.0 ml of transport medium for HPV testing. Method 2: a Pap smear was taken with a cyto standard cylindrical cytology brush from the endocervix, and ectocervix, and the remaining cells were suspended in 3 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for HPV testing. Next, a Dacron-tipped swab was used to take a specimen from the ectocervix and posterior fornix and suspended in the same PBS solution.
