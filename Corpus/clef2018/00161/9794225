Characterization of an HPV-negative cell line (FR-CAR) derived from a cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion. A new cell line, FR-car, has been established from a biopsy of a low-grade human cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). We confirmed the epithelial origin of the cells by keratin staining using polykeratin, AE1/AE3 and CAM 5.2 antibodies. Sixty percent to 80% of the cultured cells stained positive for proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67. There was no overexpression of p53. Karyotyping revealed that the cell line was hypodiploid with clonal abnormalities on chromosome 6 and 16. Sections of a biopsy adjacent to the lesion from which the culture was initiated tested positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) 18 DNA by the polymerase chain reaction, but cultured cells tested at several passages were HPV-negative by either type-specific or consensus PCRs. This HPV-negative SIL line may be useful in studies into the cell biology of dysplastic epithelium.
