Role of human papillomaviruses in the malignant transformation of keratinocytes. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are considered the main etiological agent of cervical cancer and of its precursory lesions (CIN). The HPV transformation potential consists in the presence of two oncogenes, E6 and E7, which inactivate the tumour-suppressor proteins p53 and pRB of the host cell, inducing uncontrolled transformation and proliferation mechanisms. These effects were demonstrated by in vitro experiments.
