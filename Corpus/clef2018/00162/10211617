Human papillomavirus (HPV) in high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) detected by morphology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-- a cytohistologic correlation of 277 cases treated by laser conization. The aims of this study were to evaluate the cytohistologic correlation in women treated for high-grade lesions of the cervix uteri (HG CIN), to assess the distribution of HPV features and finally to test the validity of the morphological criteria of HPV infection. The smears and biopsy specimens from 277 women treated for HG CIN by laser conization were re-evaluated blindly. Tissue blocks (n = 188) and 52 archival smears were examined for HPV DNA using PCR. HPV changes were detected with equal frequency in the smears and biopsy specimens by light microscopy 63% and 65%, respectively. The prevalence of HPV DNA in biopsies was 88% and in archival smears 85%
