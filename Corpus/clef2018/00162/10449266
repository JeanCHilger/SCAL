A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of cervicovaginal human papillomavirus. To compare intravaginal 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and placebo for the treatment of cervical and/or vaginal human papillomavirus (HPV).A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed. Women with HPV detected visually or by Papanicolaou (Pap) test and confirmed by colposcopic biopsy were randomized to receive either intravaginal 5-FU cream or an intravaginal placebo cream. Women with cervical or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia were excluded. The primary outcome measure was cytologic regression of HPV as determined by Pap test screening 4 to 6 months after treatment. The secondary outcome was cytologic evidence of disease progression at both the 4-6-month and 12-month follow-up evaluations. Data were analyzed using the Chi square test with significance established at P < 0.05.A total of forty patients were randomized, and thirty patients had a follow-up Pap test 4 to 6 months after treatment. Of those patients treated with 5-FU, 28% demonstrated regression of HPV on cytologic evaluation, compared with 69% of those treated with placebo (P < 0.05). Twelve-month follow-up cytology was available from 18 of the study participants. There were no significant differences in the frequency of cytologic progression or regression between groups at 12 months.Four to six months post treatment, the use of intravaginal 5-FU for the treatment of cervical or vaginal HPV is associated with a lower rate of regression than the use of placebo.
