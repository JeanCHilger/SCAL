Serum carotenoids and vitamins and risk of cervical dysplasia from a case-control study in Japan. The relationships between risk of cervical dysplasia and dietary and serum carotenoids and vitamins were investigated in a case-control study. Cases were 156 women who attended Papanicolaou test screening in nine institutes affiliated with Japan Study Group of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Cervical Cancer and had cervical dysplasia newly histologically confirmed. Age-matched controls were selected from women with normal cervical cytology attending the same clinic. Blood sample and cervical exfoliated cells were obtained for measuring serum retinol, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, zeaxanthin/lutein, cryptoxanthin, lycopene and alpha-tocopherol and for HPV detection. Higher serum level of alpha-carotene was significantly associated with decreased risk of cervical dysplasia after controlling for HPV infection and smoking status (odds ratio (OR) = 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.62 for the highest as compared with the lowest tertile). Decreased risk for the highest tertile of serum lycopene (OR = 0.28) was marginally significant. Decreased risks observed for the highest tertiles of beta-carotene (OR = 0.65) and zeaxanthin/lutein (OR = 0.53), were not statistically significant.
