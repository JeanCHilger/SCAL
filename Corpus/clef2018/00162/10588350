Prospective study of PAPNET: review of 25,656 Pap smears negative on manual screening and rapid rescreening. In this prospective study, 27,014 Pap smears were selected for PAPNET review on the request of the referring practitioner or patient. Smears that were negative on routine manual screening were submitted for rapid rescreening. Smears considered normal after these two manual screens (n = 25,656) were reviewed using the PAPNET testing system. Routine manual screening identified 1340 (4.96%) of the smears as abnormal, and a further 18 (0.07%) abnormalities were detected by rapid rescreening. PAPNET review identified an additional 102 (0.4%) abnormal smears, including 10 histologically confirmed high grade lesions. The use of PAPNET testing following routine manual screening and rapid rescreening in tandem, enables cytologists to detect additional diagnostically significant abnormalities and reduce the rate of false-negative smears.
