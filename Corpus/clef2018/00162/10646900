Detection of lymph node metastasis of oesophageal cancer by RT-nested PCR for SCC antigen gene mRNA. With recent development in molecular biology, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been applied to detect occult lymph node metastasis, but there have been few reports concerning oesophageal cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the usefulness of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen gene as a marker with RT-nested PCR to detect occult lymph node metastases of oesophageal cancer. The SCC antigen has been widely used as a serum tumour marker and was reported as a target gene to detect tumour cells in peripheral blood in cervical cancer. In this study, 620 lymph nodes from 14 oesophageal cancer patients were analysed. The results of RT-nested PCR were compared with that of pathological and immunohistochemical examinations. In the test of sensitivity, the RT-nested PCR detected 10(1) of SCC antigen producing cells in 10(7) peripheral blood mononucleocytes and was not found in 43 control lymph nodes. The pathological examination, immunohistochemical examination and the RT-nested PCR detected 36, 45 and 65 nodes respectively. The RT-nested PCR detected statistically more lymph nodes than the pathological or immunohistochemical examination. The sensitivity and specificity seem higher in squamous cell carcinoma cases. The SCC antigen gene is one of the more useful markers for RT-nested PCR to detect occult lymph node metastases of oesophageal cancer.
