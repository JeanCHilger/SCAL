The evaluation of computer cytological test with colposcopy for the diagnosis of cervical lesions. To assess the value of computer cytological test (CCT) with colposcopy for the diagnosis of early cervical diseases.3,016 cervical pap smears have been done in our hospital from March 15, 1995 to March 15, 1996. The CCT smears were analyzed first, then cytologist made the final reports, cervical biopsies under the guidance of colposcopy were taken in 56 cases with abnormal findings.We found 375 (12.4%) abnormal pap smears out of 3,016 cases, in which cervical squamous cancer 5 cases, endometrium adenocarcinoma 1 case. The low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection most frequently happened at the younger patients. There are 59 cases (2.0%) of LSIL, among which HPV infection accounted 79.7%. We use CCT for primary selection, its sensitivity is 98.9% specificity is 90.9%.Sexually transmitted diseases is closely related to cervical early disease. CCT should be done in the younger women, especially high-risk patients. Positive cases of CCT must be examined by colposcopy and pathological biopsy, this is the best way to diagnosis cervical disease.
