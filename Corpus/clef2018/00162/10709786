HPV type 16 protein E7 HLA-A2 binding peptides are immunogenic but not processed and presented. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been implicated in the etiology of cervical malignancies and a high percentage of cervical carcinoma cells express HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. These proteins are attractive targets for cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated immunotherapy. We screened peptides derived from the HPV-16 E7 protein for binding to HLA-A2 and tested their potential to induce specific CTL responses in chimeric HLA-A2/H2-Kb transgenic mice. From eight potential binding peptides four displayed binding and were tested for immunogenicity. CTL activity was tested using target cells pulsed with peptide or expressing E7 protein. While there was no CTL induction observed with the peptides 7-15, 66-74 and 82-90, CTL from mice immunized with 86-93 lysed targets presenting the peptide in the context of the HLA-A2/H2-Kb molecule or wild-type HLA-A2. In contrast, 86-93 induced CTL showed no cytolytic activity against cells expressing the protein E7 and vaccination with the E7 protein did not lead to cytotoxicity against targets pulsed with the 86-93 peptide. Therefore the peptide 86-93, which binds to HLA-A2, is able to induce CTL responses in context of HLA-A2, but the peptide appears not to be processed or presented by HPV type 16 infected cells.
