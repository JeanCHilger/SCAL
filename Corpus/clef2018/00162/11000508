Usefulness of human papilloma virus testing in the screening of cervical cancer precursor lesions: a retrospective study in 314 cases. To assess the usefulness of human papilloma virus (HPV) typing for predicting pre-malignant and malignant cervical lesions.314 women, who underwent colposcopy, biopsies and high and low-risk HPV typing after a confirmed abnormal routine Pap test were studied. HPV-DNAs were typed by using PCR technique.We found a significant increasing rate of high-risk-HPV by the increasing severity of histology, ranging from 40% in negative cases to 86.9% in those with CIN3 lesions. The positive predictive value of high-risk-HPV ranged from 13.3% in patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) to 29.4% in those with HSIL. By contrast, negative predictive value was 96% in patients with ASCUS, 97.2% in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 71.4% in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Sensitivity and specificity for detecting CIN2 or CIN3 was 86.0% and 41.3%, respectively.The high negative predictive value of high-risk HPV testing suggests that HPV negativity could be used for predicting the absence of important cervical lesions, and therefore avoiding unnecessary colposcopy in ASCUS and LSIL cases.
