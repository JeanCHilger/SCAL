Epstein-Barr virus-negative high grade B cell lymphoma of donor origin developing 19 months after unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. A 22-year-old man, in first complete remission of acute myelogenous leukemia, developed a high grade B cell lymphoma 19 months after an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT) from an HLA-identical unrelated donor. Biopsy of a cervical lymph node revealed a lymphoma that was negative for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small nuclear RNAs (EBERs) in situ hybridization. Genotypic analyses identified the lymphoma to be of donor origin, and there was no evidence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the lymphoma by Southern blot analysis. The lymphoma went into complete remission, following four courses of combination chemotherapy, but relapsed after a month and the patient died of congestive heart failure. The patient was thought to be persistently immunosuppressed 11 months after cessation of immunosuppressants, and the lymphoma was thought to be induced by one or more factors other than EBV.
