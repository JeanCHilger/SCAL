Detection and genetic typing of human papillomaviruses in cervical biopsies in Cagliari Province. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is considered an important risk factor for the development of cervical carcinoma. The aim of this work was to detect and genotype HPV DNA in cervical lesions from our Province.HPV DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. A total of 101 biopsies (43 koilocytic atypias, 20 CIN1, 19 CIN2, 17 CIN3 and 2 squamous carcinomas) were analyzed.HPV DNA was found in 41.8% of koilocytic atypias, in 95.0% of CIN1 and 100% of CIN2 and higher grade lesions. Only high risk genotypes were found in CIN2-3 and invasive carcinomas. HPV 16 was the most prevalent type in both CIN1 and CIN2-3 and the only HPV type found in situ and invasive carcinomas. HPV type 51 was found in 21.0% of CIN1 but it was rare in CIN2 and absent in more advanced lesions.
