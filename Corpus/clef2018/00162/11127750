Sampling, sampling errors and specimen preparation. To obtain an adequate cervical smear for making a correct cytologic diagnosis, smear taking, laboratory handling and interpretation must be optimal. Many people are involved, and only by a combined effort of all links can this target be seriously approached: the smear takers will have to be open minded about technical improvements and read the morphologic descriptions cautiously in the laboratory, cytotechnicians and physicians will have to challenge themselves and each other. It is mandatory to discard specimens that do not meet general standards of adequacy. At present a host of new techniques are being implemented. It is not feasible for all laboratories to be engaged in testing these new methods, but we are all requested to follow the development the best we can and switch to new ways when justified. Our working conditions are very different
