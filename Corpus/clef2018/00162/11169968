Epidemiology of HPV infection among Mexican women with normal cervical cytology. Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and is the most common cancer among Mexican women, but no population-based studies have reported the prevalence and determinants of HPV infection in Mexico. A population-based study was carried out between 1996 and 1999, based on an age-stratified random sample of 1,340 women with normal cytologic diagnoses from 33 municipalities of Morelos State, Mexico. The prevalence of cervical HPV DNA was determined by reverse line blot strip assay to detect 17 cancer-associated and 10 non-cancer-associated HPV types. Two peaks of HPV DNA prevalence were observed. A first peak of 16.7% was observed in the age group under 25 years. HPV DNA prevalence declined to 3.7% in the age group 35-44 years, then increased progressively to 23% among women 65 years and older. Cancer-associated HPV types were the most common in all age groups non-cancer-associated HPV types were rare in the young and became more common linearly with age. Twenty-four types of HPV were detected
