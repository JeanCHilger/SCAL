Human papillomavirus infections in women with HIV disease: prevalence, risk, and management. Among the most common coinfections and comorbidities associated with the immunosuppression induced by HIV are human papillomavirus (HPV) and its associated diseases: external genital warts, low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and genital squamous cell cancers. Studies have consistently shown that HPV infections in HIV-seropositive women are detected more frequently, are more persistent, and are more difficult to treat than are those in HIV-seronegative women. This article reviews the prevalence, risk, and management of HPV associated infections in HIV-seropositive women.
