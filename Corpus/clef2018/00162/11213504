Benign cellular changes in Pap smears. Causes and significance. We reviewed consecutive cases classified as benign cellular changes (BCC) over a four-month period.Cases classified as BCC were retrieved from the cytology files. A search was carried out to identify the previous Pap smears and concomitant cervical biopsies.One thousand one hundred three cases (23% of our gynecologic smears) were classified as BCC. Ninety-two patients (8.3%) underwent concurrent cervical biopsies. Specific infections accounted for 8% of BCC cases reactive changes accounted for 92%. Of the biopsy specimens, 8.3% had no significant pathologic change. The most common biopsy diagnoses were cervicitis (31.5%), immature squamous metaplasia (16.3%) and reserve cell hyperplasia (10.8%). Miscellaneous benign diagnoses accounted for 21.7%. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1/human papillomavirus (HPV) was present in 14% of cases. All patients with biopsy diagnoses of CIN 1 had at least two previous abnormal Pap smears. Previous biopsy reports were available for review in 127 (12%) of the 1,103 patients. Of these 127 cases, 53.5% had a previous diagnosis of CIN/HPVThe majority of BCC cases are due to reactive and inflammatory processes. In patients with a previous history of CIN, BCC may be of some significance. In patients with no significant prior cervical abnormalities, a Pap smear classified as BCC represents a reactive process.
