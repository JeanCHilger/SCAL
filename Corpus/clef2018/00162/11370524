HPV infection and cervical carcinoma--epidemiology, detection and immunology. Certain molecularly defined types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) induce, by interaction with additional cofactors, cervical cancer. In comparison to infection with HPV, all risk factors identified to date are less important. In addition to HPV a not yet classified genetic predisposition is important. Identification of HPV in cervical smears is done by detection of viral DNA. PCR based methods have the highest specificity. Currently, first vaccination studies with therapeutic vaccines are performed and phase I/II trials for prophylactic vaccination show promising results.
