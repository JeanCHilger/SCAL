DNA-cytometry in dysplasias of the uterine cervix. The diagnostic group of dysplasias has been described as "a group of diagnostic impotence". DNA-aneuploidy detected by image cytometry of Feulgen stained pap smears indicates a potentially progressive lesion, representing a high-grade lesion. DNA-cytometry can identify cases of dysplasias which are likely to progress: DNA-aneuploid dysplasias are HSIL. DNA-aneuploidy is the expression of an integral HPV infection. CIN-lesions with episomal HPV infections are DNA-diploid. With the newly developed laserscanning cytometer (LSC) of ThinPrep-Preparation an automatisation of ploidy measurement is possible in combination with HPV-PCR. We recommend DNA-Image-cytometry as a routine method for classification of uterine cervical borderline lesion into regressive and progressive.
