Negative predictive value of human papillomavirus test following conization of the cervix uteri. The goal of this study was to determine/evaluate the negative predictive value of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing following conization of cervix uteri.A prospective analysis was undertaken on 79 cone biopsies of women with high-grade lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III). HPV testing was performed on cervical smears before and after conization. We correlated the margin status (defined as positive cone margin or endocervical curettage status) and positive conization HPV status with the residual disease in a hysterectomy specimen. A Digene II kit was used to perform HPV testing. HPV detection was done by Hybrid Capture assay.Of the 79 patients, 47(59.5%) had positive margins after conization. HPV testing was positive in 37 cases (78.7%) and negative in 10 cases (21.3%). Residual disease was found in 31 of 47 (66%) postconization hysterectomy specimens. No residual lesions were found in HPV-negative cases. Of the 32 cases with negative margins following conization, HPV testing was negative in 25 cases (78%) and was positive in 7 cases (22%). Among these 25 cases with negative HPV tests, no residual lesion was detected, and in 7 HPV-positive cases, only one residual lesion was found.HPV testing is potentially an effective tool in predicting residual dysplasia after conization and could potentially assist in the decision between hysterectomy and conservative follow-up in women with CIN III.
