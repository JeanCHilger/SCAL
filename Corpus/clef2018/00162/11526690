Colposcopy in human papilloma virus infections of the distal uro-ano-genital tract. HPV infections fall within the STDs and certain high-risk types have a significant role in the cancer genesis of the distal genital tract. The infection results can be clinically evident or be subclinical and in this latter case they are revealed by a highly-sensitive colposcopic examination after acetic acid application at 3% followed by Schiller's test with Lugol solution in weak iodine concentration. Indeed, the distal districts of male and female uroano-genital tracts takes advantage of the colposcopic diagnostics although complementary analysis like histology or DNA tests for HPV typing have sometimes to be performed to confirm the results or to evaluate the prognosis. HPV subclinical lesions, above all at cervical and vaginal level, are those mostly involved with the cancer genesis: the bright-white acidophilia often combined with irregular surface, atypical vascularization and discrete iodine caption represents a colposcopic indication to complementary diagnostic analysis aiming at choosing the most suitable therapy for which colposcopy can show the lesion topography and its frequent plurilocalizations.
