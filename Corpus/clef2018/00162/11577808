Detection of c-erbB-2 gene amplification in cervical scrapes positive for human papillomavirus (HPV). c-erbB-2 gene amplification has been described in a variety of human cancers, but it has been poorly studied in noncancerous cytological samples from genital specimens positive for human papillomavirus (HPV). Furthermore, the relationship between this genetic event and the presence of high-risk and low-risk HPV types is poorly studied. Eighty-four noncancerous cytological samples from exocervical specimens that were positive for HPV types 6, 16, and 18 were analyzed for c-erbB-2 gene amplification using the genomic differential polymerase chain reaction with the single copy reference gene. An association between c-erbB-2 gene amplification and the group corresponding to HPV type 6 was found. Within the low-risk HPV group, c-erbB-2 amplification was associated to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade I (CIN I). Because in the samples analyzed, most of the CIN I stage was characterized by a koilocytotic pattern, c-erbB-2 amplification could be related to this kind of cellular alteration. It would be important to study c-erbB-2 gene amplification and also gene expression in different CIN stages in order to determine its role and significance in cervical cancer.
