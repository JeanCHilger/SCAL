Eradication of established tumors by vaccination with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles delivering human papillomavirus 16 E7 RNA. The etiological role of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in cervical and other cancers suggests that therapeutic vaccines directed against requisite viral antigens may eradicate tumors or their precursors. A Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) alphavirus vector delivering the HPV16 E7 RNA was evaluated for antitumor efficacy using a murine E7+ tumor model. Vaccination with VEE replicon particles expressing E7 (E7-VRP) induced class I-restricted CD8+ T-cell responses as determined by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), tetramer, and cytotoxicity assays. E7-VRP vaccination prevented tumor development in all of the mice and effectively eliminated 7-day established tumors in 67% of tumor-bearing mice. The induction of protective T-cell responses was dependent on CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells. Long-lasting T-cell memory responses developed in E7-VRP-vaccinated mice as determined by complete protection from tumor challenge 3 months after the final vaccination. These promising results highlight the potent CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor effects elicited by VEE replicon-based vectors and support their further development toward clinical testing against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma.
