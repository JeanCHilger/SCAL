The management of ASCUS cervical cytologic abnormalities and HPV testing: a cautionary note. A recently published study of the management of low-grade cytologic smears compared immediate colposcopy to human papillomavirus (HPV) triage and entry cytology smears (conservative management) as three triage techniques for managing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) smears (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study [ALTS]). The study reported a high sensitivity (96.3%) for HPV testing using hybrid capture 2 to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III. The authors concluded that HPV testing is a viable option for managing ASCUS smears. We have reviewed the published data from the ALTS trial and have found a large excess of colposcopies and biopsies in the HPV arm in comparison with the conservative management (cytology) arm. In addition, the ALTS trial quality control and pathology review results raise doubts about the diagnostic validity of the study to establish standards of clinical practice. Furthermore, until the 2-year follow-up analysis of the conservative management arm is completed to detect CIN III, a valid comparison between HPV triage and conservative management is not possible. We conclude that, based on published data, HPV testing for routine clinical management of low-grade cytologic abnormalities (ASCUS smears) is not warranted, and that HPV testing is currently an investigational tool.
