Correlations between nuclear/cytoplasmic area ratio and classification of cervical smears. The aim of this study was to assess the nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio using computerized image analysis of cervical smears with intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade I to III associated or not with cellular changes of human papillomavirus (HPV) in an attempt to determine if this method is more sensitive for the estimation of the grade of CIN. One hundred and ten cervical smears from women with a mean age 35.03 years were studied. The cytological diagnosis was as follows: CIN I + HPV (11), CIN II + HPV (11), CIN II + HPV (8), CIN I (7), CIN II (6), CIN III (8), Ca (22), HPV (32), CIN I-II + HPV (2) and CIN II-III + HPV (3). All cases were histologically examined: 93 cases were in agreement and 17 were under- or overestimated cytologically. The morphometric study of cervical smears was carried out by image analysis. Data were analysed by one way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni test of multiple comparisons. Statistically significant differences were detected between the three grades of CIN or CIN HPV or only HPV (p<0.0001). The results demonstrated that the N/C ratio measured by image analysis on precancerous lesions of cervical smears could be considered as an additional tool for the classification of cervical smears, especially in determining the discrepancies between cytological and histological diagnoses.
