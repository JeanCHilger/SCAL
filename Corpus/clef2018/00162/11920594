Identification and characterization of genes involved in the carcinogenesis of human squamous cell cervical carcinoma. We utilized RT-PCR differential display and cDNA microarrays to identify cellular genes involved in the multi-step carcinogenesis of squamous cell cervical carcinoma. Thirty-eight cervical cancer patients in various stages of the disease and 5 non-cervical cancer patients were studied. Twenty-five cDNA clones were identified and these were subsequently demonstrated to be consistently over-expressed in squamous cell cervical carcinoma biopsies of various FIGO stages. To further evaluate the possible role that these genes may play in the progression of disease, we performed Northern blot analysis and RNA-RNA in situ hybridization studies using cervical cancer biopsies of various FIGO stages. Of particular interest are the 2 clones G32C4B and G30CC that have been identified to be the NADH dehydrogenase 4 gene and the gene that encodes ribosomal protein S12 respectively when compared to sequences available in the GenBank database. Increased expression of these 2 genes were detected in the matched normal tissues collected together with the late FIGO stages of cervical cancer biopsies. In comparison, upregulation of these 2 genes was not detected in cervical squamous epithelium collected from patients admitted for surgery for non-malignant conditions, suggesting that expression of these 2 genes may have altered in the adjacent histopathologically "normal" cervical squamous epithelial tissue from cervical cancer patients. The ribosomal protein S12 and the NADH dehydrogenase 4 genes may therefore be potentially useful as early pre-transformation diagnostic markers for human cervical cancer.
