Cervical cytologic reports of ASCUS and LSIL. Cyto-histological correlation and implication for management. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the appropriate management of ASCUS and LSIL pap smears by correlating the histological findings obtained by punch biopsy or excised specimens.The study group included 584 women with abnormal pap smear: 358 with ASCUS and 226 with LSIL cytological abnormalities. All patients underwent colposcopy and, if necessary, directed-punch biopsy. In case of biopsy-proven dysplasia a destructive or excisional treatment was performed, as indicated.The prevalence of HPV-CIN histological lesions in ASCUS patients was 36.3% and in LSIL patients was 67.7%. High grade CIN was observed in 15.7 and 20.8% respectively. In one ASCUS patients an invasive lesion was diagnosed on punch biopsy and two LSIL patients showed stromal invasion on the final histopathologic report on excised specimens.Patients with ASCUS or LSIL pap smear exhibit a wide spectrum of histological findings ranging from no pathologic abnormality to frequent high grade CIN and invasive carcinoma in rare cases. Because of the histological assessment by directed-punch biopsy and its therapeutical indications, colposcopic examination is recommended for all women with a cytologic diagnosis of ASCUS and LSIL.
