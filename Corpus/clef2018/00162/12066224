HPV detection in cervical cancer patients in northern Poland. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with various benign and malignant lesions including genital condyloma and anogenital cancer. Epidemiological data show that about 90% of all cervical cancer patients are HPV positive. The aim of our study was to determine the percentage of HPV infections in Polish population of examined women. To detect viral DNA, PCR method was used. To distinguish between different virus types, RFLP analysis was performed. Results obtained by PCR-RFLP method were verified by Hybrid Capture test. The presence of HPV DNA was detected in 53% of cervical cancer patients and in 2% of control group of healthy women. The agreement for HPV detection between PCR and Hybrid Capture methods was 81%. Our studies showed much lower incidence of HPV in Polish women with cervical cancer than among other populations as reported in world literature. HPV detection as well as determination of other factors involved in pathogenesis of cervical cancer is of great importance.
