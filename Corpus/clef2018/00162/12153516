Limitations of HLA-transgenic mice in presentation of HLA-restricted cytotoxic T-cell epitopes from endogenously processed human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein. We investigated the use of mice transgenic for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 antigen-binding domains to test vaccines composed of defined HLA A*0201-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 oncoprotein. HPV is detected in >90% of cervical carcinomas. HPV16 E7 oncoprotein transforms cells of the uterine cervix and functions as a tumour-associated antigen to which immunotherapeutic strategies may be directed. We report that although the HLA A*0201 E7 epitope peptides function both to prime for E7 CTL responses, and to sensitize target cells for E7-directed CTL killing in situations where antigen processing is not required, the epitopes are not processed out of either endogenously expressed or immunization-introduced E7, by the mouse antigen-processing and presentation machinery. Thus (1) CTL induced by HLA A*0201 peptide immunization killed E7 peptide-pulsed target cells, but did not kill target cells expressing whole E7 (2) immunization with whole E7 protein did not elicit CTL directed to HLA A*0201-restricted E7 CTL epitopes
