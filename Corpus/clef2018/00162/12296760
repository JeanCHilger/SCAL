Number of levels needed for diagnosis of cervical biopsies. Three levels of histologic sections are routinely prepared for small biopsies in many surgical pathology laboratories. The first level is superficial and may not be representative of the entire biopsy, and may therefore represent wasted resources and time for technologists and pathologists alike.To determine if disposing of the first of 3 standard levels materially affects the diagnosis of cervical biopsies.We retrospectively reviewed levels 2 and 3 of 241 cervical biopsies and compared the review diagnosis with the original diagnosis, using 6 diagnostic categories: I, benign lesions II, human papillomavirus-associated changes or low-grade dysplasiaThe surgical pathology laboratory.Women undergoing cervical biopsy.None.The frequency with which level 1 information changed the diagnostic category determined with levels 2 and 3 only.After review of levels 2 and 3, the diagnosis in 42 (17%) of 241 cases was in disagreement with the original diagnosis. Upon review of level 1, the review category was changed to that of the original diagnosis in only one case.The first of 3 levels contributed little to reaching a diagnosis in these cervical biopsies. Control of interobserver variation would seem to be superior to preparation of additional levels as a strategy for reducing diagnostic error.
