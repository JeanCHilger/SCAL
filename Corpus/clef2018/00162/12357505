Cost of screening for cancerous and precancerous lesions of the cervix. This paper is part of the cost-effectiveness study of cervical cancer screening conducted by the French Society of Clinical Cytology (SFCC). It describes the evaluation of costs of conventional smear tests, thin-layer smear tests (ThinPrep 2000 system), and viral typing by the HCS test. For 100,000 examinations per year, the average cost of a conventional smear test is 11.53 dollars in a private anatomo-pathology clinic. The cost of the thin-layer test for the same number of examinations and in the same type of clinic is 13.93 dollars. For 20,000 annual tests, the average cost of human papillomavirus (HPV) is 23.43 dollars in the public sector and 23.48 dollars in the private one. The higher price of the thin-layer method is only justifiable if this screening technique outperforms the conventional method. Furthermore, the high cost of the HPV test means that its integration into a population-based screening program must be carefully defined.
