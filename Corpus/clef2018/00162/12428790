Usefulness of DNA ploidy measurement on liquid-based smears showing conflicting results between cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus typing. To improve the positive predictive value (PPV) for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) in primary screening, DNA ploidy was measured on the same liquid-based sample by image cytometry in 984 cases showing discrepancies between cytology and HR-HPV testing. Of the conflicting results, 14.5% corresponded to a cytologic lesion (from atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]) without HPV detected, and 85.5% of smears were within normal limits but revealed an HR-HPV infection. A suspect DNA profile was associated significantly with a lesion. In 497 patients who underwent repeated HPV testing, a normal DNA profile at the first smear predicted the clearance of HPV infection (sensitivity, 81.5% specificity, 45.4%
