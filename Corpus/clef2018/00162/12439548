Prevalence of human papillomavirus in cervical swabs in the Okinawa Islands, Japan. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for invasive cervical cancer, the mechanisms of developing carcinoma are not entirely understood. In particular, the biology and natural history of HPV infection are still unknown. Therefore, we have investigated the incidence of human papillomavirus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cervical swabs obtained from women who had cervical cancer screening in three separate areas of the islands of Okinawa. The prevalence of HPV in women aged between 30 and 85 years in the three local areas, Yonashiro-town, Naha-city, and Hirara-city, was consistent (9 to 10%). HPV of various oncogenic types, including HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 35, and 58, were identified in HPV-positive swabs and the prevalence of these types varied in the three areas.
