Update on the diagnosis and treatment of human papillomavirus infection. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with a spectrum of diseases, ranging from common warts to invasive carcinoma of the genital tract. The clinical manifestations of HPV infection depend on the viral subtype, the immune status of the patient, and environmental co-carcinogens. Infection with HPV is often asymptomatic, which makes viral detection challenging. Current therapies do not reliably eradicate HPV infection, and benign genital warts and genital tract intraepithelial neoplasia often recur after treatment. We discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, detection, and treatment of HPV infections of the anogenital tract.
