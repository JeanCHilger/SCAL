Detection of human papillomavirus and herpesvirus genotypes in biopsy specimens from cervical carcinoma by PCR-endonuclease cleavage. This study was to detect the human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) genotypes in biopsy specimens of cervical carcinoma and genital verruca by PCR-endonuclease cleavage.Biopsy samples of were obtained from 390 patients with cervical carcinoma, HPV and HSV genotypes were detected by PCR and endonuclease cleavage.The results indicated that HPV types 16, 18, 35 were found in 152 (38.9%) of 390 cervical carcinoma, in 56 (31.8%) of 176 cervical erosion, while HPV types 6, 11 were found in 80 (58.8%) of 136 acuminate erruca. The HSV-2 type were found in 135 (34.6%) of 390 cervical carcinoma and in 33 (18.7%) of 176 cervical erosion. The HPV 16, 18, 35 types and HSV-2 type found in normal cervical secretions of the control group all were 3.2%, There was significant difference between the test group of cervical carcinoma and the control group of normal cervical secretion (P < 0.001 by x 2 analysis). The restriction endonuclease analysis of these amplified products showed that positive rates of HPV 16, 18, 35 types and HSV-2 type from cervical carcinoma were 23.3%, 14.6%, 1.0% and 34.6%, respectively. While HPV 6, 11 types from acuminate verruca were 36.0% and 22.8% positive respectively.The results suggest that HPV 16, 18 types and HSV-2 type are associated with majority of the cervical carcinoma.
