Human papillomavirus DNA in cervical lesions from Morocco and its implications for cancer control. To determine the types of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in northern Morocco, information which is needed for the design and use of HPV vaccines, we have analysed 129 cervical biopsies from this region. In our study, 91 cases were HPV positive, 45 cases had HPV-16 DNA, and 20 cases had HPV-18 DNA. This distribution of virus type was similar in inflammatory cervical lesions and in invasive cervical carcinomas. In conclusion, the HPV type distribution in Morocco is similar to that in other African Mediterranean countries, where the proportion of HPV-18 cases is significantly higher than in Europe. Determination of virus-type distribution is essential for vaccination programs.
