The HPV DNA virus hybrid capture assay: what is it--and where do we go from here? The biotechnology that has made HPV DNA testing possible has the capacity to reduce the incidence of cervical carcinoma substantially, especially in the patients diagnosed with ambiguous low-grade lesions, such as ASC-US, on Pap smears. Reflex HPV DNA testing of thin layer preparations diagnosed as ASC-US, and in other certain instances as outlined by ASCCP, will play a major role in the management of abnormal cervical cytology. Other applications, such as possible primary screening, may in the future play a substantial role in cervical screening. These potential applications will require more in-depth study and research, and will ultimately have to stand the test of time.
