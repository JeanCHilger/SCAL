Abnormal Fhit expression is an independent poor prognostic factor for cervical cancer. We analysed the expression of the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene in cervical cancer to evaluate its clinical relevance in relation to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. A total of 73 women with cervical cancer of stage Ib or more advanced (67 squamous cell carcionomas, four adenocarcinomas, two adenosquamous carcinomas) were examined for Fhit expression by immunohistochemistry. They were further analysed for the presence of HPV and its subtype. Abnormal expression of Fhit (absent or reduced Fhit expression) was observed in 52 cases (71.2%). The high-risk HPV DNAs for cervical cancer, including type 16, 18, 31, 33, 51, 52, 58, 68, were identified in 63 cases (86%). The abnormal Fhit expression was not related to the clinicopathological factors including histology, tumour stage, and HPV type. Notably, the 5-year survival of patients showing the abnormal Fhit expression was significantly poorer than those showing normal Fhit expression (64 versus 87%, P=0.035). Interestingly, the mean age of the patients with the abnormal Fhit expression was significantly less than those with the normal Fhit expression (51.6 versus 58.7 years of age, P=0.027, student's t-test). These data imply that the aberrant Fhit expression could be a poor prognostic factor independent of HPV. In the light of a high incidence of abnormal Fhit expression in younger patients and HPV as a key player in cervical carcinogenesis, abnormal Fhit expression may accelerate carcinogenesis in concert with HPV.
