Epidemiologic correlates of antibody response to human papillomavirus among women at low risk of cervical cancer. A population at low risk for developing cervical cancer in Southern Brazil was studied to identify the main determinants of serological response to human papillomavirus (HPV). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests were performed in 976 women to detect serum IgG antibodies against HPV 16 L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) and HPVs 16, 18, 6 and 11 L1 VLPs as a mixture of antigens. Women with four or more sexual partners were more likely to be seropositive than women with one partner (HPV 16 serology odds ratio [OR]=3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-4.8 HPV 6/11/16/18 serology OR=4.64, 95% CI: 3.0-7.2). HPV DNA and both serological responses were associated. Those positives to HPV 16 serology were twice as likely to have a cytological diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) than seronegatives (OR=2.07
