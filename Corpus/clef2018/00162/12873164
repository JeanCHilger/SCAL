Human papillomavirus biology and cervical neoplasia: implications for diagnostic criteria and testing. Human papillomaviruses are necessary for the development of cervical neoplasia. Progress in our understanding of the epithelial biology of this common pathogen has greatly influenced current concepts of cervical carcinogenesis. This understanding has provided a framework for understanding the biologic basis of many diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, classification schemes, diagnostic testing, and clinical management have been modified and clarified in light of this knowledge.
