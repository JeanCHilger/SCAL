Cervix cytology in females with kidney transplants. Cervical dysplasia has been reported to occur more frequently in female renal transplant patients. In a 4 year surveillance-period no new cases of dysplasia or invasive cancer were found by cytological or histological methods. Despite the low incidence of abnormalities the use of cytological screening is recommended, above all in the view of a slow progress of the disease.
