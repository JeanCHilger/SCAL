Colposcopy, histology, cytology and HPV findings in patients with condylomata of the vulva. The presence of vulvar condylomata acuminata shows evidence HPV infection of the vulva. 49 patients with such lesions came to our hospital for laser treatment. At that time, none of the patients were aware of their cervical disease. Colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix revealed in eight (16%) of the 49 patients CIN I and CIN II in one patient (2%). Condylomata or other HPV-associated lesions were found in seven patients (14%) and cervicitis in two (4%). HPV were detected in the cervix in 23 patients (46%). HPV types 16 and 18 were found in seven patients (14%) and HPV types 31, 33 and 35 in four patients (8%). It is concluded, that patients with condylomata acuminata of the vulva have a high risk of developing CIN and should undergo colposcopy.
