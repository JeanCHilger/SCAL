Human papillomavirus and its prognostic significance in invasive carcinoma of the cervix in young patients. Of 1,200 Chinese patients treated for carcinoma of the cervix between 1975 and 1984, those aged 40 years (n = 70) or less had a poorer prognosis. Of the latter group, 71% had disease classified as less than International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage Ib, and in 91% the disease was less than stage IIa however, the 5-year survival of the 45 patients with verified invasive carcinoma was 75% compared with 82% for the overall group. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to test for the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) types 16 and 18 within paraffin-embedded tissue from the primary tumors. HPV-16 DNA sequences were detected in 69% of the cases, HPV-18 DNA sequences in 44%, and in 31% both HPV-16 and -18 DNA could be identified. Of the cases of invasive carcinoma, 82% (37 of 45) contained DNA of HPV types 16 and/or 18. The effects of the presence or absence of HPV DNA on known prognostic factors was investigated. Although the influence of traditional factors, especially lymph node involvement, was confirmed, careful statistical analysis could not demonstrate a prognostic influence for HPV-16/18.
