Biologic characteristics of specific human papillomavirus types predicted from morphology of cervical lesions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was detected by Southern blot hybridization in cervicovaginal lavage samples from 199 of 329 (60.5%) women attending a municipal hospital colposcopy clinic. Human papillomavirus was identified in 195 of 264 (73.9%) patients with a squamous intraepithelial lesion or cancer on biopsy or Papanicolaou smear (Bethesda system) compared with 11 of 65 (16.9%) without squamous intraepithelial lesion (P < .0001). The most common HPV type identified was HPV 16 (20.6% of positive samples), and 36.7% of isolates contained uncharacterized HPVs. Of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade III or cancer, 23.4% were infected with HPV 16 compared with less than 4% with any other single HPV type. Based on biopsy diagnosis in patients infected with specific HPV types, HPVs 6 and 11 had low oncogenic potential HPVs 18, 31, 35, and 45 had intermediate oncogenic potential
