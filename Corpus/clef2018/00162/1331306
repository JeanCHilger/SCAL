Pre- and posttreatment serum antibody responses to HPV 16 E2 and HSV 2 ICP8 proteins in women with cervical carcinoma. Serum antibodies to early proteins of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16 E2 protein) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV 2 ICP8) can be measured by ELISA. In the serum of 122 newly diagnosed cervical carcinoma patients and age-matched controls, enhanced IgA antibody levels to an HPV-16 E2 protein derived peptide no. 245 indicated a 9.5-fold (95% confidence limits 2.8-57.2) relative risk of cervical carcinoma. No significant risk was found with a corresponding HPV 6 E2 peptide or HSV 2 ICP8. To evaluate the HPV 16 E2 peptide as a possible tumor marker for cervical carcinoma serial postoperative serum samples were tested from 27 women with cervical carcinoma. Antibody responses to the HPV 16 E2 peptide depended on the clinical stage. Stage I and II patients showed decreasing posttreatment IgA and/or IgG antipeptide antibody levels. Stage III and IV patients initially showed decreasing antipeptide antibody levels followed by increasing levels. These patients also showed increasing IgG antibody levels to the HSV 2 ICP8. However, increasing antibody levels to the HPV 16 E2 peptide indicated significantly (P less than 0.05) worse 2-year disease free survival (recurring disease) than did stable or decreasing antibody levels. The results suggest that serum antipeptide antibodies to the HPV 16 E2 peptide no. 245 can be used for the monitoring of cervical carcinoma.
