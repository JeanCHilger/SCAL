Value of human papillomavirus testing after conization by loop electrosurgical excision for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The aim of the study was to evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) testing during the follow-up of patients after conization by loop electrosurgical excision for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.A prospective study was conducted on 205 patients who underwent conization for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 2 or 3). Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was used in all cases. High-risk HPV testing was realized by the Hybrid Capture II system before and 3 months after conization.Of the 205 patients, 193 (94.1%) were positive for the HPV test before conization. Seventy-one were HPV positive after conization (34.6%). The margins were positive in 36.1%. Residual disease was observed in 27 cases (13.2%). Four patients (2%) developed a recurrence after a mean follow-up of 18.1 months (+/-12). There was no correlation between pretreatment HPV testing and the residual disease or recurrence. Patients with positive margins were significantly more likely to have residual disease than those with negative margins (P < 0.0001). Residual disease was more likely to occur when the posttreatment HPV test was positive (P < 10(-7)). All recurrences were observed in patients with a positive posttreatment HPV test (P < 0.05). Residual disease and recurrence were correctly predicted with a sensitivity of 81 and 100%, respectively, and a negative predictive value of 96 and 100%.Posttreatment HPV testing could be useful in the follow-up of patients after conization. In case of negative posttreatment HPV testing, the frequency of follow-up could be reduced, particularly in those patients with free margins.
