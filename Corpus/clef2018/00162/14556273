Moderate variation of the oncogenic potential among high-risk human papillomavirus types in gynecologic patients with cervical abnormalities. The oncogenic potential of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was assessed by following the disease course in 455 patients who had had a routine diagnostic Hybrid Capture HPV test due to squamous cell abnormalities of the uterine cervix as detected by cytology and/or colposcopy. At entry, 308 patients had cytologic atypia classified as P3 by the Papanicolau classification, 168 had a positive high-risk HPV test, and 23 were infected only with low-risk HPV. The patients were followed-up using the patient registry until the endpoint of histologically diagnosed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). High-grade CIN was diagnosed in 75 surgical biopsies. High-risk HPV infection (relative risk: 76.8 CI(95): 23.7-249.5), cytologic atypia (RR: 16.2 CI(95): 3.9-66.6), and age above 35 (RR: 1.99 CI(95): 1.26-3.16) were independent risk factors for high-grade CIN, while the viral load did not predict oncogenic progression (P = 0.47). After PCR-RFLP typing, the high-risk types were classified into groups as follows: (1) types 16 and 18, (2) types 45, 52, and 56, (3) types 31, 33, 35, 51, and 58. The relative risks of high-grade CIN were 119.1 (CI(95): 36.2-390.9) for group 1, 44.4 (CI(95): 9.8-201) for group 2, and 39.7 (CI(95): 10.9-144.8) for group 3, respectively. The risk ratios between the groups of high-risk types were found to differ at most by a factor of 2.98 (corrected P value: 0.007) indicating that the oncogenic potential varies moderately within the high-risk group of HPVs.
