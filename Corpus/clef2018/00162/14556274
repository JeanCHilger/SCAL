Buccal exposure to human papillomavirus type 16 is a common yet transitory event of childhood. High-risk human papillomaviruses, such as type 16 (HPV-16), are established etiological agents for cervical carcinoma. In most cases, this virus is transmitted sexually, though can also be spread from mother to infant at delivery. We have demonstrated previously a high prevalence ( approximately 52%) of HPV-16 DNA in the mouths of prepubertal children, albeit with low levels of transcription [Rice et al., 2000]. We investigated whether childhood buccal infections with HPV-16 are persistent or transient and whether children became infected through contact with their immediate family members. Two groups of children were selected: one group were all initially HPV-16 E5 DNA-positive in sensitive polymerase chain reaction tests of swabs from their buccal mucosa (n = 20), and the other group consisted of children who were all HPV-16 E5-negative (n = 19). Thirty months later, a second oral swab was collected from each child and tested for HPV DNA. At this second visit, 40% of the HPV-16-positive group had no detectable HPV-16 DNA conversely, 63% of children who were originally HPV-16-negative had now acquired the virus. Three months later, a third sample was collected from eight children and their immediate families (seven were HPV-16 E5 DNA-positive at the second visit). Amongst the family samples tested, in two families a single previously untested child was HPV-16 DNA-positive. It is concluded that HPV-16 DNA in the oral cavities of children is a transient event and is most probably acquired from their peers.
