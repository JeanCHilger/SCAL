Relationship between human papilloma virus infection and abnormal Pap smear in HIV-seropositive women at Siriraj Hospital. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus and abnormal Pap smear in HIV-seropositive women, particularly in HIV-seropositive women who undertook antiretroviral drug. The consecutive series of 178 HIV-seropositive women was enrolled in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Siriraj Hospital. All general information and laboratory results of the patients were recorded. Pap smears are obtained from the endocervix, cervical transformation zone and vagina by using a cotton tip stick and Ayre spatula, as described in the VCE technique. The patients were assigned into two groups, the AZT and non-AZT group. The comparison between the groups was calculated statistically. It was found that 88 of 178 HIV-seropositive women (49.4%) undertook Zidovudine. The prevalence of abnormal Pap smear in HIV-seropositive women, who had an abnormal Pap smear, was 59.6 per cent. However, the prevalence of human papillomavirus infection detected by Pap smear was reported in 17 patients (9.6%). There was no difference between the AZT and non-AZT group statistically. There was a significantly higher probability of finding an abnormal Pap smear for cervical dysplasia in HIV-seropositive women who were infected with human papillomavirus compared to. It is concluded that there is a higher risk of developing cervical dysplasia in HIV-seropositive women who carry the human papillomavirus.
