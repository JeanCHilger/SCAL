Four years of screening cervical smears of cervical lesions. Twelve thousand two hundred and eighty nine Pap smears were collected from public hospitals and from private practices during a four year period (January 1987 to December 1990). 4.2% of Pap smears exhibited condylomatous or dysplastic lesions. 94.5% of such lesions were encountered in Pap smears taken from the transformation zone and which contained endocervical cells. Therefore, these smears represent the only adequate sample for cervical cancer screening. In our study, a close concertation between biologists and clinicians results in an improvement of the smear quality. The percentage of those containing endocervical cells increased from 49% in 1987 to 72% in 1990. Then, more cervical lesions were encountered on smears of patients from a low socio-economic level. New techniques such as detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA on routine Pap smears by in situ hybridization would allow to improve the cytological diagnosis of HPV infections, mainly for non specific cytological alterations (11% in our series for 1990) and for cytological aspects of dysplasia only. These results point out how a cervical cancer screening can be better carried out.
