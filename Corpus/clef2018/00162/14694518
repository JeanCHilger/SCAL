Transition of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to micro-invasive carcinoma is characterized by integration of HPV 16/18 and numerical chromosome abnormalities. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I, II, and III) and cases of CIN III associated with micro-invasive cervical carcinoma (CIN III & mCA) were analysed for evidence of episomal or integrated human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 DNA by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In parallel, numerical aberrations of chromosomes 1, 17, and X were determined in these lesions as indicators of genomic instability. HPV 16/18 DNA was present in 2 of 12 CIN I, 19 of 23 CIN II/III, and 10 of 12 CIN III & mCA. None of the CIN I and only two of the 19 HPV 16/18-positive solitary CIN II/III showed an integrated HPV pattern. However, all ten cases of HPV-positive CIN III & mCA showed this pattern. Transition of CIN II/III to CIN III & mCA therefore correlates strongly with viral integration (p<0.001). Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 23 of 31 HPV 16/18-positive lesions (14 solitary CIN I-III and nine CIN III & mCA) and 5 of 16 HPV-negative lesions. Nine of 21 HPV 16/18-positive solitary CIN I-III showed tetrasomy for all chromosomes tested, while trisomies for a single chromosome were seen in a further five of these HPV-positive lesions. In eight of ten HPV-positive CIN III & mCA, predominantly aneusomies and/or polysomies were detected. A significant correlation (p<0.02) was found between the chromosome copy number and the physical status of HPV, indicating that in its episomal form HPV induces genomic changes such as tetrasomies and single trisomies, while HPV integration correlates with aneusomies and polysomies, predominantly detected in CIN III & mCA. These data indicate that integration of HPV 16/18 DNA is a pivotal step in the transition of CIN to micro-invasive carcinoma.
