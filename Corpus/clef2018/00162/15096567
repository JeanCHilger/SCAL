Performance assessment of eight high-throughput PCR assays for viral load quantitation of oncogenic HPV types. Infection with mucosotropic human papillomavirus (HPV) is the necessary cause of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Several epidemiological studies suggest that HPV viral load can be a risk factor of cervical dysplasia. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a methodology to determine HPV viral load of eight oncogenic HPV types (16, 18, 31, 39, 45, 51, 52, and 58). The quantitation assay is based on a high-throughput real-time PCR. The E6-E7 region of HPV types 16, 18, 45, and 51 were used to amplify specific DNA sequences and cloned into a plasmid vector. The constructs for HPV types 16, 18, 45, and 51, and the whole genome for HPV types 31, 39, 52, and 58 were quantitated using a limiting dilution analysis and used to create standard curves. Type-specific HPV clones were used to determine specificity, linearity, and intra- and inter-assay variation. The sensitivity of our assay covered a dynamic range of up to seven orders of magnitude with a coefficient of intra-assay variation less than 6% and the inter-assay variation less than 20%. No cross-reactivity was observed on any of the type-specific standard curves when phylogenetically close HPV types were used as templates. Our real-time PCR methodologies are highly reproducible, sensitive, and specific over a sevenfold magnitude dynamic range.
