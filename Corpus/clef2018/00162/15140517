p53 at codon 72 polymorphism, human papillomavirus infection and cervical lesions: a cross-sectional study from northeastern Italy. To test the hypothesis that p53 homozygous Arg/Arg genotype at codon 72 is a significant risk factor for the development of HPV induced cervical cancer.A cross-sectional survey on p53 allelotypes distribution in women with different grade of cervical lesions and with or without HPV infection, in comparison to the distribution on a control group of women cytologically normal and HPV negative.No statistically significant difference in the p53 polymorphism distribution was found in relation to the infection with HPV, the cytological pattern and both conditions. A modest but constant over-representation of Pro-allelotypes was found in all groups in comparison to the control group.Searching for p53 polymorphism in a clinical setting does not seem to support secondary prevention procedures, at least for women in this area.
