Eosinophilic dysplasia of the cervix: a newly recognized variant of cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. A proportion of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions encountered in surgical pathology practice contain both metaplastic features and some degree of atypia [so-called eosinophilic dysplasia (ED)] that defy classification according to established criteria. To elucidate the nature of these lesions, we compared 44 cases of ED to 20 classic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and 10 squamous metaplasias using a panel of biomarkers and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. EDs were defined as 1) lack of normal maturation 2) relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and distinct cell borders compared with conventional HSIL
