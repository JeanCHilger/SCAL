HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis and genital mycoplasmas infections in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). The purpose of the study was to determine the correlation between Chlamydia trachomatis, urogenital mycoplasmas and Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL) in women with and without Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection.The specimens were tested for: carcinogenic HPV by the Hybrid Capture I Assay, Chlamydia trachomatis antigen by direct immunofluorescence, urogenital mycoplasmas by Mycoplasma IS test. Cytological smears were classified according to the Bethesda system.High-oncogenic HPV types, Chlamydia trachomatis and mixed infections with Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in patients with LSIL occur significantly more frequently comparing to women without dysplasia. Statistically significant correlation between C. trachomatis and presence of HPV was determined. In HPV negative women there was no correlation between C. trachomatis and LSIL.In women infected with HPV, especially high-oncogenic types, C. trachomatis test should be included in diagnostic-therapeutic routine scheme.
