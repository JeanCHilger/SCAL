Papilloma and polyoma DNA tumor virus sequences in female genital tumors. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and BKV, JCV, and SV40 polyomaviruses (PYVs) are oncogenic viruses associated with different human tumors. Our aim was to determine if PYV and HPV sequences could be detected in human genital tumors. HPV types 6b, 11, 16, and 18 and PYV were investigated in 22 genital tumor samples and the corresponding adjacent normal tissues, by PCR and filter hybridization. HPV and PYV sequences were also searched in six sperm fluid and four peripheral blood cell (PBC) samples. HPV-16 sequences were revealed in 7 of 14 cervical tumors and 1 of 1 vaginal adenocarcinoma, whereas 1 of 14 cervical carcinoma tested positive for HPV-18. Interestingly, each normal cervical tissue surrounding the neoplasm obtained from the same patient was positive for HPV type-16 and -18 with the same prevalence detected in tumors. BKV sequences were found in 9 of 14 cervical tumors, 1 of 7 vulvar tumors, and 1 of 1 adenocarcinoma, but also in normal tissues from cervix (13 of 14), vulva (6 of 7), sperm fluid (5 of 6) and PBC (3 of 4) samples. SV40 sequences were detected in 1 of 14 normal cervical tissue, 2 of 6 sperm fluids and 1 of 4 PBCs. None of the samples were JCV positive. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation reporting on the simultaneous association of both HPV and PYV with human genital tumors. These results suggest that PYV, together with HPV, may be involved as a cofactor in the onset/progression of human genital tumors, and raise the possibility that PYV act synergistically with HPV to enhance their pathogenicity in vivo. In addition, HPV and PYV may complement each other in infecting human genital tissues.
