The value of human papillomavirus detection in primary cervical cancer screening. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is present in the vast majority of high-grade gynecological abnormalities (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and worse) and, therefore, HPV detection has a very high negative predictive value. Nevertheless, introduction of HPV detection into primary screening would result in large numbers of false positives: HPV positive women with normal cytology. The prevalence of HPV in women with cytologically normal smears is age-dependent as has been shown extensively. We hypothesize that women at the age of 50, who are HPV negative and have a cytologically normal smear might be encouraged to refrain from further screening. The data available from the literature on HPV prevalence in elderly women is presented. Data of cohort studies of elderly women with and without HPV infection as well as health-economical analyses to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed hypothesis are still lacking.
