Reflections on cervical cancer. The incidence of invasive cervical cancer and consequently mortality decreased due to adequate screening programmes in Canada from 1969 to 2003. Systematic cervical screening programmes similar to those in Europe should be implemented throughout Canada. The new techniques, including a liquid-based cytology, associated or not with identifying human papilloma virus (HPV), allow the best results in prevention and early diagnosis of cervical cancer and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). In the future a vaccine against HPV type 16 could reduce the incidence of cervical cancer worldwide.
