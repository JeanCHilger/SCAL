Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping by HPV DNA chip in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-known cause of cervical cancer. HPV tests are used as an adjunct test to decrease the false-negative rate of cytological screening. However, attempts are being made to replace the cytological screening with HPV tests. Therefore, this study was performed to examine the possibility of using HPV tests as screening test.The results of the tests that were performed at the same time including the ThinPrep cytology, the high-risk group hybrid capture II (HC-II) test, the HPV DNA chip (HD-C) test, and a punch biopsy were compared in 400 women who were referred to us due to abnormal cytology or cervicogram. The accuracy of each test was then evaluated, and the type of virus was investigated using a HD-C test.The positive predictive values detected by the high-risk group HC-II test and HD-C test according to the histological diagnosis outcomes were 56.8 and 53.8%, respectively, for cervicitis 91.5 and 91.5%, respectively, for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (CIN I)These results suggest the possibility of using the HC-II and HD-C tests as screening tests, which have a similar sensitivity as the ThinPrep cytology. Nonetheless, randomized controlled trials will be needed before the actual application of the HPV tests as screening tests. Despite the fact that the importance of HPV type 16 in cancer development was confirmed, the prevalence of types 58 and 52 were relatively high compared with those found in other studies, showing a need for further studies on this subject. These HPV types need to be considered in vaccine development.
