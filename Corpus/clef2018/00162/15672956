The problems with different management options of women with minor squamous intraepithelial lesions in Pap tests. The optimum management of women with minor squamous intraepithelial lesions in Pap tests is controversial. With cytological surveillance after one Pap test showing atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), a significant proportion of women will have undiagnosed squamous intraepithelial lesions. On the other hand, using immediate colposcopy for ASCUS almost half of the women would not have needed the procedure. This number for referral for colposcopy can be reduced to only those women who test positive for high-risk HPV-DNA, however some women will have undiagnosed squamous intraepithelial lesions. In addition, when surveillance with repeat Pap tests is used for the management of low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) a significant number of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions can be missed. In this article all the problems of each management policy in women with minor squamous intraepithelial lesions in Pap tests are addressed.
