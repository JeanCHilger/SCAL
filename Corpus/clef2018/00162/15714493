Detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus in cervical samples from Italian patients. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are etiological agents of cervical cancer. In order to assess the epidemiological incidence and frequency of different HPV types, we applied a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing approach based on the use of MY09/MY11 primers as compared to Hybrid Capture assay. Cervical samples were taken from 1,500 women, both with normal and abnormal cytological smears, and we found an incidence of 6.6% of HPV infection in Brescia. Overall, 97 samples tested HPV-positive, yielding 18 HPV types. The four most frequent HPV types were: HPV 16, -31, -6, and -58. This approach could be used in ordinary laboratory settings for quick and reliable typing of known and novel HPVs from clinical specimens and it could also be applied to anti-cancer vaccine development.
