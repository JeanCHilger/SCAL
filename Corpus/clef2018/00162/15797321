Adenoviral p53 effects and cell-specific E7 protein-protein interactions of human cervical cancer cells. We investigated the time-course tumor growth suppression effects of recombinant adenovirus expressing p53 on human cervical cancer cells and cell-specific E7 protein-protein interactions in cell lysates using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. Six HPV-infected human cervical cancer cell lines (HPV 16-positive cells, CaSki and SiHa cells HPV 18-positive cells, HeLa and HeLaS3 cells
