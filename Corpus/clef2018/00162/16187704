Global expression analysis in uterine cervical cancer: metabolic pathways and altered genes. High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is considered to be the most important etiological factor of Cervical Uterine Cancer. In order to determine the global expression pattern and to identify possible molecular markers of cervical cancer, cDNA arrays with probe sets complementary to 8,000 human genes were used to examine the expression profiles among 5 cell lines derived from human cervical cancer, three HPV16(+) tumor samples and three normal cervical tissues HPV(-). The levels of expression of different cellular processes were identified. Hierarchical clustering was performed and the gene expression using RT-PCR was confirmed. Two genes were found to be consistently overexpressed in invasive cervical cancer biopsies one of them, IL-6 was previously reported to be overexpressed in cervical cancer and one novel gene, MMP10, previously not known to be related to cervical cancer. Hierarchical clustering of the expression data revealed that samples with common HPV type infection grouped together, maybe this could mean that differences between HPV types could be indirectly determined by expression profiles.
