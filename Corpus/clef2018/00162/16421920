Distribution of human papillomavirus types in ThinPrep Papanicolaou tests classified according to the Bethesda 2001 terminology and correlations with patient age and biopsy outcomes. A survey of the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) types across the spectrum of cervical cytologic categories defined by the Bethesda 2001 guidelines was conducted with the objective of examining how HPV detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis may benefit the management of patients who have abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) test results.DNA samples from women with no intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NLM) (n = 300 samples) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (n = 200 samples)HPV was detected in 27% of NLM samples, in 89.5% of ASC-US samples, in 97.5% of LSIL samples, in 93% of ASC-H samples, and in 96.5% of HSIL samples. Thirty-seven different HPV types were identified in total. One or more of 13 high-risk (HR) HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) were detected in 53% of samples that were diagnosed as ASC-US (59.0% of patients younger than age 30 yrs 45.5% of patients age 30 yrs and older), in 55.5% of samples that were diagnosed as LSIL (60.0% of patients younger than age 30 yrsHR HPV testing by PCR of samples diagnosed according to the Bethesda 2001 guidelines may benefit the management of patients with ASC-US or patients with LSIL, especially among women age 30 years and older, by allowing exclusion from referral for biopsy of women who are negative for HR HPV types. However, the small numbers of women who had CIN-III detected after a diagnosis of ASC-US or LSIL limited the assessment of test sensitivity.
