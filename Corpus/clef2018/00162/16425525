HPV genotypes in repeated PAP II smears of group of women in Slovenia. Molecular epidemiology studies have shown that some types of HPV are causally linked with precancerous lesions of cervix and invasive cervical cancer. In our study, we enrolled HPV infected women with repeated Pap smears (Pap II) in Slovenia and verified HPV infection. HPV genotypes were determined using the method of enzyme restriction of PCR products amplified with group-specific oligonucleotide primers PGMY11/PGMY09 (PCR-RFLP) and restricted with seven different restriction endonucleases. In women aged < or = 30 years we detected 21 different types of HPV and a very high percentage (76.5%) of multiple infections. In women aged > 30 years we detected 11 different types of HPV and found the predominance of a single HPV type infection (85%). In women aged < or = 30 years the most frequent infections, and also equally distributed (10.50%), were those with high-risk types HPV16 and HPV73 and with a probably high-risk type HPV26. In women aged > 30 years most frequent infections, and also equally distributed (18.20%), were those with high-risk type HPV16 and probably high-risk type HPV53. The HPV genotypes were classified by the newest classification according to their oncogenic potential and we have referred the presence of newly high-risk and probably high-risk types of HPV at observed population of women in Slovenia. Using group-specific primers PGMY11/PGMY09 and seven restriction endonucleases in PCR-RFLP method for genotypization of HPV we identified single types of HPV included in large percentage of multiple infections of young women with repeated Pap II smears.
