Methods for detailed histopathological investigation and localization of biopsies from cervix uteri to improve the interpretation of autofluorescence data. Fluorescence spectroscopy is one of many optical methods that are potentially clinically useful for noninvasive detection and characterization of disorders on the cervical part of uterus, including precancerous lesions. The cervix uteri exhibits a biologically complex tissue and the morphology of a biopsy is generally not homogenous. The standard histopathological protocol accounts only for the most severe condition found within the biopsy and no information is given on other constituents potentially influencing the recorded fluorescence spectra. Spectra are usually correlated, using multivariate techniques, to the histopathological diagnosis of the biopsies. Since the probe volume of fluorescence spectroscopy is considerably smaller than the extension of the biopsy, this can cause problems in the search for correlation between the fluorescence signals and the pathological structures. In addition, the orientation and location of the biopsies are normally not recorded. We now report on the first detailed histopathological protocol where numerous tissue parameters, such as thickness and type of the epithelium and the number of blood vessels, glands, and inflammatory cells, are tabulated and the orientation and location of the biopsy are recorded as precisely as possible. Hopefully, the use of this protocol together with sophisticated mathematical methods will increase the probability to classify cervical disorders of the uterus, including precancerous lesions, with high sensitivity and specificity.
