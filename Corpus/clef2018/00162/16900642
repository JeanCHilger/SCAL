Clinical evaluation of high-risk HPV detection by hybrid capture II in screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasma. To evaluate the value of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) detection by Hybrid Capture II (HC2) in screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN).Totally 723 patients who had received a dual screening with thinprep cytologic test (TCT) and HC2 in our department were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 350 patients received a triple examination with TCT, HC2, and colposcopic biopsy.Among the 723 patients, the incidences of hrHPV infection with atypical squamous cell (ASC), low squamous intraepithelial lesion, and high squamous intraepithelial lesion were 70.7% (94/133), 88.9% (249/280), and 90.9% (90/99), respectively, significantly higher than 55.5% (117/211), the incidence of hrHPV infection with normal cytological results (P = 0.005, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Among 350 cases who were received triple examination, the incidence of hrHPV infection with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and CIN 2 were 88.9% (72/81) and 96.3% (52/54), significantly higher than 77.7% (153/197), the incidence of hrHPV infection with normal pathological results (P = 0.03, P = 0.002) The incidence of hrHPV infection with CIN 3 and squamous cancer were 91.7% (11/12) and 100.0% (6/6), also higher than normal cases. Among these 350 cases, the incidence of hrHPV infection with ASC was 79.3% (69/87). The incidence of CIN 2-3 with ASC and hrHPV infection was 38.0%, significantly higher than the incidence of CIN 2-3 with ASC and without hrHPV infection (5.9%) (P = 0.04).hrHPV infection has a close relation with CIN, and the incidence of hrHPV infection increases along with the severity of CIN.
