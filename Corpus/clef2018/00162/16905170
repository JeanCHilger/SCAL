CpG methylation of HPV 16 LCR at E2 binding site proximal to P97 is associated with cervical cancer in presence of intact E2. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E2 protein negatively regulates transcription of the E6 and E7 genes. This study was done to test the hypothesis that methylation of the HPV 16 long control region (LCR) is overrepresented among cervical cancer (CaCx) cases compared to cytologically normal controls harboring intact E2 gene. Methylation of the E2 binding site (E2BS-I), proximal to the P97 promoter, was assessed by HpaII/ MspI restriction digestion while McrBC digestion was used to assess LCR-E6 (7289-540) for 57 CaCx samples and 15 normal controls. E2BS-I methylation was found to be significantly higher (56.14%) in cases compared to (20%) controls [OR(age-adjusted) (95% CI): 4.53 (1.05-19.43) p=0.042]. The difference between cases (54.39%) and controls (40%) with respect to LCR-E6 methylation status [OR(age-adjusted) (95% CI): 1.77(0.5-6.3) p=0.38] was not significant. Sequencing of a randomly selected set of 13 methylated malignant samples revealed absence or rare presence, of methylation at CpGs 7579, 7535, 7683 and 7862 respectively. Methylation was found to be more at CpGs within E2 binding sites proximal to the P97 promoter. These results indicate the involvement of E2 binding site methylation in presence of intact E2, leading to loss of E2 repressor activity in CaCx.
