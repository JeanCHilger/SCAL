Reflex high-risk human papilloma virus DNA test is useful in the triage of women with atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. This study is aimed to investigate the role of reflex high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing as an alternative triage method to colposcopy for women with atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) on Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. Reflex HPV DNA testing using Hybrid Capture II method was carried out on 88 women with ASC-H diagnosed by Thin Prep Pap test. Correlation with follow-up biopsies was available on 42 of these patients. The reflex HPV DNA test showed an overall positive rate of 67% and negative rate of 33% in 88 patients with ASC-H. Using age 30 as the cut off point, the positive rate had increased to 83.3% (35/42) in patients 30 yr or younger, while the positive rate for patients older than 30 yr had decreased to 52.2% (24/46). Follow-up colposcopic biopsy results were available in 35 of 59 HPV-positive women, which revealed 15 (43%) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 12 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 8 negative for dysplasia. In 7 HPV-negative patients, the follow-up biopsies showed no evidence of HSIL or LSIL. Correlation between clinical risk factors and the HPV results demonstrated no significant differences in HPV positivity between the high-risk and low-risk patients. The high sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive rate (100%) in detecting HSIL in our study provide strong evidence that, instead of automatic referral to colposcopy, reflex HPV DNA testing may be used as an alternative triage method for women diagnosed with ASC-H on Thin Prep Pap test, especially for women older than 30 yr of age.
