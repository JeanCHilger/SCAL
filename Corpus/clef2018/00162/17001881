Detection of HPV16 and 18 by in situ hybridization in precancerous and cancerous lesions of cervix. Fifty cervical biopsies from women with preinvasive and invasive malignancies of uterine cervix and ten normal cervical biopsies were examined for the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18 DNA sequences by in situ hybridization (ISH) method with biotinylated DNA probes. The overall positivity of HPV DNA was 48% (24/50). The positivity of HPV 16 DNA for low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were 33.33%, 45.45%, 42.30% respectively. The positivity for HPV 18 DNA for LSIL, HSIL and SCC were 0%, 18.18%, 30.76% respectively. Two cases of cervical adenocarcinomas showed positivity for HPV 18 DNA only.
