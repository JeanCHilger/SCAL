The up-to-date evidence on colposcopy practice and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: the Cochrane colposcopy & cervical cytopathology collaborative group (C5 group) approach. This overview presents the up-to-date evidence on colposcopy practice and other diagnostic modalities such as HPV DNA test and cytology for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Current evidence supports the use of colposcopy for the detection of intraepithelial lesions as a second line tool. CIN treatment involves either excisional or destructive techniques, usually performed under local anesthesia. Although a debate exists about the most efficient approach, the currently available evidence reveals no differences in efficacy among the available conservative methods of treatment. New evidence supports treatment by destructive rather than excisional techniques, at least for low grade lesions in women wishing future childbearing, as they appear to have no apparent pregnancy-related morbidity. Treatment failures rates might increase in cases of involved excision margins, older age or glandular involvement. There is no worldwide consensus on the optimal follow-up policy, interventions or frequency in surveillance after treatment. HPV DNA test combined with either colposcopy or cytology is a promising combination for the early detection of treatment failures due to residual disease. Existing guidelines should probably be updated incorporating the new information emerged from recently published work.
