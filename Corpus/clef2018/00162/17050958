Cervical HPV DNA detection as a predictor of a recurrent SIL diagnosis among untreated women. This study was conducted to test whether patient history of untreated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL) modifies the interpretation of a positive HPV DNA result with regards to subsequent squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL).Seventy-three women with recurrent SIL were compared to 105 controls who remain cytologically normal during follow up. Cervical samples collected at enrollment were assayed for HPV DNA in the subject and control groups.Women with and without a history of LGSIL who tested positive for HPV DNA were at a similarly increased risk of having (recurrent) LGSIL as compared to controls. However, in women with a history of LGSIL, HPV DNA appeared to be less predictive for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL) than in women without a history of disease.Past history of untreated CIN1 or LGSIL does not modify the predictive value of a positive HPV DNA test for subsequent LGSIL. The observed difference of the predictive value of a positive HPV DNA test for the risk of recurrent HSIL compared to incident HSIL should be pursued.
