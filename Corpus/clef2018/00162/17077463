Radio wave and cryodestruction in the complex therapy of cervical lesions. We have determined the effectiveness of cryodestruction and radio wave surgery during the treatment of background diseases of cervical lesions. To 52 patients with background diseases of cervical lesions the radio wave surgery has been performed and for 81 patients cryodestruction has been carried out, 65 patients got laser, anti-virus and immunomodulating therapy after cryosurgical treatment. The usage of radio wave surgery and cryodestruction helps to avoid unpleasant postoperative consequences such as pain, edema, infection and postoperative shock from loss of blood, which quite often arise after application of traditional methods of surgical operation. The advantage of cryodestruction and radio wave surgery at treatment of background diseases of cervical lesions in comparison with other invasive methods of treatment of given pathology is the absence of scars and preservation of cervical lesions' reproductive function. During the radio wave surgery operation the depth of destruction of tissues are being controlled by the adjustment of the device's capacity, which in our opinion is an advantage of radio wave method of treatment of cervical lesions' pathology in comparison with the method of cryodestruction.
