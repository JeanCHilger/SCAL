The p53 codon 72 arg/arg homozygous women in central Italy are at increased risk for HPV infections. The oncoprotein E6 binds to and degrades the p53 tumor suppressor protein, with different efficacy depending on the p53 codon 72 (arg/pro) polymorphism. The arg/arg allele has been shown to increase the risk for cervical cancer.Fifty-eight women infected with HPV and 32 normal controls were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism to detect arg/arg or arg/pro alleles.The allele frequencies in HPV-positive women were: arg/arg 47/58 (81%) arg/pro 9/58 (15.5%) and pro/pro 2/58 (3.4%), while those in controls were: arg/arg 19/32 (59%)These data suggest that arg/arg homozygous patients are at increased risk for HR-HPV infections.
