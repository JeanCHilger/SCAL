Predictors of human papillomavirus vaccination acceptability among underserved women. The objectives of this study were to examine underserved women's acceptability of the forthcoming human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines and to identify correlates of HPV vaccine acceptability.A sample of primarily low-income minority women (n = 58) recruited from community health clinics completed a semistructured interview assessing health beliefs, vaccination attitudes, health behavior, and HPV vaccination intentions.Personal acceptability of the HPV vaccines was generally high. Moreover, 100% of parents were interested in having their children vaccinated. Correlates of vaccination intentions included health beliefs and attitudes (perceived risk of HPV infection, perceived safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines, perceived physician encouragement for vaccination) and previous health behavior (HIV testing). Independent predictors of vaccine acceptability were also identified.The current study highlights key correlates of vaccine acceptability that may inform HPV vaccination campaigns for underserved populations.
