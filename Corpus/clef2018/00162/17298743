Effect of CRE-dependent RNA interference targeting Notch1 on proliferation of cervical cancer cell line HeLa. Notch signal transduction pathway mediates cell differentiation and proliferation. Its dysfunction is supposed to be involved in tumorigenesis and development. This study was to construct a course recombination enzyme(CRE)-dependent short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid targeting Notch1, and investigate its effect on proliferation of cervical cancer cell line HeLa.RNA interfering vectors pSico and pSicoR were used to construct CRE-dependent shRNA expression plasmids targeting GAPDH and Notch1 pBS185-CRE was used as an expression vector of CRE. HeLa cells were divided into 4 groups and transfected with pSico, pSico/CRE, pSicoR, and pSicoR/CRE, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were carried out to assess the efficiency of RNA interference (RNAi), and intracellular Notch signal level was tested by CBF-1 reporter plasmid. The proliferation of HeLa cells after CRE-dependent Notch1 RNAi was detected by MTS assay.After transfection of pSico (R)-GAPDH and pSico (R)-Notch1, CRE-dependent green fluorescent cells were detected Notch1 expression was inhibitedRNAi of Notch1 mediated by CRE-dependent shRNA expression plasmid can down-regulate intracellular Notch1 signal level and suppress the proliferation of HeLa cells.
