The relationship of community biopsy-diagnosed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 to the quality control pathology-reviewed diagnoses: an ALTS report. We examined the predictors (cytologic interpretations, pathology review, human papillomavirus [HPV] testing results, and colposcopic impressions) of precancer among 545 women with clinical center biopsy diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 in the ASCUS LSIL Triage Study. Among women with a CIN 2 biopsy result, there was an increasing likelihood that the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) tissue sample was diagnosed as precancer (CIN 3) with an increasing number of clinical risk factors of cervical precancer (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] cytology, high-grade colposcopy, detection of HPV type 16 Ptrend < .0005). In a multivariate model, using a case definition of worst histologic diagnosis made by the quality control pathology review of biopsy and LEEP tissue samples, HPV-16 was positively associated (odds ratio [OR], 4.8
