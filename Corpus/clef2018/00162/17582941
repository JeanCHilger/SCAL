ThinPrep pap test: a platform for gynecological diagnosis. Many of the limitations of the conventional method of Pap smear preparation have been overcome by collection of the cervical sample in liquid, and subsequent preparation to create a thin-layer microscope slides. Particularly impressive has been the large body of literature that describes the benefits of the ThinPrep Pap Test, in terms of increased sensitivity of high-grade disease detection, excellent specificity, robust cost effectiveness, and a platform from which additional testing can be performed. The benefits of the ThinPrep are particularly evident in underscreened populations, or in women who are infrequently screened, or in the setting of a national program.
