Modern screening in cervical cancer. Perspectives of HPV prophylactic vaccines. Despite the tremendous progress made along several different lines of research, cervical cancer has not has been overcome. The presence or the absence of the HR-HPV infection defines new possible approaches to screen and prevent cervical cancer. The aim of this review is to summarize the mechanisms that contribute to HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis, to present the modern screening in cervical cancer (liquid-based cytology, liquid-based hybridization, PCR-based assays) and also the beginning of the HPV vaccine era.
