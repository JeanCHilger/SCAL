Human papillomavirus. A majority of sexually active adults carry the human papillomavirus (HPV), but until recently, this virus received little public attention. This changed in 2006 with the approval of a new vaccine that can prevent infection with certain types of HPV, and thereby reduce the risk of cervical cancer.
