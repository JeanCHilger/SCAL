HPV vaccine acceptance among mid-adult women. To determine correlates of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine acceptance in mid-adult women.A convenience sample of 472 mid-adult women completed a 2-part, 69-item survey that included demographic, knowledge, and behavioral variables as potential correlates of vaccine acceptance. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify correlates for vaccine acceptance.Mid-adult women who received the HPV vaccine were more likely to be younger than 55 years (P < .001) have had an abnormal Papanicolaou test (odds ratio [OR], 2.15These clinical predictors of HPV vaccine acceptance will help clinicians recognize mid-adult women who may be more receptive to vaccination.
