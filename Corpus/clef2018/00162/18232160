Review of screening and preventive strategies for cervical cancer in India. Cervical cancer is the commonest cancer among Indian women. The predominant risk factor is persistent infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) which is now well established. Despite being the commonest cancer, and the fact that it is a type of cancer, which can be detected early by sensitive screening methods there is no effective screening programme or preventive strategy for reducing its burden. This article reviewed the published studies that has been carried out in India during 1965-2005 on cervical cancer with emphasis on screening by Pap smear and other alternative methods. Conventionally, Pap smear cytology is the only method for screening but recently various studies have been carried out to explore alternative methods like visual inspection methods. Due to the operational difficulties by Pap smear, these alternative screening methods could be more feasible for organized population based screening in a low resource country. There is therefore a need for initiating screening programmes within the existing health system in India.
