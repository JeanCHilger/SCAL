Clinical efficacy of HPV DNA chip test in the era of HPV vaccination: 1,211 cases, a single institution study. Human papillomavirus (HPV) prophylactic vaccines, bivalent types for HPV-16/18 with 70% prophylactic expectation, have been developed based on the genotypes found prevalent in the western countries, but little is known for those in Korea. Using a DNA chip test, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of HPV genotype based on cervical abnormalities.As the initial diagnostic tests, HPV DNA chip tests and Papanicolaou smear (PAP) were used for 1,211 subjects. Cervical colposcopy directed biopsies were performed for 626 among the 1,211 subjects within one month.The most frequently found genotypes in all HPV-positive specimens (n=445) were HPV-16 (22.0%), 58 (13.9%), 52 (11.0%), 51 (9.0%), 56 (8.5%), and 18 (7.2%). HPV prevalence was significantly higher in specimens where PAP and biopsy results were closer to malignancy. The HPV genotype distribution of the histologically confirmed cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or carcinoma cases showed HPV-16, 58, 52, 18, and 33, in descending order. The HPV DNA chip sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the detection of cervical HSIL or carcinoma were 76.9%, 70.1%, 72.1%, and 75.8%, respectively, Of these, the sensitivity and NPV were higher than those of PAP. PPV and NPV of HPV-16 were 90.5% and 60.7%, respectively, being the highest among the genotypes.We confirmed that HPV-16 genotype was also very important for the diagnosis of HSIL and cervical carcinoma in Korea. However, contrary to the findings in the western countries, the prevalence of HPV-58 was higher than that of HPV-18. Moreover, as the other HPV genotype reports were rare in Korea, further studies are required with the HPV DNA chip test before the nationwide adoption of the vaccines.
