Human papillomavirus genotyping for the eight oncogenic types can improve specificity of HPV testing in women with mildly abnormal Pap results. To evaluate whether human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping for the selected oncogenic HPV types can improve the efficacy of HPV DNA testing in predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) in women with mildly abnormal Pap results, we compared HPV DNA testing and HPV genotyping for eight oncogenic types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52 and 58) in Pap specimens with abnormal results (HSIL, 20 cases LSIL, 42 cases
