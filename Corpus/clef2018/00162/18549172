Vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) between registration and implementation. --Each year, 600-700 women in the Netherlands are diagnosed with cervical cancer. Over the last 10 years, an average of 250 women have died annually due to cervical cancer. --Gardasil, the first vaccine for Human papillomavirus (HPV), was recently approved in Europe for the prevention of cervical cancer. --The availability of a vaccine for HPV prompts the question whether it should be included in the Dutch National Immunisation Programme. --At the end of 2006, the Medicines Evaluation Board, the Health Council of the Netherlands and the Centre for Infectious Disease Control of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment organised a workshop for experts in the field to answer that question. --The HPV vaccine provides protection against HPV-16 and HPV-18, which cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers. --Because the efficacy of vaccination is only evident after many years, preserving good participation in the screening programme is essential. --The current screening could be improved by introducing an HPV test combined with self-sampling for women who do not participate in screening. --Vaccination is unarguably an important development. However, there are still several unanswered questions regarding vaccination and its actual protection, duration of protection, long-term safety and cost-effectiveness. --April 1st, 2008, the Health Council of the Netherlands had recommended including HPV vaccination in the National Immunisation Programme.
