Detection and typing of human papilloma virus by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization assay in cervical samples with cytological abnormalities. Certain mucosa-tropic human papillomavirus (HPV) types are associated with carcinoma of the uterine cervix or its precursor lesions. In addition to cytological screening, early diagnosis and treatment of cervical carcinoma rely on sensitive detection and typing of HPV isolates. In this study, HPV detection and typing were performed in the cervical samples of patients with abnormal cytological evaluation. Forty randomly-selected cervical samples that comprise 18 ASC-US (Aypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance), four AG-US (Aypical Glandular cells of Undetermined Significance), one ASC-H (Atypical Squamous Cells-can not exclude HSIL), one HSIL (High-grade Intraepithelial Lesion), 14 LSIL (Low-grade Intraepithelial Lesion), one adenocarcinoma and one squamous cell carcinoma, obtained by a commercial liquid-based cytology system (ThinPrep Pap Smear Method, Cytyc, USA), were included to the study. HPV-DNA detection were accomplished by L1 in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed using MY09/11 and GP5/6 primers along with a commercial real-time PCR (HeliosisTM HPV LC PCR Kit Metis Biotechnology, Turkey) that detects HPV infections and HPV-16 via melting curve analysis.
