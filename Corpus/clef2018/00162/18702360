Significance of high-risk human papillomavirus DNA-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance pap smears in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. To determine the risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or 3 in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) on Pap tests.A total of 752 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women (patients 45 years) with an ASCUS interpretation on ThinPrep Pap tests were identified in 2002 and 2003. High risk HPVDNA was detected in 191 (25.4%) women. The follow-up results in these 136 women were compared with those of women <45 years.Of the 136 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, 64.7% became negative on cytology or biopsy and 30.9% revealed persistent low-grade SIL (LSIL)/CIN 1. Furthermore, 5 women (3.68%) were diagnosed with HSIL/CIN 2 or 3, and 1 patient had squamous cell carcinoma (0.74%). The rate of HSIL/CIN 2 or 3 or worse detected in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women was significant lower than 10.6% in women <45 years (p = 0.028).Our study showed that perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with high-risk HPV positivity and an ASCUS interpretation have a significantly lower risk of HSIL/CIN 2 or 3 detected. Nonetheless, the risk of a significant finding on workup, including invasive carcinoma, indicates the need for colposcopic evaluation of these women.
