Challenges to implement strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of cervical cancer in Mexico. Mortality due to cervical cancer (CC) has decreased in developed countries given extensive screening and effective coverage. In developing countries mortality rates due to CC remain high. Since the mid-nineties there has been a decrease in mortality due to CC in Mexico, which can be attributed to the increase in coverage of the Papanicolaou (PAP) (beta -.195, IC95% -.274, -.117) and the decrease in the birth rate (beta -.407, IC95% -.632, -.182). The use of the PAP in conjunction with an HPV test within the early CC detection program would have a synergistic effect HPV testing should be combined with the Pap test. Primary prevention of CC is possible with the HPV vaccine. This vaccine will be an additional tool for reducing CC-related morbidity and mortality, but will not replace screening and treatment. To adopt a prevention policy that includes an HPV vaccine we will need to: determine the burden of HPV-related disease
