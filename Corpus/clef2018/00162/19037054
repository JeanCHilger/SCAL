ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 99: management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology. Recent evidence has shown that the risk of malignant and premalignant cervical disease and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections varies significantly with age (1,2). Furthermore, evidence now shows that treatment for cervical disease carries significant risk for future pregnancies (3-7). These factors have led to a re-evaluation of the guidelines for the management of premalignant cervical disease. The purpose of this document is to define strategies for diagnosis and management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology results. In this document, HPV refers to high-risk oncogenic forms of the virus.
