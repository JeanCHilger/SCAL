Value of conventional pap smear, liquid-based cytology, visual inspection and human papillomavirus testing as optional screening tools among latin american women <35 and > or =35 years of age: experience from the Latin American Screening Study. To compare performance of conventional Pap test, liquid based cytology (LBC) and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), as well as human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in 2 subcohorts of women, <35 and > or =35 years of age.Performance indicators were calculated using colposcopic biopsies as the gold standard all results were corrected for verification bias using maximum likelihood.Both conventional Pap test n d Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay performed significantly better among older women than younger no difference was observed in performance of LBC and VIA, both inferior to Pap and HC2. The Pap test was more specific than HC2 in both subcohortsAge of the target population is an important determinant of the performance of different screening tests. The choice of optimal test for women <35 and > or =35 years of age depends on whether the highest positive predictive value (Pap test).
