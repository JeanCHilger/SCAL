Human papillomavirus typing and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in female sex workers with a negative cervical smear result. To investigate the association between high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels in female sex workers with a negative cervical smear result, and to determine the effectiveness of using sIL-2R levels to screen for high-risk strains of HPV.A negative cervical smear result and a blood sample were obtained from 68 women: 43 female sex workers and 25 women acting as controls. HPV DNA genotyping was performed and sIL-2R levels were assessed.Female sex workers had significantly higher sIL-2R levels than women in the control group (318.37+/-239.7 vs 114.4+/-56.5 U/mL, respectively P<0.001). In addition, female sex workers with high-risk strains of HPV had significantly higher sIL-2R levels than those who did not have high-risk strains of HPV (736.7+/-251.5 vs 250.5+/-156.1 U/mL, respectively P=0.001).High sIL-2R levels may be useful in screening for high-risk strains of HPV in female sex workers who have a negative cervical smear result.
