Hospital-based prevalence and sensitivity of high-risk human papillomavirus in Thai urban population. To study the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18, 31 and 33 in healthy Thai women using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.Two hundred and sixty three healthy urban women in Pathumthani, Thailand were recruited. Cervical cancer screening was performed and residual specimen from Pap smears was subjected to PCR to identify the presence of HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33. Individuals' demographic, health-specific and sexual behavior data were also collected.Colposcopic biopsy revealed cases with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). HPV 16 and 18 positive results were associated with abnormal Pap smears. Genotyping gave a 6.1%, 11.8%, 12.1%, and 14.1%, prevalence for HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 33, while 25% were infected with multiple HPV types.High-risk HPV screening, used with abnormal pathology of HSIL gives 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value. Data from patient showed not significant correlation with neither different religion level of education, marital status, age of first sexual experience nor the number of sexual partners. Thus high-risk HPV screening is a recommended procedure with excellent sensitivity for detecting HSIL.
