HPV genotyping in anogenital abnormal samples of Ecuadorian women. Limited data are available describing human papilloma virus (HPV) genotype distributions in gynecological lesions in Ecuador. To predict how HPV vaccination and HPV-based screening will influence cervical cancer prevention it needs such studies.We analyzed 124 samples from women, adults between 18 to 55 years old, Mestizas (Hispanics), were born and living in Quito, Ecuador. They showed an atypical sample in PapTest or a histological abnormal evaluation. We used the kit PVH Fast 2.0 with conventional PCR to study cervical and vulvar swabs prior colposcopy and/or cytology.We found 23 different genotypes. 84/104 cases were positive for HPV (67.7%) 32/124 cases were negative (25.8%)
