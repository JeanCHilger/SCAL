Folate status and aberrant DNA methylation are associated with HPV infection and cervical pathogenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation is a recognized feature of human cancers, and folate is directly involved in DNA methylation via one-carbon metabolism. Previous reports also suggest that folate status is associated with the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. A cross-sectional study was conducted to test the hypothesis that folate status and aberrant DNA methylation show a progressive change across stages of cervical pathology from normal cells to cervical cancer. Additionally, we postulated that a gene-specific hypermethylation profile might be used as a predictive biomarker of cervical cancer risk. DNA hypermethylation of seven tumor suppressor genes, global DNA hypomethylation, systemic folate status, and HPV status were measured in 308 women with a diagnosis of normal cervix (n = 58), low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1 n = 68), high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2, n = 56
