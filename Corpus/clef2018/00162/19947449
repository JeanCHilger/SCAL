Role of the PAP smear in adolescence. The publication of the 2006 directives concerning the management of PAP smears has incited us to update our internal protocols at the CHUV, which are described in this article. A new addition to these directives is the specific management of adolescent PAP smears, who present both a high HPV carriage rate and increased incidence of cytological abnormalities with a favorable outcome in most cases. Our goal is to avoid over-treating dysplasias in this type of patient in order to avoid long-term complications. Emphasis is placed on the first gynecological consultation where a listening ear and clear and targeted information remain essential in the proper management of a young patient.
