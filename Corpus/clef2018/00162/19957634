Role of cytological test for cervices to identify human papillomavirus in the screening program on serious cervical lesion. To evaluate the value of cervical cytology and hybrid capture II (HC- II) human papillomavarus (HPV) test for screening cervical lesion.Conventional papanicolaou (Pap) smear by improved take-samples, liquid-based cytology test (LCT) and HC- II human papillomavarus test were performed in 425 women in Shang Mei-lin community of Futian region in Shenzhen city, from December 2007 to March 2008 and the above methods were performed in 75 women in Shenzhen Hospital of Peking University at the same time. Age stratified sampling was used. Samples of Pap were taken a broom-type sampling device (take-samples used for LCT) with split-sampling method. Those women with HPV-positive, Pap> or =atypical squamous cells of undetermined sign (ASCUS) or LCT> or =ASCUS received multi-spot biopsy and endocervical curettage under colposcopy. Final diagnosis would depend on pathological findings as well, to evaluate the values of Pap, LCT, HC-II HPV, Pap-HPV parallel test, LCT-HPV parallel test, Pap-HPV serial test and LCT-HPV serial test for the screening program on cervical cancer.(1) In this study, 7 women had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II, another 7 had CIN III, 1 had cervical cancer in the community 9 had CIN II, 11 had CIN III, 3 had cervical cancer in the hospital, respectively. (2) The sensitivity of HC-II HPV and cytology-HPV parallel test for detecting > or =CIN II was >95.0% while negative pre-value were nearly 100.0%. (3) There were no significant differences of screening effectiveness and unsatisfactory rates between Pap of improved take-samples and LCT. (4) The cost-effectiveness ratio of Pap-HPV parallel test was higher than LCT-HPV parallel test.It was suggested that the first choice for screening of cervical serious lesion were HC-II HPV and cytology-HPV parallel test while Pap-HPV parallel test was the best method for screening purposes.
