Factors influencing HPV vaccination status in a Latino population and parental attitudes towards vaccine mandates. We performed a retrospective cohort study in a largely Latino population in Los Angeles, surveying 95 parents of 11-17 year old girls between May and June 2008 to examine factors associated with [1] parental consent for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) immunization one year after vaccine implementation and [2] parental support of an HPV vaccine mandate for adolescents prior to middle school entry. 73% of participants had heard of the HPV vaccine and 37% of daughters had already received the vaccine. Variables associated with vaccination included Latino ethnicity, the belief that vaccines are safe, and that HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer. The most frequent reasons for refusing vaccination included parental request for more information and missed opportunities in clinic. Variables associated with parents agreeing with a law mandating HPV vaccination included: belief in vaccine safety, recent maternal Pap Smear, HPV vaccination of participant's daughter prior to survey, and Latino ethnicity. Our survey supports the work of previous studies recommending continued educational campaigns emphasizing the safety of HPV vaccine, and its efficacy in reducing cervical cancer.
