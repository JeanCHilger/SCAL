Clinical validation of the Cervista HPV HR and 16/18 genotyping tests for use in women with ASC-US cytology. High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is important in cervical cancer screening for triage to colposcopy. This study evaluated the clinical performance of the Cervista HPV HR and 16/18 genotyping tests for detection of HPV in cervical cytology specimens.The tests were prospectively evaluated in a multicenter clinical study. DNA was extracted from approximately 4000 residual liquid-based cytology specimens collected during routine liquid-based Papanicolaou tests at standard of care visits and was assessed for the presence of HR HPV and/or HPV types 16 and 18. All women with cytology results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or greater underwent colposcopic examination and biopsies were collected. Test results were compared with local colposcopy and histology results from a central pathology review panel.There were 1347 subjects with complete data sets of cytology, HR HPV, colposcopy, and histology included in the analysis of the HPV HR test. Sensitivity of the HPV HR test for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ among women with ASC-US cytology was 92.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.1-96.9) and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.1% (95% CI: 98.1-99.6). Sensitivity for detection of > or =CIN 3 in women with ASC-US was 100% (95% CI: 85.1-100) and the NPV was 100% (95% CI: 99.4-100). The specificity of the test for detection of > or =CIN 2 and > or =CIN 3 was 44.2% (95% CI: 41.5-46.9) and 43% (95% CI: 40.3-45.7), respectively. The HPV 16/18 genotyping test also performed as expected in women with ASC-US cytology who were positive for HR HPV.The Cervista HPV HR test can be clinically used for detecting HR HPV types in conjunction with cervical cytology for use in triage of women with ASC-US cytology during routine cervical cancer screening.
