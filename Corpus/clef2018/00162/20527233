The effects of genital schistosoma haematobium on human papillomavirus and the development of cervical neoplasia after five years in a Zimbabwean population. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for cervical cancer and genital Schistosoma haematobium infection has been hypothesized to be an additional co-factor or even an independent risk factor for cervical neoplasia. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of schistosomiasis on HPV persistence and development of cell atypia in a group of rural Zimbabwean women with confirmed high-risk HPV.A five-year follow-up was done among women previously included in a study on genital schistosomiasis. Women who had high-risk HPV at baseline were invited after 5 years for examination of cell atypia, genital schistosomiasis, and high-risk HPV. Both vaginal lavage samples (low-cost) and cervix brush samples (high-cost) were obtained for further analysis.Thirty-seven women were re-examined. Genital Schistosoma haematobium of a minimum of five years' duration was associated with the development high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, but not with persistent high-risk HPV. There was a high concordance between the brush and vaginal lavage (96.3% agreement, kappa 0.93) however, the number of beta-globin negative vaginal lavage samples was unacceptably high.Findings warrant an exploration in a larger longitudinal study where a vaginal swab should be explored.
