Acculturation and HPV infection among Latinas in the United States. To describe the relationship between acculturation and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among diverse US Latinas, a group at high risk for cervical cancer.Using survey and medical testing data from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we examined the relationship between acculturation level and HPV infection among diverse Latinas (n=503) and Mexican American women (n=442). Multivariable logistic regression was performed using infection with any type of HPV and with high-risk oncogenic genotypes as outcome variables.More acculturated Mexican American women were more likely to be infected with high-risk HPV than less acculturated women. In multivariate analyses, Mexican Americans with higher levels of self-rated English language ability (2.48 OR, 95% CI: 1.42-4.33) with birth in the US (2.07 OR, 95% CI: 1.03-4.16)Higher acculturation levels related to more frequent infection with high-risk HPV genotypes and other STIs among US Mexican American women. This association may in part be due to engagement in sexual behaviors.
