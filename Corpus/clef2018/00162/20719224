Quality assessment for human papillomavirus testing. There are over 30 commercial, as well as numerous in-house assays, available for human papillomavirus testing. Laboratories performing such assays would need to assess accuracy and reproducibility of their results by incorporating ongoing internal control as well as participating in external quality-assurance schemes (EQAS) as part of their quality assurance program. Several EQAS are available and participation in which is a requirement for laboratories engaged in HPV testing. It is important that laboratories select the appropriate panels for detection of targeted types covered by assay used. Failure to do so can possibly alter patient management and increase the cost of treatment.
