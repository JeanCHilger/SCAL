Update on current care guidelines. Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of cytological changes in the cervix, vagina and vulva. Approximately 150 cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in Finland annually. Both incidence and mortality have decreased by 80% since organised screening began. Recently, screening based on primary HPV-testing with Pap-smear triage has been shown to be more sensitive and more specific among women over 35 years old in randomised studies and thus may be implemented in routine. Abnormal findings in Pap smears indicate management. Confirmed CIN1 lesions are followed up and CIN2 and worse lesions treated. Follow-up after treatment should be reliably arranged, because elevated risk of cancer remains over 20 years after treatment. Quality control is of utmost importance.
