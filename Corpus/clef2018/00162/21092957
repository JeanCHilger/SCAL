Prevalence and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus in women with cervical cancer or high-grade precancerous lesions in Chengdu, western China. To study the prevalence and genotype distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) among women with cervical cancer or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) in western China.Cervical cast-off cells from 144 women with cervical cancer and 63 women with HSIL were tested for HPV genotypes using an oligonucleotide microarray.The overall HPV prevalence was 80.6% in cases of carcinoma and 61.9% in cases of HSIL. The most common genotypes were HPV-16 (carcinoma, 68.1% HSIL, 34.9%) and HPV-58 (carcinoma, 8.3%The prevalence of HPV-16 and HPV-58 was high. This finding may help to improve HPV vaccination and cervical cancer prevention programs in western China.
