Colposcopy prediction of progression in human papillomavirus infections with minor cervical lesions. To evaluate the risk of progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or 3 in women with positive human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and low-grade (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), borderline (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), or no cervical lesions, and to determine the accuracy of initial colposcopy to predict progression.Women with HPV infection and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, atypical squamous cells, or normal cytology were recruited and grouped according to cytologic or histologic diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were histologic CIN 2 or 3, previous cervical cancer and HPV infection, cervical disease, or treatment for CIN 2 or 3 in the past 3 years. Four-hundred sixty-five women were included and monitored by cytology, Hybrid Capture-2 test, and colposcopy every 6 months. Colposcopy results were described as normal, with minor or major changes, and lesion size was recorded in quadrants.Forty-three women (9.3%) had progression to CIN 2 or 3. No significant differences were found in rate of progression between women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, atypical squamous cells, or negative results (8.2%, 13.4%, and 9.8%, respectively P=.679). Neither colposcopy pattern (P=.284) nor lesion size (P=.170) at recruitment provided any information on the risk of progression. History of cervical lesion and worsening of the colposcopy pattern during follow-up were associated with progression (P<.001).Initial colposcopy findings do not provide relevant information on the risk of progression in HPV-positive women with minor or no cervical lesions. These women have a similar risk of progression and should benefit from the same follow-up strategies.
