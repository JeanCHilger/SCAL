Screening for cancer of the cervix with simultaneous pap smear and colposcopy. The efficacy of pap smear and colposcopy. Some Japanese institutes have been performing a population screening program for cervix cancer involving the simultaneous use of Pap smear and colposcopy. This program may be a good model for evaluating the efficacy of Pap smears and colposcopy.The subjects included 2,000 women who underwent primary screening at the Kanagawa Health Service Association.1) The incidence of ACF (atypical colposcopic findings) was 3.6%, whereas that of abnormal Pap smears (ASC-US and above) was 1.1% 2) Of 88 women who showed abnormal findings on Pap smear and/or colposcopy, only three cases appeared abnormal in both methods, i.e., the two methods were complementaryThe sensitivity of the Pap smear for detecting mild dysplasia is low, whereas that of colposcopy is high. However, colposcopy may not be suitable for primary screening due to its high UCF. The low sensitivity of Pap smears may be improved by repetition or adding ancillary HPV testing.
