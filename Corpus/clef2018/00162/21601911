Follow-up outcomes for a large cohort of US women with negative imaged liquid-based cytology findings and positive high risk human papillomavirus test results. This study aimed to follow a large group of US women with negative computer-imaged liquid-based cytology (LBC) and positive high risk (hr) HPV DNA results.Negative LBC and positive hrHPV cases were identified between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009. Cytologic and histopathologic follow-up results, repeat HPV results, and prior history were analyzed.1099 Patients with negative LBC and positive hrHPV results were identified. Eight hundred sixty-nine had repeat Pap or histopathologic follow-up results. Average age was 41.2 years. Average follow-up was 23.2 months. Two hundred ninety of 869 had colposcopic examination and biopsies, including 33 diagnostic excisional procedures and 10 hysterectomies. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (CIN1/LSIL) and more severe lesions (CIN1/LSIL+) were detected in 211 of 689 (24.3%). CIN2+ was diagnosed in 21 (2.4%) (1 VAIN3, 2 adenocarcinoma in situ, 1 invasive cervical adenocarcinoma). Six hundred six had repeat HPV tests and 200 had multiple repeat HPV tests. More LSIL/CIN1+ was identified with repeat positive HPV results than with repeat negative HPV results (P<0.001). LSIL/CIN1+ was detected more often with a history of LSIL/CIN1+ than with a history of negative Paps (P<0.001). Eight of 105 (7.6%) cytology-negative HPV-positive patients tested positive for HPV 16 and/or HPV 18.This is the largest study documenting follow-up on US cytology-negative hrHPV-positive patients screened with now widely utilized FDA-cleared methods of ciLBC and hrHPV testing. Of 869 patients followed for an average of almost 2 years, 20 cases of high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (2.3%) and one case of endocervical adenocarcinoma were detected. 90.5%(190/210) of intraepithelial neoplasias detected during follow-up were CIN1.
