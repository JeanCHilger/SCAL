Rate of detection of high-risk HPV with two assays in women ≥ 30 years of age. High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence rates, as determined by the Cervista(®) HPV HR test, in women aged ≥30 years in a routine screening population have not been studied.The primary objective of this study was to estimate HR HPV prevalence in women negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) cytology using the CERVISTA HPV HR test. The study also compared HR HPV prevalence rates in women aged ≥30 years and NILM cytology using the CERVISTA HPV HR and Hybrid Capture(®) 2 (hc2) tests.A multi-center study was conducted to analyze HR HPV prevalence rates using the CERVISTA HPV HR test from residual ThinPrep(®) specimens. HR HPV positive rates were determined for hc2 percent agreement between the CERVISTA HPV HR and the hc2 tests were reported.HR HPV prevalence rates among women with NILM cytology were not statistically different between the CERVISTA HPV HR and hc2 tests (6.92% [98/1417] versus 5.93% [84/1417], respectively P>0.05). The overall percent agreement between the tests was 95.3% (1351/1417There is no statistically significant difference between HR HPV prevalence rates obtained with the CERVISTA HPV HR and hc2 tests in women aged ≥30 years with NILM cytology.
