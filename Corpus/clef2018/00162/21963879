A clinical study of cervical dysplasia in long-term survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This retrospective study examined the prevalence of and risk factors for cervical dysplasia and genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in 89 female recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) between 1985 and 2005 who survived for more than 5 years after transplantation. All patients underwent regular gynecologic examination and cervical cytological testing. The incidence rates of cervical cytological abnormalities and HPV infection were calculated. Various clinical parameters were evaluated for association with cytological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) posttransplantation to identify risk factors for cervical dysplasia. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for cervical dysplasia after adjusting for confounding factors. Sixty-one of the 89 patients (68.5%) had cervical cytological abnormalities of varying grades, including atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US 31.5%
