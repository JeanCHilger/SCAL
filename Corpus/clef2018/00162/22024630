Mode of delivery influences the regression of abnormal cervical cytology. The purpose was to investigate the influence of delivery mode on the postpartum regression of abnormal cervical cytology.A retrospective review was conducted of 64 pregnant women with abnormal cervical cytology at Yonsei University Health System in Korea between 2001 and 2008. A Papanicolaou smear and pathological data were categorized into three groups by cervical intraepithelial neoplasia classification. Postpartum evaluation was taken 3-6 months after delivery. The regression rates of cervical cytologic findings were compared between the vaginal delivery group and Cesarean section group. p < 0.05 was considered significant.Of the 64 women, 45 (70.3%) were delivered vaginally and 19 (29.7%) by cesarean section. No significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to age, gestational age, parity, smoking, and HPV (human papilloma virus) screening. Postpartum regression was shown in 39 (92.9%) women who delivered vaginally and in 12 (63.2%) women who underwent cesarean section (p = 0.016). In the cesarean section group, 1 patient had progressed from CIN2 to microinvasive cancer and 2 patients from carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer.The rate of spontaneous regression of antepartum abnormal cervical cytology was higher after vaginal delivery.
