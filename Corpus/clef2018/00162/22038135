Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma. This overview summarizes pathogenetic and practical aspects of (sub-)classification of cervical glandular (pre-)neoplasias and, inter alia, calls into question the usefulness of grading. In the context of the differential diagnosis of benign "imitations", the phenotypic variability of glandular precancerous lesions and carcinomas is described as well as the use of special tests to distinguish them. With regard to carcinomas, the differential diagnosis of well-differentiated neoplasias is addressed including "minimal deviation" adenocarcinoma (MDA, malignant adenoma), carcinomas with endometrioid or villoglandular morphology, and mesonephric hyper- and neoplasias. Furthermore, knowledge of HPV-negative glandular (pre-)neoplasias is covered including "gastric-type" adenocarcinomas and diagnostic algorithms for discriminating between primary and secondary cervical adenocarcinomas. Finally, comments are offered on the difficulties in recognizing early invasive adenocarcinomas, especially also the pitfalls inherent in determining the depth of invasion.
