Comparison between two human papillomavirus genotyping assays targeting the L1 or E6/E7 region in cervical cancer biopsies. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is increasingly used in cervical cancer prevention strategies, and a variety of HPV genotyping assays have been developed. We aimed to compare the performance of two HPV genotyping techniques in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens from a series of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases.Archival FFPE tissue blocks from 78 SCC cases were initially considered. DNA was extracted from dewaxed tissue sections and tested with the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra assay (Innogenetics), and the F-HPV typing kit (Genomed) targeting the L1 and E6/E7 regions, respectively.The INNO-LiPA assay showed a higher sensitivity (98.6%) than the F-HPV assay (78.6%). A total of 12 (17.1%) biopsies showed multiple-type infections evidenced by at least one assay. Among the SCC cases tested, HPV16 and/or 18 were detected in 70% of the cases, and 18.4% of them had multiple infections with other high-risk types.Our results suggest that the INNO-LiPA assay has a better performance than the F-HPV in FFPE specimens, probably due to its smaller amplicon size and the wider range of detectable HPV types. The prevalence of multiple infections could be higher than previously reported, as evidenced by the combination of the two assays.
