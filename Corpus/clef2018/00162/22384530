Glucose, body mass index and pre-neoplastic lesions in the cervix. The obesity and abnormal blood glucose level has been associated with cervical cancer development however, few studies have been performed about this relation.Evaluate the blood glucose levels and body mass index (BMI) in women with human papilloma virus infection (HPV-I) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN-I).Transversal study of 44 women diagnosed with HPV-I and CIN-I from September to December 2010 in Dysplasia Clinic of Regional Hospital of Guzman City, Federal entity of Jalisco, Mexico. The diagnoses were carried by biopsy of cervix, glucose test results were evaluated by spectrophotometry and determinate the BMI.The 18% (n=8) of women were without injury, 41% (n=18), with HPV-I and 41% (n=18) CIN-I. High blood glucose was observed in GIN-I versus without injury in the cervix (p = 0.05), the correlation was OR = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.090-6.52). The young women (19-35 years) were 17% high glucose, 28% normal glucose and 55% low glucose. In group of the medium age (35-65 years) 23% showed high glucose, 50% normal and 27% low. The BMI was not relation with diagnosis, although in the age (young versus age median p=0.001).These results support the proposal about the high levels of glucose in plasma and obesity could be risk cofactors in the development of preneoplasic lesion of cervix.
