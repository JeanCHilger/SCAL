Factors affecting the clearance of high-risk human papillomavirus infection and the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This study aimed to identify factors that predict clearance of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or higher, in women with normal cervical histology or CIN 1.A retrospective analysis was performed  on 817 high-risk HPV-infected women with histologically verified CIN 1 or normal cervical histology. Patients were followed-up for a maximum of 24 months. Cervical HPV DNA tests were performed at every visit.At the end of followup, 648/817 (79.3%) patients were free from HPV infection  and 66/817 patients (8.1%) progressed to CIN 2 or higher. Age, parity, cytology and viral load at diagnosis were significantly and inversely associated with HPV clearance. Cytology, viral load and presence of CIN 1 lesions were significantly associated with lesion progression.Cytology and high-risk HPV viral load may be useful markers for the likelihood of high-risk HPV clearance and lesion progression. Histological status, parity and marital status may also be useful factors to consider when predicting progression.
