Advances in peptide-based human papillomavirus therapeutic vaccines. Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer in women worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for all cases of cervical cancer. Commercial prophylactic HPV vaccines are now available, but unfortunately these vaccines have no therapeutic effect against established HPV infections. In order to accelerate the control of cervical cancer and treat established HPV infections, it is necessary to develop therapeutic vaccines to eradicate HPV by generating cell-mediated immunity against HPV infected cells. Two HPV-encoded early proteins, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, are the preferred targets because they are consistently expressed in virtually all cervical cancer cells and are necessary for the induction and maintenance of HPV-associated disease. A variety of vaccine strategies have been employed targeting immune responses to these proteins. Peptide-based vaccines are a promising strategy for the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines because of their safety, stability, and ease of production. This review summarizes the prospects of peptide-based vaccines for the treatment of established HPV infections. We address the challenges that scientists currently face for developing peptide-based vaccines and explore feasible strategies for improving the potency of the induced immune response with the aim of treating established HPV infections.
