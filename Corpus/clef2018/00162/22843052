Human papillomavirus infection in Brazilian women with  normal cervical cytology. We examined the prevalence of human papillomavirus  (HPV) infection in a sample of Brazilian women presenting normal cervical  cytology. Possible interactions between patient characteristics and HPV  infection were analyzed in order to provide background data to improve cervical  cancer screening and prophylaxis. Cervical samples of 399 women, received for  routine evaluation in the Health Department of Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil, were  subjected to HPV-DNA testing by PCR with MY09/11 primers. HPV-positive  specimens were typed by RFLP. A structured epidemiological questionnaire was  administered to each woman. HPV prevalence among these cytologically normal  women was 11%. Twelve viral types were detected, the most common being HPV-16,  -6, -61, -83, and -66. HPV was more prevalent in younger women high-risk viral  types were detected in 61% of the infected women and 27% of the infected women  had multiple HPV infections. Significant associations of HPV infection were  found with age, literacy, residence, marital status, lifetime number of sexual  partners, and parity. We detected a great diversity of HPV types in women with  normal cytology. This kind of information about local populations is useful for  HPV prevention and vaccination strategies.
