Differential DNA copy number aberrations in the progression of cervical             lesions to invasive cervical carcinoma. Host genomic alterations in addition to human papillomavirus (HPV) are needed             for cervical precursor lesions to progress to invasive cancer because only a small             percentage of women infected by the virus develop disease. However, the genomic             alterations during the progression of cervical lesions have not been systematically             examined. The aim of this study was to identify differential genomic alterations             among cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and cervical squamous             cell carcinoma (SCC). Genomic alterations were examined for 15 cases each of CIN1,             CIN2, CIN3 and SCC by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH).             The chromosomal regions showing significant differential in DNA copy number aberrations             (DCNAs) among CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and SCC were successfully identified by resampling-based             t-test. The chromosomal regions of 5q35.3 and 2q14.3 showed significant DCNAs             between CIN1 and CIN2, and between CIN2 and CIN3, respectively, while a significant             difference in DCNAs between CIN3 and SCC was observed at 1q24.3, 3p14.1, 3p14.2,             5q13.2, 7p15.3, 7q22.1 and 13q32.3. In addition, the status of DCNAs in 1q43,             2p11.2, 6p11.2, 7p21.1, 7p14.3, 10q24.1, 13q22.3, 13q34 and 16p13.3 was conserved             throughout the progression of CIN to SCC. The presence of differential and common             DCNAs among CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 and SCC supports that the CIN progression may include             continual clonal selection and evolution. This approach also identified 34 probe             sets consistently overexpressed when amplified, suggesting an unbiased identification             of candidate genes in SCC during cervical cancer progression.
