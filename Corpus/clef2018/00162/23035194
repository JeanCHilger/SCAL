Comparison of hybrid capture II, linear array, and a bead-based multiplex genotyping assay for detection of human papillomavirus in women with negative pap test results and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Many methods with different levels of analytical sensitivity and clinical specificity have been developed to detect the presence of high-risk (HR) types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical samples. The Hybrid Capture II (HC-II) assay is broadly used for primary screening. In addition, several HPV genotyping assays, based on PCR methods, display higher sensitivity than the HC-II and are also used in screening programs. We evaluated the performance of three HPV DNA tests, namely, the HC-II, the Linear Array (LA) HPV genotyping assay, and an HPV type-specific E7 PCR bead-based multiplex genotyping assay (TS-MPG) that is a laboratory-developed method for the detection of HPV, in 94 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and in cytological samples from 86 women with a negative Pap test. The HPV prevalence with the TS-MPG assay was increased compared to the prevalence with the LA and HC-II assays. The HPV DNA prevalence in women with ASC-US was greater with the TS-MPG assay (46.2%) than with the LA (36.3%) and HC-II (29.7%) assays. The HPV DNA prevalence in the control group was greater with the TS-MPG assay (32.1%) than with the LA assay (10.7%). Two women with ASC-US who were HPV DNA negative by the HC-II and positive by the TS-MPG or/and LA assays had lesions that progressed to low-grade squamous intraepithelial and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. This study shows that the TS-MPG assay exhibited higher analytical sensitivity than the LA and HC-II assays for the detection of HPV DNA, which reduces the potential to incorrectly identify a woman's HPV infection status.
