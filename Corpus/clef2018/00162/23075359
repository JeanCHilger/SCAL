Diagnostic accuracy of self-collected human papillomavirus specimens as a primary screen for cervical cancer. The aim of the study was to compare the sensitivity of self-collected with clinician-collected human papillomavirus (HPV) tests and cytology for cervical cancer. A total of 250 non-pregnant, 25-60-year-old women from Leon, Nicaragua, self-collected vaginal specimens for HPV and received a pelvic examination for cytology and reflex HPV. All participants underwent colposcopy and completed questionnaires regarding demographic and medical information. The sensitivities of self-collected brushes, self-collected swabs and clinician-collected HPV tests were 25%, 16.7%, and 16.7%, respectively, with colposcopy as the gold standard and 30%, 22.2% and 40% when cytology was the gold standard. Agreement between self-collection methods was significant (Îº=0.84, p<0.001). Although utilisation of colposcopy in every participant resulted in lower sensitivities, the self-collected tests surpassed cytology and significantly agreed with the clinician-collected results. Further clarification of the sensitivity will be required to employ self-collection for cervical cancer screening in low resource areas like rural Nicaragua.
