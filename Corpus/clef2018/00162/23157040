Screening of cervical cancer: 27 years experience in six Republics of Panama. Between the years of 1983 and 2010, a program of screening of patients was conducted in six of the Republics of Panama, applying cytology, colposcopy, and directed biopsy when required. In the community of Pocri de Los Santos, a tour of 33 rural areas was included in 27 years of consecutive coverage. This allowed to confirm that application that screening was successful, resulting in initial, evolutionary, or final diagnoses. These were of extreme importance because they indicated the disease and its response to conservative treatments applied and to the fact that the cancer evolution was nil.
