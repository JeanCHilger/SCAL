Expression of LRIG1 and LRIG3 correlates with human papillomavirus status             and patient survival in cervical adenocarcinoma. The incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma, which accounts for 10-20% of all             cervical cancers, has increased continuously in developed countries during the             last two decades, unlike squamous cell cervical carcinoma. This increasing trend,             noted particularly among women under the age of 40 years, has occurred despite             extensive cytological Pap smear screening. A deeper understanding of the etiology             of cervical adenocarcinoma, better preventive measures and reliable prognostic             markers are urgently needed. The human leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like             domains (LRIG) gene family includes: LRIG1, LRIG2 and LRIG3. LRIG expression has             proven to be of prognostic value in different types of human cancers, including             breast cancer, early stage invasive squamous cervical cancer, cutaneous squamous             cell carcinoma, oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma. LRIG1 functions as a tumor             suppressor, while less is known about the functions of LRIG2 and LRIG3. This study             evaluated the expression of the three LRIG proteins in tumor specimens from 86             women with pure cervical adenocarcinoma by immunohistochemistry. Possible correlations             between LRIG expression and known prognostic factors, including human papillomavirus             (HPV) status, FIGO stage and histology were investigated. Patient survival data             were collected retrospectively and the possible prognostic value of LRIG protein             expression was investigated. High staining intensity of LRIG1 and high fraction             of LRIG3-positive cells were significantly associated with patient survival, and             positive correlations were found between LRIG1 and LRIG3 staining intensity and             HPV status. Thus, the LRIG proteins may be important determinants of cervical             adenocarcinoma progression and their diagnostic and prognostic potential should             be studied further.
