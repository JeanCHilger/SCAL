Cervical cancer prevention in Switzerland: the challenges of the vaccine era. In Switzerland, cervical cancer screening has been introduced in the 60s and has allowed a significant reduction in the incidence and mortality of this disease. More recently, the HPV vaccine was introduced with public target of girls aged 11 to 14 years. Gradually, this vaccinated population will reach the age of screening. Vaccinated population will present less HPV infection and less cytological abnormalities and consequence will conduct to a lower performance of cytology. In this context, the HPV test with its objectivity will become the most suitable means for cervical cancer screening. The aim of this paper was to conduct a synthesis of current knowledge about primary and secondary prevention of cervical cancer and define the best options for the future.
