A cross-sectional analysis of lower genital tract intraepithelial neoplasia in immune-compromised women with an abnormal Pap. Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections can cause intraepithelial neoplasia of the lower genital tract. Immune-compromised women have higher rates for all lower genital tract intraepithelial neoplasia. We wish to study the distribution of genital intraepithelial neoplasia in women with and without an immune system.The study consisted of 343 women with an abnormal genital lesion or cervical cytology who were referred to a gynecologic oncologist. All patients underwent vulva, vaginal, cervical and anal colposcopy. Any lesion detected was biopsied. Demographic and medical data were collected. The Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between immunosuppression status and various variables, including sites of intraepithelial neoplasia.Immune-compromised women (N = 33) are more likely than immune-competent women (N = 310) to have intraepithelial neoplasia of the vulva (p < 0.05) and vagina (p < 0.05), but not more likely to have intraepithelial neoplasia of the anus or cervix. Immune-compromised women are more likely than immune-competent women to have multifocal intraepithelial neoplasia (p < 0.001). In addition, immune-compromised women are more likely to have higher grade disease of the vulva and vagina (p < 0.05), and no more likely to have higher grade disease on the cervix or anus than immune-competent women.Women with conditions suppressing the immune system are at higher risk for HPV-related disease outside of the cervix and for worse HPV-related diseases than immune-competent women. This study highlights the need for vigilant evaluation of the complete lower genital tract in women with immune-compromised systems.
