Clinical utility of HPV testing. Testing for human papilloma virus (HPV) has been shown to be more sensitive than cervical cytology in detecting both high-grade and low-grade dysplasia. When screening for cervical cancer, unfortunately, the HPV test lacks specificity and has limited its usefulness as a primary screening modality for cervical cancer. In this chapter, we will review HPV and its role in cervical cancer, the utilization of HPV testing in current practice, and the possible future utilization of HPV and its role in screening.
