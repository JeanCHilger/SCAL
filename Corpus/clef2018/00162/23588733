Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 mRNA as a triage test after detection of HPV 16 and HPV 18 DNA. High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection provides high sensitivity but low specificity for moderate-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse histological identification. A prospective study evaluated mRNA testing efficacy for predicting this histological diagnosis in case of HPV 16 and/or 18 DNA detection. A total of 165 endocervical samples harboring HPV 16 and/or 18 DNA were tested with NucliSENS-EasyQ® HPV E6/E7-mRNA-assay (Biomerieux, Marcy l´Etoile, France). Women with cytological alterations were referred to colposcopy (n = 111). Moderate-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse was diagnosed in 25.8% of women presenting atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and in 89.8% of women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. mRNA sensitivity was 81.3% and 84.1%, respectively. Specificity was 52.2%, and 80.0%, respectively. Negative predictive value (NPV) was 88.9% in undetermined or low-grade squamous lesions. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 97.4% in high-grade squamous lesions. mRNA reduced colposcopies by 44.3% in undetermined or low-grade squamous lesions. Direct treatment of mRNA-positive cases reduced 77.5% of colposcopies in high-grade squamous lesions. Women without cytological alterations were followed for 18 months (n = 35), and moderate-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse was diagnosed in 34.3% mRNA sensitivity and specificity were 83.3% and 86.9%, respectively. PPV and NPV were 76.9% and 90.9%, respectively for predicting moderate-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse in 18 months. mRNA reduced the number of visits for follow-up in 62.2%. In conclusion, NucliSENS-EasyQ® HPV E6/E7-mRNA-assay (Biomerieux) can serve as a triage test in case of HPV 16 and/or 18 DNA detection.
