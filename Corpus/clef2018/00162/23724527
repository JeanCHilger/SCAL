Liquid based cytology and HPV DNA testing in a Greek population compared to colposcopy and histology. Screening for cervical cancer in Greece is still unorganised and based on self- motivation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cytological findings from a large observational population sample, originating from Western Athens, in association with reflex DNA test, colposcopic estimation, and final histologic diagnosis. The rate of invasive carcinoma, both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, is indicative of a largely unscreened population. In this study, the estimated overall prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) was 41.1%, with HPV positivity at 37.4% of cytologically normal women. HPV testing did not seem to improve sensitivity of cytology for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) cases in identifying CIN 2+ lesions, but outperformed cytology in detecting CIN3+ for cytological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) cases. For HGSIL cases sensitivity of colposcopy for detecting CIN3+ was comparable to cytology.
