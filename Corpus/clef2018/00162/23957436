Human papillomavirus infections among Hungarian female sex workers. The purpose of this study was to assess the human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence in cervical, oropharyngeal and anal samples of the high-risk population of Hungarian female sex workers (FSWs). HPV testing of swab specimens from FSWs (n = 34) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology was performed. Results were compared with control group (n = 52) matched for age. Questionnaires were used to obtain data regarding participants' sexual behaviour. Data were analysed using SPSS. HPV DNA was detected in at least one location in a great majority of FSWs (82.4%), compared with 46.2% of the general female population (P < 0.05). Both the cervical and the anal samples of sex workers showed higher infection rates than those of controls (64.7% vs. 34.6% and 50.0% vs. 15.4%, respectively, P < 0.05). High-risk HPV prevalence was also significantly higher in sex workers (55.9% vs. 25.0%, P < 0.05). A significantly higher proportion of FSWs had a history of genital warts (26.5% vs. 3.8%, P < 0.05). The results suggest that condom use may not result in adequate protection from HPV infection. The high infection rates among FSWs should be viewed as a priority group for HPV and cervical cancer prevention programmes since they are sources of HPV infection for the general population.
