Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL-H) is a unique category of cytologic abnormality associated with distinctive HPV and histopathologic CIN 2+ detection rates. To examine data correlating high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) results in patients with both low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) cytology findings (LSIL-H) with follow-up histopathology.A total of 494 LSIL-H ThinPrep (Hologic, Marlborough, MA) cases with hrHPV testing were identified. Histopathologic follow-up was available in 347 patients.Among 347 patients with follow-up histopathology after LSIL-H cytology and hrHPV testing, 90.5% tested hrHPV positive. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 was diagnosed in 29.4% and CIN 1 in 53.6%. CIN 2/3 was diagnosed in significantly more patients with hrHPV-positive LSIL-H than following hrHPV-negative LSIL-H results. Compared with published institutional data, LSIL-H had significantly lower hrHPV and histopathologic CIN 2/3+ rates (90.5% and 29.4%, with no cervical cancers) than high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (95.7% and 70.5%, with 2.4% cervical cancers) but higher rates than LSIL (80.2% and 12.9%) or atypical squamous cells/cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) (54.3% and 17.2%). Whereas CIN 2/3 detection rates were similar in HPV-positive LSIL-H and HPV-positive ASC-H, CIN 2/3 findings were more likely with HPV-negative LSIL-H than with HPV-negative ASC-H.LSIL-H is a unique category of cytologic abnormality associated with distinctive hrHPV and CIN 2/3+ diagnostic rates.
