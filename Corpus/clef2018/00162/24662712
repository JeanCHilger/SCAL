A three component mix of thioredoxin-L2 antigens elicits broadly neutralizing responses against oncogenic human papillomaviruses. Current human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines based on major capsid protein L1 virus-like particles (VLP) provide potent type-specific protection against vaccine-type viruses (mainly HPV16 and 18), but cross-protect against only a small subset of the approximately 15 oncogenic HPV types. It is estimated that L1-VLP vaccines, which require a fairly complex production system and are still quite costly, fail to cover 20-30% of HPV cervical cancers worldwide, especially in low-resource countries. Alternative antigens relying on the N-terminal region of minor capsid protein L2 are intrinsically less immunogenic but capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing responses. We previously demonstrated the enhanced immunogenicity and cross-neutralization potential of an easily produced recombinant L2 antigen bearing the HPV16 L2(20-38) peptide epitope internally fused to bacterial thioredoxin (Trx). However, antibodies induced by Trx-HPV16 L2(20-38) failed to cross-neutralize notable high-risk HPV types such as HPV31. In the present work, the Trx-L2 design was modified to include L2 sequence information from the highly divergent HPV31 and HPV51 types in addition to HPV16, with the aim of extending cross-neutralization. Multivalent antigens comprising L2(20-38) peptides from all three HPV types on a single Trx scaffold molecule were compared to a mixture of the three type-specific monovalent Trx-L2 antigens. While multivalent antigens as well as the mixed antigens elicited similar anti-HPV16 neutralization titers, cross-reactive responses against HPV31 and HPV51 were of higher magnitude and more robust for the latter formulation. A mixture of monovalent Trx-L2 antigens thus represents a candidate lead for the development of a broadly cross-protective, low-cost second-generation anti-HPV vaccine.
