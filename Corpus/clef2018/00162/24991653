Factors Associated With Adherence to Follow-up Colposcopy. Understanding the gaps in knowledge about human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, transmission, and health consequences and factors associated with the knowledge gap is an essential first step for the development of interventions to improve adherence to follow-up among women with abnormal Pap smears.To examine the relationship between knowledge about HPV and adherence to scheduled colposcopic evaluation and variables related to lack of knowledge among women with abnormal Pap tests.Telephone surveys were conducted with women who attended their scheduled appointments (adherers) and women who did not attend their appointments (nonadherers).The multivariable analyses indicate that lower HPV knowledge was independently associated with nonadherence to follow-up, controlling for race and education level. Factors related to lower knowledge scores included non-white race, lower education, and lack of health insurance at the time of the scheduled appointment.Lack of knowledge of HPV was related to nonadherence among women scheduled for colposcopic evaluation.Health education interventions that deliver complex information about HPV and cervical cancer should be in a format that is accessible and understandable to the women who are most at risk of being nonadherent.
