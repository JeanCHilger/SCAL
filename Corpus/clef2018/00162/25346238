Follow-up and clinical significance of unsatisfactory liquid-based Papanicolaou tests. To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have examined adherence to recommended guidelines for follow-up and outcomes after an unsatisfactory Papanicolaou (Pap) test (UPT) with liquid-based technologies.Within 4 US health plans, the median time to follow-up and the percentage of patients with follow-up testing by 120 days was calculated after a UPT. Multivariable analyses evaluated the association between clinical factors and follow-up testing. The authors compared the risk of a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of type 2 or worse (CIN2+) after a UPT with the risk after a satisfactory Pap test while controlling for study site, test year, and other covariates.A total of 634,644 Pap tests performed between 2004 and 2010 were included in the current study. Of 1442 UPTs, 53.4% had follow-up testing within 120 days follow-up differed across the health plans (P<.001) and was found to be higher among patients aged <50 years (57.2% vs 48.8%Various clinical factors associated with the risk of CIN2+ appear to influence the receipt of follow-up after a UPT. HPV test results in patients with UPTs might be used in follow-up strategies specifically, a negative test result might reduce the urgency for repeat Pap testing.
