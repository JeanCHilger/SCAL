Human papillomavirus and chlamydia trachomatis infections in rheumatoid arthritis under anti-TNF therapy: an observational study. The objective of this study was to evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections in RA patients pre- and post-TNF blocker. Fifty female RA patients (ACR criteria), who were eligible to anti-TNF therapy [n = 50 at baseline (BL) and n = 45 after 6 months of treatment (6 M)], and 50 age-matched healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. They were assessed for demographic data, gynecologic, sexual, cervical cytology and histological evaluations, disease parameters and current treatment. HPV DNA and CT DNA testing in cervical specimens were done using Hybrid Capture II assays. At BL, the median current age of RA patients and controls was 49 (18-74) versus 49 (18-74) years, p = 1.0. A trend of lower frequency of HPV infection was observed in AR patients pre-anti-TNF compared with controls (14 vs. 30%, p = 0.054). Further evaluation of AR patients with and without HPV infection before anti-TNF therapy showed that the former group had higher frequency of sexual intercourses (100 vs. 48%, p = 0.014), higher median number of sexual partners [1 (1-1) vs. 0 (0-1), p = 0.032] and higher frequency of abnormal cervical cytology (43 vs. 7%, p = 0.029). Current age, disease duration, disease parameters and treatments were alike in both groups (p > 0.05). At 6 M after TNF blockage, HPV infection remained unchanged in five patients, whereas two became negative and one additional patient turned out to be positive (p = 1.0). CT infection was uniformly negative in RA patients pre- and post-TNF blockage and in controls. Anti-TNF does not seem to increase short-term risk of exacerbation and/or progression of HPV and CT infections in RA patients.
