Genotyping of human papillomavirus in women under 25 years old treated in the screening program for cervical cancer. In Chile, cervical cancer (CC) is the second leading cause of death from malignancy in women. The main causal agent of cervical cancer is the human papillomavirus (HPV). This virus is the most common sexually transmitted infection among sexually active youth. An early onset of sexual life increases the chances of HPV infection this may involve a possible early development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and CC, creating a major public health problem.To present HPV frequency in women under the age of 25, treated in the CC screening program and their follow-up after histopathological diagnosis.173 cervical samples were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and non-radioactive reverse hybridization (line blot).The overall frequency of HPV was 84.8%. HPV16 was the most prevalent. In 12.1% of women the cervical lesion persisted or progressed. 28.9% of women had irregular follow-up in this group, 88% were HPV(+) and 52% had no record of Pap smear in the past 3 years.The results reaffirm the usefulness of complementing the Pap and HPV detection as a primary screening tool in sexually active women. They also suggest the possibility of extending the age coverage of the national screening program.
