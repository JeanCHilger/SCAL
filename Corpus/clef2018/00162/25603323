Age-related changes in the diagnostic assessment of women with severe cervical lesions. To evaluate the effect of age on the diagnostic assessment of women with severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).This retrospective observational study included 338 consecutive women with a diagnosis of CIN3 on cone specimen. Patients were divided into three groups according to age: < 35 years (Group A), 35-49 years (Group B), and â‰¥ 50 years (Group C). Clinical and colposcopic variables were compared, and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution was measured.The most common HPV genotype was HPV-16 (63.65%), followed by HPV-33 (7%), HPV-18 (6.2%), and HPV-31 (5.4%). The rate of the following high-grade lesion predictors was lower in Group C than in Groups A and B: HPV-16 infections (55.9% vs. 75% vs. 70.9%, respectively, p = 0.022) high-grade colposcopic impression (29.4% vs. 51.8% vs. 51.7%, respectively, p < 0.0001)Women aged 50 years and older with CIN3 showed a significant reduction of high-grade lesion predictors along with physiological confounding cervical changes (transformation zone type 3 and endocervical lesion location). The diagnostic work-up of cervical lesions in older women should provide their potential consideration as a special population.
