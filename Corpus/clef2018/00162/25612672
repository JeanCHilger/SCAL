Pathogenesis of combined high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and adenocarcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix: human papillomavirus genotype and methylation status and immunohistochemical study. To determine the etiology of combined high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) of the uterine cervix, we examined human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes, methylation status of the HPV-16 L1 gene, and immunohistochemical staining pattern of Krt7 in 8 cases of combined HSIL and AIS. Overall, 6 (75%) of 8 patients with combined HSIL and AIS were infected by the same subtype of HPV in both HSIL and AIS (cases 1-5, HPV-16 and case 6, HPV-18), whereas 2 (25%) patients showed infection with different subtypes of HPV (case 7, HPV-31 and -18
