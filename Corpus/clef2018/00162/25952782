Human papillomavirus confers radiosensitivity in cancer cervix: a hypothesis toward a possible restoration of apoptotic pathways based on clinical outcomes. To evaluate if high baseline local human papillomavirus (HPV) titer confers radiosensitivity in cancer cervix. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the clinical outcomes.121 serial HPV titers from cervical smears of 21 patients were estimated during radiotherapy (RT) and correlated with RT dose-response curves, local response and local disease-free survival (LDFS).Local response (p = 0.04) and LDFS (p = 0.06) were better in high HPV than low HPV baseline group. On multivariate analysis, RT doses for 50% tumor regression and baseline HPV titer were the only predictors for LDFS.Serial reductions of HPV titers following RT could restore the HPV induced temporarily downregulated p53 and pRb apoptotic pathways resulting in radiosensitivity of these tumors.
