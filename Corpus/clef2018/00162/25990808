Cell mediated immunity against HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 peptides in women with incident CIN and in constantly HPV-negative women followed-up for 10-years. Virus-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays a role in the outcome of genital HPV infections. To cast further light on the question why most women clear their HPV infection while others develop high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), we analyzed HPV16 E2-, E6- and E7 -specific CMI in women who developed CIN during a 10-year follow-up of the Finnish Family HPV cohort.Overlapping 30-35 mer peptides covering the entire HPV16 E2-, E6- and E7 protein sequences were used for defining the lymphocyte proliferation capacity, cytokine production (IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and numbers of HPV16 -specific CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells in 10 women who developed CIN, and in 22 control women who tested constantly HPV-negative during the follow-up. HPV-specific CMI was related to the demographic data including sexual behavior, smoking and alcohol consumption.Women with CIN and their controls had similar T-cell mediated immunity against HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 peptide pools. However, nearly fourfold higher T-cell reactivity against common antigens was found in the CIN women than in the healthy donors (p = 0.001). HPV16 E6 stimulation resulted in higher IL-17A secretion in the controls than in the CIN women (p = 0.035). Smoking and use of alcohol affected the T-cell response to common antigens but not to HPV peptides (p = 0.032 and 0.045, respectively).While both the CIN women and controls exhibited an HPV16-specific CMI, IL-17A might be of importance in HPV induced pathology. The hyper-responsiveness of the CIN patients to common antigens needs further studies. Smoking and alcohol had no effect on HPV-specific CMI.
