MicroRNAs are involved in cervical cancer development, progression, clinical outcome and improvement treatment response (Review). Cervical cancer (CC) is the third most diagnosed cancer among females worldwide and the fourth cause of cancer-related mortality. Prophylactic HPV vaccines and traditional pap-smear screening are undoubtedly capable of decreasing the incidence and mortality of CC. However, a large number of females succumb to the disease each year due to late diagnosis and resistance to conventional treatments. Thus, it is necessary to identify new molecular markers to predict the clinical outcome and to design powerful treatments. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are involved in the modulation of several cell pathways associated with progression from pre-malignant to invasive and metastatic disease, increasing tumor malignancy. The aim of this review was to summarize the recent data that describe the important role of miRNAS involved in CC in order to determine their potential as prognostic biomarkers and as therapy targets. Studies of >40 miRNAs with roles in cancer regulation were identified. We also identified 17 miRNAs associated with progression, 12 involved with clinical outcome and 7 that improved CC treatment response. The present review is expected to broaden understanding of the functional role and potential clinical uses of miRNAs in CC.
