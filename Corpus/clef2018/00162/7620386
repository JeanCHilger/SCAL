Local therapy and adjuvant interferon therapy in genital papilloma virus infections. Is it possible to reduce the recurrence rates of HPV-positive genital tract lesions by systemic interferon alfa-2a in addition to local therapy?Thirty-three of 63 patients with first manifestation of papillomavirus infection or monolocal manifestation were treated by local therapy. The other 30 patients with recurrent or multiorgan infections received 3 courses with 12 x 10(6) IU interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously.For the remaining 47 patients (16 were lost to follow-up) we found a significantly lower recurrence rate of 21% (5 of 24) in the group of interferon-treated patients compared to 52% (12 of 23) of patients treated without interferon.The systemic treatment of HPV-positive genital tract lesions with interferon alfa-2a in addition to CO2 laser surgery or cone biopsy seems to reduce the recurrence rates of HPV-positive lesions.
