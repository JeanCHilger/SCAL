Association of papillomavirus infection and latent hyperprolactinemia in patients with dysplasia and preinvasive cancer of the cervix uteri. Gynecological screenings carried out in I, 247 females and supplemented by cytological examination of ectoendocervical mucosa smears established significantly higher rates of detection of cytological signs of papillomavirus infection (PVI), regardless of age, in cases of background pathologies of the uterine cervix (10.0%) than in females without detectable pathology of the ectocervix (3.6%). Females of reproductive age revealed a significantly higher frequency of PVI-associated dysplasia and preinvasive carcinoma (4.2%) than in pre- and postmenopausal women (2.8%). In 24 patients with a combination of dysplasia, cervical flat condylomas and PVI signs, thyroliberin load served to identify higher levels of latent prolactin production as compared to healthy controls, the basal concentrations of blood prolactin being identical. Electrosurgical conization of the cervix was performed in 98 cases of cervical dysplasia. Morphological examination of resected tissue confirmed the relationship between PVI infection and degree of dysplasia in cervical epithelium.
