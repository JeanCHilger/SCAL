Group-specific differentiation between high- and low-risk human papillomavirus genotypes by general primer-mediated PCR and two cocktails of oligonucleotide probes. In recent years, general primer-mediated PCR assays have been developed to detect a broad spectrum of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. In this study, a procedure enabling a simple group-specific differentiation of high-risk (HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -54, -56, and -58) and low risk (HPV-6, -11, -34, -40, -42, -43, and 44) HPVs following an HPV general primer-mediated (GP5+/GP6+) PCR is presented. By computer-assisted sequence analysis, oligonucleotides (30-mers) specific for 19 different HPV genotypes were selected from the internal part of the 150-bp GP5+/GP6(+)-amplified region. These oligo probes were tested for specificity in a Southern blot analysis of PCR products derived from the same panel of HPV types. No cross-hybridizations were found. The sensitivities of the oligo probes varied from the femtogram level for the well-amplified HPV types like HPV-16 and -18 to the picogram level for the less-well amplified HPV types like HPV-39 and -51. These sensitivities were reached when the oligo probes were applied both individually and in a cocktail. On the basis of these results, two cocktail oligo probes that enabled a specific and sensitive differentiation between low- and high-risk HPV types were composed.
