Risk factors for genital papillomavirus infection in populations at high and low risk for cervical cancer. This study sought to determine risk factors for genital infection with papillomavirus (HPV) in Panamanian women 20-49 years old. Subjects were randomly selected from Herrera and Panama provinces (cervical cancer incidence 79 and 25/100,000, respectively). Participants were interviewed to determine sexual behavior. Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were obtained to test for HPV DNA by commercial dot blot hybridization. HPV-16/18 DNA was detected significantly more frequently (5%) in Panama than Herrera (2%) samples (P = .002). Clearly, infection with high-risk HPV types alone cannot account for the differences in cervical cancer incidence between the two populations. HPV-16/18 detection decreased with increasing years of sexual experience among all women in Panama and among women with multiple partners in Herrera. However, HPV-16/18 detection did not change with sexual experience among monogamous women in Herrera. Thus, the epidemiology of HPV is complex and reflects both virus- and population-specific factors.
