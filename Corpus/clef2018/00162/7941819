Laser therapy of the uterine cervix. Within a period of 2 years 103 patients have been treated with a 50 Watt CO2-Laser because of chronic fluor (20 patients), condylomatous or dysplastic lesions of the portio (39 patients) or after conisation (44 patients). All patients have been treated as outpatients without any local anesthesia. We didn't observe severe complications. 2 times we had to stop laser vaporisation because of bleeding of the portio and had to begin once more after an interval. The patients had been controlled by cytology and colposcopy. The shortest observation time was 6 months. All cytologically controlled patients had a negative PAP-smear. 17 of the 20 patients with chronic fluor mentioned improvement or missing symptoms.
