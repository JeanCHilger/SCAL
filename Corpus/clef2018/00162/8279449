Cell abnormalities associated with human papillomavirus-induced squamous intraepithelial cervical lesions. Multivariate data analysis. One hundred ninety-six cervical scrapings were obtained for simultaneous research of cell abnormalities in Papanicolaou smears and detection of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes by polymerase chain reaction in extracted DNA from each clinical sample. The samples described by six discriminant cytologic parameters, and a synthetic HPV-presence/absence parameter provided an efficient matrix for multiple correspondence analysis. This statistical analysis displayed a plurality of HPV-related cell abnormalities in squamous intraepithelial lesions, and a high correspondence between HPV infection and the presence of multinucleated squamous cells, morphologically transformed keratinocytes (dyskaryotic cells), koilocytes, and cellular changes related to epithelial maturation. Because of the low proportion of detectable koilocytes in the HPV-infected scrapings, the authors also inferred that cellular changes related to epithelial maturation and morphologically transformed keratinocytes are the most accurate and efficient cell abnormalities, in terms of frequency and correlation, for cytodiagnosis of HPV-induced or associated squamous intraepithelial cervical lesions.
