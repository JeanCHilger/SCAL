Sexually transmitted agents and cervical neoplasia in Colombia and Spain. Case-control studies of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III) and of invasive cervical cancer were carried out in Spain and Colombia to assess the relationship between cervical cancer and 6 common sexually transmitted agents (STAs). The CIN-III studies included 525 cases and 512 controls matched for age and for the place of recruitment the invasive-cancer studies included 373 histologically confirmed cases of squamous-cell carcinoma and 387 age-stratified controls selected randomly from the populations that generated the cases. Antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were tested in 88% of the women. Cervical scrapes were examined for HPV DNA in 63% of the women using a polymerase-chain-reaction assay (PCR). Among controls, the highest antibody prevalence was to CMV (96.5%), followed by HSV-2 (31.4%) and C. trachomatis (23.3%). For all STAs, the sero-prevalence was markedly higher in Colombia than in Spain both for cases and for controls. After adjustment for the presence of HPV DNA, C. trachomatis was the only STA associated with CIN III in both countries
