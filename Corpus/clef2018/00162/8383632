Ten immortalized cell lines were established by transfection of human cervical keratinocytes (CK) with HPV-33 DNA and some of their characteristics were investigated. The following observations were made: (a) several cell lines have reached over 100 population doublings in vitro (b) 3 transcripts were observed, 2 being encoded by the E6/E7 open reading frames (ORFs)
