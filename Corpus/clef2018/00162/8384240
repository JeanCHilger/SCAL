Cervical neoplasia. Its association with human papillomavirus infection. Almost 70 human papillomavirus (HPV) types have been identified. An estimated one-third are anogenital associated. Their presence in the genital tract is associated with cancer, and certain particular types have a high correlation with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and carcinoma. Although a spectrum of histopathologic features within the epithelium characterize changes caused by HPV infection, only DNA analysis accurately detects and determines the type of infection. The variety of molecular methods for detection of HPV DNA primarily reveal whether or not a lesion is in fact associated with HPV infection. For minor grade cervical squamous lesions or equivocal Pap smear results, HPV detection and typing can help identify patients at increased risk for cervical carcinoma. Cervical colposcopy and biopsy are indicated for definitive diagnosis.
