Interactions of human papillomavirus transforming proteins with the products of tumor suppressor genes. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) contribute to the development of almost all cervical cancers, a common and often fatal human disease. The mechanisms by which the HPVs function in malignant progression appear to be related to the activity of the two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which form complexes with several cell proteins normally involved in controlling cell growth. Of particular interest has been the association of E6 with p53 and E7 with Rb, both products of tumor suppressor genes. Expression of E6 and E7 is likely to overcome the regulation of cell proliferation normally mediated by proteins like p53 and Rb, allowing uncontrolled growth and providing the potential for malignant transformation. These activities of E6 and E7 support the importance of the tumor suppressor proteins in the maintenance of normal cell proliferation and provide novel approaches to understanding the mechanisms by which they function.
