Detection of human papillomavirus in cervical swab samples by ViraPap and in cervical biopsy specimens by in situ hybridization. Human papillomavirus (HPV) detection in cervical swab specimens by ViraPap and in cervical biopsies by the ViraType in situ hybridization assay was correlated with concurrent cytologic and histologic findings in 149 patients. Seven percent of patients with normal samples were positive for HPV DNA, compared with 29% and 69% of patients with low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs), respectively. The performance of both assays increased the rate of HPV detection in low-grade lesions but not in high-grade cases. ViraPap was more sensitive than the ViraType in situ hybridization assay in high-grade lesions. The present investigation suggests that HPV DNA detection may be useful in separating confirmed lesions from histologically questionable biopsies.
