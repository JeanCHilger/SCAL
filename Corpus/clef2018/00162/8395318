Cloning and characterization of the genome of human papilloma virus type 16 in China. The cloning and characterization of a whole genome of human papillomavirus type 16(7.9kb) and a 5.4kb subgenomic fragment were studied. They were cloned after insertion in plasmid pAt153, using its unique BamH1 site. The full-length genome and subgenomic fragment were designated HPV16Z and HPV16F respectively. After analysis by 16 endonucleases, no new restriction site was found in HPV16Z in comparison with the standard strain. A new BamH1 site was observed at the 750 bp position in HPV16F. Using HPV16Z as molecular probe, 296 cervix and vagina biopsies from Xiang Yuan County of Shanxi Province were tested by means of Coslot hybridization under highly stringent conditions (Tm-17 degrees C). The experimental result showed that the HPV16Z infection rates of patients with chronic cervicitis, vaginitis, cervical pre-cancer lesions (CINI-CINIII), cervical cancer were 11.9% (17/143), 17.3% (14/81), 46.8% (22/47), and 68% (17/25) respectively. The findings indicate that HPV16Z infection is prevalent in the cervix pre-cancer lesion and cervical cancer in the high risk region.
