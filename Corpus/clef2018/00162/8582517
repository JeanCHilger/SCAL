Dysplasia and HPV infection initially detected by DNA analysis in cytomorphologically normal cervical smears. We examined the relationship between the risk of dysplasia and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection initially detected by DNA analysis in Japanese women with cytomorphologically normal cervical smears.We applied the polymerase chain reaction method to detect HPV DNA in 800 women and subsequently followed up 49 women positive for HPV DNA.HPV 16 or HPV 18 DNA was detected in 53 (6.6%) of 800 women with normal smears (negative). During the follow-up period (23 months), the presence of HPV DNA could not be detected in 41 (83.7%) of 49 women after its initial presence. The remaining eight women had repeated HPV DNA, and four of these eight women had lesions that progressed to mild dysplasia.The results indicated that some women with cytomorphologically normal smears may have HPV DNA which can be transient, and persistence of HPV types 16 or 18 DNA plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cervical dysplasia.
