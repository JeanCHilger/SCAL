Human papillomavirus infection in Hong Kong Chinese women with normal and abnormal cervix--detection by polymerase chain reaction method on cervical scrapes. Detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) was accomplished by utilizing polymerase chain reaction methods on cervical scrapes from a total of 488 Hong Kong Chinese women attending the colposcopy, general, and antenatal clinics. From colposcopy clinic, 10% of normal cervix, 31% of condyloma, 56, 50, and 57% of CIN I, CIN II, and CIN III, respectively, and 88% of squamous cell carcinoma contain HPV. The overall detection rate is 30%. The most prevalent type is 16. Four percent of scrapes from normal cervix of patients attending general gynecology clinic and none from antenatal clinic show HPV. The detection rate appears to be more related to the types of cervical lesions than to the age of the patients.
