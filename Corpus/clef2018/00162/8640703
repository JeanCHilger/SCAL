Human papillomavirus DNA after treatment of cervical dysplasia: low prevalence in normal cytologic smears. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in relation to cervical cytology was evaluated after treatment of cervical dysplasia.Forty patients, 22 with normal and 18 with abnormal cytology (mild or moderate dyskaryosis), with a history of cervical dysplasia were selected. Only patients with HPV DNA positive biopsies obtained before treatment were included. The presence of HPV was assessed in cervical smears at least 1 year after treatment of cervical dysplasia by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with consensus primers (CPI/IIG). HPV typing was done by direct sequence analysis of the CPI/IIG PCR generated amplimers.Smears from 3 of the 22 patients with normal cytology after treatment were positive for HPV DNA (14%). HPV DNA positive smears were found in 13 of the 18 patients with abnormal cytology after treatment (72%) (relative risk: 5.3 95% confidence interval: 1.78-15.75). In 11 of the 16 HPV DNA positive smears (69%), the HPV type was different from that before treatment. In 35 of 40 patients, the HPV type before treatment could not be detected after treatment (88%).A minority of the patients with normal cytology after treatment of cervical dysplasia had detectable HPV DNA. In contrast, a high prevalence of HPV DNA was found in cervical smears of patients with abnormal cytology after treatment of cervical dysplasia. After treatment, none of the patients with abnormal cytology but HPV DNA negative smears had recurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This suggests the value of supplementary HPV DNA testing during follow-up of patients treated for cervical dysplasia.
