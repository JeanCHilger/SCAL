Microcolpohysteroscopy compared with colposcopy in evaluation of abnormal cervical cytology. Microcolpohysteroscopy (MCH) permits in vivo visualisation of cervical epithelium and is a useful procedure in the diagnostic workup of a patients with abnormal pap smear. Our study compared standard colposcopy with MCH in 45 patients with dysplasia reported on cytology. On comparing with final histopathological diagnosis colposcopy had an accuracy of 95.6 percent in diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) within one grade. MCH had a diagnostic accuracy of 84.4 percent in predicting CIN changes. Further MCH was able to evaluate the endocervical squamocolumner junction in all cases of unsatisfactory colposcopy. Microcolpohysteroscopy is a useful adjunct to colposcopy and is also of value in locating the epicenter of lesions and is diagnosing HPV infection. MCH prior to conisation is of value in tailoring the biopsy to fully include the CIN lesion.
