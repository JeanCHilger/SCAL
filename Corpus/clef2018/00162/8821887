Peoscopic diagnosis of flat condyloma and penile intraepithelial neoplasia. IV. Urethral reservoir. The aim of the present study was to test the method of urethral cytologic sampling and to assess its results in the cytologic detection of human papillomavirus infection in the male partners of infected women. Cytologic evidence of abnormal epithelium was found in a total of 50 out of 167 cases (29.94%). It is interesting to note that 9 (5.38%) patients with cytological evidence of flat condylomas of the urethra did not have any other lesion. On the basis of the present study, we conclude that cytobrush urethral cytology should be routinely associated with peoscopy in studying the male partners of women affected by human papillomavirus infection, in an effort to diminish the reservoir of a virus strongly associated with cervical and penile neoplasia.
