Human papillomavirus types 52 and 58 are prevalent in cervical cancers from Chinese women. A substantial body of evidence has confirmed human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as an etiologic agent in human cervical cancer. To evaluate the association between HPV and cervical cancer in Chinese women, we examined tumor specimens from women who lived in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Biopsies from 40 women, diagnosed with either squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 35) or adenocarcinoma (n = 5) were tested for HPV DNA by PCR. The HPV types present in tumors were determined either by hybridization of PCR products with HPV type-specific probes or by PCR-based sequencing. A total of 35 of the 40 cervical cancer specimens (87.5%) contained HPV DNA. The following distribution and types were detected: 7.5% HPV 16, 10% HPV 18, 20% HPVs 16 and 18, 15% HPV 52, 15% HPV 58, 12.5% HPVs 52 and 58 and 7.5% unclassified HPVs. In this population of Chinese women with cervical cancer, HPV 52 and 58 were as prevalent as the "high-risk" (for cervical cancer) viruses HPVs 16 and 18.
