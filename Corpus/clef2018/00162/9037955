Hybrid Capture method for detection of human papillomavirus DNA in clinical specimens: a tool for clinical management of equivocal Pap smears and for population screening. High- and intermediate-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in concert with cofactors are responsible for over 90% of cervical cancers world-wide. While the Pap smear is a valuable cancer prevention tool, its subjective nature leaves it error prone. As a result, HPV DNA testing appears to be a needed adjunct to the Pap smear. Hybrid Capture is a simple DNA test with high specificity and sensitivity which appears useful for clinical management of equivocal Pap tests and shows promise for mass screening.
