Sensitive in situ hybridization with catalyzed reporter deposition, streptavidin-Nanogold, and silver acetate autometallography: detection of single-copy human papillomavirus. The usefulness of standard in situ hybridization for viral nucleic acid detection is occasionally limited by its sensitivity limit of 10 to 50 copies per cell. A modified version of the recently described signal amplification method, catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD), and its application to formalin-fixed cells and tissue sections is presented. Deposition of the reporter is facilitated by using horseradish peroxidase catalyzing the deposition of biotinylated tyramide on the location of the probe target. The biotin accumulation created is usually detected with streptavidin-labeled enzymes or fluorochromes. In the present investigation, this step was replaced by streptavidin-Nanogold and combined with silver acetate autometallography. This resulted in deep-black precipitation at positive in situ hybridized reaction sites. The sensitivity of this new approach was tested with a biotinylated, genomic probe specific for human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18. SiHa cells, a cervical carcinoma-derived cell line with one to two HPV16 copies per cell, and 10 histologically confirmed cervical carcinomas were used for the study. All samples were previously HPV16 positive with solution polymerase chain reaction, but only two of the cervical carcinomas were positive with standard in situ hybridization with barely visible signals. When employing CARD-Nanogold, SiHa cells and 9 of 10 biopsies proved positive with marked signals. It is concluded that this nonisotopic method can detect single viral copies in situ in routinely fixed material and may have the potential to replace in situ polymerase chain reaction in many applications.
