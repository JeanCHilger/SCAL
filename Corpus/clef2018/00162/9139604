Proliferating cell nuclear antigen in precancerous cervical disease. Monoclonal antibodies PC-10 were used to study the expression of PCNA in precancerous pathology of the uterine cervix in 50 biopsies in the presence of papilloma virus infection (PVI). Positive reaction was in 100% PVI before treatment weak proliferative activity was in 40% and strong reaction in 15%. If PVI was complicated with degree III dysplasia, there was an increase of proliferative activity. The positive reaction was retained after the therapy in 4 cases of the recurrent PVI. Positivity with PC-10 may be an unfavourable prognostic criterium.
