Expression of the tumor-associated gene MN: a potential biomarker for human renal cell carcinoma. MN is a novel cell surface antigen originally detected in human HeLa cells. Although it is also expressed in normal gastric mucosa, this antigen was previously found to be expressed in cells with a malignant phenotype in certain tissues of the female genital tract (cervix and ovary). Using an oligonucleotide primer set specific for MN-complimentary DNA, we performed reverse transcription-PCR assays on RNAs extracted from human cell lines and tissues to evaluate whether this marker might be expressed at other sites. RNA libraries extracted from normal human heart, lung, kidney, prostate, peripheral blood, brain, placenta, and muscle were negative for MN expression. RNAs extracted from liver and pancreatic tissue were positive for MN expression. Three of six renal cancer cell lines tested revealed MN expression. In addition, 12 of 17 samples of human renal cell carcinoma tissue tested positive for MN, all 12 of which were clear cell adenocarcinomas. This survey identified a unique association of MN expression with renal cell cancers, especially those of the clear cell variety, suggesting that MN is a potential marker for the diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic monitoring of renal cell carcinoma in humans.
