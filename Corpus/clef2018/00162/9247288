Human papillomavirus (HPV) in an Icelandic population: the role of HPV DNA testing based on hybrid capture and PCR assays among women with screen-detected abnormal Pap smears. This study was based on 358 cases with abnormal smears referred for colposcopy and HPV DNA testing. We analysed: 1) the frequency of different grades of cyto- and histopathologic findings 2) the frequency and relative amount of HPV DNA with the hybrid capture assay (HCA) in swabs, and the frequency of HPV with PCR in swabs (-S) and biopsies (-B)
