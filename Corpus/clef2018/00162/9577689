Cervical neoplasia. History-screening-diagnosis-treatment. Health care providers are exposed early in their education to the pathological classifications of cervical neoplasia. The significance of this early education may at first be hard for some to grasp. However, as one delves more deeply into the history of cervical cancer, the natural progression of early lesions, and the tremendous advances made in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer in the past fifty years, the importance of this early education is very apparent. With the widespread use of The Bethesda System of lesion classification, the introduction of the ThinPrep pap smear and HPV DNA typing, and ever evolving therapeutic techniques, it seems timely to review the history, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical neoplasia.
