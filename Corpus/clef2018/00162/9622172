Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA assay as an adjunct to liquid-based Pap test in the diagnostic triage of women with an abnormal Pap smear. The diagnostic performance and clinical value of the combined use of liquid-based Pap test and human papillomavirus testing were determined in 336 patients with a previous abnormal smear.Subsequent histologic evaluation was used as definitive diagnosis.The combined use of liquid-based Pap test and HPV DNA testing showed higher rates in sensitivity (99.0%), specificity (59.3%), positive predictive value (89.9%) and negative predictive value (94.5%) than either cytology alone (sensitivity 98.8%, specificity 45.7%, positive predictive value 84.7%, negative predictive value 92.6%) or HPV DNA testing alone (sensitivity 84.9%, specificity 67.4%, positive predictive value 88.8%, negative predictive value 59.5%).The study demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy for cervical cancer and its precursors was improved by using the liquid-based Pap test as a primary diagnostic procedure and HPV assay as an adjunctive test. This information may assist the clinicians in triaging patients with equivocal cytologic cervical atypias.
