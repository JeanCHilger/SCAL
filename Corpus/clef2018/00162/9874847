Lower genital tract neoplasia in women with HIV infection. Women who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at greater risk for the development of lower genital tract neoplasia than are HIV-negative women. Among HIV-positive women, those who are more severely immunosuppressed appear to be at higher risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), also known as squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). Women who are HIV-positive also are more likely than HIV-negative women to have multifocal lower genital tract neoplasia. Cervical cancer is one of the most important acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)--related malignancies in women. Cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia of the lower genital tract can be persistent, progressive, recurrent, and difficult to treat in HIV-positive women. The most effective method for treating SILs has not been determined. Regular performance of Pap smears in HIV-positive women is of critical importance, as is careful examination of the entire lower genital tract. Also, women with high-grade intraepithelial or cervical cancer should be tested for HIV.
