Induction of specific cell-mediated immunity in mice by oral immunization with Salmonella expressing Onchocerca volvulus glutathione S-transferase. Cellular and humoral immune responses of mice to Onchocerca volvulus glutathione S-transferase (OvGST) presented via in vivo expression in attenuated Salmonella typhimurium were examined and compared with the same antigen administered by subcutaneous injection with Freund's adjuvant. After infection with recombinant S. typhimurium, maximal numbers of bacteria were recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens during the second week postinfection. By weeks 3-4, bacteria were absent from these tissues. Splenocytes from mice infected with S. typhimurium expressing OvGST showed significant and specific proliferative responses to OvGST, whereas the non-recombinant S. typhimurium controls and those which received the antigen by subcutaneous injection with Freund's adjuvant did not. Mice infected with recombinant S. typhimurium had elevated IFN-gamma levels over non-recombinant S. typhimurium and placebo controls. but IL-4 and IL-5 levels were low and did not differ significantly between these groups. Antibody responses to OvGST antigen expressed by a recombinant Salmonella vaccine or delivered in a purified form with Freund's adjuvant were moderate to high. These data suggest that Salmonella can be used as a vaccine delivery vector that induces specific cellular and humoral immune responses to Onchocerca volvulus antigens. This is the first report to describe the successful application of a filarial antigen in a live-vector delivery system as well as the first recombinant based filarial vaccine to elicit a cellular immune response similar to that described for putative immune endemics.
