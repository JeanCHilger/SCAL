Characterization of a phase 1-d epitope on Salmonella typhi flagellin and its role in the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against Salmonella typhi 52 kDa flagellin protein has been previously produced by our group. In this study, we have demonstrated that the epitope specific to the MAb is unique to phase 1-d. To map the epitope, plasmids encoding different regions of S. typhi flagellin gene were constructed. Analysis of protein produced from each recombinant plasmid indicated that the epitope specific to the MAb resided within amino acids 171-303 (region IV) of S. typhi flagellin protein. The recombinant region IV flagellin was used to develop an ELISA for the detection of IgM antibody to S. typhi in serum. In the hemoculture-positive typhoid group, the developed ELISA was positive in 77 of 92 cases. In patients with non-typhoidal Salmonella, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria or dengue virus, the ELISA was negative in all 78 cases. Two from 116 healthy control subjects had positive reactions with the assay. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the test were 83.7%, 99.0%, 97.5% and 92.8%, respectively. With such high validity together with the requirement of only a single serum specimen and one day for performing the test, the developed ELISA should become a valuable diagnostic test for typhoid fever.
