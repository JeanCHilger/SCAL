Establishing a laboratory for surveillance of invasive bacterial infections in a tertiary care government hospital in a rural province in the Philippines. A clinical bacteriologic laboratory was established in a tertiary care government hospital in The Philippines, where expert bacteriologic laboratories do not usually exist at this level of health care. The laboratory was jointly established by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) (Manila, The Philippines) and the National Public Health Institute (KTL) (Helsinki, Finland). The laboratory was planned, its personnel were trained, and its functioning was continuously supported by the RITM and KTL. The following aspects were of utmost importance in establishing the laboratory and launching its work: 1) the support of the RITM bacteriologic laboratory, with back-up and consultations from KTL 2) creation and maintenance of personal contacts between clinicians and laboratory staff with an emphasis on clinical relevance and rapid reporting of laboratory results
