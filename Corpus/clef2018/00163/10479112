Cervical dysplasia in women with HIV. Prevention of cervical cancer in HIV-positive women is possible through regular cervical cytological screening for early detection and a variety of effective treatment options for dysplasia. Women with HIV infection continue to have an increased rate of CIN, and cervical dysplasia appears to recur more frequently and progress more rapidly in severely immunocompromised women with high-risk type HPV infection. The Pap test is an effective screening tool, but high rates of recurrence in immunocompromised women reinforce the need for more frequent screening in HIV-positive women with a history of abnormal smears and CD4 counts less than 200. Health care providers should be aware of the latest recommendations for cervical dysplasia evaluation and should apply these in their care of HIV-infected women. Early detection, prompt treatment, and meticulous follow-up are essential in the prevention of cervical dysplasia, as well as the morbidity and mortality associated with cervical cancer in women with HIV.
