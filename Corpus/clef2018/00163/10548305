Rapid serologic diagnosis of pediatric typhoid fever in an endemic area: a prospective comparative evaluation of two dot-enzyme immunoassays and the Widal test. We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of two dot-enzyme-linked immunoassays (Typhidot and Typhidot-M Malaysian Biodiagnostic Research SDN BHD, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), assessing IgG and IgM antibodies against the outer membrane protein (OMP) of Salmonella typhi, and the Widal test in comparison with blood culture in a consecutive group of children with suspected typhoid fever. Of 97 children with suspected typhoid fever, the disease was confirmed bacteriologically in 46 (47%), whereas 25 (26%) were considered to have typhoid fever on clinical grounds. An alternative diagnosis was made in 26 (27%). The Typhidot and Typhidot-M were superior to the Widal test in their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, although values (sensitivity = 85-94% and specificity = 77-89%) were significantly lower than in other regional reports. The lower specificity of the Typhidot in our series may represent regional differences in the genomic structure and plasticity of the OMP of S. typhi and merits further evaluation of these tests in diverse geographic locations.
