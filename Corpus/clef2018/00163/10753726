Detection of cervical antibodies to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) capsid antigens in relation to detection of HPV-16 DNA and cervical lesions. A more sensitive luminescence immunoassay (LIA) for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) was developed and used to measure HPV-16 antibodies in cervical samples from 292 college-aged women who were examined at 4-month intervals. Of the 609 collected samples, IgG, IgA, and secretory piece-associated antibodies to HPV-16 were detected in 12%, 6%, and 8%, respectively, of samples tested. Cervical IgG antibodies were most strongly associated with HPV-16 DNA detected within the previous 12 months (odds ratio, 3.3 95% confidence interval, 1.4-7.8). Secretory IgA (cervical IgA- and secretory piece-positive) was most strongly associated with detection of a squamous intraepithelial lesions 4-8 months earlier (odds ratio, 6.4
