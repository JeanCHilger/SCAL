Differential inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in systemic and pulmonary vessels after endotoxin. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is associated with vascular hypocontractility in systemic vessels after endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Although lung iNOS is increased after LPS, its role in the pulmonary circulation is unclear. We hypothesized that whereas iNOS upregulation is responsible for LPS-induced vascular dysfunction in systemic vessels, iNOS does not play a significant role in the pulmonary artery (PA). Using isolated aorta (AO) and PA rings, we examined the effect of nonselective NOS inhibition [N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) 100 micromol/l] and selective iNOS inhibition (aminoguanidine, AG
