Papillomaviruses and herpesviruses as selected risk factors in the etiopathogenesis of cervix neck cancer. II. Use of PCR for isolating DNA of human papillomavirus and Herpes simplex. The aims of the study were to compare polymerase chain reaction PCR with nucleic acid hybridisation HC in the routine diagnosis of HPV infections. Smears collected for PCR were digested for 24 hours using proteinase K. After DNA extraction 174 samples were tested by PCR with human bglobin primers PG04-GH20. The PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. In 80.6% of the samples 256 base pair DNA fragments were observed in the gel in UV light. These samples were tested by PCR with HPV primers MY09-MY11. In 40% of the samples the presence of HPV DNA was confirmed. Next we carried out PCR using a mixture of two pairs of primers bglobin PG04-GH20 and HPV MY09-MY11. DNA for this study was extracted from 24 samples in which the presence of human DNA was not confirmed in the first PCR test and from 7 untested samples. In 21 cases HPV DNA was found to be present in gel electrophoresis. The presence of HPV DNA was confirmed in 44.75% of the samples.
