8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in cervical cells: correlation with grade of dysplasia and human papillomavirus infection. In this study, the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) level was assessed in human cervical cells by an immunoperoxidase method and was related to the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and precancerous lesions. After optimizing the immunohistochemical method of detecting oxidative DNA damage in whole cells, we have used this technique to estimate the oxidative damage in cervical cells collected during a routine PAP test. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the data from human samples showed significant differences in the 8-OHdG content among normal, low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL, HGSIL and LGSIL, respectively P < 0.001). In the comparison of the three groups, statistically significant differences were detected between normal SIL and HGSIL (P < 0.001) and between LGSIL and HGSIL (P = 0.003), whereas no statistically significant difference was found between normal SIL and LGSIL (P = 0.1). Grouping observations by HPV status, no significant difference was detected in 8-OHdG levels between HPV(+) and HPV(-) subjects (P = 0.8). The polytomous and proportional odds models, extensions of the logistic regression analysis, showed that the effect of 8-OHdG levels in rising the risk of dysplasia was roughly constant through SIL grades. In conclusion, the immunoperoxidase method, applied to single human cervical cells, provides clear evidence that significant differences exist in 8-OHdG content between normal and dysplastic cells and that oxidative DNA damage might play an important role in cervical carcinogenesis.
