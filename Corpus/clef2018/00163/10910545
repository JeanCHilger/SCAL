Typhoid fever presenting as infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome: report of one case. This report describes a 13-year-old boy who had high fever with severe pancytopenia and acute psychosis as initial presentation. Bone marrow examination was compatible with infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IAHS). Blood culture showed no growth of bacteria while the culture of bone marrow yielded Salmonella typhi. The clinical condition stabilized shortly after the use of ceftriaxone. This case illustrates that typhoid fever must be included in the differential diagnosis of IAHS. In cases with IAHS, bacterial culture as well as morphological study of bone marrow is necessary for the evaluation of etiological agent and to avoid injudicious use of chemotherapy.
