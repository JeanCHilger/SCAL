Rapid detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis in blood cultures by a dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody specific to phase1-c Salmonella was developed for the direct detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis in blood cultures. This system was applied to the identification of serovar Choleraesuis, and the results were compared with those obtained by a conventional biochemical method. It was revealed that all 12 samples identified to be infected with serovar Choleraesuis were positive on testing by the ELISA. In contrast, 77 samples infected with bacteria commonly isolated from the blood were not reactive by the ELISA. The calculated sensitivity and specificity of the established assay are 100%.
