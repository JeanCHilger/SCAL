HPV subtype analysis in lower genital tract neoplasms of female renal transplant recipients. Immunocompromised patients, such as female renal transplant recipients, have an increased incidence of neoplasms involving the lower genital tract (i.e., cervix, vagina, vulva). The relationship between lower genital tract neoplasms and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been established and high-risk oncogenic subtypes have been identified (HPV 16, 18, 45, and 56). The purpose of this study is to evaluate HPV subtypes present in lower genital tract neoplasms of post renal transplant women and compare HPV subtypes found in these patients with immunocompetent patients having similar neoplasms and normal immunocompetent controls.Twenty specimens from lower genital tract neoplasms of 16 renal transplant patients, 13 specimens from 13 immunocompetent patients with similar histology, and 13 patients with normal lower genital tract histology were analyzed for the presence of HPV using polymerase chain reaction. HPV primers including the L1 (late) region consensus primers and primers specific for the HPV E6 (early) region for subtypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were amplified with DNA from the above patient samples.Overall, HPV was detected in 21/46 specimens tested. Thirteen of the HPV-positive specimens were from transplant patients, and 8 were from immunocompetent patients (5 immunocompetent with disease and 3 normal patients). This difference in the total number of HPV-positive cases was statistically significant between the transplant and immunocompetent group (P = 0.02). Although no difference in HPV 6 and/or 11 was detected between the two groups, HPV subtypes 16 and/or 18 approached statistical significant difference (P = 0.06).High-risk oncogenic HPV subtypes 16 and/or 18 were found at a higher rate in transplant patients compared with their immunocompetent counterparts. The combination of immunocompromise and increased HPV 16 and/or 18 positivity may place these patients at increased risk for aggressive lower genital tract neoplastic progression.
