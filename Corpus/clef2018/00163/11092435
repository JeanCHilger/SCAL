Investigation of concurrent outbreaks of gastroenteritis and typhoid fever following a party on a floating restaurant, France, March 1998. A retrospective cohort study was carried out to investigate concurrent outbreaks of gastroenteritis and typhoid fever that occurred among guests of a supper on a floating restaurant in France in March 1998. A total of 133 guests (attack rate = 90%) reported gastroenteritis within 12 days of the supper. Twenty-seven guests developed typhoid fever (attack rate = 18%) of whom 15 were confirmed by stool or blood culture. All patients with typhoid fever had had an initial gastroenteritis. The results suggest that the same food items served during the supper, chicken and rice, were the vehicles of both gastroenteritis and typhoid fever, but the authors could not determine the specific source of infection. Initial gastroenteritis has been described as a clinical manifestation of typhoid fever but whether or not these two syndromes (gastroenteritis and typhoid fever) were due to the same etiology remains unclear in this outbreak.
