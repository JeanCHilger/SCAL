HPV testing: where are we now? 1) To assess if HPV (human papillomavirus)-DNA testing using the presently available technology offers any advantage over the utilization of the traditional Pap-smear as a screening tool for women at risk for cervical pre-cancers. 2) To assess if the HPV-DNA test is a valuable intermediate triage method for patients with Pap-smears demonstrating ASCUS (Abnormal Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) or LG-SIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) in order to better select those patients who would maximally benefit from colposcopy, thus, using clinical resources in an efficient way.Review of the peer reviewed literature between 1992 and June 2000 regarding: 1) new and innovative approaches for cervical cancer screening and prevention 2) advances in management protocols of ASCUS and LG-SIL with the introduction of HPV-DNA test.HPV-DNA testing in association with the Pap (Papanicolau) smear performed either conventionally or, preferably, with the new liquid based cytology is a valuable adjunct with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity rates in defining those patients most likely to demonstrate HG-SIL (High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) at the time of colposcopy.At present available evidence indicates that the best reason for performing HPV-DNA testing is the triage of selected patients with ASCUS and in specific settings with LG-SIL. Ongoing clinical studies may demonstrate additional advantages for this technology when used in a screening application.
