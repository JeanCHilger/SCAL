Bacteraemia and mortality among adult medical admissions in Malawi--predominance of non-typhi salmonellae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The high seroprevalence of HIV in Malawi might be expected to alter the pattern of pathogens isolated from bacteraemic patients. We aimed to describe the frequency and seasonal pattern of bacterial isolates from blood, their antibiotic susceptibility, and patient outcome, in order to provide data on which to base empirical antibiotic therapy and further studies of pathogenesis.Over a 12-month period, blood cultures were taken from all febrile adult medical admissions to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre.A total of 2789 out of 9298 adult general medical admissions had blood culture performed, of whom 449 (16.1%) grew significant pathogens. Non-typhi salmonellae (NTS) (37%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (30%) were the two commonest isolates. Mortality was 18% among general medical admissions and 38% among bacteraemic patients. Mortality for individual pathogens was: NTS 33% S. pneumoniae 36%This large study confirms the dominance of NTS and S. pneumoniae in bacteraemia in an area affected by HIV-1 and allows comparison of mortality by individual pathogens. It demonstrates a preserved seasonal pattern of bacteraemia for these major pathogens, despite an overwhelming association with HIV infection.
