Monoclonal antibodies of IgA isotype specific for lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella enteritidis: production, purification, characterization and application as serotyping reagents. Hybridomas secreting immunoglobulin A (IgA) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were generated after mucosal immunization of BALB/c mice with heat killed bacteria. Antigen binding properties and specificity of the produced MAbs were studied in ELISA and immunoblotting with purified LPS. Two IgA MAbs agglutinated all Salmonella OD1 strains and all S. enteritidis clinical isolates. MAb 178H11 recognized O:9 antigen of subserogroup OD1 LPS. MAb 177E6/A9 reacted also with OD3 LPS antigen and agglutinated OD3 strains. These data suggest the existence of different O:9 antigen subspecificities, one presented in subgroup OD1 and the other common for OD1 and OD3. Thus the produced IgA MAbs prove to be useful reagents, which could differentiate OD1 and OD3 from OD2 strains.
