Antibody response against Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin expressed as fusions to flagellin. The heat-stable toxin (ST) produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains causes diarrhoea by altering the fluid secretion in intestinal epithelial cells. Here, the effectiveness of a flagellin fusion protein of Salmonella containing a 19-amino-acid sequence derived from the ST sequence (FLA--ST) in generating antibodies capable of neutralizing the toxic activity of ST was evaluated. This fusion protein, and an alternative construction where two cysteine residues in the ST sequence were substituted by alanines (ST(mt)), were delivered to the immune system by three distinct strategies: (i) orally, using an attenuated Salmonella strain expressing FLA--ST (ii) intraperitoneally, by injection of purified FLA--ST
