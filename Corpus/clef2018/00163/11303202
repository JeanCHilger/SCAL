Value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in the prediction of residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen. Our aim was to evaluate human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen.A prospective study was conducted on 75 patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who had cone margins or endocervical curettage specimens showing disease and who elected to undergo hysterectomy after conization. All patients underwent high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing by the Hybrid Capture II (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD) system before conization and at the time of hysterectomy (within 2-7 weeks after conization). The presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in cells obtained by endocervical brush before hysterectomy was correlated with residual disease in the hysterectomy specimens.Of the 92 patients enrolled, 75 were eligible. Of these 75 patients, 52 (69.3%) had persistent human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization, and 27 (36.0%) of the 75 patients had residual cervical neoplasia in the hysterectomy specimens. Those with negative results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization were all (23/23) without residual disease in the uterus (100% negative predictive value). All those who had residual disease (27/27) had positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid at the time of hysterectomy (100% sensitivity). Postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid status (odds ratio, 4.000 95% confidence interval, 1.531-10.449This prospective study confirms an excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual cervical neoplasia. A strategy of managing patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, based on postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid findings and endocervical curettage results, is proposed.
