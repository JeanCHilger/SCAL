Summary statement on quantitative cytochemistry (DNA and molecular biology): Task Force 8. To reach consensus on the application of quantitative cytochemical analysis of chromosomal and DNA aneuploidy in cervical cytopathology.The current Pap test has limited specificity to predict cancer and its truly progressive pre-malignant lesions. Infection with human papillomavirus may trigger genetic instability, hyperproliferation and immortalization of the cervical mucosa and cause cervical cancer. Several related molecular markers have been shown to be informative about this neoplastic process. Quantitative analysis of chromosomal and DNA aneuploidy has been shown to be an important tool for identifying (progression to) high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. A high degree of standardization (material handling, calibration and quality control, measurement and interpretation of results) is required for accurate and reproducible measurements. Areas for further study are presented.
