Oral antibodies to human papillomavirus type 16 in women with cervical neoplasia. This study investigated the relationship between human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) antibodies detected in oral fluid from women with cervical neoplasia, their HPV-16 antibody seroprevalence, and their cervical HPV-16 DNA presence. Cervical HPV-16 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 43.2% (35/81) of these women. The prevalence of IgG and IgA antibodies to HPV-16 virus-like particles (VLP-16) in oral fluid and was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-VLP-16 IgA antibodies were detected in oral fluid from 54.3% (44/81) of women with cervical neoplasia, compared with 8% (3/36) in controls (P = 0.000002). Anti-VLP-16 IgG was detected in oral fluid from 43.2.9% (25/72) and 13.3% (4/30 P = 0.029), respectively. Women who were HPV-16 DNA positive at their cervical lesion, displayed an oral fluid anti-VLP-16 IgA prevalence of 60.7% (17/28) and HPV-16 DNA negative women an oral fluid anti-VLP-16 IgA prevalence of 50% (20/40
