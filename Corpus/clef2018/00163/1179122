Etiological diagnosis of spondylitis.  I. Clinical, biological and radiological aspects. The authors compared the different elements of diagnosis contributed by the clinical examination, and by laboratory and radiological investigations in 33 cases of Pott's disease and 46 cases of non-tuberculous spondylodiscitis. They show that certain elements indicate the diagnosis of Pott's disease : associated visceral tuberculosis, and a radiogram showing in particular a centro-somatic notch, recent primary infection, absence of pain, minimum signs of medullary compression  other elements on the other hand, indicate a diagnosis of non-tuberculous spondylodiscitis : a negative cutaneous tuberculin test, a positive haemoculture, humoral signs of melitococcosis or of typhoid fever, any indication of possible means of entry of infection in the two months before the disease, radiological signs of reconstruction in the first four months of evolution, location of the lesion in the anterior upper part of the vertebra, and to a lesser degree, the acute febrile nature of the clinical picture. The authors recall that the existence of a large abscess, of which there were no examples in the present series, is an indication in favour of tuberculosis.
