An outbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium, DT104L linked to dried anchovy in Singapore. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104L was first reported in Singapore from mid-July to mid-October 2000. Salmonella strains isolated from clinical laboratories were submitted to a reference laboratory for serotyping, phage-typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using XbaI restriction endonuclease. An epidemiological investigation was conducted to determine the source of infection and mode of transmission using a structured questionnaire. A total of 33 cases involving mainly infants and toddlers were detected in the 3-month long outbreak. The outbreak strain was of the R-type ACGSTSu, i.e. resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, tetracycline and sulphonamide. PFGE showed all isolates had an indistinguishable pattern, indicating a common source of infection. Consumption of imported dried anchovy was found to be the vehicle of transmission after adjusting for all confounding variables in the case-control study using stepwise logistic regression (OR 25.6 95% CI 3.9-167.9
