Salmonella bacteremia. Non-typhi salmonellae are invasive bacteria, which can, in certain conditions, get into the blood stream, and course bacteriemia or localized infections in different organ systems. Incidence of salmonella bacteriemia varied in different studies between 5.2-13.7%. The incidence is higher in patients younger than 1 year and the elderly. Among different serotypes, the most invasive are Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella choleraesuis and Salmonella Virchow. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of salmonella bacteriemia among patients hospitalized at the Clinic of Infectious Diseases Novi Sad during 1991-1998, and to point to certain risk factors for salmonella bacteriemia.During 1991-1998, 1309 patients were hospitalized with the diagnosis of Salmonella gastroenteritis. 12 patients (0.99%) had positive blood culture. The average age of salmonella bacteriemia patients was 17 (1-54 year), but 50% of them were younger than 10. 4/12 patients (33.33%) had positive stool and blood culture, but in 8/12 (66.66%) only positive blood culture had been established. The main serotype was Salmonella enteritidis (83.33%) and after that Salmonella Virchow (16.66%). In more than 50% of patients there was at least one risk factor responsible for dissemination: sideropenic anemia (25%), cerebral palsy (8.33%) and chronic cardiac disease (8.33%). Average duration of fever was 13.16 days and diarrhea 8.83. All patients presented with hepatosplenomegaly. One patient had a localized salmonella infection (periappendicular abscess) and she had undergone successful surgery. All our patients had been under cephalosporins of the third generation for 2 weeks and they recovered completely without sequelae.A relatively low incidence of salmonella bacteriemia (0.99%) in our patients can be explained with small number of children younger than 1 year and patients older than 70 years of age in whom bacteriemia is most common. Positive blood culture doesn't mean obligatory positive stool culture. Routine laboratory analyses are relatively nonspecific for the diagnosis of generalized infection. Cephalosporins of the third generation are considered to be the drug of choice in treatment of salmonella bacteriemia.
