Human papillomavirus 16 load in normal and abnormal cervical scrapes: an indicator of CIN II/III and viral clearance. The relation between human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) viral load in cervical scrapes and development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN II or III) was studied in a nested case-control study of women with normal cytology (group A) and in a cohort of women with abnormal cytology (group B). HPV 16 DNA load was determined using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. In group A, case women (women with CIN II/III, n = 12) had a significantly higher viral load than control women (women with CIN < or = I, n = 47). This resulted in an increased relative risk of women with the 50% highest viral load for development of CIN II/III (OR 7.7 CI 1.6-33). In group B, women with CIN II/III (n = 38) had a significantly higher viral load than women with CIN < or = I (n = 25). Women with the 50% highest viral load had an increased relative risk of CIN II/III (OR 3.2
