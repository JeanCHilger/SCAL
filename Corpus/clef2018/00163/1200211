Roentgenographic findings in typhoid fever. Barium meal examinations have been performed on 20 patients with proved or clinically suspected typhoid fever. There were distinct abnormalities in the terminal ileum early in the febrile stage of the disease. The abnormality was different in a single case of relapse of typhoid. The study is easily and safely performed and we feel that it is a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of typhoid fever, particularly in those cases where a positive blood culture is not available to confirm the clinical impression. The result of the roentgenographic examination is obtainable immediately and treatment can be initiated early.
