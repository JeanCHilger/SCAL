Salmonella meningitis: report of three cases in adults and literature review. Salmonella meningitis is an unusual complication of Salmonella sepsis and occurs almost exclusively in infants and young children. One case of Salmonella meningitis and two cases of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis in adult patients with Salmonella bacteremia were studied and the literature was reviewed. On a retrospective review of the charts of 100 sequential patients with Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi-positive blood cultures, we found one patient with fulminant Salmonella meningitis and two others with CSF pleocytosis. All three patients survived. The patient with Salmonella meningitis had significant residual neurologic sequela. Salmonella encephalopathy occurred in six other patients who presented with headache and were confused or drowsy. Cases of meningitis in adults do occur and are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Newer cephalosporn antibiotics may be the therapy of choice in these infections.
