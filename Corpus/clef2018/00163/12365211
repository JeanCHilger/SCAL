Utility of HPV DNA detection in thin-layer, liquid-based tests with atypical squamous metaplasia. To determine if testing for HPV is useful in the management of patients with atypical squamous metaplasia (ASM) and to evaluate a small group of patients with atypical squamous cells in the setting of an atrophic cellular profile (estrogen test [ESTT]).Presence of HPV DNA was determined on 104 ASM and ESTT cases on residual ThinPrep specimens using Hybrid Capture II. Results of the HPV DNA test were correlated with subsequent biopsy or repeat Pap test results.Of 63 patients with ASM on ThinPrep Pap tests, 52% were associated with histologically proven SIL when HPV DNA was detected by Hybrid Capture II. None of the 17 patients who were negative for HPV DNA had subsequent evidence of HPV infection by biopsy or repeat Pap test. Among 14 patients with ESTT, none of the 12 who were negative for HPV DNA had subsequent evidence of HPV infection.ASM and ESTT with a negative HPV DNA test can be followed routinely, and a colposcopic examination is not warranted.
