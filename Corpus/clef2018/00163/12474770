Some aspects of diagnosis and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (review of the literature). Cervical cancer has remained close to the forefront of oncologic studies even in our days. The incidence of the disease has changed little, except in those countries with effective screening programs. The morbidity in Lithuania reached 23.9/100,000 in the 2000's, while in comparison the morbidity in the 1994's was 20.4/100,000. The mortality was 13.2 and 11.3/100,000, respectively. Over the last 50 years our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of lower genital tract squamous neoplasia has increased enormously and, particularly in the last 15 years, progress in our understanding of the molecular events associated with lower anogenital tract neoplasia has developed rapidly. Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, after breast cancer. Since 1978 it is known that Human Papillomavirus is closely related to genital neoplasia--cervical, vulva, vagina, penis, anus intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive carcinoma. It is also known that cytologic smear is one of the most important way to diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer as well, because we can not evaluate cervical lesion visually. Cytologic smear remains the main principle of cancer screening because of its simplicity and accessibility, while colposcopy remains the method of examination in choice, when pathologic cytologic findings are determined.
