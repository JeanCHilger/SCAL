Diagnostic difficulties in febrile travellers returning from the tropics. Two cases of typhoid fever imported from India. Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease caused by Salmonella enterica serotype typhi. The infection is responsible for endemic or epidemic outbreaks in tropical and subtropical countries, especially in Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Central and South Africa. Latin America, and it occurs sporadically in Poland. We reported two cases of imported typhoid fever after travelling to India and Nepal. In the tourists returning from the area hyperendemic for malaria, visceral leishmaniosis, amoebiasis and haemorrhagic fevers and not following tropical hygiene measures, persistent fever was a source of difficulties in differential diagnosis. In the first case, lack of anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis in the presence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia strongly suggested Plasmodium spp. infection. Two daily peaks of fever with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, leucopenia, high transaminases levels and co-existing positive serology for L. donovani pointed to visceral leishmaniosis. Late occurrence of specific anti-S. typhi agglutinins in the Widal test, cross-reactivity with S. paratyphi A and negative urine bacteriological culture were observed. In the second case, gastrointestinal disturbances, including pain, abdominal tenderness and diarrhoea gave a suspicion of amoebic colitis. Stool and urine cultures were negative for S. typhi and cross reactions with S. paratyphi A and C were reported. Typhoid fever was finally confirmed in both patients by an isolation of S. typhi from peripheral blood cultures. The effectiveness of treatment of choice with ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone in a case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of S. typhi was documented.
