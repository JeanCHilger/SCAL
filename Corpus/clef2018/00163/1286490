Enoxacin in the treatment of typhoid fever. Enoxacin 400 mg twice daily was given orally to 40 patients who had Salmonella typhi- or Salmonella paratyphi-positive blood or bone marrow cultures. One patient was switched to parenteral therapy within 48 hours of study enrollment, but the remaining 39 patients were given enoxacin for 10 to 14 days. All 39 patients were cured by enoxacin, even though 23 (58.9%) strains were resistant to cotrimoxazole and 16 (41%) strains were multiply resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole. No adverse events necessitated the interruption of therapy. In this study, enoxacin was well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of typhoid fever.
