PCR diagnosis of HPV in cervical biopsies of CIN and invasive neoplasia formerly diagnosed as HPV negative. To evaluate whether the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enhances the diagnosis of human papillomavirus (HPV) in biopsies of the uterine cervix with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive neoplasia.Samples of 71 paraffin-embedded cervical tissue blocks from patients seen in the period 1997-1998 were analyzed. Samples were selected according to age (18-60 years old) and an active sexual life and divided in to 3 groups: test (samples with CIN or invasive neoplasia and a negative HPV diagnosis), positive controls (samples with CIN or invasive neoplasia and a positive HPV diagnosis) and negative controls (samples without CIN or invasive neoplasia and a negative HPV diagnosis). Samples were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR for HPV detection.PCR analysis matched the colposcopic and cytopathologic diagnoses in the positive and negative controls. However, 77% of samples in test group were HPV positive.CIN, an invasive neoplasm, is associated with the presence of HPV. Colposcopy and cytopathology are efficient but not sufficient to identify HPV. Thus, despite the high cost, PCR can be used as an additional examination, in women with cervical lesions.
