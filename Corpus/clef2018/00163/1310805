Human papillomavirus infection of the cervix: relative risk associations of 15 common anogenital types. During the years 1982-1989, 2627 women were recruited into eight studies analyzing the relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia. Subsequently, each individual was assigned as either a case or control, and each cervical sample was rescreened for HPV DNA by low-stringency Southern blot hybridization. Positive samples were retested at high stringency with specific probes for HPVs 6/11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 56, and (in most instances) 58. Most cases (153 cancers, 261 high-grade and 377 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) had target or cone biopsies all 270 borderline atypia subjects and more than 85% of the 1566 normal controls had cytology plus colposcopy/cytology. Scientists performing HPV testing were masked to the clinical diagnoses. Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 79.3% of specimens from women with definite cervical disease (627 of 791), in 23.7% of borderline atypia subjects (64 of 270), and in 6.4% of normal subjects (101 of 1566). Graphic analysis of odds ratios at each point in the diagnostic spectrum defined four categories: 1) "low risk" (HPVs 6/11, 42, 43, and 44), present in 20.2% (76 of 377) of low-grade lesions but absent in all 153 cancers
