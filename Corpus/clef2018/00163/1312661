High-risk human papillomavirus types in cytologically normal cervical scrapes from Kenya. Seventy-seven women with normal cervical cytology on routine visit to a family planning clinic in Nairobi, Kenya, were analysed for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) types by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We applied a general primer pair (GP60/GP124) recognising sequences conserved among HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33. Of the 77 specimens tested 15 (19.5%) proved to be positive for genital HPV. Amplification products were examined for the presence of high-risk HPV types by Slot-blot hybridization. Out of the 15 PCR-positive samples, 4 were positive for HPV 16.3 for HPV 18, while 1 contained both HPV 16 and 33. HPV DNA prevalence in this group of women from a "high-risk" area is similar to that in "low-risk" Swedish women but much lower than in cervical cancer samples from the same region.
