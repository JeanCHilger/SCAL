In situ hybridization with nonisotopic probes using different detection systems. In order to evaluate a sensitive nonisotopic in situ hybridization method for routine work in pathology laboratories, we compared seven different detection systems, using digoxigenin- and biotin-labeled probes. The sensitivity of these methods was tested on four cases of cervical condyloma all known to be positive for HPV 6. Four of these methods gave satisfactory results without any background staining. The single biotin method and the single digoxigenin method were equally sensitive, while the two triple biotin methods, using mouse anti-biotin/anti-mouse IgG/alkaline phosphatase mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase or mouse anti-biotin/alkaline phosphatase anti-mouse IgG/alkaline phosphatase mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase as the detection systems, tremendously improved the sensitivity. The enhanced sensitivity of the nonisotopic in situ hybridization method make it useful in investigation of pathologic tissues.
