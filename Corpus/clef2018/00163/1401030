Diagnosis of typhoid fever by detection of Salmonella typhi antigen in urine. A monoclonal antibody specific for group D Salmonella antigen 9 was used in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the antigen in urine specimens collected from patients with clinical typhoid fever in Jakarta, Indonesia. The ELISA had a sensitivity of 95% in identifying patients in whom Salmonella typhi was isolated from hemocultures, 73% in patients in whom S. typhi was isolated from stool specimens, and 40% in patients in whom the organism was isolated from bone marrow cultures. Among patients in whom S. typhi was isolated from blood cultures, the ELISA had a sensitivity of 65% when a single urine specimen was examined and 95% when serially collected urine specimens were examined. A dot blot immunoassay performed on a nitrocellulose filter in parallel had a sensitivity of 85%, versus 83% for the plate ELISA in which S. typhi was isolated from blood, bone marrow, and/or stool specimens. Since S. typhi antigen is intermittently excreted in the urine of patients with typhoid fever, serially collected urine from patients with typhoid should be tested for antigen 9.
