Predicting residual disease after excision of cervical dysplasia. Dysplastic epithelium at the resection margin after a cervical cone is known to predict persisting disease. We followed 702 women for 30 months after cervical excision to see which resection margin was predictive. The risk of persisting cytological abnormalities was doubled when CIN extended to the endocervical resection margin and was doubled when there was evidence of HPV. In contrast, disease at the ectocervical resection margin and the grade of CIN were not associated with a higher risk of residual disease.
