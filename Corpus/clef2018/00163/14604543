The TUBEX typhoid test based on particle-inhibition immunoassay detects IgM but not IgG anti-O9 antibodies. A serological test kit (TUBEX, IDL Biotech, Sweden) developed recently for the diagnosis of typhoid fever detects antibodies to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O9 antigen. The antibodies are detected by their ability to inhibit the interaction between two types of reagent particles: (a). indicator latex microspheres sensitized with an anti-O9 monoclonal antibody, and (b). magnetic microspheres sensitized with S. typhi LPS. Following rapid mixing of the serum with these reagents and sedimentation of the magnetic particles by magnetic force, the concentration of indicator particles left in suspension provides a measure of the inhibition. Whereas it was previously assumed that both IgM and IgG antibodies could inhibit in the system, the present study reveals, surprisingly, that only the IgM antibodies do. It is not clear why IgG anti-O9 antibodies, both of mouse and human origin, do not inhibit, although these can bind to the LPS-sensitized magnetic particles as efficiently as the IgM antibodies. In addition, they can also inhibit very well in another detection system (ELISA) which uses a similar assay format and the same antibody and antigen reagents. Increasing the size of the LPS-sensitized microspheres made no difference microscopic analysis of the TUBEX reaction mixture revealed that while the indicator particles bound abundantly to the IgG-aggregated LPS-sensitized particles, forming large clumps, these only formed a very light decoration on the IgM-aggregated particles. Thus, the TUBEX system is ideally suited for use in the diagnosis of infections as it allows IgM antibodies to be detected easily and rapidly from whole sera.
