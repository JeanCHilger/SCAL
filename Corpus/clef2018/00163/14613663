Cervical cytology screening in teens. New guidelines for when to initiate cervical cancer screening have recently been revised. The American Cancer Society now recommends that screening be initiated within 3 years of the onset of vaginal intercourse but no later than 21 years of age. Natural history studies of human papillomavirus (HPV the cause of abnormal cytology and cervical cancer) suggest that there is little risk of a significant precancerous lesion going undetected within the first 3 to 5 years after the onset of sexual activity. The new recommendations will assist in the over-referral and overtreatment of adolescents with HPV.
