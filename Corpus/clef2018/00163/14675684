A retrospective review on atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS) using the Bethesda 2001 classification. The Bethesda system for reporting cervicovaginal cytologic diagnoses was recently revised in 2001. Pathologists are required to report not only whether the smear favors neoplastic changes, but also the origin of the abnormal cells. In this study, archival smears were reviewed to evaluate the usefulness of the new classification.Smears having atypical glandular cells taken between January 1995 and December 1997 were reviewed and subclassified according to the revised Bethesda classification. Case records were then reviewed and cases with discrepancies between the cytological evaluation and corresponding final histological diagnoses were further reviewed.There were 138 smears reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 47 (range, 18 to 78). Thirty-four smears favored neoplasia and 104 favored "NOS" ("not otherwise specified"). Sixty smears favored endocervical origin and 78 endometrial origin. Forty-three patients (31%) had significant pathologies, including 12 (8.7%) patients with high-grade CIN, 2 (1.4%) with low-grade CIN, 5 (3.6%) with HPV infection, 7 (5.1%) with carcinoma of the corpus, 1 (0.7%) with cervical adenocarcinoma in situ, 4 (2.9%) with adenocarcinoma of the cervix, 3 (2.2%) with endometrial hyperplasia, and 5 (3.6%) with carcinoma of the ovary. Two (1.4%) patients had double primary female genital malignancies and 2 patients (1.4%) had extragenital malignancies. Significant correlation was found between smears "favor neoplasia" and a final diagnosis with significant pathology (chi(2) test, P < 0.05). Significant association was found between AGC favored endocervical origin and a final diagnosis with cervical diseases (chi(2) test, P < 0.05). Four of the 43 patients who had significant pathologies had lesions found during their subsequent visits and all of them had cervical smears classified as AGC "favor neoplasia".AGC found on cervical smears are an indication for early and intensive investigation.
