Incidence of the recently described sulfonamide resistance gene sul3 among German Salmonella enterica strains isolated from livestock and food. The sul3 gene recently described in Escherichia coli was found in 22 of 512 (4.3%) German Salmonella isolates from different regions and sources and of different serotypes, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, and genomic groups. This is the first report on the prevalence of sul3 among Salmonella strains, and the findings support the strong potential of this determinant to spread within bacterial populations.
