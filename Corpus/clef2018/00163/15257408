Human leukocyte antigen class II alleles and natural history of HPV 2/27/57-induced common warts. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between HLA-DQB1*03 alleles and the risk of cervical cancer induced by human papillomavirus (HPV). As persistence of HPV infection is required for developing cervical cancer, we wanted to elucidate the role of HLA-class II allele polymorphisms in the persistence of common warts induced by HPV 2, HPV 27 or HPV 57. Therefore, we determined the distribution of HLA-DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 alleles in 71 patients presenting with HPV 2/27/57-induced common warts which had persisted for at least 18 months as well as in 92 individuals who had never suffered from common warts or whose warts had healed in less than 18 months. Among patients with long-lasting warts, the carriership frequencies and allele frequencies of DQA1*0301, DQB1*0301, DRB1*07 and DRB1*09 were higher, and the allele frequencies of DQA1*0501, DQB1*0603, DRB1*01 and DRB1*03 were lower. Statistically significant differences (Bonferroni adjusted Fisher's exact test) were found for carriership frequency of DQA1*0301 (46.5 vs 21.7%, P = 0.013) and for carriership frequency (18.3 vs 1.1%, P = 0.0015) and allele frequency (12 vs 0.5%, P = 0.000013) of DQB1*0301. A greater proportion of patients with long-lasting warts than of subjects without persistent warts were homozygous at the DQA1 (14.1 vs 6.5%) and DQB1 (16.9 vs 8.6%) gene loci. These results suggest that the natural history of cutaneous HPV 2/27/57-induced common warts may be modulated by allele polymorphisms at the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 gene loci.
