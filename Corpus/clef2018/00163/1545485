Role of ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever and to compare its efficacy with chloramphenicol. Eighty patients between 20-45 years with positive blood culture were included in the study. Seventy five percent patients treated with ciprofloxacin became afebrile within 72 hours while with chloramphenicol it took upto 120-144 hours for the same percentage of patients to become afebrile. Four patients resistant to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin/amoxycillin, also responded to ciprofloxacin. There were no significant adverse effects indicating that ciprofloxacin is safe and effective drug for resistant and nonresistant cases of typhoid fever.
