Isolation of Salmonella spp. from liquid and solid excreta prior to and following ensilage in ten swine farms located in central Mexico. A study was carried out to define selected bacteriological characteristics of residues from 10 swine farms, 5 with or without prior clinical enteric disease (PCED) and to determine the effect of ensilage on the bacteria present in the solid fraction. At each farm, samples were taken from the sedimentation basin (SB), the solid fraction (SF), and the liquid fraction (LF). For each sample, CFU/g for enteric bacteria were quantified Salmonella spp. were isolated and typified. Solid phase samples from each farm were used to prepare the ensilage, with a mixture of solids (80%), sorghum (12%) and molasses (8%). The quantity of enteric bacteria was significantly greater in farms without PCED (P < 0.05). Salmonella enterica were isolated from 8/10 of the farms with and without PCED
