Folate is associated with the natural history of high-risk human papillomaviruses. Several micronutrients have been implicated in cervical carcinogenesis. However, their mode of action is still a matter of speculation. In particular, it is unclear whether certain nutrients reduce the probability of acquiring high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) or whether they facilitate the clearance of high-risk HPV. We conducted a 24-month prospective follow-up study to test the hypothesis that systemic concentrations of folate are associated with the occurrence and duration of high-risk HPV infections after controlling for other micronutrients (vitamins B(12), A, E, and C, total carotene) and known risk factors for high-risk HPV infections and cervical cancer. Circulating concentrations of these micronutrients and risk factors for cervical cancer were determined in a cohort of 345 women who were at risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Using the hybrid capture 2 (HC-2) assay, high-risk HPV status was evaluated at 6-month intervals up to 24 months. All women had at least three consecutive visit high-risk HPV test results. Higher folate status was inversely associated with becoming HC-2 test-positive [odds ratio (OR): 0.27 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-0.91
