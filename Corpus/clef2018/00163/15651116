Diagnostic methods for typhoid fever in Nigeria. In this study, 65 patients are screened for Salmonella typhi by conventional culture and the Widal test. In addition, the patients undergo full blood count are screened for malaria parasites. Of the 65 patients, 50 report febrile conditions, while the remaining 15 are used as a control population. In the febrile group, 13 (26%) were positive for S. typhi, while in the control group only one (7%) was positive for S. typhi. Overall, 36 (64.3%) patients had malaria parasites. Patients with a higher O antibody titre (> or = 1 in 80) by Widal test were found to have consumed both tap water and pure water. More females (10/14 mean age: 33) had typhoid fever as a result of S. typhi infection, the majority of which were isolated from stool samples (57%). Nine of the isolates were also positive for malaria parasites, seven of which were in the trophozoite stage. Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite (78%), the remainder being P. malariae. The majority of patients (12/14) with typhoid fever had normal PCV values. In conclusion, it is recommended that tests for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in Nigeria should include malaria parasites, S. typhi culture from faecal samples, and the Widal test.
