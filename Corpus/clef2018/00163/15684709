Genomic and proteomic expression patterns in HPV-16 E6 gene transfected stable human carcinoma cell lines. cDNA microarray and proteomics studies were performed to analyze the genomic and proteomic expression patterns in HPV-16 E6 gene transfected stable human carcinoma cell lines. Among 1024 known genes and ESTs tested by cDNA microarray, we found 50 upregulated and 35 downregulated genes in RC10.1 HPV-16 E6 transfected human colon adenocarcinoma cells compared to RKO cells, and 27 upregulated and 43 downregulated genes in A549E6 HPV-16 E6 transfected human lung adenocarcinoma cells compared to A549 cells. Employing two dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS, the global pattern of protein expressions in RC10.1 human colon adenocarcinoma and A549E6 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines stably expressing the HPV 16-E6 gene were compared with those of RKO and A549 cell lines to generate a differential protein expression catalog. We found 13 upregulated and 13 downregulated proteins in RC10.1 (E6-expressing RKO) cells compared to RKO cells and 12 upregulated and 14 downregulated proteins in A549E6 (E6-expressing A549) cells compared to A549 cells. The identified genes and proteins were classified into several groups according to the subcellular function. Expressing pattern of three genes and proteins (CDK5, Bak, and I-TRAF) were matched in both analyses of cDNA microarray and proteomics. These powerful approaches using cDNA microarray and proteomics could provide in-depth information on the impact of HPV-16 E6-related genes and proteins. Differential gene and protein expression patterns by transfection of HPV-16 E6 will provide the nucleus of valuable resource for investigation of the biochemical basis of cervical carcinogenesis. Further understanding of this data base may provide valuable resources for developing novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets of cervical cancer.
