Short report: prospective evaluation of a multi-test strip for the diagnoses of scrub and murine typhus, leptospirosis, dengue Fever, and Salmonella typhi infection. A multi-test strip dotblot immunoassay for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, scrub typhus, murine typhus, dengue virus infection and leptospirosis was evaluated in Thai adults presenting to hospital with acute, undifferentiated fever. The kit gave multiple positive test results in 33 of 36 patients with defined infections and was therefore not a useful admission diagnostic tool.
