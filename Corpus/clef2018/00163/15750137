Typhoid fever associated with acute appendicitis caused by an H1-j strain of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. While most strains of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, the etiologic agent of typhoid fever, have only a phase 1 flagellar antigen, H1-d, variations of the flagellar antigen have been observed. Although H1-j strains (one of the flagellar antigen variants) account for 10 to 50% of S. enterica serotype Typhi strains found in Indonesia, there have been no published data to suggest its existence in other parts of the world. We describe a case of typhoid fever associated with acute appendicitis caused by an S. enterica serotype Typhi H1-j strain in a Chinese woman in Hong Kong. A gram-negative, motile rod was recovered from her blood and stool cultures. Conventional biochemical tests and the Vitek system (GNI+) showed that the bacterium was S. enterica serotype Typhi. The isolate agglutinated with poly(O), 9O, Vi and H1-j Salmonella antisera but not with poly(H) antisera. The patient developed antibodies against only S. enterica serotype Typhi O antigens but not against H1-d antigen by the Widal test. Flagellin C gene (fliC) sequencing showed a 261-bp deletion in the fliC gene of the isolate, confirming that the isolate possessed the H1-j antigen. The patient had no past history of travel to Indonesia or personal contact with any Indonesian. She recovered with appendectomy and antibiotic treatment. Further studies should be performed to determine the prevalence of this unusual S. enterica serotype Typhi strain in our locality.
