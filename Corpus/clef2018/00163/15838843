A region on human chromosome 4 (q35.1-->qter) induces senescence in cell hybrids and is involved in cervical carcinogenesis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are known to play a major role in cervical carcinogenesis. Additional genetic alterations are required for the development and progression of cervical cancer. Previously, we showed that the introduction of an entire human chromosome 4 into HPV-immortalized cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) can induce senescence in cell hybrids. In the present study, we established eight new murine donor cell lines harboring different fragments of the human chromosome 4. These were tested for their ability to induce senescence by MMCT into HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes (HPK II) and cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). By exclusion, we could identify a region for a putative senescence gene or genes at 4q35.1-->qter. Further evidence that this locus may be involved in cervical carcinogenesis was obtained by studying sections of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN2/3) and cervical cancers from 87 women using a combination of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) and microsatellite PCR. I-FISH indicated copy number loss at 4q34-->qter. Microsatellite analysis showed that loss of one or more alleles at chromosome 4 was more frequent in the cervical carcinomas than in the CINs. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affected four areas, D4S412 (4p16.3), D4S2394 (4q28.2), D4S3041 (4q32.3), and D4S408 (4q35.1), and was highest at D4S408. LOH at terminal 4q has been reported previously for cervical carcinomas and other human malignancies. This is the first report associating allelic loss at 4q34-->qter with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma, and the first experimental evidence that this locus or these loci can induce senescence in cervical carcinoma cells and HPV16-immortalized cells.
