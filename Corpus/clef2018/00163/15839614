Genital human papillomavirus testing by in situ hybridization in liquid atypical cytologic materials and follow-up biopsies. To describe cases of HPV testing by DNA in situ hybridization performed on atypical cervicovaginal samples collected by a liquidsed method that were negative for HPV DNA on cytology but revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia on follow-up biopsies.Three hundred ninety-five consecutive SurePath atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cytologic samples from asymptomatic, reproductive-age women were tested for human papillomaviruses (HPVs) by the in situ hybridization (ISH) method (Ventana Inform HPV Test, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.A). One hundred (25%) cases underwent follow-up colposcopic biopsy within 3 months of cytology. All the tests (cytology, ISH, histology) were independently evaluated without knowledge of the other tests.One hundred twenty-two (33%) cytologic samples were positive for HPVs. Of a total of 100 (HPV positive and negative) follow-up biopsies, 55 were positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Fourteen cases of biopsy-proven CIN tested negative for all HPV types in the prior cytologic samples. Retesting of the 14 CIN tissues by ISH was negative in 10, positive for HPV in 2 and inconclusive in 2.There is a small but significant (14%) false negative rate with HPV testing by the Ventana ISH method. Clinically suspicious cases should be followed even if an HPV test is negative.
