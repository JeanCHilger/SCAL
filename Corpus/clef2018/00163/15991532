Colposcopy vs Hybrid Capture II assay in detection of cervical human papilloma virus infection. Considering the relationship between high-risk human papillomavirus types and the presence or subsequent development of cervical high-grade preinvasive lesions, the aim of the study was to determine if the Hybrid Capture II test can be used to triage women with atypical colposcopic findings.The study was carried out on 100 patients with suspicious colposcopy findings (suggestive of human papillomavirus infection) who underwent a cervical smear for human papillomavirus testing DNA Hybrid Capture II and direct biopsies for histopathological analysis.Sixteen patients were negative for human papillomavirus. Of the eight patients positive for high-risk HPV type, seven presented an abnormal transformation zone grade 2 (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix at histopathology). There was a significant positivity of medium-high risk virus types in the cases with more abnormal colposcopy (chi2 = 7.44 p < 0.005). Histopathological findings of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were registered in the patients positive for medium-high risk human papillomavirus types (chi2 = 7.66Based on these results it can be concluded that if a diagnosis of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion has been made on the basis of colposcopic and histopathological findings, there is a high probability that the infection was due to one or more types of human papillomavirus. There are necessary further studies to interpretate both the advantages and disadvantages of intermediate triage procedures, like Hybrid Capture II testing, compared with immediate colposcopy.
