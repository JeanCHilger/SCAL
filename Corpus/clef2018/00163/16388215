Predominant symptoms were fever (100%), headache (90%), abdominal Pain (37%) and constipation (33%). Common clinical signs were splenomegaly (37%), relative bradycardia (27%) and hepatomegaly (17%). None of the patients presented with complications.The clinical profile of typhoid fever in our study revealed not much difference from that of other studies on typhoid fever. Rose spots were not noticed and we did not find a single case of complication of typhoid fever. Probably early initiation of antibiotics prevented the complications.
