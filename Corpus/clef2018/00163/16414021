Haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in viral-associated neoplasia: Linkage to cervical cancer. The present study examines the frequency of the two main HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a randomly selected population of 346 individuals including 201 DNA samples from women with cervical neoplasia (including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and invasive squamous cell carcinoma) and a control population of 146 women from the same geographical area. We found a significantly lower risk of development of cervical neoplasia in H63D carriers (OR = 0.56 95% CI 0.35-0.92
