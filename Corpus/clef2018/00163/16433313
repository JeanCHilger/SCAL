Clostridium difficile toxin A and other enteropathogens in stool specimens of children hospitalized due to acute diarrhoea. A total of 74 fresh stool specimens obtained from children with acute diarrhoea (43) and without diarrhoea (31) were examined simultaneously for bacteria pathogens (culture methods) and for Clostridium difficile toxin A (Oxoid Toxin A Kits) and enteric viruses (only diarrhoeal samples) (Slidex Rota-Adeno Kits bioMÃ§rieux). One (49%) or dual with C. difficile (23%) enteric pathogens associated with community-acquired diarrhoea (58% bacteria and 14% viruses) in 31 (72%) children were recognized. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) (18,6%) and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (16,3%) the most commonly were observed. Children were considered to have CDAD if they met special criteria such as the positive test for C. difficile toxin A, the presence of diarrhoea for at least 2 days and no other documented enteric pathogens. It was be found that antibiotic usage in the previous 3 weeks as a main risk factor for CDAD not be frequent (only 2/8 CDAD). The frequency of C. difficile toxin A detection in the diarrhoeal stool specimens from children treated or not treated with antibiotics was comparable (p>0,05)
