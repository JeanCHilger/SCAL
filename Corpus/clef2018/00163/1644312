Mutations in the araC gene of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 which affect both activator and auto-regulatory functions of the AraC protein. The araC gene encodes a regulatory protein, AraC, that acts as both an activator and a repressor of transcription of the genes involved in the transport and catabolism of L-arabinose in Salmonella typhimurium LT2. Five araC mutants which have altered regulatory properties were characterized. All are point mutations which would result in amino acid substitutions near the C terminus of AraC. Each mutation results in altered activator and auto-regulatory AraC function in vivo. In vitro DNA-binding assays showed that three mutant AraC have measurable lowered affinity for ara controlling site DNA. The data are consistent with a model in which there is a DNA-binding domain in the C terminus of AraC which functions in both activation and repression.
