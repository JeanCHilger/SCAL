Comparison of immunoblot analysis of emergent multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium definitive phage type 104 with a non-multidrug-resistant definitive phage type 104 strain. The emergent multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella typhimurium definitive phage type 104 (DT104) is a public and veterinary health problem not only due to its wide host range and potential for enhanced virulence, but also the difficulty associated with its control. There is thus a need to investigate possible antigens of MDR DT104.Using standard protocols, whole cell lysates, outer membrane extracts and cell-free ultracentrifuge supernatants of selected isolates of MDR DT104 were prepared, electrophoretically separated and tested for their antigen-antibody reactivity in comparison with a non-MDR DT104 strain.Protein antigens of both strain types were recognized by antibodies in chick serum in a similar manner for all methods of antigen preparation used.This study did not find differences between the antibody recognition of MDR DT104 and that of the non-MDR DT104 strain tested. This observation should strengthen the quest for the possible use of vaccines to control this emergent strain in poultry.
