Severe colitis due to Histoplasma capsulatum in an AIDS patient. The case of a thirty-two-year-old female HIV-positive patient from Ghana admitted with a septic illness, diarrhoea, anaemia, and severe weight loss is presented. During an extensive diagnostic work-up Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and typhoid fever were detected. Specific treatment led to marked improvement in the patient's condition. However, five weeks later high fever and diarrhoea recurred. Histological examination of biopsies from coloscopy and blood cultures revealed Histoplasma capsulatum. The patient recovered completely following antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole. The case presented emphasises the need for medical staff dealing with immunocompromised patients from endemic areas to be aware of symptoms, diagnostic features, and therapeutic measures of this rare fungal infection.
