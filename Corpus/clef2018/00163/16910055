Evaluation of an in-house rapid diagnostic method for detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in fecal specimens. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is the etiological agent of typhoid fever. Laboratory diagnosis requires isolation and identification of the organism from the patient's blood or feces. Feces is the specimen most commonly submitted to laboratories. Detection of bacterial antigens is an important adjunct to laboratory diagnosis. We carried out an in-house diagnostic method by preparing test reagents comprising of latex beads coated with specific antisera to detect Vi, O9 and H-d antigens of S. typhi. Fecal specimens from one hundred patients with diarrhea and fever as well as from twenty healthy controls were incubated for enrichment in Selenite F broth for 6 hours or overnight. Latex agglutination tests to detect antigens of S. typhi were carried out on centrifuged broth supernatants. Parallel cultures on media selective for S. typhi were also set up. Nine of the supernatants were positive for two or more specific antigens and S. typhi grew in three of the corresponding cultures. None of the samples from 20 healthy controls were positive by either the diagnostic method or by culture. The result of the in-house diagnostic assay can be obtained overnight and may help in directing immediate antimicrobial therapy.
