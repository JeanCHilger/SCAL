Comparison of API 20E and invA PCR for identification of Salmonella enterica isolates from swine production units. API 20E and invA PCR were evaluated for the identification of Salmonella enterica isolates from swine farms. API 20E had the highest agreement with other tests at the 99.9% likelihood level. Both tests had 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity compared to 16S rRNA sequencing. Compared to serotyping, both tests had 96% sensitivity specificity was 86% for API 20E and 79% for invA PCR.
