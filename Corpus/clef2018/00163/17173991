A simple nucleic acid hybridization/latex agglutination assay for the rapid detection of polymerase chain reaction amplicons. We have developed a new method for the detection of nucleic acid hybridization, based on a simple latex agglutination test that can be evaluated by the unaided eye. Nucleic acid, e.g., a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, is denatured and incubated with polystyrene beads carrying covalently bound complementary oligonucleotide sequences. Hybridization of the nucleic acids leads to aggregation of the latex particles, thereby verifying the presence of target sequence. The test is performed at room temperature, and results are available within 10 min. As a proof of principle, the hybridization/latex agglutination assay was applied to the detection of purified PCR fragments either specific for Salmonella spp. or a synthetic sequence, and to the detection of Salmonella enterica in artificially contaminated chicken samples. A few nanograms of purified PCR fragments were detectable. In artificially contaminated chicken samples, 3 colony-forming units (cfu)/25 g were detected in one of three replicates, and 30 cfu/25 g were detected in both of two replicates when samples for PCR were taken directly from primary enrichment, demonstrating the practical applicability of this test system. Even multiplex detection might be achievable. This novel kind of assay could be useful for a range of applications where hybridization of nucleic acids, e.g., PCR fragments, is to be detected.
