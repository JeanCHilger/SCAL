Lack of the alpha-1,2-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine epitope in the outer core structures of lipopolysaccharides from certain O serogroups and subspecies of Salmonella enterica. A total of 176 strains of Salmonella enterica representing 116 serotypes were tested for the presence of the T6 epitope of the alpha-1,2-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue by reaction with a murine monoclonal antibody T6 specific for this structure in the Salmonella Ra core lipopolysaccharide (LPS). All 20 serotypes (70 strains) belonging to serogroups A to E were positive for the T6 epitope while 29% of the 96 serotypes (106 strains) belonging to O serogroups F to 67 were negative 12 serotypes (12 strains) of subspecies IIIb Salmonella were positive for the T6 epitope, but 10 serotypes (11 strains) of subspecies IIIa Salmonella were found to lack this epitope. In T6-positive strains, the epitope was accessible to antibody binding in both the unsubstituted free rough core LPS and in the rough core LPS substituted with a few repeating units of O side chains. The presence or absence of the T6 epitope in Salmonella strains was not affected by culture conditions, the source of the isolate, the age of the culture or the presence of fimbriae antigens.
