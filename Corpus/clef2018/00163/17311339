HPV16 E6 variants and HLA class II polymorphism among Chinese women with cervical cancer. Infection with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) confers a high risk for the development of cervical cancer. Variants of this virus may interact differentially with host genetic factors, possibly affecting the disease pathogenesis. This study was designed to investigate the association between HPV16 E6 variants and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism within a Chinese population. Peripheral blood from HPV16 positive Chinese women with cervical carcinoma, who had previously been tested for HPV16 E6 variants, was used for HLA class II typing. It was found that there was a significant positive association between DQB1*060101 allele and HPV16 As variant-positive cervical cancers (OR, 4.47 Pc=0.0018). A negative relationship was found between DRB1*150101-DQB1*0602 haplotype and decreased risk for HPV16 As variant-positive cervical cancers (OR=0.31
