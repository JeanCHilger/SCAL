Retrospective study on the isolated strains of Salmonella in an Iranian hospital in Kermanshah. A survey of occurrence of Salmonella in blood and bone marrow cultures was conducted in 1989-1990 and 1999-2000 (Sina hospital, Kermanshah). A total of 496 (12.3%) and 60 (2.4%) Salmonella strains were isolated (from 4020 and 2447 cultures). In 1989-1990, the isolated strains were: S. typhi 448 (98.5%), S. paratyphi A 40 (8%), S. paratyphi B 5 (1%) and S. paratyphi C 3 (0.5%). In 1999-2000, the isolated strains were S. typhi 59 (98%) and S. paratyphi B 1 (1.5%). There was a 60.9% reduction in the number of specimens over the 2 periods. The rate of Salmonella isolation fell from 12.3% (1989-1990) to 2.4% (1999-2000). There was a 10.2, 8.3 and 6.6 times increase in resistance of S. typhi strains to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole respectively.
