Paratyphoid sepsis. A large for gestational age male baby was born to a healthy young primigravida, on L-thyroxime, at 40 weeks by caesarean delivery in a tertiary care hospital. The baby had episodes of hypoglycemia during his immediate four postnatal days in the nursery that were successfully managed with intravenous glucose administration. The baby became unwell on day 5 and had a positive sepsis-screening test. Blood culture revealed a multidrug susceptible S. Paratyphi A strain, which he probably acquired on the first or second postnatal day from the contaminated expressed breast milk or the formula feed.
