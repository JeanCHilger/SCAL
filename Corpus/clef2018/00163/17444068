Uncomplicated falciparum malaria complicated by salmonella septicaemia: cause not coincidence. A male patient of 10-year-old presented with fever, headache and vomiting for last few days. He was being treated with antimalarial drugs. On 14th day of illness he again showed rise of temperature. His blood culture showed growth of Salmonella typhi. He was treated with ceftriaxone and responded favourably. Here uncomplicated falciparum malaria developed a secondary infection with salmonella during hospital stay. This uncommon association was noted rather than a mere coincidence, which rarely reported in literature.
