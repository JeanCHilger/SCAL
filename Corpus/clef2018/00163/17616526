RbAp48 is a critical mediator controlling the transforming activity of human papillomavirus type 16 in cervical cancer. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the primary cause of cervical cancer, the molecular mechanism by which HPV induces cervical cancer remains largely unclear. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis with mass spectrometry to study protein expression profiling between HPV16-positive cervical mucosa epithelial H8 cells and cervical cancer Caski cells to identify 18 differentially expressed proteins. Among them, retinoblastoma-binding protein 4 (RbAp48) was selected, and its differentiation expression was verified with both additional cervical cancer-derived cell lines and human tissues of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. Suppression of RbAp48 using small interfering RNA approach in H8 cells significantly stimulated cell proliferation and colony formation and inhibited senescence-like phenotype. Remarkably, H8 cells acquired transforming activity if RpAp48 was suppressed, because H8 cells stably transfected with RbAp48 small interfering RNA led to tumor formation in nude mice. In addition, overexpression of RbAp48 significantly inhibited cell growth and tumor formation. This RbAp48-mediated transformation of HPV16 is probably because of the regulation by RbAp48 of tumor suppressors retinoblastoma and p53, apoptosis-related enzymes caspase-3 and caspase-8, and oncogenic genes, including E6, E7, cyclin D1 (CCND1), and c-MYC. In brief, RbAp48, previously unknown in cervical carcinogenesis, was isolated in a global screen and identified as a critical mediator controlling the transforming activity of HPV16 in cervical cancer.
