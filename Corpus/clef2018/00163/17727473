Biomarker-assisted diagnosis of ovarian, cervical and pulmonary small cell carcinomas: the role of TTF-1, WT-1 and HPV analysis. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcaemic-type (SCCOH) is morphologically similar to small cell carcinomas from other sites. The aims of this study were to (i) determine if a biomarker panel would distinguish small cell carcinomas of the ovary, cervix (SCCCx) and lung (SCCLu) and (ii) potentially determine the histogenesis of SCCOH.Nine ovarian small cell carcinomas (seven hypercalcaemic type two pulmonary type), eight SCCCx and 22 SCCLu were immunostained for thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1, WT-1, p16, cKIT and OCT3/4Combined staining with WT-1 and TTF-1 will distinguish SCCOH from SCCLu and SCCCx with a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 97%. HPV is specific for tumours of cervical origin, but p16 immunohistochemistry is not useful for this purpose. The presence of diffuse WT-1 supports a MÃ¼llerian origin for SCCOH, whereas the absence of cKIT and OCT3/4 argues against a germ cell origin.
