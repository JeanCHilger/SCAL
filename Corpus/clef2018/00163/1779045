The behavior of selected microorganisms during the manufacture of high moisture Jack cheeses from ultrafiltered milk. Whole milk was pasteurized and concentrated two times by ultrafiltration. Starter cultures, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, were propagated in either reconstituted skim milk, two times UF retentate, or UF permeate, or a direct vat system was used for the starter culture. The cheese milk was simultaneously inoculated with starter culture and Pseudomonas fragi 4973, Staphylococcus aureus 196E, and Salmonella typhimurium var. Hillfarm. Control whole milk, UF control milk, inoculated whole milk, and inoculated UF milk were made into Monterey Jack cheese using traditional procedures. The process of cheese manufacture was followed by determination of pH, titratable acidity, and microbial population levels. The cheeses were stored for 6 mo and analyzed every month for percentage solids and microbial population levels. Generally, numbers of contaminant microbes increased at a similar rate during manufacture in all cheeses. During the 6-mo ripening period, bacterial starter culture population levels remained high, psychrotrophs declined slowly, Staphylococcus levels remained stable, and Salmonella populations decreased. No Staphylococcus enterotoxin was detected by reverse passive latex agglutination assay.
