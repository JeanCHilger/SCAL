Ofloxacin in the treatment of infection caused by Salmonella paratyphi A. We reported a case of salmonellosis treated with ofloxacin (OFLX) which showed excellent clinical and bacteriological effect in a 22 year-old Japanese male with Salmonellosis paratyphi A. He had stayed in India from Sept. 6, 1990 to Oct. 13, 1990. On Oct. 25, 1990, he complained of a high fever and headache. On Oct. 29, he was admitted to our hospital and was diagnosed as Salmonellosis paratyphi A by the blood culture. He was treated with 2.0 g/day of chloramphenicol (CP) for 7 days, but the clinical efficacy was not sufficient. Therefore, we added 900 mg/day of OFLX for 10 days. He was treated successfully with them, the temperature became on the 2nd day. No side effect and no changes of laboratory data were observed and no recurrence was observed clinically and bacteriologically for three months after his discharge.
