Evaluation of commercial antisera for Salmonella serotyping. We compared a set of commercial Salmonella somatic and flagellar serotyping antisera to in-house-prepared antisera from the Microbial Diseases Laboratory, California Department of Public Health, using 327 Salmonella enterica strains belonging to subgroups I, II, IIIa, IIIb, and IV. The sensitivities of Denka Seiken (Tokyo, Japan) somatic and flagellar antisera (using a tube agglutination assay) were 94.0% and 99.2%, respectively, and the specificity was 100% for both sets of sera. Polyvalent O and O1 antiserum sensitivity and specificity were >90%, with the exception of polyvalent O1 antiserum, for which sensitivity was 88.9%. When Denka Seiken flagellar antisera were used in a slide agglutination assay, the sensitivity and accuracy dropped to 88.9% and the specificity fell to 91%. Overall, Denka Seiken commercial antisera performed very well and, together with the comprehensive range of factors available, offer laboratories quality reagents suitable for serotyping strains of salmonellae.
