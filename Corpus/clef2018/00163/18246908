Evaluation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and hybrid capture II (HCII) assay for the detection of human papillomavirus in cervical scrapings. In order to investigate the reliability of detecting HPV DNA in cervical smears, we compared the performance of nested MY/GP PCR and FDA approved-Hybrid Capture II (HCII) using clinical cervical scrapings from 40 patients. It was found that PCR was more sensitive (81.8%) in comparison to HCII (36.4%) in detecting HPV although specificity of HCII was much higher (96.6%) than PCR (58.6%). The Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of both the techniques were quite similar but Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of HCII was much higher (80.0%) compared to PCR (42.9%). While the HCII method showed good specificity for HPV detection, its lack of sensitivity as compared to PCR may be a drawback for diagnostic use.
