Abnormal Pap smears in inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that is frequently treated with immunomodulators. Previous work has demonstrated an increased risk for abnormal cervical cytology in women treated with chronic immunosuppression, due mainly to human papillomavirus. This review summarizes the data known for this relationship in women with IBD, and management strategies for patients found to have abnormal cervical cytology.
