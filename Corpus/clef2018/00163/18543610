CCR5-Delta32 polymorphism and susceptibility to cervical cancer: association with early stage of cervical cancer. Inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Chemokines are involved in inflammation, cancer, and infectious diseases. Therefore, we evaluated the association of the chemokine receptor gene polymorphism CCR5 Delta32 with risk of cervical cancer. A total of 150 histopathologically confirmed patients with cervical cancer and 162 age and ethnically matched cervical cytology negative healthy controls were genotyped for CCR5 Delta32 polymorphisms using PCR. Association of CCR5 Delta32 genotypes with risk of cervical cancer, clinical stages, and tobacco exposure was analyzed using chi-square statistical tests. The frequency of the mutant allele CCR5 Delta32 was higher in patients with cervical carcinoma (2.3%) but there was no statistically significant difference (OR = 1.51 p = 0.685
