The determination in saliva of IgA antibodies to Shigella ribosomes for the diagnosis of dysentery. The levels of antiribosomal antibodies to Shigella ribosomes in serum and saliva samples from 38 dysentery patients (15 S. sonnei cases and 23 S. flexneri cases), 14 patients with salmonellosis and 136 healthy adults were determined in ELISA with ribosomes from S. sonnei R-mutant used as solid-phase antigen. High levels of "normal" antiribosomal IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies were revealed in the sera of healthy persons while the level of salivary IgA antibodies was very low. In dysentery infection no increase in the levels of serum IgG and IgM antibodies and only a slight increase in the level of IgA antibodies were revealed. Local immune response was manifested by the early (on days 2-4 from the onset of infection) and significant augmentation (12- to 16-fold) of salivary antiribosomal IgA antibodies. An increase in the level of these antibodies was registered in 95-100% of dysentery patients but not in patients with salmonellosis, which made it possible to recommend the method for diagnosing shigellosis. Immune response to Shigella ribosomal antigens, in contrast to the response induced by Shigella O-antigen, is almost exclusively local.
