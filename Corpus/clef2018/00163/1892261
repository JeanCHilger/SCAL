Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of Salmonella enteritidis infection in chickens. An ELISA was developed and tested for its ability to detect antibodies against Salmonella enteritidis in chickens. Various features of the ELISA were evaluated and optimized. The outer membrane protein antigens selected by use of the protein immunoblotting method made the assay specific and sensitive. The assay was evaluated in chickens experimentally infected with S enteritidis. Blood samples collected at weekly intervals after experimental infection with S enteritidis were analyzed by ELISA. Results of the ELISA were compared with those of conventional serum plate and microagglutination tests. The ELISA was more sensitive and specific in the detection of S enteritidis infection than the other 2 conventional tests.
