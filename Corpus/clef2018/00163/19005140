Controlled evaluation of Bactec Peds Plus/F and Bactec lytic/10 anaerobic/F media for isolation of Salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi A from blood. We compared anaerobic lytic (AL) and pediatric aerobic resin-containing (Peds Plus/F) blood culture media for the isolation of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi A from children. The yields from AL and Peds Plus/F media were the same with equal volumes of blood, but recovery was faster from AL medium than Peds Plus/F medium (10.7 and 16.4 h, respectively) (P < 0.001).
