Etiology and pathogenesis of precancerous lesions and invasive cervical carcinoma. Cervical cancer is the second most common gynecological malignancy in the world. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the leading ethiologic agent in the development of premalignant and malignant cervical diseases. HPV is a member of the Papovaviridae family and until now over 100 types have been recognized There are two types of viral infection: latent and productive. Virus induced oncogenesis is the result of interaction between virus oncoproteins E6 and E7 and tumor supresor host genes p53 and Rb. Many cofactors such as immunosuppression, early sexual relationship, multiple sexual partners, other sexualy transsmited infections and smoking are contributing factors of the precancerous and invasive cervical lesions. According to the oncogenic potential HPV are divided into three groups: low, intermediate and high oncogenic risk viruses. Molecular technics which are used for the virus detection are: In situ hibridisation, Hyybrid capture test and polymerasa chain reaction. Human papilloma virus testing has an important role in the follow up and treatment of women with "atypical squamous cells of unknown significant" changes in cervical smears and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, changes in punch biopsy.
