Epstein-Barr virus detection in invasive and pre-invasive lesions of the uterine cervix. In the present study, our aim was to investigate whether EBV DNA could be found in association with invasive and pre-invasive cervical cancer lesions. We hypothesize that EBV is not merely a commensal agent when present in malignant cervical lesions. DNA was extracted from cervical scrapings followed by nested PCR-based amplification. The patients were 66 women with high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 14 women with invasive cervical cancer. The control group consisted of 89 women with a normal Pap smear and colposcopy as well as a negative HPV DNA test. Analysis of our results, in conjunction with the work of other authors, leads us to propose that EBV is not merely a commensal agent when present in malignant cervical lesions. The presence of DNA from EBV is significantly associated with cervical cancer.
