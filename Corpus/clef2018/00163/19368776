Potent anti-HPV immune responses induced by tandem repeats of the HPV16 L2 (20 -- 38) peptide displayed on bacterial thioredoxin. The minor capsid protein L2 is a promising candidate for the construction of an anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) broadly protective vaccine for the prophylaxis of cervical cancer. However, L2-derived peptides are usually poorly immunogenic and extensive knowledge on the most relevant (cross)neutralizing epitope(s) is still needed. We systematically examined the immunogenicity and virus neutralization potential of six peptides encompassing the N-terminal (amino acids 1 -- 120) region of HPV16 L2 (20 -- 38 28 -- 42
