Ciprofloxacin in typhoid fever. The study covers 78 children with typhoid fever who were hospitalized in April & May 1990. Serious complications were present in 32% (toxemia 22%, ileus 25% and myocarditis 8%). Blood cultures were positive in 30 of 49 tested. Others were diagnosed by positive Widal test. In vitro cultures of S. typhi were resistant to chloramphenicol (90%), ampicillin (93%) and co-trimoxazole (97%). However all were highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin and moderately sensitive to cephalexin and gentamycin. Ciprofloxacin alone or in combination was given in 73 of the 78 children and found to be remarkably effective in controlling the disease and preventing relapse. No serious side effects were noted. The cohort is being followed up for possible long term adverse effects.
