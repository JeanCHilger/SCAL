Comparative study of dot enzyme immunoassay (Typhidot-M) and Widal test in the diagnosis of typhoid fever. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of Typhidot-M and Widal test with blood culture (gold standard) for diagnosing typhoid fever in 105 children aged 1-15 years admitted with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever. Of the 105 cases, blood culture was positive for S.typhi in 41 (39%) children, Widal test was positive in 48 (45.7%) and Typhidot-M was positive in 78 (74.3%) cases. Sensitivity and specificity of Typhidot-M was 92.6% and 37.5% while sensitivity and specificity of Widal test was 34.1% and 42.8%, respectively. In children with fever of less than 7 days duration, Typhidot-M was positive in 97%, compared to 24.2% by Widal test. Typhidot-M is a simple and sensitive test for early diagnosis of typhoid fever in children.
