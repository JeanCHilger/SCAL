Clinical, epidemiological, and pathogenetic aspects of formation of persisting forms of high oncogenic risk papillomavirus infection in women. To reveal factors related with presence of human papillomavirus in women.Nine hundred and fifty women of childbearing age from 18 to 45 years old (30 of them--almost healthy) were examined. Samples of epithelium of urogenital tract obtained by scrapings were tested for the presence of urogenital infections by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colposcopy, cytologic study, and ultrasound examination of pelvic organs were conducted.Human papillomaviruses types 16 and 18 were detected in 41% of studied women. Of them, persisting form of papillomavirus infection was identified in 38%. Following factors promoted the development of persisting papillomavirus infection in women: age under 21 years, presence of pelvic inflammatory disease (endometritis, salpingoophoritis), cervical ectopy, use of untrauterine devices, oncologic diseases in family history, and presence of pointed condylomas. Signs specific for chronic inflammatory disease of cervix were observed significantly more frequently in women with persisting papillomavirus infection.Association between presence of chronic inflammatory diseases of female reproductive system, related with different adverse factors, and persistence of human papillomavirus of high oncogenic risk in women.
