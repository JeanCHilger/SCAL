Isolation of Yersinia spp. from cases of diarrhoea in Iraqi infants and children. All 250 children presenting with diarrhoea at 2 teaching hospitals in Mosul, Iraq over a 9-month period were studied for the presence of Yersinia spp. in stools by cold-enrichment culture at 4 degrees C for 21 days. Pathogenicity of the isolated Yersinia was determined. Antibodies to Y. enterocolitica were raised for rapid Yersinia detection in the stool. Yersinia spp. were isolated from the stools of only 4 patients 3 isolates were identified as Y. enterocolitica and 1 was Y. pseudotuberculosis. The blood culture was also positive for Y. enterocolitica in 1 case. The antibiogram test for the isolated Yersinia was determined. Cross-reaction between Y. pseudotuberculosis and Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi B, and between Y. enterocolitica and Brucella was detected serologically.
