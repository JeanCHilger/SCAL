Salmonella myocarditis in a young adult patient presenting with acute pulmonary edema, rhabdomyolysis, and multi-organ failure. The mortality and morbidity of salmonella infections is seriously underestimated. Salmonella myocarditis is an unusual complication of salmonella sepsis in adults. Cases that do occur may be associated with high morbidity and mortality. We present a rare case of salmonella myocarditis with multi-organ failure in a previously healthy young adult man who was brought to the emergency room with fever, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and altered sensorium, discovered to have acute pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise for which he was assisted with mechanical ventilation for 8 days. Blood culture grew Salmonella typhi. Biochemically he exhibited myocardial, hepatic, and muscular enzymatic surge with renal failure, features of rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient showed a progressive improvement on treatment with ceftriaxone for 2 weeks in addition to decongestive therapy. He was discharged in good condition afterward.
