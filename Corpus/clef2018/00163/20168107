Effect of the number of biopsies on the subsequent acquisition of new human papillomavirus infections. To analyze the effect of number of biopsies taken at enrollment with incident human papillomavirus (HPV) infections detected at the next 6-month visit.Using data from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCUS) and Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), we compared the 6-month acquisition of new HPV infections among 988 women who underwent colposcopy, were not diagnosed and treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe lesions, and had polymerase chain reaction results for 38 HPV genotypes at enrollment and follow-up. Our analysis considered each woman's possible acquisition of each of these HPV genotypes.The average 6-month acquisition of any HPV genotype for women with zero, one, and two or more biopsies was 1.82%, 1.74%, and 1.97%, respectively (Ptrend=.7). In a logistic regression model that controlled for age, baseline HPV status, and having a new sexual partner during the 6-month follow-up, two or more biopsies (compared with one biopsy) was not associated with acquiring HPV (odds ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.75-1.3).Multiple biopsies compared with a single biopsy did not increase the likelihood of acquiring new HPV infections.II.
