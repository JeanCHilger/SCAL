Rapid, sensitive, type specific PCR detection of the E7 region of human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 from paraffin embedded sections of cervical carcinoma.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and in particularly infection with HPVs 16 and 18, is a central carcinogenic factor in the uterine cervix. We established and optimized a PCR assay for the detection and discrimination of HPV types 16 and 18 in archival formaldehyde fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections of cervical cancer.Tissue blocks from 35 cases of in situ or invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma and surrogate FFPE sections containing the cell lines HeLa and SiHa were tested for HPV 16 and HPV18 by conventional PCR using type specific primers, and for the housekeeping gene beta-actin. Using HPV 16 E7 primers, PCR products with the expected length were detected in 18 of 35 of FFPE sections (51%). HPV 18 E7 specific sequences were detected in 3 of 35 FFPE sections (9%).In our experience, the PCR technique is a robust, simple and sensitive way of type specific detection of HPV16 and HPV18 genes in FFPE tissue. That makes this technique applicable to routine practices of HPV detection.
