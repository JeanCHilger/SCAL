A comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of cervical pre-cancer detection methods in a high-risk area in East Congo. Given the high burden of cervical cancer in low-income settings, there is a need for a convenient and affordable method for detecting and treating pre-cancerous lesions.Samples for comparing the accuracy of cytology, virology and histology were collected. Identification of HPV E6/E7 mRNA was performed using PreTect HPV-Proofer. HPV DNA detection was performed by GP5+/6+ PCR, followed by reverse line blot (RLB) for typing.A total of 343 women, aged 25-60 years, attending gynaecological polyclinics in DR Congo were included for sample enrolment. The test positivity rate was conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) at cutoff ASCUS+ of 6.9 and 6.6%, respectively PreTect HPV-Proofer of 7.3%Both HPV detection assays showed a higher sensitivity for CIN2+ than did cytological methods. Detecting E6/E7 mRNA from only a subset of HR HPVs, as is the case with PreTect HPV-Proofer, resulted in a similar specificity to cytology and a significantly higher specificity than consensus HR HPV DNA (P<0.0001).
