Effect of bovine lactoferrin in Salmonella ser. Typhimurium infection in mice. Lactoferrin (LF) has in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium causes systemic infection and acute diarrhea in humans, mainly in children younger than 2 years of age. The aim of the study was to determine the in vivo effect of bovine LF in Salmonella ser. Typhimurium infection in mice. 58 BALB/c mice were employed. Two hours before the infection with 300 microl of 10(7) CFU of Salmonella ser. Typhimurium, 29 mice received LF (2 mg) and 29 placebo (buffer). After the infection, the mice received LF (10 mg/ml) ad libitum or buffer, respectively, for 7 days. Mortality, weight and clinical signs (piloerection, hunched position and reduced movement) were monitored daily. The degree of inflammation and necrosis in the intestine, liver, spleen and brain were studied with a blinded observer. The mortality in the control group (8/29) was higher than in the LF group (1/29) (Kapplan Meier P < 0.05). From the third day post-infection the control group were significantly more symptomatic (P < 0.05). The blood culture for Salmonella spp. was positive for all mice studied in the control group (17/17), but positive in the LF group in only 6/17 animals (P < 0.05). In the LF group, the pathologic studies show less inflammation and focal necrosis in the four organs studied, with the greatest difference found in the intestine. Bovine LF protects against Salmonella ser. Typhimurium infection in mice, reducing the severity, mortality and the degree of inflammation of this infection.
