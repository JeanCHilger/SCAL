Effect of patient age on outcomes and compliance in women with minimally abnormal pap tests. To assess follow-up and histologic outcomes by age for an indigent urban cohort of women with minimally abnormal cytology.Retrospective analysis of Pap tests was performed (January 2, 2002, to June 30, 2005). Adolescents (age < 21) and women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)/high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) Pap results were studied and followed for outcomes at 2 years. The chi2 test was performed to evaluate differences among groups statistical significance was established as p < or = 0.05.A total of 2,266 women were studied--676 adolescents, 1,063 women aged 21-30 years, and 527 women > 30 years of age. Results included 619 ASCUS/ high-risk HPV and 1,647 LSIL results. Compliance was similar across age-groups 31% never returned for follow-up. CIN2 was detected in 18.8% of adolescents, 21.6% of women aged 21-30, and 15.7% of women > 30 years (p = 0.53). CIN3 was detected in 8.5% of adolescents, 8.1% of women aged 21-30, and 7.7% of women > 30 years (p = 0.55).Adolescents and women had similar rates of loss to follow-up after having a minimally abnormal Pap test. The likelihood of detecting CIN2-3 was similar regardless of age.
