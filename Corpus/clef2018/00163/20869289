Cervical dysplasia in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in areas of high prevalence of infection. To determine the prevalence of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions among HIV-positive women, compared to that of HIV-negative women and identify the different types of lesions in both groups.Cross-sectional study conducted in 16 months in two facilities and the service of pathological anatomy of Bangui. The sample consisted of 250 HIV-positive women matched to 250 HIV-negative women. The parameters studied were the HIV status, the result of cervical smear screening, the rates of CD4 and the data of the interview.The smears were inflammatory in 54.4% of HIV-negative and 46.4% of HIV-positive. Epidermoid intraepithelial lesions of the cervix were more frequent among HIV-positive women than among HIV-negative women with respectively 34.8% and 16.4% (P<0.0001). The low-grade lesions were more common regardless of HIV status of patients. The median age of onset of the LEI was lower among HIV-positive whatever the grade of the lesion. KoÃ¯locytosis was found in 27.2% of HIV-positive women against 9.2% among HIV-negative (P<0.001).The prevention of infection by HIV and HPV and the monitoring of precancerous lesions would allow to prevent their evolution towards invasive cancer.
