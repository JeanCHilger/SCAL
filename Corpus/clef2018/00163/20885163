Random biopsy after colposcopy-directed biopsy improves the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse. To evaluate the usefulness of additional random biopsies in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2) or worse (CIN 2+) after colposcopy-directed biopsy.A retrospective chart review was performed in 107 women with satisfactory colposcopy results after colposcopy-directed biopsy with random biopsy for abnormal cervical cytological evaluation at Soonchunhyang University Hospital between April 2008 and November 2009. Random biopsies were performed at the cervical squamocolumnar junction in lesion-free quadrants of the cervix. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure conizations were performed in 59 women. Age, referral cytology, lesion size, human papilloma virus (HPV) viral load, and HPV type were analyzed as possible indicators of lesion severity detected using random biopsy.The mean age was 39.3 years (range = 21-72 y), and 96 (89.7%) women were premenopausal. Sixty-three women had CIN 2+ of those, 8 (12.7%) were diagnosed using random biopsies: 6 had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesionsThe detection of CIN 2+, particularly high-grade cytological abnormalities and large lesion size, can be increased by additional random biopsies after satisfactory colposcopy. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure conization can detect lesions not detected by punch biopsy.
