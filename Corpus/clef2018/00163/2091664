Determination of antibody from typhoid patients against lipopolysaccharide and protein antigens of Salmonella typhi. Although the Widal test is simple, inexpensive and the most widely used for serodiagnosis of typhoid fever, the sensitivity and specificity of the test is sometimes doubtful. In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of serum IgG and IgM antibodies to protein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens of Salmonella typhi which was compared with the Widal test in various groups of subjects. In typhoid patients with hemocultures positive for S. typhi (TP group), ELISA positivity was found on 100% for IgG antiprotein, 94.44% for IgG anti-LPS and 88.89% for IgM to both the protein and LPS antigens. In contrast, the Widal test was positive in only 61.11% for anti-O and 83.33% for anti-H antibodies. In healthy control subjects (HC group), only 5% of serum samples were positive for IgG anti-protein and none was positive for IgG anti-LPS or IgM to either the protein or LPS. In contrast, the Widal test was positive in 7.5% of HC group for anti-O and 17.5% for anti-H antibodies. In blood bank donors (BB group), both ELISA and Widal tests were positive in 23-40% of sera. Since the hospital records of BB group were incomplete. It might be possible that some of these subjects had recently been infected with S. typhi. Our data indicate that the standard Widal test was associated with false negative reactions in 16-39% of blood culture positive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
