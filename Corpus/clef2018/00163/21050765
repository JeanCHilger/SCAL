Persistence of human papillomavirus infection: keys to malignant progression. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiologic agents of cervical and other epithelial cancers. Persistence of infections by high-risk HPV types is the single greatest risk factor for malignant progression. Although prophylactic vaccines have been developed that target high-risk HPV types, there is a continuing need to understand better the virus-host interactions that underlie persistent benign infection and progression to cancer. In this review we summarize the molecular events that facilitate the differentiation-dependent HPV life cycle, how the life cycle is organized to facilitate virus persistence, and how the activities of HPV regulatory proteins result in malignancy.
