Impact of human papillomavirus-related lesions on quality of life: a multicenter hospital-based study of women in Mainland China. To date, few studies using a human papillomavirus (HPV)-specific questionnaire have focused on the impact of quality of life (QoL) among women with HPV-related lesions in developing countries.A multicenter, hospital-based survey was conducted from 2007 to 2008. Women 18 to 65 years old who had HPV-related lesions or underwent HPV-related screening interventions during the past 3 months were recruited and divided into 6 groups based on different diagnoses: (1) normal Papanicolaou (Pap) test result, (2) abnormal Pap test result without HPV test, (3) external genital warts (GWs), (4) precancerous cervical lesions (confirmed by histological diagnoses), (5) HPV positive (HPV+) after abnormal Pap test result, and (6) HPV negative (HPV-) after abnormal Pap test result. Psychosocial burdens were assessed by the HPV impact profile (HIP). The HIP contains 7 domains and 29 questions, and its scores reversely relates to the subjects' QoL.A total of 2605 eligible women were enrolled. Women with GWs had the highest mean HIP scores (52.2), followed by the group with precancerous cervical lesions (48.6), HPV+ after abnormal Pap (45.8), abnormal Pap test result without HPV test (44.1), HPV- after abnormal Pap (43.1), and women with normal Pap endured the least (33.1). "Sexual impact," "self-image," and "control/life impact" were the 3 QoL-related domains that affected women the most. The psychosocial burden of urban residents was heavier than that of rural women.Women with GWs and precancerous cervical lesions had the worst psychological burden, and sexual-related concern was the primary cause of burdens regarding HPV-related diseases for Chinese women. In addition to basic medical treatments, psychosocial support systems should be established, and consultation services should be generalized to help alleviate these burdens.
