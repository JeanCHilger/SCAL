Women's knowledge and awareness of gynecologic cancer: a multisite qualitative study in the United States. U.S. women's awareness and knowledge of gynecologic cancer have not been well studied, with the exception of cervical cancer screening and risk factors.Fifteen focus groups were conducted with women aged 40-60 years in Miami, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.Most participants said they had heard of cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancers but were unfamiliar with vaginal and vulvar cancers. The misconception that the Pap test screens for multiple gynecologic cancers was prevalent and engendered a false sense of security in some women. An annual Pap screening interval was most familiar to participants some mentioned a shorter screening interval for high-risk womenParticipants lacked critical knowledge needed to understand their gynecologic cancer risk and seek appropriate care. Pap tests and routine examinations offer ideal opportunities to educate women about the purpose of the Pap test as well as risk factors and symptoms associated with various gynecologic cancers. The reported influence of the mass media also supports the viability of multimedia educational strategies.
