Is early cervical cancer screening justified?. Pap smear screening of women under 25 years old remains controversial. No randomized study exists on this topic. The perception of individual benefit often prevails, although there is no proof of effectiveness and no demonstrated risk-benefit ratio. A review of published studies - taking into account epidemiological data, effectiveness of screening of young women, adverse medical outcomes and costs - suggests that there are more arguments against screening before 25 than in favour of it.
