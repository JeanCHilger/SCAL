Validation of the Dri-Dot Latex agglutination and IgM lateral flow assays for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in an Egyptian population. Laboratory confirmation of typhoid fever is essential for appropriate medical treatment. Blood culture is a standard test for diagnosis of typhoid fever, but well-equipped diagnostic facilities to perform culture are seldom available in endemic areas. We retrospectively compared 2 diagnostic field tests, a latex agglutination Dri-Dot assay and an IgM Lateral Flow assay, to blood culture, in patients with clinically diagnosed typhoid fever. Sensitivity of the Dri-Dot was 71.4%, and specificity was 86.3% for samples collected at time of first diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity of IgM Lateral Flow were 80% and 71.4%, respectively. A major limitation of these serologic tests is the limited sensitivity at the early stage of the disease. Performing both tests in parallel increased sensitivity to 84.3%, but decreased specificity to 70.5%. There was a trend towards improved diagnostic performance using either assay over a longer duration of illness. These rapid, point-of-care assays for typhoid fever provide easy-to-interpret results in typhoid-endemic countries and may be most useful in patients presenting 1 week after symptom onset.
