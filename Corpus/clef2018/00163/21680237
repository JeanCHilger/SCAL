Cervical Human Papillomavirus in transplanted Italian women: a long-term prospective follow-up study. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer among women. Immunosuppression is recognized as one of the major risk factors for HPV infection and persistence.Aim of this study was to determine if solid organs (24 kidney and 24 kidney/pancreas) transplanted Italian women undergoing immunosuppressive therapies were at higher risk of HPV genital infection and cervical precancerous lesions in a ten-year follow-up.Forty-eight women that underwent transplant from 1990 to 2000, receiving multi-drug immunosuppressive therapy, were enrolled prospectively in a long-term follow-up protocol. Patients were cytologically (Pap smear) and virologically (HPV-DNA test) tested each year for 10 years. Incidence of HPV-DNA positivity and of cervical cytological/histological abnormalities was collected. Results were statistically analyzed and compared to a matching control group of 200 healthy women.HPV-DNA positivity and cytological High-Grade (HG-SIL) cervical lesions did not show statistically significant differences in cases compared to controls, while statistical significance was observed in Low-Grade (LG-SIL) cytological diagnoses. No statistically significant difference was observed in histology-proven cervical lesions.Women receiving immunosuppression therapy following transplant do not seem to require intensive follow-up, and should not be considered a high-risk subgroup, as they do not show a statistically significant higher incidence of HPV infections or high-grade cervical dysplasia compared to healthy immunocompetent matching controls.
