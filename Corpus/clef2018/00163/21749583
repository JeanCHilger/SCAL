Risk factors for high-risk human papillomavirus infection in unscreened Malian women. To investigate the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Malian women, for whom cervical cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality.Pilot study of 202 women aged 15-65 to determine the prevalence rate of high-risk HPV infection among unscreened Malian women. Information on risk factors was collected through a standardized, structured interview and clinical examination. High-risk (HR) HPV DNA was detected using signal amplification methods (hybrid capture II).High-risk HPV DNA was detected in 12% of unscreened women, while visual inspection after application of acetic acid and Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) identified suspicious abnormalities in 2.5% of unscreened women. Histopathological evaluation of VIA/VILI-positive biopsies revealed no evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer. The majority of infections occurred among women in the 15-24 year old range. Compared to women who were married or widowed, single women were 3.5 times more likely to be infected with HR HPV.The prevalence of infection with cancer causing types of HPV in this study was 12%. These prevalence estimates are consistent with what has been reported previously for other West African countries.
