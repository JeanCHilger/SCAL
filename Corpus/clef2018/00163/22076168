Co-expression of metalloproteinases 11 and 12 in cervical scrapes cells from cervical precursor lesions. The metalloproteinases (MMP) 11 and 12 have been shown to be expressed in cervical cancer (CC). In order to extend our previous results, these MMPs were evaluated in cervical precursor lesions. One hundred seventeen cervical scrapes: thirty-six normal, thirty-six low grade squamous lesions (LSIL), thirty-six high grade (HSIL), nine CC and, also ninety-nine paraffin-embedded cervical lesions: fifteen normal cervices, thirty eight LSIL, sixteen HSIL, and five CC were collected. The samples were analyzed for relative expression by real time RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry assay. We were able to identify a relative increased expression of MMP11 in 75% and 78% from LSIL and HSIL samples, respectively. While MMP12 expression was 64% and 75% in LSIL and HSIL, respectively. Positive samples for MMP11 expression were also positive for MMP12 expression and also increased according to illness progression. In the tissues, MMP11 or MMP12 expression was observed in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells, while in the normal epithelium was absent. The reaction was always stronger for MMP12 than MMP11. MMP11 expression was present in 77% and 66% of LSIL and HSIL, while MMP12 expression was 73% and 68%. There was a relationship between MMP11 or MMP12 expression and HPV infection. Our data are showing a relationship between diagnostic of precursor lesions and the MMP11 and 12 expressions, suggesting that their expression could be an early event in the neoplastic lesions of the cervix and could have clinical significance.
