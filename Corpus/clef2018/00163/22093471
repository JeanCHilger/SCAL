Burden of disease regarding paratyphoid fever A - based on the Syndromic Surveillance System on Fever. To evaluate the burden of paratyphoid fever A in Hongta district, Yuxi city, Yunnan province from May 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009 so as to provide information for the development of comprehensive intervention measures.Based on the Fever Syndromic Surveillance System, information as attendance rate of patients with fever, rate of patients being sampled, laboratory testing rate, sensitivity on the detection of blood culture and the rate of case reporting etc. were calculated. According to the pyramid model of food-borne disease on disease burden, the local actual incidence of paratyphoid fever A was estimated and analyzed.Under the Fever Syndromic Surveillance System, there were 6642 fever cases being detected, among whom 6570 cases were sampled and undergone testing, with the sampling rate as 98.92% and all the samples received laboratory testing. There were 354 positive cases of paratyphoid fever A reported, all from the Hongta district. Data showed that the attendance rate of the feverish patients was 73.53%, with the highest rate seen in whose under 10 years old (100%). Assumed that the sensitivity of paratyphoid fever blood culture was 70%, and the case reporting rate was 90%, we estimated that the annual incidence of paratyphoid fever A in Hongta was 220.33 (95%CI: 170.1 - 521.4) per 100 thousand, with 965 (95%CI: 745 - 2284) as new cases. Among all the age groups, the incidence in the age group from 15 to 44 years old was estimated to be at the highest (318.27 per 100 thousand).Hongta seemed to be an endemic region for paratyphoid fever A, with the highest incidence occurred in the age group of between 15 and 44 years old. These findings highlighted the urgent need to carry out further investigation on the risk factors and to implement targeted effective prevention and control measures.
