Comparison of usefulness of lipopolysaccharides extracted by phenol and trichloroacetic acid from Salmonella Typhimurium and Enteritidis for serodiagnosis of salmonelosis. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis are the two predominant serogroups, responsible for about 80% of all human cases of salmonelosis in Poland. Therefore we compared the usefulness of lipopolysaccharides antigens extracted by phenol (Westphal method) and trichloroacetic acid (Boivine method) from Salmonella Typhimurium and Enteritidis in ELISA method for the determination of antibodies. We used one home - made LPS antigen and two others commercially available antigens from SIGMA - Aldrich. Our study showed that the presence of antibodies was found in 35 (74.5%) sera from 47 samples from patients with suspected salmonelosis. There was no significant statistical differences of frequency of appearance of antibodies to all three Salmonella antigens in sera from patients with salmonelosis and in sera from control group. This study showed that all three antigens are useful for determination of IgA, IgG, IgM antibodies for Salmonella serogroup B and D in routine serological diagnosis of salmonelosis. However, it should be considered possibility of cross-reaction between LPS antigen of Salmonella and antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica which could be correlated with similarity between somatic antigens of these two pathogens.
