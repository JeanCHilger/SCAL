Management of cervical precancers: a global perspective. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have decreased dramatically over the past 50 years in countries with access and resources to provide frequent screening, evaluation, and treatment of high-grade cervical cancer precursors. For countries with fewer resources and many competing health concerns, cervical cancer remains one of the most lethal and common cancers among women. With the advent of newer technology, such as low-cost HPV vaccines and self-administered HPV tests, followed by simple well-known techniques such as VIA and cryotherapy, cervical cancer rates may well start to decrease worldwide.
