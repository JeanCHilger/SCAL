The APTIMA HPV assay versus the Hybrid Capture 2 test in triage of women with ASC-US or LSIL cervical cytology: a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy. Testing for DNA of 13 high-risk HPV types with the Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) test has consistently been shown to perform better in triage of women with cervical cytology results showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) but often not in triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) detected in cervical cancer screening. In a meta-analysis, we compared the accuracy of the APTIMA HPV test, which identifies RNA of 14 high-risk HPV types, to HC2 for the triage of women with ASC-US or LSIL. Literature search-targeted studies where the accuracy of APTIMA HPV and HC2 for detection of underlying CIN2/3+ was assessed concomitantly including verification of all cases of ASC-US and LSIL. HSROC (Hierarchical Summary ROC) curve regression was used to compute the pooled absolute and relative sensitivity and specificity. Eight studies, comprising 1,839 ASC-US and 1,887 LSIL cases, were retrieved. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of APTIMA to triage ASC-US to detect underlying CIN3 or worse was 96.2% (95% CI = 91.7-98.3%) and 54.9% (95% CI = 43.5-65.9%), respectively. APTIMA and HC2 showed similar pooled sensitivity however, the specificity of the former was significantly higher (ratio: 1.19
