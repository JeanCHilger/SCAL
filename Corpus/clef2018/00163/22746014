Salmonella enteritidis bacteremia with septic arthritis of the sacroiliac joint in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: case report and review of the literature. An 18-year-old female presented with a ten days history of high grade fever, chills and pain of the left sacroiliac joint. The patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is on chronic immunosuppressive therapy (steroids, antimalarial and antimetabolites). Imaging of the left sacroiliac joint revealed inflammation. Blood cultures and an aspirate of a small gluteal abscess that she developed later grew Salmonella enteritidis resistant to nalidixic acid. The patient was treated conservatively with eight weeks of IV ceftriaxone and is currently asymptomatic. First case of SLE with this complication to be reported from Lebanon and treated conservatively, this communication deserved publishing together with a literature review.
