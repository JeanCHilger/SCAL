Dry storage and transport of a cervicovaginal self-sample by use of the Evalyn Brush, providing reliable human papillomavirus detection combined with comfort for women. Primary screening using high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) detection has been suggested as a way of improving cervical cancer prevention. Women currently not attending screening (nonresponders) are more likely to participate when given the opportunity of self-sampling for hrHPV testing. The Evalyn Brush is a new cervicovaginal self-sampling device, developed specifically to meet women's demands, which is user-friendly and easy to use. The aims of this study were to investigate agreement of hrHPV detection by two PCR methods between the Evalyn Brush and physician-obtained samples and to study women's acceptance of this self-sampling device. Each of 134 women visiting the gynecology outpatient clinic collected a self-obtained sample (self-sample) and completed a questionnaire. The brush was stored dry. After self-sampling, a trained physician obtained a conventional cervical cytology specimen in ThinPrep medium. HrHPV detection was performed using the SPF(10)-DEIA-LiPA(25) and GP5+/6+-LQ-test. The overall agreement for hrHPV detection using SPF(10)-DEIA-LiPA(25) between the self-sample and the physician-taken sample was 85.8% (kappa value, 0.715 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.597 to 0.843
