Prevalence and risk factors for oncogenic human papillomavirus infections in high-risk mid-adult women. The epidemiology of high-risk (hr) human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in mid-adult women with new sex partners is undefined.We analyzed baseline data from 518 25- to 65-year-old women online daters. Women were mailed questionnaires and kits for self-collecting vaginal specimens for polymerase chain reaction-based hrHPV testing. Risk factors for infection were identified using Poisson regression models to obtain prevalence ratios (PRs).The prevalence of hrHPV infection was 35.9%. In multivariate analysis restricted to sexually active women, the likelihood of hrHPV infection was associated with abnormal Papanicolaou test history (PR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.84), lifetime number of sex partners >14 (compared with 1-4 PR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.13-4.02 for 15-24 partnersMeasures of both cumulative and recent sexual history were associated with prevalent hrHPV infection in this hr cohort of mid-adult women.
