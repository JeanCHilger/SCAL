Human papillomavirus DNA and E6/E7 mRNA testing as triage in liquid-based cytology samples from primary screening. We estimated the frequency of detection of different human papillomavirus (HPV) types in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology in a population-based primary screening programme. 247 liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples with ASCUS/LSIL results were tested using the LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test (LA Roche Diagnostics), which detects 37 HPV types. 79.4% of samples were positive by LA, and 60.7% were positive for high-risk HPV types (ASCUS: 41.2%
