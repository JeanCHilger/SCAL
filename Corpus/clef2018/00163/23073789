A modified Latent Class Model assessment of human papillomavirus-based screening tests for cervical lesions in women with atypical glandular cells: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study. In the absence of gold standard diagnoses, we estimate age-specific false-positive and false-negative prediction rates of HPV-, cytology-, and histology-based tests for significant cervical lesions (SCL) in US women with AGC-NOS Pap smear diagnoses.Modified Latent Class Model (LCM) analyses, with prevalence of SCL modeled as a function of age, were applied to GOG-0171 study data (n = 122). The accuracies of several HPV-based tests, including Hybrid Capture II high-risk HPV (HC2 H-HPV) carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX)The histology-based test was nearly perfect (sensitivity = 1.00, CI = 0.98-1.00 specificity = 0.99, CI = 0.96-1.00). Otherwise, HC2 H-HPV performed best (sensitivity = 1.00, CI = 1.00-1.00Women with negative HC2 H-HPV can safely forego invasive treatment (i.e., cone or LEEP biopsy, hysterectomy) in favor of observational follow-up. Additional biomarkers must be found for use in combination with HC2 H-HPV to reduce false-positive rates. This novel application of a modified LCM exemplifies methods for potential use in future cancer screening studies when gold standard diagnoses are not available.
