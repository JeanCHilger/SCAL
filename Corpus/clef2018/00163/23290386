Serum antibodies to human papillomavirus (HPV) pseudovirions correlate with natural infection for 13 genital HPV types. Serology for human papillomaviruses (HPV) types -16 and -18 is established as an important tool for studies of HPV vaccinology and epidemiology. However, as there are a large number of oncogenic genital types of HPV there is a need for development of high-throughput, validated HPV serological assays that can be used for more comprehensive seroepidemiological studies and for research on multivalent HPV vaccines.To develop a multiplexed pseudovirion-based serological assay (PsV-Luminex) encompassing 21 HPV types and validate the method by correlating the serology with the presence of type specific HPV DNA in cervical samples.Cervical swabs from 3,291 unvaccinated women attending organized cervical screening in Slovenia were tested with 3 different HPV DNA detection methods and presence of HPV DNA compared to presence of serum antibodies to pseudovirions from 15 genital HPV types (HPV-6,-11,-16,-18,-31,-33,-35,-39,-45,-52,-56,-58,-59,-68,-73).On average 51% of the HPV DNA positive women were seropositive for the same HPV type that was detected in the cervical specimen. We found a strong correlation with presence of HPV DNA and antibodies to the same HPV type for 13/15 genital HPV types (median OR = 5.7, CI 95% = 2.4-12.9). HPV-52 serology failed the validation and HPV-11 serology could not be validated because only a single woman was positive for HPV-11 DNA. The correlation between serology and HPV DNA status tended to be stronger among women infected with single HPV type (median OR=10.5, CI 95% = 2.4-48.4) than among women with multiple HPV infections (median OR = 4.6, CI 95% = 1.8-11.7).A multiplexed HPV PsV-Luminex assay has been developed and validated to correlate with natural HPV infection for 13 HPV types, thus enabling more comprehensive studies in HPV epidemiology and vaccine research.
