Sequence variation of human papillomavirus type 31 long control region: phylogenetic and functional implications. About one-third of human papillomavirus (HPV) types infect the anogenital tract. High-risk genital HPV types (such as HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35) are linked causally to the development of cervical cancer. The long control region (LCR) of the HPV genome regulates the replication and transcription of the viral genome. In this study, the functional significance of nucleotide sequence variation within the LCR of HPV 31 was investigated. The LCR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 41 HPV 31 positive cervical samples of Hungarian women. A phylogenetic tree constructed from the nucleotide sequences of the LCR variants revealed the presence of three intratypic variant lineages of HPV 31, in accordance with previous results. In order to explore the functional consequences of sequence variation in the LCR of HPV 31, selected LCR variants were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, transfected into C33-A cells and tested in luciferase reporter assays. Significant differences were found between the transcriptional activities of HPV 31 LCR variants belonging to different variant lineages. As the LCR is governing the transcription of the E6 and E7 oncogenes, the differences in the transcriptional activities of LCR variants may be associated with differences in their oncogenic potential.
