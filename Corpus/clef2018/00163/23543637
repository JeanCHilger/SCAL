Detection of HPV by PCR-A Novel Step in the Prevention of Cancer Cervix. (1) To compare the efficacy of Pap smear and HPV PCR for detection of CIN and (2) To study the distribution of HPV genotypes.One hundred women presenting at the female Outpatient Department with unhealthy cervices were subjected to a detailed history, clinical examination, Pap smear, HPV DNA PCR test, and colposcopic-directed biopsy (where indicated).This study has shown that there is a strong association of HPV infection with higher grades of CIN (100Â % in patients with CIN 2, CIN 3, and CIS). The detection of CIN by HPV PCR was more accurate than by Pap smear. The most prevalent HPV genotype found in our study was HPV 16.The advent of HPV testing has opened the doors for more accurate cervical cancer surveillance strategies than Pap smear. Early detection and treatment of CIN will considerably reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.
