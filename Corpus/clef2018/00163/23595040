Yield and mode of diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 or cancer among women with negative cervical cytology and positive high-risk human papillomavirus test results. In women with negative cervical cytology and positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) test results, we compared the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) or cancer (CIN 3+) in women with previous abnormal cervical cytology, CIN, or HR-HPV with that in women without this history, and we determined their cumulative risk of CIN 3+.We reviewed colposcopies for negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results from 2007 to 2009 (colposcopy was done for previous abnormal cytology, HR-HPV, or CIN or if negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results for 20-35 months). Women with negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results in 2007 were reviewed to determine their cumulative risk of CIN 3+.Of the 513 women with colposcopy for negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results, 367 had previous abnormal cytology, CIN, or HR-HPV greater than 35 months ago and 146 had negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results for 20 to 35 months. Risk of CIN 3+ for women with negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results with previous abnormal cytology, HR-HPV, or CIN who did not have previous colposcopy was 11.9% (8/67) for similar women with previous colposcopy, it was 2.7% (8/300)If referral to colposcopy of women with cervical cytology of ASC-US and positive HR-HPV test result (CIN 3+, 3.9%) is justified, referral to colposcopy of women with negative cytology and positive HR-HPV test results is justified if they have previous abnormal cervical cytology, CIN, or HR-HPV greater than 35 months ago but have not had previous colposcopy (CIN 3+=11.9%) or are persistently HR-HPV positive for 20 to 35 months (CIN 3+, 7.5%). The risk of CIN 3+ in women with previous abnormal cytology, CIN, or HR-HPV who have previous colposcopy (2.7%) is lower because these women have incident rather than prevalent CIN 3+.
