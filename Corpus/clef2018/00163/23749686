Clinical significance of atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion with histologic correlation-: a 9-year experience. Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H) is a recognized category in the 2001 Bethesda Nomenclature System for cervical cytology. Although current ASCCP guidelines recommend colposcopic follow-up, more recent studies are suggesting prior triage for HPV-DNA analysis. We report on our experience at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2011 (9-y), the cytopathology laboratory processed 109,424 Pap Tests, of which 281 (0.26%) were diagnosed as ASC-H. Tissue follow-up was available in 181 (64%) of these cases, of which 45 (25%) were negative/cervicitis, 41 (23%) were CIN 1, 36 (20%) were CIN 2 and 59 (32%) were CIN 3. Stratification by age groups showed a higher percentage of high grade (CIN 2+) lesions (65%) in the premenopausal age group as compared with high grade lesion (35%) in the postmenopausal age group, whereas negative/CIN1 biopsies were more common in postmenopausal (65%) as compared to premenopausal (44%) women. Our data support the use of colposcopy in the management of women with ASC-H on Pap Tests. However, in the older age group, prior HPV-DNA testing may be of benefit to better identify those women at risk for high grade lesions.
