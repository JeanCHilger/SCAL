A Phase I, dose-escalation trial in adults of three recombinant attenuated Salmonella Typhi vaccine vectors producing Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein antigen PspA. Live, attenuated, orally-administered Salmonella strains are excellent vectors for vaccine antigens and are attractive as vaccines based on previous use of S. Typhimurium in animals. A Phase I dose escalation trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three newly constructed recombinant attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi vaccine (RASV) vectors synthesizing Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A (PspA).The 3 S. Typhi strains used as vectors to deliver PspA were S. Typhi ISP1820 S. Typhi Ty2 RpoS(-)In the highest dose group, no subject experienced severe reactions or serious adverse events. Most adverse events were mild one subject had a positive blood culture. No subject shed vaccine in stool. No statistically significant differences for post vaccination ELISA or ELISPOT results between Groups were detected. However, a limited number of â‰¥ 4 fold increases from baseline for IgA anti-OMPs, IgA and IgG anti-LPS, and IgA anti-PspA occurred for a few individuals as measured by ELISA, and IgA anti-OMPs as measured by ELISPOT assay.All three S. Typhi vectored pneumococcal vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. Immunogenicity was limited possibly due to pre-existing high antibody titers prior to vaccination. Increases in IgA were most often observed.
