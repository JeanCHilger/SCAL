HPV in urology. Basic principles and controversies. The information presented in this article summarizes some of the basic knowledge on human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and the consequences particularly in men. According to current understanding most HPV infections are latent and transient in immunocompetent patients but some will persist. Predominantly due to the different oncogenic potential of various HPV types, persisting infections can give rise to benign or malignant neoplasms in both genders. Current controversies, such as the need for HPV testing in men or routine male HPV vaccination will be discussed. High-risk male populations, e.g. men who have sex with men (MSM) and HIV positive men, merit special attention from urologists in the future. The groups of HIV positive MSMs are at an extremely high risk of developing anal cancer that currently even exceeds the highest reported incidence of cervical cancer.
