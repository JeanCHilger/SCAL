Cervical cancer screening: women's knowledge and participation. The purpose of this study was to assess women's knowledge of cervical cancer screening, to examine the relationship between knowledge and screening participation, and to gain a better insight into GP involvement in screening.A telephone survey was conducted on a random sample of women aged 25-65 years living in Val-d'Oise, France.117 women responded to the survey. The results show that women were often not aware of screening modalities, although participation was high in 87.9 % of cases. Knowing that cervical smears (CS) can be performed in a medical laboratory and that HPV-vaccinated women should undergo screening were significantly associated with high participation. Women who had consulted a gynaecologist in the last 12 months were also significantly more likely to participate in screening. According to 64.1% of the respondents, the question of screening had never been discussed in GP consultations. Only 6.8% of the women had had a cervical smear performed by a GP, although most of the women (59.8%) felt that GPs should be more involved in cervical smear testing.Increased knowledge of cervical cancer screening among women may help to increase participation in screening. The study suggests that GPs should be more involved in cervical cancer screening and that their role in providing prevention information to female patients should be promoted.
