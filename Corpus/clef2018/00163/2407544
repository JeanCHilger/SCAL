Serological response of chickens to Salmonella enteritidis infection. Fifty-eight sera, from 29 chickens originating from two layer flocks known to be naturally infected with Salmonella enteritidis phage type (PT) 4, were examined for antibodies to S. enteritidis. Using the techniques of immunoblotting and ELISA, antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of S. enteritidis were detected in 43 of 58 sera. Antibodies were of the IgG class and bound to the S. enteritidis LPS antigen O = 12. Bacterial agglutination reactions using whole-cell preparations of S. enteritidis and S. pullorum, correlated with anti-LPS antibody reactions as detected by immunoblotting and ELISA. A rapid means of screening chicken sera for antibodies to the LPS of S. enteritidis as an indicator of infection is discussed.
