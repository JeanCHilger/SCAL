High-risk human papilloma virus management in pregnancy with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during pregnancy and postpartum in China. To investigate the relationship between cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) during pregnancy and postpartum in China.In this prospective case-control study, 168 pregnant women with CIN and cervicitis were diagnosed by colposcopic cervical biopsy. All the cases underwent hybrid capture assay version II (HCII) to detect HR-HPV DNA load amounts and the tests were completed in 3-6 months after childbirth.During pregnancy: as the CIN grade increased, the HR-HPV infection rates increased (P = 0.002), but HR-HPV DNA load amounts (in logarithms) did not change obviously (P = 0.719). 3-6 months postpartum: as the CIN grade increased, the natural negative rate of HR-HPV decreased (P = 0.000), while the amount of HR-HPV DNA (in logarithms) increased (P = 0.036) especially the amount of HR-HPV DNA in pregnant women with CINIII was significantly higher than that of other grades. During pregnancy and 3-6 months postpartum : the amount of HR-HPV DNA (in logarithms) during pregnancy was higher than that of 3-6 months postpartum with the same grade of CIN.The findings emphasize the importance of undergoing the HCII test 3-6 months postpartum. It should be noted that HR-HPV may turn negative in pregnancy with CINIII 3-6 months after childbirth. Further treatments of pregnancy with CIN should be considered according to the CIN grade diagnosed by cervical biopsy via colposcopy 3-6 months after birth, but not according to the persistence of HR-HPV during pregnancy.
