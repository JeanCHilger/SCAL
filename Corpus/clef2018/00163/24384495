Topical 5-fluorouracil for treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2: a randomized controlled trial. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravaginal application of 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 in women.Women aged 18-29 years with CIN 2 were recruited for this randomized controlled trial of observation vs treatment with intravaginal 5-FU. Women in the observation group returned in 6 months for a Papanicolaou smear, colposcopy, and a human papillomavirus (HPV) deoxyribonucleic acid test. Women in the 5-FU group were treated with intravaginal 5-FU once every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks and were similarly evaluated at 6 months. All women who had a baseline visit were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Values of P < .05 were considered statistically significant.Between August 2010 and June 2013, 60 women were randomized and had a baseline visit for intervention (n = 31) vs observation (n = 29). Of women who had cervical biopsy results at 6 months, regression of disease was demonstrated in 93% of women in the 5-FU group (26 of 28) and 56% of women in the observation group (15 of 27). Under the intention-to-treat analysis, a relative risk for cervical disease regression of 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.56) was found between the 5-FU and observation arms (P = .01). When the cervical biopsy, Papanicolaou smear, and HPV results were combined for the 6 month follow-up visit, 50% of the 5-FU group (14 of 28) had a documented normal biopsy, normal Papanicolaou smear, and negative HPV test compared with 22% in the observation group (6 of 27) (relative risk, 2.25 95% confidence interval, 1.05-5.09Topical 5-FU appears to be an effective medical therapy for CIN 2 in young women. 5-FU is readily available and may be considered as an off-label treatment option for young women with CIN 2 who are interested in the treatment of disease but want to avoid excisional procedures.
