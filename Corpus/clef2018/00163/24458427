Risk factors for treatment failure of CO2 laser vaporization in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2. The aim of our study was to evaluate the risk factors for treatment failure of CO2 laser vaporization in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2).Medical records of patients who received either shallow or deep CO2 laser vaporization with biopsy-proven CIN2 during March 2007 to April 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. After laser vaporization, liquid-based cytology and human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing were checked in every follow-up visit. Treatment failure was defined when the follow-up biopsy was more than CIN2, needing secondary surgical treatment.During that period, 141 patients with CIN2 underwent CO2 laser vaporization. After laser ablation, 14 of 141 women needed the secondary treatment, a success rate of laser vaporization of 90.1 %. In multivariate analysis, the previous loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) history (adjusted OR = 13.649 P value = 0.025) and the ablation depth (adjusted OR = 11.279Both ablation depth and previous LEEP history were the important factors increasing the risk for the treatment failure of CO2 laser vaporization in CIN2.
