Quantitative determination of the soluble O antigen of Salmonella serogroup B and of specific antibodies in different classes by using immunoenzyme analysis. The results of measurements of S. typhimurium O-antigen and specific IgA-, IgG- and IgM-antibodies in 115 serum samples from patients with salmonellosis induced by group B salmonellae are analyzed. As determined in this study, the concentrations of IgA-antibodies ranged 0-15 micrograms/ml, the minimal diagnostically significant value being 3.6 micrograms/ml the concentrations of IgG-antibodies ranged 0-13 micrograms/ml, the minimal diagnostically significant value being 1.3 micrograms/ml
