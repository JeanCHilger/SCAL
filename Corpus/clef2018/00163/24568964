Comparison of the Anyplex II HPV28 assay with the Hybrid Capture 2 assay for the detection of HPV infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is an important part of cervical cancer screening and management of women with abnormal cytology results. The Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) has been recommended for use as a reference test.To evaluate a new real-time PCR assay (Anyplex II HPV28) for detecting high risk (HR) HPV and to compare it to the HC2. In addition, we compared the genotyping results of the Anyplex II HPV28 to those of sequencing analysis.A total of 1114 cervical swab specimens were consecutively obtained from a single healthcare center. We submitted all specimens for HPV detection with Anyplex II HPV28 and HC2, then analyzed the discordant results using multiplex PCR followed by direct sequencing.HC2 detected 72 (6.5%) cases with HR HPV, while Anyplex II HPV28 identified 138 (12.4%) cases. The overall agreement rate was 91.4% (1018/1114) of cases. Discordant results between these two assays were observed in 96 cases 15 were positive only by HC2, and 81 were positive only by Anyplex II HPV28. Sequencing analyses performed in 80 cases of discordant results revealed 11 false-positive, and 67 false-negative results using HC2 tests and two false-positive results using Anyplex II HPV28.The Anyplex II HPV28 assay is analytically more sensitive in the detection of the 13 HR types represented by the HC2 assay and exhibited a higher concordance with comprehensive genotyping based on the sequencing analysis, and it could be used as a laboratory testing method for identifying HPV genotypes.
