Pancreatic hyperenzymemia is associated with bacterial culture positivity, more severe and right-sided colitis. Several studies reported pancreatic hyperenzymemia (PHE) related to acute colitis. However, there is no consensus on its clinical significance. This study was addressed to find the clinical significance of PHE in acute colitis.Pancreatic hyperenzymemia was defined as abnormal increase in serum concentrations of the pancreatic enzymes by three times of normal upper range without definite pancreatic symptoms and evidence of pancreatitis at abdominal CT imaging of pancreatic disease. And clinical and laboratory and biologic parameters of PHE group and normal pancreatic enzymemia (NPE) group were compared.A total of 1,069 patients admitted to hospitals due to acute colitis were analyzed. Of these patients, 2.99 % (32/1,069) showed PHE. PHE group showed more severe symptoms and had longer hospital stays than the NPE group (12.15 vs. 4.59 days P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that right-sided colitis (OR 2.846Pancreatic hyperenzymemia is associated with right-sided colitis, bacterial culture positivity, and severe acute colitis.
