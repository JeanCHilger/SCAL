Detection of typhoid fever by Widal and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests. A comparative study. Widal test is a conventional method for the detection of typhoid fever. However, it takes 18-24 hours to complete the test. In the present study indirect fluorescent antibody test has been compared with the Widal test using single serum specimens and was found to be rapid, sensitive and specific. Serum specimens from 41 culture proven cases of typhoid fever, 14 clinically suspected cases and 22 normal individuals were collected. Whereas Widal test detected 63.41% positive cases, IFA test detected 87.80% from among culturally proven typhoid cases. Among the clinically suspected cases of typhoid fever, IFA test detected 85.71% (28.57 + 57.14%) while Widal test detected only 57.13% (35.71 + 21.42%) positive cases out of above 14 cases.
