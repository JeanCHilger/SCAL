The complex serologic diagnosis of typhoid fever. A parallel serological study of the blood sera of typhoid patients has been made by the methods of countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and the indirect hemagglutination test with a view to establish the presence of soluble typhoid antigens and their corresponding antibodies. As shown in this study, the occurrence of Salmonella typhi O- and Vi-antigens is essentially higher than the content of specific antibodies in diagnostically significant titers.
