Human papillomavirus: prevalence and factors associated in women prisoners population from the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the associated factors among female prisoners in Ananindeua City, State of Pará, Brazil. In 2010, 190 cervical samples were obtained, and Pap smear and polymerase chain reaction (GE Health Care™, Uppsala, Sweden) were performed. Additionally, a questionnaire was used. The prevalence of HPV was 10.5%, and the presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (n = 33, 17.5% P < 0.1) was associated with HPV infection. The presence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was greater in women with HPV than in those without HPV infection, indicating that HPV infection is a risk factor for such injuries and that viral screening and prevention are extremely important in public health among female prisoners in Amazon.
