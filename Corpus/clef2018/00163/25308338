FHACT: the FISH-based HPV-associated cancer test that detects nonrandom gain at four genomic loci as biomarkers of disease progression. Despite implementation of screening programs for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers, in particular cervical, scientific studies continue to uncover viral and host biomarkers that could serve to further optimize the detection of individuals with underlying or at risk for developing precancer or cancer. Nonrandom host somatic chromosomal alterations are frequently shared across HPV-associated cancers, but with varying frequencies, potentially with functional roles. At least for 3q26 gain, there is firm preliminary evidence to support that this genomic alteration can serve as a biomarker of disease progression of cervical cancer. In the current review, the FISH-based HPV-associated cancer test is described that enables detection of genomic imbalance at four loci (3q26, 5p15, 20q13, centromere 7) in a single hybridization on a cell-by-cell basis in cytology specimens. When implemented as a secondary screening assay, the FISH-based HPV-associated cancer test could assist in the detection of clinically relevant HPV-associated disease and help guide patient management decisions.
