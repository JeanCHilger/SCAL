An immunosuppressed man with an aortic rupture secondary to Salmonella aortitis successfully treated with endovascular aortic repair. A 75-year-old immunosuppressed man presented with fever and central abdominal pain 3 weeks after having positive blood cultures for Salmonella enteritidis. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a contained perforation of a nonaneurysmal abdominal aorta. Salmonella aortitis was suspected, and given his recent history of coronary artery stent insertion, endovascular aortic repair was performed, with lifelong antibiotic therapy. At 6 months, there were no remaining clinical or radiological concerns for aortitis or aneurysmal development. This case highlights the high index of suspicion required for aortitis in immunosuppressed patients and verifies endovascular aortic repair, an appropriate alternative in patients with severe comorbidities.
