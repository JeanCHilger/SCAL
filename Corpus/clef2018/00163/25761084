Peritonitis as presentation of aorto-caval fistula with Salmonella choleraesuis-associated abdominal aortic aneurysm. The majority of aorto-caval fistulae occur spontaneously, either as a result of rupture of an existing atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm into the vena cava or secondary to iatrogenic injuries during peripheral angiography or surgery. Aorto-caval fistula from an infected aortic aneurysm is a rare scenario, but potentially lethal.Case report and review of the literature.A 63-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis was admitted for intractable abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. A computed tomography scan demonstrated an abdominal aortic aneurysm and ill-defined peri-aortic fluid with air density and evidence of a fistula between the aorta and the inferior vena cava. Salmonella cholerasuis had been isolated from a blood culture at a previous admission. Urgent endovascular exclusion of the aorto-caval fistula was carried out, and the infra-renal abdominal aneurysm was repaired using a Cook Zenith TX2 aortic stent graft. She received parenteral ceftriaxone for four weeks.This case shows acceptable short-term results after endovascular repair of a Salmonella-infected aorto-caval fistula.
