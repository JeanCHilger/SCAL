IL-10 gene promoter and intron polymorphisms as genetic biomarkers of cervical cancer susceptibility among Tunisians. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in the promoter and intron regions of the interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene with the risk of cervical cancer (CC) in Tunisian patients and control women.Study subjects comprised 86 CC cases and 126 control women. Genotyping of IL-10 intron (rs3024491, rs3024490) and promoter (rs1800872, rs1800871, rs1800896) variants was done by real-time PCR, with defined clusters.The minor allele frequencies of the five tested IL-10 SNPs were not significantly different between cervical cancer cases and control women. However, significantly higher frequencies of homozygous minor allele-carriers in cases was seen for rs3024490 (P=0.023), rs1800872 (P=0.037), and rs1800871 (P=0.028). IL-10 serum levels were significantly reduced in rs3024490 T/T vs. G/G genotype carriers, and in rs1800871 T/T than C/C genotype carriers. While carriage of rs1800872 and rs3024491 minor allele was associated with reduced IL-10 secretion, this was not statistically significant. Haploview analysis demonstrated high linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the IL10 SNPs studied, and only seven haplotypes were common, capturing 98.8% of the total possible haplotypes. Reduced frequency of haplotypes GTCCA (P<0.001) and TGATG (P<0.001) was seen in cervical cancer cases than in control women, thus conferring disease protection nature to these haplotype. This association remained significant for GTCCA (Pc=0.006) and TGATG (P=0.045) after correcting for multiple comparisons.Specific IL-10 variants (rs3024490, rs1800872, and rs1800871) and haplotype (GTCCA and TGATG) may contribute to the development of cervical cancer among Tunisian women.
