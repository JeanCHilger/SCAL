Comparison of the performance of Anyplex II HPV HR, the Cobas 4800 human papillomavirus test and Hybrid Capture 2. Anyplex II HPV HR (Anyplex_HR Seegene, Seoul, Korea) is a new multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for screening cervical cancer, and it is designed to detect 14 high-risk human papillomaviruses along with all the genotype information in a single tube. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Anyplex_HR in comparison to that of the Cobas 4800 HPV (Cobas_4800The performance of the Anyplex_HR for high-risk human papillomavirus genotype detection was prospectively evaluated against that of the HC2 and the Cobas_4800 at the National Cancer Center using 400 cervical samples. All discrepant samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with type-specific primers followed by sequencing.The overall agreement and kappa value of the Anyplex_HR with the Cobas_4800 were 98.0% and 0.96, respectively. The level of agreement between the two assays and the corresponding kappa values for human papillomavirus16, human papillomavirus18 and other high-risk human papillomaviruses were 99.5%, 99.8% and 98.8%, and 0.98, 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. The agreement and kappa value of the HC2 with the Cobas_4800 were 95.3% and 0.91. The human papillomavirus positivity of the Anyplex_HR and the Cobas_4800 in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion samples demonstrated 100% concordance. Both the Anyplex_HR and the Cobas_4800 showed excellent results in the precision test.The Anyplex_HR is comparable with the Cobas_4800 and the HC2 for human papillomavirus DNA testing, and it may prove more useful for follow-up testing and patient management by providing genotyping information additional to human papillomavirus16 and human papillomavirus18.
