Beral's 1974 paper: A step towards universal prevention of cervical cancer. In 1974, Valerie Beral published a landmark paper on the sexually transmitted origin of cervical cancer (CC) using statistics routinely available in the United Kingdom (UK). Among women born between 1902 and 1947, CC mortality rates correlated remarkably well with the incidence rates of gonorrhoea when they were 20 years old and both were highest among women born after 1940. Hence, if CC prevention and treatment had remained unchanged, the youngest generations of women would have experienced a high risk of CC death as they grew older. Fortunately, progress in CC prevention has helped avoid this scenario. The adverse consequences of the "sexual revolution" were greatly mitigated in the UK and other high-resource countries by the implementation of high quality cytology-based CC screening. An age-period-cohort analysis suggests that >30,000 cases or approximately 35% of expected CC cases may have been prevented by screening programmes in the UK between 1983 and 2007 and this percentage has been steadily increasing. In addition, the discovery of the causal role of HPV is reshaping primary and secondary prevention of CC. Cheaper HPV tests are becoming available and HPV-based primary screening may at last facilitate CC screening in low-resource countries. In the long-term, however, HPV vaccination, which has already been adopted by many countries, represents the best hope for preventing CC and overcoming socio-economic differences in CC risk within and across countries. The additional elucidation of HPV cofactors to which Beral has greatly contributed may also help control HPV infection in unvaccinated women.
