Diagnostic usefulness of Vi-indirect fluorescent antibody test(Vi-IFAT) for typhoid fever--a prospective study. Although the confirmative diagnosis of typhoid fever is by culture of the causative organism, usually from blood, a serological test is still necessary to provide a more rapid method of diagnosis. The indirect fluorescent antibody test, using a Salmonella typhi Vi antigen and a FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human polyvalent immunoglobulin, was evaluated for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Serum specimens were collected from patients with febrile diseases on admission. Of the 32 patients with titers of 1:64 or more, 22 were confirmed to have typhoid fever by blood culture and 7 had fever of undetermined origin that was considered to be typhoid fever clinically. Three patients were diagnosed to have salmonellosis other than typhoid fever. Of the 121 patients with titers of 1:32 or less, 105 patients had non-typhoidal febrile disease, 15 patients had fever of undetermined origin, and one patient was confirmed to have typhoid fever by blood culture. When a Vi antibody titer of 1:64 or more was taken as serological evidence for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.7% and 97.2%, respectively. The incidence of positive test results following fever onset was 70.0% within 1 week of fever onset, 88.9% from 1 to 2 weeks, and 100% after 2 weeks. In conclusion, the Vi-indirect fluorescent antibody test(Vi-IFAT) can be employed as a useful serologic test in the diagnosis of typhoid fever.
