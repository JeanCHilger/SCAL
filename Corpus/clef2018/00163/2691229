Salmonella typhimurium outbreak at Kenyatta National Hospital (1985). A total of 560 Salmonellae species were isolated from Jan-Dec 1985. Of these, 347 (62%) were from blood cultures, 180 (32%) from stools and 33 (6%) were from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other body aspirates. S. typhimurium were the highest isolated. These were, 291 (52%) from blood cultures, 94 (17%) from stool cultures and 32 (6%) from CSF. S. typhimurium was also multi-drug resistant. More than 50% strains of S. typhimurium were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin and chloramphenicol. The need for coordination between the laboratory and clinical staff to prevent the spill-over of infection with S. typhimurium and its epidemic spread is discussed.
