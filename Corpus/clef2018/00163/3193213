Gallium detection of Salmonella costochondritis. A case of Salmonella costochondritis developed at a traumatic focus in a 37-yr-old Hispanic male without hemoglobinopathy or systemic disease. Bone scans and gallium scans were initially positive and remained abnormal, despite a variable clinical course and repeatedly negative serology and blood cultures. Scintigraphy was valuable for both detection and monitoring of antibiotic treatment, as well as providing localization for subsequent surgical resection.
