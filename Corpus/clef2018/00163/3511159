Typhoid fever: successful therapy with cefoperazone. We compared cefoperazone with chloramphenicol in a randomized trial involving the treatment of 25 children with severe typhoid fever. The clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were comparable on entry into the study. Four patients died (three receiving chloramphenicol, one cefoperazone), and an additional two patients received dexamethasone (one per group). Excluding these six patients, the response of the cefoperazone group was comparable or superior to that of the chloramphenicol group in terms of the number of days from initiation of therapy to becoming afebrile (P less than .055) and the number of days until negative blood cultures were obtained (P less than .19). There were no relapses or treatment failures in either group. We conclude that cefoperazone is as effective as chloramphenicol in the treatment of severe typhoid fever.
