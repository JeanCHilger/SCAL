Typhoid: clinical picture and response to chloramphenicol. Prospective study in Bombay (1972). The clinical picture of 78 cases with proven typhoid and 18 cases with proven paratyphoid A fever is presented. The diagnosis was made by isolating the organisms from the blood. The Widal test could not be used as a diagnostic criterion. By means of chemotherapy with chloramphenicol (initial dose 30-40 mg/kg body weight) defervescence was achieved within an average of 4.5 days. The course of the disease was generally mild one patient with typhoid fever died. The average hospital stay was 19 days. Four patients of the typhoid fever group were readmitted with a relapse. The laboratory examinations included blood clot culture, phage typing, Widal test, haemoglobin, leucocyte count, transaminases, serum bilirubin, and routine examination and culture of stool and urine. Forty-two patients were infected with intestinal parasites and 25 with Shigella organism. The findings are discussed and compared with findings of similar studies of enteric fever.
