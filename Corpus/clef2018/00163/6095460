Comparative study of three blood culture systems for isolation of enteric fever Salmonella. Eight hundred blood cultures were tested in parallel in three conventional systems: tryptic soy broth containing 0.05% sodium polyanethosulfonate (TSB-SPS), whole blood in bile (BILE-BLOOD), and blood clots in bile (BILE-CLOT). Sixty-eight cultures were Salmonella typhi positive and 29 were positive for S. paratyphi A in at least one of the systems. Analysis of the isolation rates of the 97 Salmonella-positive specimens showed that BILE-BLOOD was significantly more sensitive (p less than 0.05) than either TSB-SPS or BILE-CLOTS, and that the latter two were not significantly different. The time required for positive results was shortest in BLOOD-BILE which was significantly quicker than BILE-CLOTs (p less than 0.05), but not TSB-SPS (p greater than 0.05). Possible explanations for the observed, superior performance of the BILE-BLOOD system are discussed and recommendations for efficient recovery of enteric fever salmonellae from blood are presented.
