Arthritis associated with salmonella infection. Six cases of arthritis caused by or associated with Salmonella infection are reported. It is stated that an arthritis associated with a Salmonella infection cannot be excluded on the negative results of the Widal test. Consequent upon Salmonella infection two different types of arthritis might develop: a) monoarticular infectious arthritis or b) a subacute reactive oligo-articular arthritis. In this study a patient with a chronic destructive "reactive" oligoarthritis is described, resembling experimental "Salmonella-associated arthritis" in rats. This form of arthritis might be regarded as an immune complex mediated disease associated with a chronic infection.
