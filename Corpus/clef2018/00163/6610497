A simple kit system for rapid diagnosis of cerebrospinal meningitis in rural areas of developing countries. A simple, easily operated, portable diagnostic kit, employing coagglutination reagents, has been developed for the rapid, bedside diagnosis of cerebrospinal meningitis. Field trials using this kit were conducted in a rural area of sub-Saharan Africa for identifying the etiological agents of meningitis outbreaks. West African village medical attendants were taught to use this kit and succeeded in making rapid specific diagnoses of meningitis cases. Other acute infections such as cholera and typhoid fever can also be rapidly diagnosed in a similar manner. This rapid diagnostic system offers appropriate technology in support of primary health care delivery in the rural areas of developing countries.
