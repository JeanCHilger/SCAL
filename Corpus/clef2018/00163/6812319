CO2-dependent mutant of Salmonella typhi causing typhoid fever in two patients. A CO2-dependent mutant of Salmonella typhi was isolated from anaerobic but not from aerobic blood-cultures of two patients with typhoid fever. Both patients diseased after return from their home country Turkey. The strains developed in a CO2-enriched atmosphere and under anaerobic but not aerobic culture conditions. This property remained stable during 20 subcultures. The fermentative and serological pattern was identical with S. typhi T2. Both strains were of lysovar E1a.
