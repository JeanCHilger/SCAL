Crossreactivity as a factor in the immune response to Salmonella typhimurium in CBA and BALB/C mice. The immune response to Salmonella typhimurium was investigated in CBA and BALB/C mice, by an arithmetic Widal agglutination assay. High antibody titres were obtained in CBA and low titres in BALB/C mice after secondary immunisation. A rabbit antiserum raised against S. typhimurium was tested for agglutinating activity after absorption with spleen- and lymph-node cells obtained from unimmunised CBA or BALB/C mice. BALB/C cells consistently removed more anti-S. typhimurium antibodies than did CBA cells, whilst the quantities of Fc receptor-bearing cells were found to be similar in both strains when measured by the erythrocyte-antibody rosette technique. It is suggested BALB/C mice give a low antibody response because their cell-surface antigens crossreact to a greater degree with S. typhimurium than do CBA cell-surface antigens.
