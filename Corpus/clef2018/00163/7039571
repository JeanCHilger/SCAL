Metastatic endophthalmitis due to Salmonella typhimurium. A 48-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had endophthalmitis as the first sign of generalized sepsis due to Salmonella typhimurium. The organism grew from the anterior chamber aspirate as well as from the blood cultures. The eye required enucleation, and pathologically identifiable organisms were present in the vitreous cavity. To our knowledge, a case of metastatic endophthalmitis due to S typhimurium has not been previously reported. Salmonella is an opportunistic organism and should be considered in cases of endophthalmitis occurring in an immunocompromised host.
