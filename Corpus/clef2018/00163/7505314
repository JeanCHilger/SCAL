Induction of nitric oxide synthase in rat C6 glioma cells. We have examined the induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the rat astrocyte-derived C6 glioma cell line. In contrast to the previous results with primary astrocyte cultures, incubation of C6 cells with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS 1 microgram/ml for 24 h) did not stimulate NO2 production. However, addition of either tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), cytokines that by themselves had no effect on NOS activity, imparted LPS responsiveness onto these cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 values of 39 ng/ml of TNF-alpha and 9.4 U/ml of IFN-gamma), and the effect of TNF-alpha could be further potentiated (twofold) by the presence of interleukin-1 beta. The simultaneous presence of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma yielded a greater response than either cytokine alone
