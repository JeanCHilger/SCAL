Condyloma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of the endometrium. Many studies have shown the presence of squamous metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium, whether they arose de novo or from direct extension from the cervix. Condyloma associated with squamous metaplasia or dysplasia of the endometrium is rare. We report a case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I) and condyloma of the endometrium. A 58-year-old woman presented with high-grade dysplasia on two successive pap smears. A total vaginal hysterectomy showed extensive CIN I and condyloma involving the entire endometrium. DNA in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction documented the presence of condyloma.
