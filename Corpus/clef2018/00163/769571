Febrile illnesses resulting in hospital admission: a bacteriological and serological study in Jakarta, Indonesia. A study of 741 Indonesian patients with fever was carried out in order to determine what serious febrile illnesses are prevalent in Jakarta. All patients were hospitalized primarily because of fever and were studied by bacteriological and serological methods. Bacteremia due to Salmonella typhi (150 cases), S. enteritidis (36 cases), or both (2 cases) was common in both children and adults. One S. enteritidis isolate was chloramphenicol resistant. Serological evidence of Salmonella infection was found in 130 additional cases without bacteremia. Serological evidence of arbovirus infection (94 cases) was common in children. Malaria was found in 12 adults, most of whom were probably infected outside Jakarta. Little serological evidence was found for rickettsial, leptospiral, Brucella, Toxoplasma gondii or a number of other infections. Clinical signs and symptoms in the febrile patients studed were generally nonspecific, and laboratory results reported were very helpful in establishing more accurate diagnoses.
