Randomized comparison of aztreonam and chloramphenicol in treatment of typhoid fever. Patients with clinical typhoid fever plus a blood, bone marrow, or bile positive for Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi were included in an open clinical trial to compare the efficacy of aztreonam (6 g/day [2 g intravenously every 8 h]) given for 10 days with that of chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg of body weight per day [intravenously or orally]) administered for 14 days. A total of 44 patients, 22 in each group, were included in the study, and both groups were comparable in terms of baseline parameters. All patients randomized to receive chloramphenicol completed the 14 days of treatment, while two patients randomized to receive aztreonam developed an intestinal hemorrhage, and a third patient elected to withdraw from the trial. Defervescence occurred more quickly in the subjects receiving chloramphenicol than in those receiving aztreonam (P < 0.05). All patients in the chloramphenicol group were clinically cured during therapy, while four patients (21%) in the group receiving aztreonam were declared clinical treatment failures. None of the 19 patients receiving aztreonam, compared with 7 of 22 (32%) patients receiving chloramphenicol, had a positive blood culture after 24 h of therapy (P < 0.05). Adverse experiences were unusual and mild. In the study, aztreonam was less effective than chloramphenicol with regard to clinical effectiveness and time of defervescence but was more effective in the elimination of the infecting Salmonella organisms from the bloodstream.
