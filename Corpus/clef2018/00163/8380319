Definition of human papillomavirus type 16 DNA levels in low and high grade cervical lesions by a simple polymerase chain reaction technique. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is associated with a high proportion of cervical cancers and pre-cancers but has also been reported by some workers to be widely distributed in the normal population. Using a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) operated with carefully regulated sensitivity we have established two distinct levels of HPV 16 DNA which distinguish between high and low grade cervical lesions. The potential use of such an approach in the understanding and management of HPV related cervical disease is discussed.
