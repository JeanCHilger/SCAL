A binary (Bethesda) system for classifying cervical cancer precursors: criteria, reproducibility, and viral correlates. This study of cervical squamous precursors addressed the consistency with which pathologists could agree on diagnosis using a Bethesda system and the degree to which the classification system discriminated "high-risk" human papillomavirus (HPV) types. Four pathologists independently assessed biopsies of 75 squamous lesions all contained HPV DNA amplified from archival fixed tissue with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and typed by restriction digestion of the PCR product. Lesions were categorized as low or high grade using published criteria. In independently performed histologic evaluations a majority (three or more) of observers agreed on the classification of 63 of the 75 cases (84%) with good to very good interobserver (kappa values, 0.43 to 0.63), and fair to excellent intraobserver (kappa values, 0.32 to 0.83) agreement. A majority of the observers classified as high grade 15 of 17 (88%) HPV 16-positive lesions (P < .002), but only 15 of 21 (71%) lesions associated with other high-risk HPV types 18, 31, 35, and 39 (P = .089). Concurrence among observers also varied with HPV type
