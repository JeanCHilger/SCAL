A new method, based on in situ DNA hybridization, for the detection of papillomavirus in condyloma patients and their partners. The detection and typing analysis of human papillomavirus (HPV) were carried out by means of BIOHIT in situ HPV DNA hybridization screening and typing kits in condyloma tissues of patients with genital condyloma acuminatum, in cytological smears of their asymptomatic female consorts, and in female patients with vulval condyloma acuminatum. "Low"-risk HPV 6 and HPV 11 were demonstrated most frequently in the condyloma tissues of the male patients. It is noteworthy that all but one female consorts carried similar HPV type(s) in their cervical smears to those of their sexual partners in condyloma tissues. "Medium" and "high"-risk HPV 18, 31 and 33 types (frequently associated with high-grade dysplastic lesions and carcinomas) were demonstrated more frequently in female condylomas than in male. These three HPV types were identified in both tissues in a female patient with condyloma acuminatum and carcinoma epidermoids cornescens.
