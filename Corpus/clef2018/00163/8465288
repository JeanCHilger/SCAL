Non-typhoid Salmonella aortitis. Non-typhoid Salmonella enteritis may be complicated by aortitis. Three cases of Salmonella enteritidis aortitis are described. One patient, who survived, was operated with resection of the infected part of the aorta. An axillo-femoral bypass was made. The patient was treated for 18 months with antibiotics. The two patients who died were only treated with antibiotics. Aortitis is diagnosed by means of blood-cultures and topographic examination of the aorta with CT-scanning, ultrasonography or angiography. The treatment of Salmonella aortitis is a combination of surgery and long-term administration of antibiotics.
