Laparoscopic removal of a dermoid cyst in pregnancy. A case report. Laparoscopy in pregnancy can endanger the fetus. It is now being reexamined because of our experience with complex operative procedures and new laparoscopic equipment.A decision was made to perform laparoscopy instead of laparotomy for a pelvic mass in a pregnant woman. The patient was admitted to the emergency room with a temperature of 38.9 degrees C and was 15 4/7 weeks pregnant. Over several hours she developed septic shock, with the blood pressure and white blood cell count dropping. Bedside ultrasound revealed a complex mass suspicious for an abscess. A dermoid cyst was found and removed by pelviscopic techniques. Blood cultures revealed typhoid fever, and the patient responded to antibiotics. She was discharged on the 10th postoperative day.This case demonstrates the value of laparoscopy in pregnancy not only for diagnosis but also for treatment. Laparoscopy in pregnancy should be added to the armamentarium of the gynecologist.
