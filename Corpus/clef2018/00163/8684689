Quantitative evaluation of endocervical cells in women with human papillomavirus infection. Human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in cells of endocervical origin has been demonstrated by in situ hybridization and Polimerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Similarly, the presence of HPV DNA has been shown in many cases of endocervical Adenocarcinoma. Morphological changes in squamous cells, specific for HPV infection, have already been described in previous reports, but similar specific alterations in the endocervical elements have not yet been reported. In this retrospective study we analyzed 30 endocervical smears from women with HPV infection, ascertained colposcopically, cytologically and/or histologically. Thirty endocervical samples have been taken from healthy women of the same age and hormonal status, as a control group. We evaluated maximum and minimum nuclear diameters, anisocariosis, chromatin pattern and cytoplasmic characteristics of at least 60 endocervical cells selected from each specimen.In the cases with HPV infection, the mean nuclear diameter of endocervical cells was increased and anisonucleosis was more evident. However, the most significant parameter was the chromatin distribution with a granular pattern in almost 90% of the cilindrical cells in more than 80% of the cases. The cytoplasm does not show any peculiar alteration of endocervical cells except for an unconspicous "alo" in some elements, but this pattern is not frequent. In conclusion, some of the parameters studied seem to have a diagnostic relevance in confirming HPV infection. This may suggest that this infection could be present even at endocervical site, and should be confirmed by molecular techniques or by microcolpohysteroscopy.
