Human papillomavirus detection by hybrid capture in paired cervicovaginal lavage and cervical biopsy specimens. Infection of the uterine cervix with human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with dysplastic lesions that may progress to malignancy. Certain HPV types are associated with higher risk of cervical cancer than other genital HPVs. The goal of this study was to determine if cells obtained by cervicovaginal lavage contain similar HPV types as paired cervical biopsy in women referred because of abnormal cervical cytology. Thirty-four paired lavage and biopsy samples were analyzed for HPV DNA by hybrid capture, using "low risk" (HPV types 6. 11, and related types and "high risk" group (HPV types 16, 18, and related types) HPV. HPV was detected in 24 lavage samples and 18 biopsies. High risk types were predominant. In 14 of 18 HPV-positive biopsies, the paired lavage was also positive for the same HPV group. Four biopsies were HPV-positive at low levels, and the paired lavage was HPV-negative. The mean viral copy numbers of the biopsies from patients with positive and negative lavage samples were 2.7 and 0.1, respectively (P = .02). Ten low level HPV infections were detected by lavage that were not detected by biopsy. HPV detection by hybrid capture in cells obtained by cervicovaginal lavage reflects the results of HPV testing in cervical biopsies.
