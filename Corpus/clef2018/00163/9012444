The oxidative burst triggered by Salmonella typhimurium in differentiated U937 cells requires complement and a complete bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The bacterial and serum factors involved in the oxidative response triggered by Salmonella typhimurium in differentiated U937 cells were investigated. Complement activation was shown to be required, using sera deficient in complement factors. An original dot-blot technique was developed to study the activation of complement by either bacteria or purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both O-specific and lipid A segments of LPS were found to play a role in the triggering of the oxidative response. Lipid A was responsible for bacterial C3-derived opsonization by inducing an antibody-independent activation of complement classical pathway, whereas O-specific polysaccharide chains (O-Ag) were involved in cellular activation. Inhibition experiments using anti-cell surface marker monoclonal antibodies showed the involvement of the alpha chain of CR3 (CD11b) in the oxidative response developed by differentiated U937 cells in response to S. typhimurium infection. Whether both iC3b and O-Ag interact with different domains of CR3 or whether the binding of O-Ag occurs via a not yet identified receptor remains to be determined.
