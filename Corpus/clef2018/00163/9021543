Age distribution of antibodies to human papillomavirus in children, women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and blood donors from South Africa. Sera from 95 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 95 age-matched female blood donors, and 155 children aged between 1 and 12 years were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for levels of serum IgG to three human papillomavirus (HPV) peptides (HPV-16 E2 [E2-16], HPV-18 E2 (E2-18], HPV-16 L1 [L1-16]), as well as HPV-16 virus-like particles (VLP-16) and bovine papillomavirus type 1 virus-like particles (BPV-VLP). In the adult group antibodies to E2-16 and VLP-16 were significantly associated with CIN when compared to the blood donor controls (P = .039 and P = .002, respectively). In women with CIN there was an increase in seropositivity to E2-16 and a decrease in seropositivity to VLP-16 with age. Antibodies to HPV-16 E2 could therefore be an important marker of CIN in women over 40 years of age, whereas antibodies to VLP-16 could be a marker for CIN in younger women. There was no correlation with CIN and antibodies to E2-18, L1-16, and BPV-VLP. In the children's sera antibodies were detected to E2-16 (44.5%), E2-18 (18.7%), L1-16 (20%), VLP-16 (4.5%), and BPV-VLP (5.1%). Between the ages of 3 and 12 years the prevalence of antibodies to E2-16 decreased with age. The presence of antibodies to HPV-16 in young children indicated infection with either HPV-16 or a related virus. HPV DNA isolation from children could help resolve this question.
