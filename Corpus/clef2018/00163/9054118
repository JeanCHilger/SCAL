Characterisation of monoclonal antibodies specific to SEF 21 fimbriae of Salmonella enteritidis and their reactivity with other Salmonellae and Enterobacteria. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to type 1 (SEF 2) fimbriae of S. enteritidis was produced using crude and HPLC purified preparations of SEF 21 fimbriae. Sixteen mAbs were selected by indirect ELISA using both purified SEF 21 antigen and whole cells of S. enteritidis. Eight mAbs were confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay to react specifically with SEF 21 fimbriae. These mAbs were further characterised for their reactivity patterns by the "whole cell" ELISA and latex agglutination test with a number of strains of Salmonella and other enterobacteria. Not all SEF 21 mAbs reacted in both ELISA and latex agglutination tests with whole bacterial cells. mAb 611 was the only one suitable for use in both tests. Unexpectedly these mAbs reacted with the type 1 fimbriae of many of the tested strains of enterobacteria. mAb 721 reacted with most strains of Salmonella (89.1%) and enterobacteria (71.4%) tested. mAb 611 reacted with 61%-75% of strains of Salmonella and with 6.9%-17.6% of enterobacteria in ELISA and latex tests respectively. These mAbs will be useful reagents for further characterisation of type 1 fimbriae expressed by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
