Perianal Bowen's disease: associated tumors, human papillomavirus, surgery, and other controversies. Perianal Bowen's disease (BD) is an intraepithelial nonkeratinizing carcinoma, associated historically with internal tumors.A review of patients with perianal BD presenting consecutively during a 25-year span was undertaken, excluding Bowenoid papulosis and contiguous genital BD. Histologic slides were resubmitted for review by an experienced pathologist, in a "blind" fashion among other slides. Follow-up was updated in every patient. Survival and recurrence curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared with a normal age-matched population (log-rank test).Nineteen patients were identified 15 of them were females. Mean age +/- standard deviation was 49.6 +/- 10.6 years. Five patients had a coincidental diagnosis (hemorrhoidectomy or wart excision). No associated carcinomas were foundPerianal BD has no association with internal tumors. Despite a high rate of recurrence, perianal BD can be treated by local excision. An increased rate of human papilloma virus-related entities was found, which could suggest a causative role.
