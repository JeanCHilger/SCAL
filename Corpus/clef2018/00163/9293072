Changing patterns of Salmonella serovars: increase of Salmonella enteritidis in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Serovars of a total of 5,490 Salmonella strains isolated during the period of 1991-95, from human infections (2,254 strains) and from non-human materials (3,236 strains) were evaluated. In the studied period, 81 different serovars were determined among human isolates. Salmonella Enteritidis corresponded to 1.2% in 1991, 2% in 1992, 10.1% in 1993, 43.3% in 1994, and 64.9% in 1995 of all isolates. A significant rise on the isolation of this serovar was seen since 1993 linked to food poisoning outbreaks. It is reported also an increase on the isolation of S. Enteritidis from blood cultures, associated mainly with patients with immunodeficiency syndrome. S. Enteritidis was prevalent among one hundred and thirty different serovars isolated from non-human sources. Increasing number of isolation of this serovar was seen from shell eggs, breeding flocks and from environmental samples. It is also reported a contamination of commercial feed stuffs by S. Enteritidis which represents a major concern for Brazilian poultry industry.
