Differential osmosensing signalling pathways and G-protein involvement in human cervical cells with different tumour potential. Previous studies show that the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in human cervical cells with different tumour potential may be mediated by different ion channels. The signalling events involved in regulating these channel activities are not clear. To screen the possible mechanisms involved in cell volume regulation in these cells, we examine intracellular mechanisms and second messengers listed as follows: phospholipase C (PLC), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), tyrosine kinase (TK), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and cAMP. The involvement of G-protein was also studied. Our results showed that PLC signalling with downstream activation of PKC was involved in the cell volume regulation of cervical cancer cells. On the other hand, different PKC isoforms that were not related to upstream PLC regulation were involved in the RVD of human papillomavirus (HPV)-immortalised and normal cervical epithelia. Furthermore, GTP-gamma S facilitated the process of RVD in cervical cancer cells, while pertussis toxin retarded this process. In contrast, neither GTP-gamma S nor pertussis toxin showed effect on the RVD responses of HPV-immortalised and normal cervical cells.
