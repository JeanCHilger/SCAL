The early diagnosis of typhoid fever prior to the Widal test and bacteriological culture results. In an attempt to evaluate various clinical and laboratory features available within 24 h of admission, prior to the Widal test and bacteriological culture results as potential diagnostic aids in typhoid fever, we undertook a retrospective unit-based case control study in 90 febrile adult and paediatric patients admitted to King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, South Africa with an initial diagnosis of typhoid fever. A total of 30 blood culture-proven typhoid fever patients (cases) were matched to 60 patients confirmed as not having typhoid fever (controls) by age, sex, race and severity of illness on admission. Features significantly associated with a final diagnosis of typhoid fever were: a pre-admission duration of fever > or = 7 days (odds ratio (OR) 6.9) hepatomegaly (OR 3.2)
