Salmonella level of Danish swine herds based on serological examination of meat-juice samples and Salmonella occurrence measured by bacteriological follow-up. Analyses of data collected in the Danish Salmonella Control Program in swine herds were conducted to assess the association between bacteriological and serological findings (including the degree to which changing serological status over time modulated the relationship) and to assess the degree to which type of swine operation and age group affected the relationship between bacteriological and serological findings. Although serological status was significantly associated with bacteriological prevalence of salmonella enterica in swine herds, the association was clarified by adding information on the change in serological status over time and the age group being tested. Salmonella infection assessed by serological tests at a single time-point and data on age group tested would allow better targeting and managing control programs.
