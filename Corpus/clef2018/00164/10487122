Liposomal immunoassay as a method for detecting microorganism antigens and their antibodies. The paper presents experimental data on the use of the liposomal immunoassay (LIA) with a fluorescence marker to detect lipopolysaccharide antigens (LPS-AG) of the causative agents of infectious diseases (S. typhimurium, S. typhi, F. tularensis) and antibodies to them in the model systems and human serum. The sensitivity of determination of specific antibodies to LPS-AG is shown to be 15-160 times as high as that of RPGA and the sensitivity of determination of LPS-AG is comparable to that of solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. The stability and storage of diagnostic immunoliposomal test systems are dealt with. It is shown that the liposomal diagnostic agents can be stable without losing their properties for years. Whether LIA is of diagnostic value in detecting salmonellosis in children in the clinical setting is discussed and the value of this assay is compared with that of other laboratory methods. The data on how LIA can be automated are presented. Its analytical advantages in using in laboratory diagnosis are discussed.
