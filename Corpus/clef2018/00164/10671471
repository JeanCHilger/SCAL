Mutational analysis of ligand recognition by tcp, the citrate chemoreceptor of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. The chemoreceptor Tcp mediates taxis to citrate. To identify citrate-binding residues, we substituted cysteine for seven basic or polar residues that are chosen based on the comparison of Tcp with the well-characterized chemoreceptors. The results suggest that Arg-63, Arg-68, Arg-72, Lys-75, and Tyr-150 (and probably other unidentified residues) are involved in the recognition of citrate.
