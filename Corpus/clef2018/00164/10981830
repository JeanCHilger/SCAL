Clinical and bacteriological profiles of patients with typhoid fever treated during 1975-1998 in the Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital. Patients with typhoid fever presenting to the Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital during the period 1975-1998 were retrospectively investigated. All cases were diagnosed by a positive culture for Salmonella typhi in either of their clinical specimens. Of the total number of 130 patients, 57% contracted the disease abroad this population increased in later years as the total numbers of cases decreased. The period from disease onset to diagnosis averaged 14 days with 20% of the cases requiring over three weeks to establish a diagnosis. As for symptomatology relative bradycardia was seen in less than half of the cases, and rose spots or splenomegaly in less than one third. A positive blood culture was the most frequent test establishing the diagnosis followed by a positive stool culture. Intestinal bleeding was recognized in as many as 35 cases (27%) and even intestinal perforation occurred in two cases (1.5%). Chloramphenicol was most commonly employed during the early study period, however, during the late period it was replaced by fluoroquinolones. The clinical cure rate was 98% with regimens that include fluoroquinolones/quinolone
