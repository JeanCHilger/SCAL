Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a Salmonella enteritidis antigen for differentiating infected from vaccinated poultry. The specificity and sensitivity of indirect ELISA, based on the use of four different antigenic extracts obtained from a clinical isolate of Salmonella enteritidis, were compared with those obtained with the gm-flagellin based ELISA (IDEXX). A total of 116 serum samples from salmonellae free, naturally infected and vaccinated hens were studied. The results showed that the indirect ELISA, based on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), O-polysaccharide (PS) or membrane sediment (SD) antigens, enable the identification of a greater number of infected birds and discriminated field antibody responses from vaccinal ones better than the commercial IDEXX test. The indirect ELISA that used a O-polysaccharide rich fraction (PS) proved to be the most specific and sensitive test, suggesting that this indirect ELISA could be used to confirm IDEXX results, especially when the differentiation between vaccinated and infected poultry is required.
