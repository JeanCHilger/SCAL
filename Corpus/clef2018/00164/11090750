Evaluation of the roche AMPLICOR enterovirus PCR assay in the diagnosis of enteroviral central nervous system infections. Enteroviruses cause a substantial number of cases of aseptic meningitis annually in the USA. While culture has been useful in the detection of patients with viral meningitis it is time-consuming and lacks sensitivity. Detection of viral nucleic acid in patient specimens has been demonstrated to improve enteroviral detection.A research use only commercial amplification assay, the Roche AMPLICOR EV test, was compared to culture for the diagnosis of enteroviral meningoencephalitis.Four-hundred and sixty-five consecutive CSF samples sent prospectively for suspicion of enteroviral infection were evaluated by PCR and shell-vial culture. Clinical information and CSF analysis were used to resolve PCR positive, culture negative samples. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using resolved data.There were 138 samples which met the definition of a true positive. Of these culture detected 77 (sensitivity 55.8%) and PCR detected 136 (sensitivity 98.6%). PCR missed two culture positive samples. Upon repeat testing, these CSF samples were found to contain inhibitors.The Roche AMPLICOR EV-PCR test was statistically more sensitive than culture (P<0.001) in the detection of enteroviruses in CSF in patients suspected of having enteroviral meningitis. This assay also has the advantage of a rapid turnaround time of 5-6 h compared to 3-5 days for culture.
