Is sudden infant death syndrome associated with Helicobacter pylori infection in children? Helicobacter pylori infection has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We investigated this association. Twenty-five pairs of gastric and tracheal tissue specimens obtained from autopsies of 25 children with previous diagnoses of SIDS were available for this study. The presence of H. pylori organisms was evaluated by three different methods: histology (hematoxylin-eosin or Giemsa staining), immunohistochemistry, and nested polymerase chain reaction technique. We were unable to confirm the presence of H. pylori organisms by the first two methods. H. pylori DNA was identified by nested polymerase chain reaction in six different tissue specimens (stomach, 4 trachea, 2). In no case was H. pylori DNA detected in both tissues. We concluded that H. pylori infection is most likely not associated with SIDS.
