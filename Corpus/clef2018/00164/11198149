Neuroretinitis. Despite the growing list of agents that can present as neuroretinitis, nearly one-half remain idiopathic. However, many of the candidate etiologies are treatable conditions, and accurate diagnosis can result in visual rehabilitation. A complete workup in patients presenting with acute neuroretinitis should include a thorough history and general medical evaluation. Exposure history should be thoroughly explored, including recent travel, unpasteurized and uncooked foods, sexual experience, and animal contacts.

Laboratory tests should be tailored to the history and may include complete blood count erythrocyte sedimentation rate
