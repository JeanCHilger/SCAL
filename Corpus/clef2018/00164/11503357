Prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis in France. Risk assessment. Results and perspectives of prenatal screening and newborn follow up. In France, a national program for the prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis has been set up 25 years ago. This program is here presented and discussed in details. It is based on a decision tree well defined, with pre and/or per gravidic serological screening with several different tests, completed, if necessary, by ultrasounds examinations of the fetus, biomolecular tests (PCR) on amniotic fluid, and by clinical, biological, and radiological surveillance of neo-nates. The purpose of this prevention program is to: 1/identify nonimmune young women and limit their contamination risk during pregnancy by appropriate counseling on hygiene and diet 2/screen and treat per gravidic toxoplasmosis as early as possible so as to prevent or limit transmission to the fetus and its consequences. 3/in utero diagnose and treat infestation of the fetus
