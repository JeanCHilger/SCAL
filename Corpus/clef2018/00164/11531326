Unusual presentation of typhoid fever: cutaneous vasculitis, pancreatitis, and splenic abscess. We report a case of typhoid fever with an unusual presentation: prolonged fever with cutaneous vasculitis, pancreatitis, and splenic abscess. This is the first case of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis associated with Salmonella typhi. The diagnosis was made upon isolation of S. typhi in blood cultures, and after ruling out other causes of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The outcome was favourable with antibiotics alone without surgery.
