Bacteremia associated with live attenuated chi8110 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ISP1820 in healthy adult volunteers. Live attenuated chi8110 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ISP1820 vaccine was given in a dose-escalation trial to healthy, adult volunteers. Positive stool and blood cultures were noted, but limited, as were immune responses measured by ELISA and ELISPOT. Only volunteers with bacteremia developed immune responses however, no symptoms were associated with bacteremia. The vaccine was insufficiently immunogenic for use as a vaccine. It is possible that reduced survival in the gut and reduced immunogenicity may have been due to the thawing of frozen inocula immediately prior to use.
