Isolation of a highly purified capsular polysaccharide from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella typhi)--Vi-antigen and its use in serological diagnosis of typhoid fever. For use in differential diagnostics of typhoid fever, samples of the capsular polysaccharide from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (usually named Vi-antigen) were isolated and characterized by physicochemical and serological methods. It was shown that only the sample of Vi-antigen with the minimal (0.57%) admixture of the corresponding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from S. typhi retained a high serological activity in the tests with monoreceptor anti-Vi sera. However, it exhibited a substantially weaker reaction with sera from normal donors and patients with acute nontyphoid salmonelloses, than Vi-antigen preparations with a higher (0.8-1.2%) LPS content. The chromatographically pure Vi-antigen was purified by triple reprecipitation with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The content of the LPS admixture in the resulting Vi-antigen samples was quantitatively determined by GC. A high purification level of the Vi-antigen from the LPS admixture allows us to hope that this preparation could serve as a basic component of the test system for the diagnostics of typhoid fever.
