Typhoid, hepatitis E, or typhoid and hepatitis E: the cause of fulminant hepatic failure--a diagnostic dilemma. To report a case of hepatitis E-induced fulminant hepatic failure associated with typhoid fever, diagnosed with the Widal test.Case report.Eight-bed medical/surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.A 15-yr-old, 50-kg male with grade IV hepatic encephalopathy was admitted to the intensive care unit for ventilatory support. On admission to the intensive care unit he had had fever associated with loss of appetite and nausea for 15 days, jaundice for 4 days, and altered sensorium for 2 days.He was intubated and kept on elective ventilation. Tracheal aspirate, blood, urine, and stool were sterile. Anti-coma measures were instituted in the form of 20 degrees head elevation mannitol, lactulose, and ampicillin through a nasogastric tubeThe patient recovered with anti-coma and anti-typhoid therapy.In viral hepatitis, fever is usually present in the prodromal phase but subsides before appearance of the icteric phase. In endemic areas, if fever is present in the icteric phase of hepatitis, typhoid also should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever, even in the absence of positive cultures for Salmonella typhi. The Widal test may be helpful in reaching a diagnosis.
