Production and characterization of monoclonal immunoglobulin A antibodies directed against Salmonella H:g,m flagellar antigen. Hybridomas were generated after intragastral immunization of BALB/c mice with live Salmonella suberu and subsequent fusion between isolated spleen lymphoblasts and myeloma cells. Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype were selected and characterized. All of them were found to recognize the H:g epitope in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting but did not react with all H:g-expressing strains in slide agglutination test. All MAbs strongly agglutinated Salmonella enteritidis type strain and a large number of S. enteritidis clinical isolates. They were not bactericidal in the presence of complement. All hybridoma clones produced secretory IgA forms, which were found in the gastrointestinal tract of mice bearing hybridoma as a subcutaneous 'backpack' tumor or after intravenous application of purified MAbs. The IgA MAbs stability demonstrated in different tests together with their antigen specificity and strong agglutination ability make them a useful diagnostic tool for serotyping of Salmonella strains.
