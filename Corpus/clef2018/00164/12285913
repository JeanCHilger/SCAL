Coping with osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis, or infection of the bones, is a common orthopedic condition in the young in developing countries which causes severe deformity and morbidity.  Acute osteomyelitis is of hematogenous origin, and in adults it results from infected open fractures or a leg ulcer from Staphylococcus aureus (over 80%), or mixed with Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas spp, Proteus spp, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi.  In a classic case of acute osteomyelitis, a child under 10 presents severe bone pain, pyrexia of 39-40 degrees Celsius, and inability to use the limb.  Blood culture is positive in 60% of cases, and white cell count is elevated to around 20,000/ml indicative of leucocytosis.  After 12 weeks of intense infection in the bone, chronic osteomyelitis sets in.  A large abscess develops in the subperiosteal soft tissue extending into the tissue planes.  Discharging sinuses and fistulae appear along with bony deformity.  In advanced cases, X-ray shows complete separation of the dead bones (sequestrum) or a defect in the length of bone.  In acute osteomyelitis, treatment calls for the limb to be splinted and elevated.  The usual regimen is to give 500 mg iv cloxacillin every 6 hours for 24-48 hours in combination with intra-muscular gentamicin (40 mg, every 8 hours) and analgesics as well as small doses of pethidine for 24 hours.  Antibiotic therapy must continue for 8-12 weeks with a follow-up X-ray at 3 months to confirm complete recovery.  In chronic osteomyelitis, which can linger for year, subcutaneous and subperiosteal abscesses should be drained without sequestrectomy until involucrum has formed.  Public awareness has to be increased about urgent medical attention at an early stage to avoid amputation in very severe cases in adults.
