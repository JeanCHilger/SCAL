Intrauterine West Nile virus infection--New York, 2002. West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus and human neuropathogen, is epidemic in the United States. In 2002, newly recognized mechanisms of person-to-person WNV transmission were described, including possible transmission from mother to infant through breast milk. WNV has not been previously associated with intrauterine infection or adverse birth outcomes. This report describes a case of transplacental WNV transmission. Pregnant women should take precautions to reduce their risk for WNV or other arboviral infection and should undergo diagnostic testing when clinically appropriate.
