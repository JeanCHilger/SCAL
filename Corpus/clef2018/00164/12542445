Isolated thrombocytopenia: the presenting finding of typhoid fever. Thrombocytopenia is generally seen as a complication in typhoid fever. However, it can also be encountered as a presenting sign on admission. A 29-year-old man with complaints of fever and diarrhoea was hospitalized because of isolated thrombocytopenia encountered on routine complete blood count examination. The diagnosis of typhoid fever was established when Salmonella typhi was isolated from the blood cultures. The platelet count returned to normal level within the first week of ceftriaxone therapy. Possible mechanisms of thrombocytopenia were discussed.
