Repeated gallium-67 scan demonstrating an occult mycotic aneurysm of the aortic arch due to Salmonella. A 71 y-old female with 40 degrees C fever and a change in consciousness during haemodialysis was referred for a gallium-67 scan, which revealed a horseshoe-like radioactive accumulation in the mediastinal region. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from blood culture. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an aortic arch aneurysm. The patient died without surgery.
