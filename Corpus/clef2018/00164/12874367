Molecular characterization of the sucB gene encoding the immunogenic dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase protein of Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii and Bartonella quintana. Members of the genus Bartonella have historically been connected with human disease, such as cat scratch disease, trench fever, and Carrion's disease, and recently have been recognized as emerging pathogens causing other clinical manifestations in humans. However, because little is known about the antigens that elicit antibody production in response to Bartonella infections, this project was undertaken to identify and molecularly characterize these immunogens. Immunologic screening of a Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii genomic expression library with anti-Bartonella antibodies led to the identification of the sucB gene, which encodes the enzyme dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase. Antiserum from a mouse experimentally infected with live Bartonella was reactive against recombinant SucB, indicating the mounting of an anti-SucB response following infection. Antigenic cross-reactivity was observed with antiserum against other Bartonella spp. Antibodies against Coxiella burnetti, Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia typhi also reacted with our recombinant Bartonella SucB. Potential SucB antigenic cross-reactivity presents a challenge to the development of serodiagnostic tests for other intracellular pathogens that cause diseases such as Q fever, rickettsioses, brucelloses, tularemia, and other bartonelloses.
