Suppurative salmonella thyroiditis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We describe an 82-year-old man with undiagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with acute swelling of the thyroid goiter. Subsequent thyroid aspirate and blood culture yielded group B Salmonella thyroid abscess with septicemia. Infectious complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CLL since most of them can be timely detected and few can arise from innocent-looking lesions.
