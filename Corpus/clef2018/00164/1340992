Study of the Widal test phenotypic expression of blood groups ABO, Rh and MNSs in patients with typhoid fever. The significance of the Widal test (WT) as a phenotypical expression was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 244 children from the Northern Area of Santiago (Chile) with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever (TF) due to S. typhi (183 cases) and S. paratyphi B (61 cases). The working hypothesis was that if the parasite-host relationships were similar for these two agents the immune response, as measured by the Widal test, should be similar. An association between test response and etiology was found consisting of a significantly higher proportion of positive response, in cases due to S. paratyphi B as compared with those due to S. typhi, (OR = 2.13 95 Cl% = 1.06, 4.32
