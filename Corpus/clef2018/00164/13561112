Laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever with notes on treatment. As indicated by a study of 41 cases of typhoid fever treated in three years, blood culture alone is often sufficient for the diagnosis of the disease if a large (30 cc.) specimen is used. Demonstration of the organism is the only completely diagnostic measure, but this was also achieved by the Widal reaction, by fecal or urine culture, or by aspirated bile culture, which in one case gave the only positive response. Chloramphenicol is the drug of choice in treating typhoid fever. Since only 25 per cent of patients develop immunity, immunizing injections should be started a week after therapy is discontinued.
