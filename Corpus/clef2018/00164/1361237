Characterisation of monoclonal antibodies against a fimbrial structure of Salmonella enteritidis and certain other serogroup D salmonellae and their application as serotyping reagents. A panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies from different hybridomas was produced against a novel salmonella fimbrial antigen expressed predominantly by Salmonella enteritidis strains. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies to this antigen (SEF14) was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified SEF14, immune electron microscopy and, with 11 monoclonal antibodies, the identification of a repeating protein subunit (14,300kDa) on the antigen. Blocking-ELISA with the monoclonal antibodies identified epitopes in at least three, non-overlapping clusters which appeared evenly distributed on SEF14 in immune electron microscopy. The use of the monoclonal antibodies in direct-binding ELISA on a range of salmonella serotypes suggested that the epitopes on SEF14 are highly conserved and were expressed by all the S enteritidis strains examined some strains of S dublin and the only strain of S moscow available were the only other serotypes that expressed SEF14. A latex agglutination reagent based on a monoclonal antibody was developed and used to test for SEF14 on 280 strains (representing 120 serotypes in 24 serogroups of salmonellae) that had been grown on Sensitest agar for 18 hours at 37 degrees C. All S enteritidis strains (64) and most S dublin strains (28 of 33) produced SEF14 as did the two strains representing S blegdam and S moscow. SEF14 was not detected in any other strains of serotypes from serogroup D or from any other serogroup examined.
