Serum, disc and egg ELISA for the serodiagnosis of Salmonella gallinarum and S. enteritidis infections in chickens. An ELISA was evaluated for the serodiagnosis of fowl typhoid and paratyphoid due to Salmonella enteritidis in chickens. The hot phenol: water lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extract of Salmonella was used as the antigen. Chicken serum, eggs and discs impregnated with chicken blood were tested for the presence of antibodies against Salmonella factor 'O' 9 antigen. The substrate and chromogen used were hydrogen peroxide and orthophenylenediamine respectively. Serological results from the experimentally and naturally infected chickens showed close agreement between the conventional Serum Tube Agglutination Test (SAT) and serum ELISA while serum ELISA results were in close agreement with the egg and disc ELISA results. It was noted that ELISA was highly sensitive, convenient and versatile. It is concluded that ELISA, especially disc ELISA, ought to replace SAT for seroscreening chickens against S. gallinarum and other Salmonella Group D infections.
