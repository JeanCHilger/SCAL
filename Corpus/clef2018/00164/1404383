M ring, S ring and proximal rod of the flagellar basal body of Salmonella typhimurium are composed of subunits of a single protein, FliF. The flagellar basal body, a major part of the flagellar motor, consists of a rod and four rings. When the fliF gene of Salmonella typhimurium, which was previously shown to code for the component protein of the M ring, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, the FliF subunits formed ring structures in the cytoplasmic membrane. Electron microscopic observation of the purified ring structures revealed that each was composed of two adjacent rings and a short appendage extending from the center of the rings. Antibodies raised against the purified FliF protein decorated both the M and S rings of the intact basal body. We conclude that the FliF protein is the subunit protein of the M ring, and of the S ring and of part of the proximal rod of the flagellar basal body.
