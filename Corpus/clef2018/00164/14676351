Salmonella osteomyelitis in an otherwise healthy adult male-successful management with conservative treatment: a case report. A 21-year-old male presented with pain in the right thigh of insidious onset and 3 months' duration. He had a history of febrile illness lasting for 15 days, 2 months prior to the onset of pain. Examination revealed swelling over the lower lateral aspect of the right thigh with some induration and tenderness. Initial X-rays of the right femur and the computed tomography scan at 10 weeks after the onset of disease were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed signal alteration with minimal destruction of the anterior cortex in the mid-diaphyseal region of the right femur. A repeated X-ray taken at 15 weeks after the onset of illness showed erosive changes, along with periosteal reaction in the diaphyseal area. The Widal test was positive. Open biopsy of the lesion revealed inflammatory non-caseating tissue. Culture of the specimen grew Salmonella typhi. The patient was given antibiotic treatment. Both X-rays and the Widal titres were normal on subsequent follow-up at 3 months.
