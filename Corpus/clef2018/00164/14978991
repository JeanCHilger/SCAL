Pattern of nontyphoid ileal perforation over three decades in Pondicherry. Two hundred and twelve cases of ileal perforation due to different causes (excluding typhoid) were treated in 3 phases in the Department of Surgery, JIPMER Hospital, Pondicherry, during the periods 1966-78 (phase I), 1981-88 (phase II) and 1990-1998 (Phase III). Forty per cent of the patients were in the second and third decades of life. Male-to-female ratio was 2.2:1. The majority of the perforations (52.8%) were due to non-specific causes. Trauma (19.3%) and mechanical factors (12.7%) were the other principal aetiologies. Pain abdomen (92.3%), constipation (63.6%) and fever (44.3%) were the principal presenting features. Abdominal guarding and rigidity (89%) were the main physical signs. Pneumoperitoneum was present in 66.8% of cases on plain X-ray abdomen. Widal and blood culture for Salmonella typhi were negative in all. Laparotomy was done in most of the cases after adequate resuscitation. Simple closure of the perforation, wedge resection and resection anastomosis were the different procedures of management. Histology of the margin of perforation/excised gut gave added evidence of a non-typhoid etiology. Broad-spectrum antibiotics in different combinations with metronidazole were administered postoperatively. Mortality was 28.2% in Phase I, and 9.4% and 11.9% in phases II and III respectively. The lag period (advent of symptoms and hospitalization) showed definite relationship with mortality and morbidity. Wound infection, wound dehiscence, enterocutaneous fistula and septicaemia were the principal postoperative complications.
