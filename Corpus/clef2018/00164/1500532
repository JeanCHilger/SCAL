Further consideration of the clonal nature of Salmonella typhi: evaluation of molecular and clinical characteristics of strains from Indonesia and Peru. We examined envelope protein profiles, chromosomal restriction endonuclease digest patterns, and immune responses to envelope proteins for collections of Salmonella typhi strains isolated in Peru and Indonesia. Only minor differences in envelope protein patterns were apparent among strains. Strains from 7 of 20 Indonesian patients had a distinct chromosomal digest pattern compared with patterns of Peruvian and other Indonesian strains. Strains with this pattern carried the gene for the j flagellar antigen (H1-j) differences in response to envelope proteins of j and d strains were noted on immunoblot analysis. Our data suggest that there are genotypic and phenotypic differences among S. typhi strains. The clinical importance of these differences remains to be fully evaluated
