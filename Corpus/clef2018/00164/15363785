Conformational epitope mapping of OmpC, a major cell surface antigen from Salmonella typhi. The outer membrane protein OmpC, a trimer made of 16 stranded beta-barrel monomers, is a major cell surface antigen from the human pathogen Salmonella typhi. The relative stability of the epitopes recognising a Salmonella specific MAb (referred as MPN5) and an Enterobacteria specific MAb (referred as P7D8) and the role of the trimeric organisation has been probed using gel electrophoresis and monoclonal antibodies. The assembly of the trimer and the stability of the beta-barrel are found to be important for epitope presentation. The Salmonella specific conformational epitope is found to be more stable than the Enterobacteria specific one. The important residues of the Salmonella specific (Asp 25 of loop 1, Asp 340 of loop 8, Lys 334 of loop 8, and Tyr 210 of loop 5) and the Enterobacteria specific (Asp 25 of loop 1, Tyr 210 of loop 5, and Lys 152 of loop 4) conformational epitope have been identified using monoclonal antibodies, chemical modification, and solid phase binding methods.
