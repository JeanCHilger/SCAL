Evaluation of nested PCR in diagnosis of typhoid fever. In this study, nested PCR using H1-d primers, which is specific for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, was compared to blood culture and the single-tube Widal test. Results indicate that nested PCR can be used as a gold standard to determine the cutoff titer of the Widal test for diagnosis of typhoid fever.
