Nontyphoidal salmonellosis and mycotic aneurysm: a case report. A 74-year-old male with atherosclerosis presented with severe nontyphoidal salmonellosis, and received outpatient therapeutic antimicrobial treatment. Nevertheless, within seven days he developed a mycotic aortic aneurysm, a serious but treatable complication. Its surgical management was successful. Rapid formation of mycotic aortic aneurysm represents a rare complication of a common disease, nontyphoidal salmonellosis. Atherosclerosis seems to be an important risk factor. Extensive work-up for mycotic aneurysm by CT-scan in patients older than 50 years, with nontyphoidal Salmonella -positive blood cultures, especially in the presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis, is prudent. However, blood and stool cultures of these patients can be negative in 15% and 35% of cases, respectively. And the results of the blood cultures may be delayed. So it is sensible to extend the previous recommendation to patients older than 50 years, with typical symptoms of nontyphoidal salmonellosis and imminent aneurysmatic rupture, independent of previous results of CT-scans, and blood or stool cultures.
