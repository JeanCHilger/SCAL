3-Substituted indolizine-1-carbonitrile derivatives as phosphatase inhibitors. In the course of studies directed toward the discovery of novel scaffolds for medicinal application, we synthesized a series of 3-substituted indolizine-1-carbonitrile derivatives. Some of them displayed activity against MPtpA/MPtpB phosphatases which are involved in infectious diseases. We report here the solid-phase synthesis and antiphosphatase activity of a series of indolizines.
