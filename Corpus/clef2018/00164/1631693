Murine typhus endocarditis. We have described a 28-year-old male sheepfarmer who had fever, headache, chills, malaise, and aortic insufficiency. Echocardiography revealed a tricuspid aortic valve with a large vegetation on the right cusp, an enlarged left ventricle, and diastolic flutter of the mitral valve. Repeated blood cultures were negative. Seroconversion of IgG and IgM to Rickettsia typhi was found on the 13th day of hospitalization. The patient was treated with tetracycline for 1 year and remained afebrile and free of symptoms for 9 months, when he was lost to follow-up. IgM and IgG fluorescent antibodies to R typhi remained positive during 8 months of the follow-up period. We believe this to be the second reported case of endocarditis due to R typhi and the first not treated surgically.
