Typhoid fever in Dhulikhel hospital, Nepal. One hundred and twelve cases of typhoid fever presenting in outpatient and emergency department of Dhulikhel Hospital in Nepal were studied. In this study, it was found that 71% typhoid fever cases were less than 30 years of age group with male to female ratio of 3:1. Fever over 5 days followed by headache and chills were major presenting symptoms. Widal test and blood culture for Salmonella typhi were positive in 59% and 49% cases respectively. Two third of our study population had total leucocyte count of normal range. The fever clearance time was significantly better with ofloxacin compared to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.05) and ceftriaxone compared to chloramphenicol (p < 0.05). The release from treatment was significantly shorter with ceftriaxone compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol (p < 0.01). Ceftriaxone was found to be 100% sensitive to salmonella typhi. Amoxicillin was only 52.1% sensitive to Salmonella typhi. Early diagnosis and institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy is of paramount importance in the management of typhoid patients.
