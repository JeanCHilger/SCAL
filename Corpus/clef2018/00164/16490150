Emergence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi with decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility in Bangladesh. During 1989-2002, we studied the antimicrobial resistance of 3928 blood culture isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Overall 32% (1270) of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole) first detected in 1990 (rate of 8%), increased in 1994 (44%), declined in 1996 (22%, P<0.01 compared to 1994) and re-emerged in 2001 (36%) and 2002 (42%, P<0.01 compared to 1996). An increased MIC of ciprofloxacin (0.25 microg/ml) indicating decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was detected in 24 (18.2%) out of 132 randomly selected strains during 1990-2002
