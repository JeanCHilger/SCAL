Invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis in immunocompetent infants and children. To investigate the extraintestinal manifestations of non-typhoidal Salmonellae (NTS) infection in immunocompetent infants and children.The study took place at the University General Hospital at Heraklion, Crete. Over a 10-year period from 1993-2002 we studied 1087 patients, of whom 443 were children less than 14 years old, with a culture-proven diagnosis of NTS infection. Stool and blood cultures were routinely obtained in patients presenting with fever and diarrhea. The cases of invasive infection in otherwise well children, including bacteremia and/or extraintestinal focal infections were further analyzed.Invasive cases were less common in children than adults (4.06% vs. 8.7% relative risk 0.467Invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis in immunocompetent children is less frequent than in both immunocompromised children and in adulthood. However, invasive cases may well occur in otherwise healthy children, especially during infancy. In these patients, prompt appropriate treatment leads to favorable outcomes.
