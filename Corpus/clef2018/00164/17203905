Postoperative meningitis caused by an unusual etiological agent: Salmonella enteritidis. Salmonella intracranial infections are unusual in adults, and particularly after neurosurgical procedures. We report a case of post-operative meningitis owing to Salmonella enteritidis. A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was admitted to our unit for postoperative evaluation and management after neoplasic intracranial surgery. On the third day of admission, the patient developed infectious signs and diagnosis of postoperative meningitis was evoked. The cultivation of cerebrospinal fluid revealed Salmonella enteritidis which was also identified in several blood cultures. The treatment consisted of third-generation cephalosporin and quinolone to which Salmonella enteritidis was susceptible. However, the clinical course was poor and the patient died on day 8. This case demonstrates that postoperative meningitis can be caused by an unusual agent like Salmonella enteritidis.
