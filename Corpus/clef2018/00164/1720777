Epitope mapping of four monoclonal antibodies recognizing the hexose core domain of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide. Four murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with distinctive regions of the hexose core domain of Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were generated and their epitope specificities were delineated. MAST 56 (IgG1) and MAST 50 (IgG3) antibodies elicited by immunizations with Salmonella typhimurium Rb1 and Rb2 mutants, reacted selectively in enzyme immunoassay with the LPS from rough mutants. In contrast, MATy 1 (IgM) and MATy 2 (IgG2b) antibodies raised by an attenuated Salmonella typhi 620 Ty strain were reactive with LPS from both smooth and rough Salmonellae. Immunoblotting analysis showed that MATy 1 distinguished only the bottom bands (naked LPS core) among the heterogeneous LPS populations, whereas MATy 2 gave a ladder pattern (reactive with both naked and O-chain-substituted LPS cores). Differential binding specificities of MATy 1 and MATy 2 antibodies to the naked and capped LPS cores were further analyzed utilizing S. typhimurium polysaccharide fractions with different O-chain:core ratios which were obtained after separation by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. Steric effects on the antibody reactivity by the bulky O-polysaccharide chain were detected. The use of chemically defined native and synthetic saccharides as inhibitors, in combination with the conformation of the Salmonella core oligosaccharide, permitted the definition of antigenic determinants carried in the core domain recognized by each antibody: (i) the branches I and VIII are essential for MATy 1 recognition, (ii) the backbone III-IV-V for MATy 2, (iii) the backbone II-III-IV-V for MAST 56, and (iv) the backbone plus the branch III-IV-V-VIII for MAST 50.
