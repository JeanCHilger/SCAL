Bacterial isolates of blood cultures in patients with suspected septicaemia in Ilorin, Nigeria. Periodic bacteriologic surveillance of blood cultures is a necessity. To determine currently prevalent bacterial pathogens of blood cultures in patients with suspected septicaemia in Ilorin. Nigeria. Three thousand and fifty-seven patients from all age and sex groups with clinical suspicion of septicaemia underwent bacteriologic screening of their blood specimen over a 13 month period starting from January. 2003. Twenty point three percent were positive for bacterial growth. An incidence of 41.7 per 1000 admissions was recorded which was a statistically significant (p< 0.05) marginal increase when compared with the previous incidence of 37.9 per 1000 admissions from this centre. Majority of the isolates were gram negative (51.61%) though the single predominant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (35.85%). Other isolates included Escherichia coli (32.48%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.74%), Proteus spp (0.32%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1.61%), Salmonella typhi (0.48%). beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (0.48%) and Acinetobacter spp (0.32%). No anaerobe was isolated. Most isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, perfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) except Acinetobacter that was 100% resistant to both groups of antibiotics. Gram positive isolates were resistant to the second generation cephalosporin, cefuroxime. We hereby recommend the use of combination of a third generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones where not contraindicated, in the empiric treatment of septicaemia before sensitivity results are available.
