Case report: parotid abscess due to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in an immunocompetent adult. There are reports of increasing incidence of focal extra-intestinal infections from non-typhoidal salmonellae during the past two decades. We present the first case of a parotid abscess caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) in an apparently immunocompetent adult without other abnormality of the parotid glands. A 58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of a 3-day history of fever and painful swelling of the right parotid gland. His medical history was unremarkable. A CT scan revealed an abscess of the right parotid. S. Enteritidis was isolated from a sample of fluid aspirated from the parotid abscess under ultrasound guidance. The stool, urine, and blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with ciprofloxacin 500 mg per os every 12 h for 10 days, with complete remission of symptoms. The infection did not recur during 3 years of follow up. Our case report adds to the literature regarding the extra-intestinal infections with S. Enteritidis, a common non-typhoidal salmonellosis.
