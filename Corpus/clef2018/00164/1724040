The serologic diagnosis of group B salmonelloses. Antibacterial sera activities towards Citrobacter O22 and Salmonella typhimurium were tested with O22, O1, O4, O5, O12 erythrocytic diagnostic agents. Cross activities of O22, O1, O4, O5, O12, and Hi antigens were tested with the same and Hi erythrocytic diagnostic agents in the antibody neutralization test. The findings have confirmed the identity or very close relationship between the tested O antigens. Screening for antigens of the excretions from patients with S. typhimurium and Citrobacter O22 infections has shown that indication of Hi antigen may be considered as the differentiating criterion between these infections.
