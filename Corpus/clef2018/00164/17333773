Neonatal sepsis caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Weltevreden. Salmonella enterica serovar Weltevreden is an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis occurring worldwide. For the first time, we report 2 cases of neonatal sepsis caused by S. Weltevreden from Hubli, India. In the first case, the neonate had features of septicemia and S. Weltevreden was isolated from a blood culture. The other neonate had omplalitis and clinical features of septicemia. S. enterica serovar Weltevreden was isolated from the umbilical swab culture of this neonate. Even though extensive investigations were conducted, the source of infection could not be identified. Both neonates recovered completely after appropriate antibiotic and supportive therapy.
