Salmonella bacteraemia in England and Wales, 1981-1990. To report the incidence of nontyphoidal salmonellas in England and Wales and identified in the Division of Enteric Pathogens, London between 1981 and 1990.Strains were serotyped and phage typed for Salmonella typhimurium, S enteritidis, and S virchow, using established methods.Overall, less than 2% of nontyphoidal salmonellas isolated from humans were from blood culture. The highest numbers of bloodstream isolates were from infections caused by S enteritidis and S typhimurium, but the highest incidence of septicaemias was attributable to infections with S cholerae-suis, S dublin, and S virchow. 2.2% of S typhimurium isolates phage type 204C were from blood culture likewise, 5.5% of S virchow phage type 19. This could be a cause for concern as most isolates of both these phage types are multiresistant to antimicrobial drugs.Salmonella septicaemia is rare in England and Wales in other than a few serotypes of limited epidemiological importance.
