Reappearance of severe typhoid forms following a case of massive gastrointestinal haemorrhaging. A case of a patient is reported who was admitted with massive intestinal haemorrhaging after 10 days of medical discomfort, characterized by persistent fever, headache and abdominal pain. The patient did not respond to medical treatment: antibiotics, blood transfusions and fluid replacement and required emergency surgical intervention. Intestinal resection with primary anastomosis was performed, controlling the bleeding. Following the testing of blood cultures and histopathological study infection by the S. tiphy bacteria was recorded by testing. In Latin America this strain of typhoid fever was common until the beginning of the 90's, before the cholera epidemic and has rarely been seen in the past 15 years.
