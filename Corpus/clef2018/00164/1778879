Three-day treatment of typhoid fever with two different doses of ceftriaxone, compared to 14-day therapy with chloramphenicol: a randomized trial. Fifty-nine adult Filipino patients suffering from typhoid fever documented by blood culture were randomly allocated to one of three different drug regimens. Nineteen patients received 3 g ceftriaxone iv once daily for three days. Twenty patients received 4 g ceftriaxone iv once daily for three days and 20 patients received oral chloramphenicol 3 g daily in divided doses for two days followed by 2 g daily for 12 days. Eighteen patients were cured (95%) with 3 g of ceftriaxone for three days. All patients receiving 4 g ceftriaxone per day for three days or chloramphenicol for 14 days were cured. In the ceftriaxone groups two patients developed typhoid fever 30 and 45 days respectively after completion of treatment and one further patient had evidence of reinfection. Three patients relapsed within 15 to 17 days in the chloramphenicol group. Fever subsided in most patients between six and eight days, with three patients having a prolonged and moderate fever for 11 days in the ceftriaxone groups. This study suggests that a short treatment of three days of typhoid fever with ceftriaxone (3 or 4 g once daily) is adequate and not hazardous as far as relapses are concerned.
