Pediatric salmonellosis at the Tokoin's teaching hospital, Lom√© (Togo). The authors had for aim to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and bacteriological aspects and outcome of pediatric Salmonella enterica, Salmonella septicemia, over the last 10 years.We analyzed the case history of 132 patients hospitalized for Salmonellasepticemia (positive blood culture) between 1995 and 2004.Salmonellosis accounted for 0.36% of all hospitalizations. The mean age of patients was 5.86 plus or minus 4.06 years, significantly higher in patients with S. ser. Typhi (7.14+/-4.04 years) than in patients with other serotypes (4.95+/-3.8 years). The clinical presentation was severe in many children (with dehydration (34.8%) and emaciation (55.3%)), so HIV was suspected and investigated in 51 patients (38.6%). Eight patients were HIV positive. Three serotypes of S. enterica were predominant: S. ser. Typhi, 55 cases (41.7%), S. ser. Enteritidis, 32 cases (24.2%), and S. ser. Typhimurium, 19 cases (14.4%). The bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics was good for ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin (100%). But 78.8% of the serotypes were resistant to amoxicillin, 75.4% to chloramphenicol, and 69.4% to cotrimoxazole. The mean duration of hospitalization was 13.7 plus or minus 7.4 days (range 4-34 days). Complications occurred in 15.9% of cases, dominated by digestive bleeding (10.6%), and 6.1% of patients died.
