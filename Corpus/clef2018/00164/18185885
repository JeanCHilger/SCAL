A case report of endovascular stenting in Salmonella mycotic aneurysm: a successful procedure in an immunocompromised patient. Mycotic aneurysms are associated with high mortality rates and are managed in the local setting with extra-anatomical bypass followed by ligation, exclusion and debridement of the aneurysm. This is the first case of successful endovascular stenting in an immunocompromised patient with Salmonella mycotic aneurysm.A middle-aged man who was HIV positive had Salmonella septicaemia. He developed abdominal pain 5 days after admission and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed infrarenal aortitis. He developed a mycotic aneurysm 3 weeks later.He opted for endovascular stenting and after prolonged antibiotic therapy and negative blood cultures, he underwent the procedure using a Talent stent, with an iliac extension.He was discharged 1 week after stenting and maintained on oral bactrim based on sensitivity. At 1-year follow-up, he remains well symptomatically and CT scan showed no endoleak or collection.Endovascular stenting, though a fairly new procedure, can be successfully deployed even in a mycotic aneurysm in the right setting.
