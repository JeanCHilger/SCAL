Dot enzyme immunosorbent assay for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever. A nitrocellulose membrane strip dotted with a specific 50 kDa outer membrane protein of Salmonella typhi was applied for the serodiagnosis of typhoid fever. Using horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgM and IgG antibodies with 4-chloronaphthol as substrate, antibodies in typhoid patients were clearly visualised as bluish purple dots while sera from patients with non-typhoid fevers gave negative results. The detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies in typhoid patients suggest either recent or current infection. Combined with the high specificity, reliability and rapidity of the test, the dot EIA technique provides a simple and useful method for the serodiagnosis of typhoid using a single serum specimen.
