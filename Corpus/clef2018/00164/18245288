Coordinated regulation of expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 and flagellar type III secretion systems by ATP-dependent ClpXP protease. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium delivers a variety of proteins via the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1)-encoded type III secretion system into host cells, where they elicit several physiological changes, including bacterial invasion, macrophage apoptosis, and enteropathogenesis. Once Salmonella has established a systemic infection, excess macrophage apoptosis would be detrimental to the pathogen, as it utilizes macrophages as vectors for systemic dissemination throughout the host. Therefore, SPI1 expression must be restricted to one or a few specific locations in the host. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the expression of this complex of genes is repressed by the ATP-dependent ClpXP protease, which therefore suppresses macrophage apoptosis. Depletion of ClpXP caused significant increases in the amounts of two SPI1-encoded transcriptional regulators, HilC and HilD, leading to the stimulation of hilA induction and therefore activation of SPI1 expression. Our evidence shows that ClpXP regulates cellular levels of HilC and HilD via the control of flagellar gene expression. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the flagellum-related gene product FliZ controls HilD posttranscriptionally, and this in turn activates HilC. These findings suggest that the ClpXP protease coregulates SPI1-related virulence phenotypes and motility. ClpXP is a member of the stress protein family induced in bacteria exposed to hostile environments such as macrophages.
