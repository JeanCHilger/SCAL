Multiplex PCR for differential diagnosis of emerging typhoidal pathogens directly from blood samples. Classically Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is associated with typhoid, a major health problem in developing countries. However, in recent years S. Paratyphi A and Vi-negative variants of S. Typhi have emerged rapidly. We have developed a nested multiplex PCR targeting five different genes for differential diagnosis of typhoidal pathogens which has been optimized to be directly applicable on clinical blood samples. Of 42 multiplex PCR-positive blood samples, 26, nine, and two were Vi-positive S. Typhi, Vi-negative S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, respectively, and five patients were found to have mixed infection. Seventeen patients grew Salmonella from blood culture and the remaining 25 were positive in the Salmonella-specific PCR. Tests with several common pathogens confirmed the specificity of the assay. We conclude that the proposed multiplex PCR is rapid, sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of typhoidal pathogens directly from blood samples.
