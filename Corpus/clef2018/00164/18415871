Bilateral endogenous panophthalmitis caused by Salmonella typhi: first case report. Metastatic bilateral endogenous panophthalmitis is a rare but devastating ocular infection. A young male presented with high-grade fever of 4 days duration along with rapidly progressive proptosis and loss of vision in both eyes. Systemic examination revealed bronchopneumonia and the blood culture was positive for Salmonella typhi. Ocular examination revealed bilateral panophthalmitis, which was confirmed on ultrasound B scan and MRI of the orbits. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics and a core vitrectomy was performed in the right eye along with intravitreal antibiotic injection. Bronchopneumonia, proptosis and periorbital edema resolved with systemic antibiotic therapy but the patient developed bilateral phthisis bulbi. This is the first case report of metastatic, bilateral panophthalmitis caused by Salmonella typhi.
