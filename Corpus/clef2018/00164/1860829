Initiator (DnaA) protein concentration as a function of growth rate in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The DnaA protein concentration was determined in five different Escherichia coli strains and in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 growing at different growth rates. The DnaA protein concentration was found to be invariant over a wide range of growth rates in the four E. coli K-12 strains and in S. typhimurium. In E. coli B/r the DnaA protein concentration was generally higher than in the K-12 strains, and it increased with decreasing growth rates. For all the strains, there appears to be a correlation between the DnaA protein concentration and the initiation mass. This supports the concept of the concentration of DnaA protein setting the initiation mass and, thus, that the DnaA protein is a key molecule in the regulation of initiation of chromosome replication in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
