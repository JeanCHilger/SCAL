Modification of the TUBEX typhoid test to detect antibodies directly from haemolytic serum and whole blood. The TUBEX test for typhoid fever detects serum antibodies in a simple and rapid assay system based on the inhibition of binding between two types of reagent particles - magnetic particles coated with an antigen (Salmonella O9 LPS) and coloured indicator particles coated with an anti-O9 mAb. A magnet is used to separate the colour indicator particles bound to the magnetic particles from the unbound indicator particles. Specific colour changes following magnetic separation are indicative of antibodies in the patient's serum however, because results are interpreted based on changes in the colour red, haemolytic or icteric specimens cannot be used. This study describes a simple modification of the protocol to accommodate such specimens, including whole blood. This involves the addition of a quick and simple washing step after mixing the specimen with the antigen-bound magnetic particles. This modification has the advantage of allowing larger sample volumes to be used, thus enhancing the assay sensitivity, and also enables cases considered to be borderline positive by the original method to be re-assessed.
