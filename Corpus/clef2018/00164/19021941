Clinical spectrum of fever of unknown origin among Indian children. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, especially in tropical and developing countries.To determine the aetiology and outcome of FUO in Indian children.A hospital-based, prospective, observational study was conducted over a 1-year period (2006-2007). Children aged > or =3 months to 12 years who qualified for the definition of FUO were recruited. Initial evaluation included complete blood count, peripheral smear for malarial parasites, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urine analysis and culture, blood culture, tuberculin test and chest X-ray.Of 49 patients evaluated, a diagnosis was reached in 43 (88%). Infections were the predominant cause of FUO in 34 patients (69%). Enteric fever was the most common infection (14), followed by visceral leishmaniasis (10) and tuberculosis (5). The next most common cause was malignancy (6, 12%). Among the six undiagnosed patients, spontaneous resolution occurred in five whereas one child continued to be febrile without an established cause at the end of the study.Repeated, thorough clinical examination and carefully selected laboratory examinations proved useful in the diagnosis of FUO. Serology (e.g. enteric fever) and bone marrow examination (e.g. leishmaniasis, malignancy) were the most useful diagnostic tests.
