Detection of Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium DT104 in Mozambique. The spread of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium definitive phage type DT104 in sub-Saharan Africa is a public health concern. We obtained two isolates of S. typhimurium DT104 from blood cultures of infants with malaria in Mozambique. Both isolates contained Salmonella genomic island 1A and had the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis PulseNet pattern (STYMXB.0005). Results showed the need for continuous surveillance of Salmonella spp. serotypes circulating in this area.
