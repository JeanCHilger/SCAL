Detection of living Salmonella cells using bioluminescence. ATP-based bioluminescence using mutant firefly luciferase was combined with an immunochromatographic lateral flow test strip assay for Salmonella enteritidis detection. In this combination method, the Salmonella-antibody-gold complex captured at the test line on the test strip was lysed by heat-treatment, and the ATP released from the cells was measured using mutant luciferase. This method resulted in approximately 1,000 times higher sensitivity in the detection of Salmonella (i.e. 10(3) c.f.u./ml) compared to immunochromatographic lateral flow assay.
