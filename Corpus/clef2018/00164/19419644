Concurrent leptospirosis and salmonella infection. We report a case of a 56-year-old man who was admitted with septicaemia of unknown origin after working in a henhouse. The patient had beginning liver and kidney failure. Salmonella Typhimurium was cultured from the stool, and DNA from Leptospira spp. was demonstrated by PCR in the urine and blood culture. Leptospirosis is a rare condition that should be remembered as a differential diagnosis in patients with relevant exposure. Leptospirosis may be diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction at an early stage of infection. Later development of antibodies will confirm the diagnosis.
