Demonstration of an antigenic protein specific for Salmonella typhi. Current studies were undertaken to determine the presence of a specific antigenic protein on the outer membrane of Salmonella typhi. Immunoblot analysis using sera from patients with fevers revealed that the 50 kD band was specifically recognized only by typhoid sera. The 50 kD band located on the outer membrane is protein by nature and is not a Vi (capsular), dH (flagellar), or O9 (somatic) antigen of S. typhi. These results indicate the usefulness of the specific antigen in the development of a serodiagnostic test for typhoid fever since antibodies of both the IgM and IgG class responses were obtained.
