Seroepidemiology of enteric fever and brucellosis in a developing country. The seroepidemiology of infection due to S. typhi and Brucella spp. in a sub-tropical, developing country of the Middle East was investigated in 130 children of age less than 1 to 15 years, 117 young adults (16-30 years) and in a further 40 adults (greater than 30 years) using an agglutination test to detect antibodies to of S. typhi, B. abortus and B. melitensis. Only 4.5% of the children's and adult's sera respectively showed the presence of antibodies to both O and H antigens of S. typhi with reciprocal titers greater than or equal to 80. Prevalence rates of 11.6%, 11.3% respectively in children and adults of antibodies to B. abortus with reciprocal titers greater than or equal to 80 and similarly 13.1%, 12.4% to B. melitensis were found. The usefulness of a single Widal test to diagnose enteric fever in a non-endemic area and the agglutination test in the diagnosis of brucellosis in an endemic area was investigated. Of 244 patients with suspected enteric fever, the sera of 100 showed reciprocal antibody titers 80 to both O and H antigens and included in these were 8 patients with concurrent culture positivity. Among 138 children and adults with suspected brucellosis, 29 culture proven cases where serologically confirmed and a further 90 were detected serologically. The sera of all the culture proven cases exhibited antibody reciprocal titer greater than or equal to 640. A similar antibody response was noted in seventy-two of the culture negative cases diagnosed serologically for brucellosis. In culture proven, cases B. melitensis was the isolate. Comparative evaluation indicated the potential usefulness of the Rose Bengal Antigen Slide Agglutination Test (Brucelloside Test) as a screening test in the serodiagnosis of human brucellosis.
