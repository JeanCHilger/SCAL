Salmonella osteomyelitis in pregnancy. Salmonella osteomyelitis is rare in the immunocompetent host, even though Salmonella is not an infrequent public health problem. Invasive salmonellosis has in general a poor outcome in pregnancy with regard to fetal survival. We report the case of a healthy woman who developed Salmonella osteomyelitis of the iliac bone four weeks after a febrile gastroenteritis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the iliac bone and a growth of Salmonella enteritidis in blood culture. The patient recovered fully after six weeks treatment with intravenous antibiotics and delivered a healthy infant at 40 weeks.
