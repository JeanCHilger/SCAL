Non-Rotavirus infection causing apnea in a neonate. Apnea in a premature infant is not always due to immaturity and caffeine is not always the answer. We report a case of apnea in a preterm infant who presented at two weeks of life with increase in frequency of apnea that did not respond to caffeine. Family history was significant for diarrhea in a sibling. Stool PCR was positive for Norovirus Genogroup II. Enteric isolation was instituted and the apnea resolved spontaneously with conservative management. Re-emergence of apnea or persistent apnea necessitates further investigation to elucidate the etiology.
