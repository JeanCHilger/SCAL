Conservative management of isolated splenic abscess in children. Isolated splenic abscesses (SAs) are rare in children. We report a single-center experience with emphasis on their diagnosis, etiology, treatment, and outcome.This is a retrospective review.Eighteen children (age, 3-16 years male-female ratio, 5:1) were managed over a period of 8 years in a tertiary-care institution. Presenting symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, and anorexia. Splenomegaly was present in 12 (67%), leukocytosis in 9 (50%), and thrombocytosis in 12 (67%) patients. Associated diseases were thalassemia (1), tuberculosis (1), and typhoid fever (9). Solitary and multiple SAs were seen in equal numbers. Blood culture grew Salmonella paratyphi A in 1 case. Splenic aspirate culture was positive in 3 (Escherichia coli [1], S paratyphi A [1], Acinetobacter [1]). Widal serology was positive in 9 (50%) patients. Management consisted of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in all patients, together with percutaneous aspiration in 10 (56%) cases where the abscess size was greater than 3 cm. All patients responded, and complete resolution was observed.Isolated SA in children responds favorably to conservative treatment with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and percutaneous drainage without the need for splenectomy.
