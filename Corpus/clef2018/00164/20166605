1-2 Test. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of detecting low contamination levels of Salmonella in peanut butter using the 1-2 Test. This study was conducted under the AOAC Research Institute Emergency Response Validation program. A set of samples was analyzed by the 1-2 Test and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference method. Among the 90 total samples and controls, 32 samples were positive by the 1-2 Test and the reference method. Statistical analyses of these paired samples indicated that for all levels analyzed, the difference between the 1-2 Test and reference method results were not statistically different at the 5% level.
