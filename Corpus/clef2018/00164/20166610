RAPID'Salmonella chromogenic medium. Performance Tested Method 050701. RAPID'Salmonella is a chromogenic medium for isolation and detection of Salmonella spp. in food, based on two enzymatic activities. All presumptive Salmonella-positive colonies are magenta, including lactose-positive Salmonella. S. Typhi, and S. Paratyphi serotypes, due to detection of C8 esterase activity. In order to differentiate Salmonella from other Enterobacteriaceae, the medium includes a second chromogenic substrate. As part of an Emergency Response Validation due to a massive outbreak and subsequent recall, peanut butter was tested to compare the performance of RAPID'Salmonella to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference method for detection of Salmonella. Sensitivity and specificity for RAPID'Salmonella were 100%.
