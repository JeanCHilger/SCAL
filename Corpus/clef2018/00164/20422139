Outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis B in a family in southern Taiwan. This study describes a Salmonella outbreak in a 9-member family in Southern Taiwan, and emphasizes the risk of Salmonella infection in extreme age.Salmonella infection was identified by blood culture, stool swab, and Widal test. A questionnaire was designed for the family to ascertain the underlying disease, symptoms, and history of untreated water and food exposure.Of 9 members in the family, 4 had symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea. There was a relationship between Salmonella infection and age, and associated symptoms included fever, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness.Salmonella infection tends to occur more frequently in very young or very old people, especially elderly patients with chronic pre-existing comorbidities. Therefore, age is a significant risk factor for this symptomatic disease.
