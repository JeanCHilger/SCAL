Distribution of antibodies to Salmonella in the sera of blood donors in the south-western region of Nigeria. There are currently no reports of a multicentre assessment of the presence of antibodies to Salmonella in donated blood in Nigeria.Blood specimens from blood donors presenting at six selected public blood collection centres in the south-western region of Nigeria were analysed for the presence of Salmonella antibodies.Out of the 200 specimen analysed, 106 (53%) were found to be Widal-positive with a minimum titre of 160. Among the positive cases, reactivity was most common to S. typhi (D) antigens (48.6%). The most frequently recorded titre of reactive specimens (i.e., the modal titre) was 160, with 71 donors (35.5%) of the total sample population from the different centres reacting at this level. Thirty-one donors had elevated titres of = 320 and nine donors had a titre of 640. The percentages of Widal-positive cases among donors with A positive and O positive blood groups were 58.7% and 64.2%, respectively the percentage of Widal-positive cases was lowest among B positive blood donors (26.7%). The p-value for these differences (p<0.05) shows that blood group has a statistically significant impact on Widal reaction in donors. CONCLUSION.: This study confirms that salmonellosis is endemic in Nigeria and that many of our blood donors may be Salmonella carriers. This study also revealed a positive association between blood groups and typhoid fever.
