Enteric fever in a 6-year-old traveler caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A: laboratory detection strategies and treatment options. We report the first pediatric case of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. Mixed infections are infrequently reported, potentially because detection of two different Salmonella serotypes in blood cultures is technically challenging. We suggest laboratory strategies to aid in the recognition of mixed infections.
