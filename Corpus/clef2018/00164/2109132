Hepatic involvement with typhoid fever: a report of nine patients. Salmonella typhi has been reported to cause hepatic involvement. We studied nine patients with positive blood cultures in order to identify characteristic features of typhoid hepatitis which may help in early diagnosis. Patients who had an illness resembling enteric fever but negative cultures for Salmonella typhi were excluded. No specific clinical features were found consistently and liver function tests were widely variable. Other biochemical abnormalities occurred due to vomiting and renal involvement. Liver biopsy showed focal hepatocellular necrosis and non specific inflammation. Although most responded to conventional antibiotics, it was generally a delayed response. It is recommended that patients with fever greater than 38.5 degrees C and liver abnormalities should undergo blood, urine, stool and/or bone marrow cultures. Liver biopsy may help to differentiate typhoid hepatitis from acute viral hepatitis.
