A suspected case of in utero transmission of influenza A (H1N1) 2009. A 34-year-old woman consulted the day before a scheduled caesarean for dry cough. A positive rhinopharyngeal sample for PCR testing for influenza A H1N1 led to a curative oseltamivir (TamifluÂ®) treatment. At delivery a direct contact between the newborn and mother lasted only few seconds. The first healthy baby boy developped dry cough with a rhinopharyngeal sample positive for A H1N1. The minimal contact between mother and child and the positive neonatal sample only four hours after birth allow to think that it is a rare case of prenatal transmission of influenza A H1N1 to the fetus.
