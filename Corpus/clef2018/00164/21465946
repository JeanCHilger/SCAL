Is there any association of extra hepatic biliary atresia with cytomegalovirus or other infections? The objective of this study was to find any association of extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) with a possible infectious etiology. Infants diagnosed to have EHBA were tested by blood PCR for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Ebstein-Barr virus, HBsAg, anti-HCV and IgM antibodies for CMV, toxoplasma, rubella, and herpes infections. Thirty-three infants of EHBA were included in the study, male 22, median age when diagnosed 2.5 months (range 1.0-5.0 months). On examination pallor, oedema and hepatosplenomegaly were seen in all and ascites and microcephaly in 19 (57.6%). Centile height and weight were 50th in 23 and 25th in 10. Persistent CMV infection documented by PCR was present in 14 (42%) patients. Eleven of these also had positive CMV IgM antibodies. No other above mentioned infections could be detected in our patients of EHBA. Our data suggests that CMV infection may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of EHBA.
