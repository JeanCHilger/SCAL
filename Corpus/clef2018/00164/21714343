Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with typhoid fever. A case study in the Fiji Islands. Guillian-Barré Syndome is a very rare neurological complication of typhoid. We report a young girl with blood culture proven typhoid septicaemia that developed this very rare neurological complication of the disease. Following treatment with intravenous antibiotics she improved but developed the complications during the third week of her illness while admitted in hospital. To our knowledge this neurological complication of typhoid has never been reported in Fiji.
