Scalp abscess due to Salmonella typhimurium-- a case report. The incidence of non-typhoidal salmonellosis has markedly increased in the past decade. Localised infection develops in approximately 5-10% of persons with salmonella bacteraemia. In this report, a 4-year-old female child suffering from acute lymphoid leukaemia is presented with high grade intermittent fever. Pustular lesions were observed over the right side of the scalp. The scalp abscess was drained and pus was sent for culture and sensitivity. Culture grew Salmonella typhimurium. Blood culture also grew the same organism. She had an uneventful recovery after treatment.
