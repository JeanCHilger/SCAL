Salmonella typhi infection: a rare cause of endocarditis. A 21 years old male with a history of mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation is discussed. He was presented with a history of fever and loose motions for one month and shortness of breath for 03 days. Chest radiograph and ECG was within normal limits. Total leukocyte count was elevated and antibodies to salmonella typhi were positive. Blood culture revealed Salmonella typhi growth. Echocardiography revealed small echogenic masses on mitral valve. He responded to treatment with ceftriaxone given for 4 weeks. This is a rare case where Somonella typhi was isolated from blood of a patient with echocardiographic evidence of documented mitral valve disease and endcarditis.
