Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Salmonella Enteritidis. A 73 year-old immunocompromised male was admitted to the intensive care unit with signs of necrotising fasciitis and septic shock. Prompt surgery was performed. Cultures showed Salmonella Enteritidis. Relevant antibiotics were given in a course of 14 days. A few weeks later the patient had a relapse of fever. Again blood cultures showed S. Enteritidis. This case presents a rare manifestation of extraintestinal infection with S. Enteritidis, and implicates the need for long-term antibiotic therapy to prevent relapse.
