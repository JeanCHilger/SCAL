Stability of the mutagenicity in stored cigarette smokers' urine and extract. Urine from cigarette smokers was analyzed for the effect upon mutagenic activity when stored for as long as 175 days. Frozen aliquots of urine were thawed out at various time points in the study and prepared for bioassay. These urine extracts were not bioassayed immediately, but rather refrozen until all of the unprocessed urine samples had eventually been prepared for bioassay. All extracts were obtained using cyanopropyl solid phase extraction techniques. At the end of 175 days, all extracts were bioassayed using a microsuspension assay of Salmonella typhimurium TA98. Urine from smokers was found to be mutagenic (14.4-30.9 revertants/ml equivalent) while a control set of urine from non-smokers was not. Data from the storage study when analyzed by analysis of variance techniques indicated no statistical loss of mutagens occurred over the 175-day period although near significance was observed (P = 0.054). This near significance was the result of decreasing mutant response as storage time increased for two of the higher doses tested.
