Imported infectious diseases in fever of unknown origin in migrant children: 2 cases. The increase in migratory movements has increased the incidence of infectious diseases that were infrequent in our setting. In the presence of fever in children from endemic areas, imported infectious diseases must be ruled out in the first place. We present two cases of typhoid fever in immigrant children, recently diagnosed in our centre. Both from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were admitted for study of fever of unknown origin. The two patients had been living in our country for less than one month. Isolation of the gram-negative bacillus in the blood cultures provided the key for reaching the etiological diagnosis. In both cases endovenous antibiotherapy was established and both the blood cultures and stools became negative before discharge. At present the two children are free of the disease.
