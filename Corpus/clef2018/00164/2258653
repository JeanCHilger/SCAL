Typhoid fever with intestinal hemorrhage, drug-induced fever, DIC, ARDS and psychiatric disorder (a case report). A 40-year-old poor nutritional Japanese male was admitted to our hospital on June 5, 1989, with a 31-day history of fever. He had been working as a crew member of a ship in South East Asia. Salmonella typhi was isolated from his blood culture. In the course of the disease, intestinal hemorrhage, drug-induced fever and liver dysfunction, DIC, ARDS, and psychiatric disorder were identified. Intestinal hemorrhage occurred after the coagulation test became normal, so it was thought that the intestinal hemorrhage did not correlate with DIC. The patient was treated with CP, ABPC and supportive therapy. He became well, and ARDS and psychiatric disorder were disappeared. He was discharged on the 118th day of illness. Drug-induced fever was thought as one of the allergic reaction and the causative drug was not identified by LST. It was suspected that psychiatric disorder correlated with poor nutrition. Supportive therapy such as mandatory bed rest, intravenous hyperalimentation and low-volume blood transfusions, as well as an antimicrobial treatment were important for the inhibition of shock and/or intestinal perforation.
