Salmonella enteritidis bacteraemia as clinical onset of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The case is presented of a 38 year-old patient who was admitted in the Emergency Department due to a severe acute respiratory failure and who was transferred to the Critical Care Unit with a suspected initial diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia caused by an atypical microorganism, which was complicated with an acute respiratory distress syndrome. This was able to be treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation. At 48 hours after admission, the growth of Gram negative bacilli in the blood culture was reported, which was subsequently identified as Salmonella enteritidis. This information, along with the lymphopenia suffered by the patient, suggested an immunodepressed state, thus serological tests were performed which showed positive for HIV. Antibiotic treatment was started based on the microbiological findings, with a favourable clinical outcome for the patient.
