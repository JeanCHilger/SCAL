Treatment of salmonellosis and shigellosis with the new quinolones. Sixty patients with enterocolitis (36 men, 24 females), mean age thirty seven (12 to 84) have been treated with new quinolones. Two groups have been constituted. First group included patients without bacteremia despite enterocolitis. Among them, 9 patients suffered from shigellosis (8 S. flexneri, 1 S. sonnei). Twenty-two patients had a minor salmonellosis (13 S. typhimurium, 4 S. enteritidis, 1 S. blockley, 1 S. Virchow, 1 S. london, 1 S. baildon, 1 S. C2 group). Patients in the second group underwent a septicemic salmonellosis (18 S. typhi, 3 S. paratyphi, 8 other Salmonella serotypes). All patients but one received an oral treatment. Forty-seven patients received 400 mg/day ofloxacin, 8 patients 1.500 mg/day ciprofloxacin, 5 patients 800 mg/day pefloxacin. Treatment lasted an average of 10 days (5 to 31 days). Apyrexia was observed within an average of 3 days (1 to 8 days). Blood culture have always been sterile after a two days treatment duration. No more shigella or salmonella was found in feces, five days after beginning of treatment. No relapse has been observed within a 30 days mean background (1 to 180 days). Not any intolerance needed to stop treatment. Patients have been hospitalized on an average of 11 days. Therefore, new quinolones will represent an effective, well tolerated treatment for salmonellosis or shigellosis.
