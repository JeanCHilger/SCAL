Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella infection with multifocal seeding in an immunocompetent host: an emerging disease in the developed world. We report an immunocompetent 24-year-old man who presented with a severe, invasive non-typhoidal salmonella (iNTS) infection. He presented with lumbar back pain associated with fever and rigours, which had been preceded by diarrhoea. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. An MRI scan of his pelvis and spine showed that he had a small gluteal abscess and sacroiliitis. His condition subsequently deteriorated due to the development of a secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure. He was managed conservatively with 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone, followed by 6 weeks of oral ciprofloxacin. Detailed investigations did not reveal any predisposing factors or evidence of an underlying immunodeficiency. Follow-up showed complete resolution of symptoms with no long-term sequelae.
