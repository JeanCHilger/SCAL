Cloning, expression, and purification of the hemolysin/cytolysin (HlyE antigen) from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi: potential application for immunoassay development. The hemolysin (HlyE) protein of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was reported to be antigenic. This work describes the cloning, expression, and purification of a hexahistidine-tagged HlyE protein under native conditions. Immunoblot analysis and a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using sera from typhoid patients showed the presence of HlyE-specific antibodies in circulation.
