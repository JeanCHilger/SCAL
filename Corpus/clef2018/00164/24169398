Salmonella cholecystitis: atypical presentation of a typical condition. Salmonella cholecystitis is a rare but important complication of Salmonella typhi infection. We are reporting an 11 years old female child who presented with complaints of high-grade fever, jaundice and right sided abdominal pain (Charcot's triad). Her examination showed tender hepatomegaly. Initial blood results revealed high white cell counts with left shift, deranged liver function tests. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed distended gallbladder with minimal layer of sludge seen within its lumen along with streak of pericholecystic fluid. Blood culture grew Salmonella typhi. She was successfully treated with intravenous ceftriaxone.
