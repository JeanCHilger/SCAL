Quantification of cytomegalovirus viral load. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the Herpesviridae family, is worldwide distributed. After the primary infection, CMV induces a latent infection with possible reactivation(s). It is responsible for severe to life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised patients and in foetuses and newborns of infected mothers. For monitoring CMV load, classical techniques based on rapid culture or pp65 antigenemia are progressively replaced by quantitative nuclear acid tests (QNAT), easier to implement and standardize. A large variety of QNAT are available from laboratory-developed assays to fully-automated commercial tests. The indications of CMV quantification include CMV infection during pregnancy and in newborns, and viral surveillance of grafted and non-grafted immunocompromised patients, patients with bowel inflammatory diseases and those hospitalised in intensive care unit. A close cooperation between virologists and clinicians is essential for optimizing the benefit of CMV DNA monitoring.
