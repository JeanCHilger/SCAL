Solid-phase method of immunoradiometric determination of the O antigen of Salmonella typhi. The solid-phase variant of radioimmunoassay for the determination of S. typhi O-antigen has been developed. The sensitivity of this method is 0.1 microgram/ml of the antigen in the blood serum of patients. The study of a number of blood serum samples collected from patients with typhoid fever has confirmed the possibility of using this method in clinical practice.
