Cloning, expression and characterization of the 36 KDal Salmonella typhi porin gene in Escherichia coli. A recombinant plasmid containing the gene for the 36 KDal porin of Salmonella typhi has been identified in a cosmid library of S. typhi propagated in Escherichia coli. The recombinant clone was identified by its ability to endow E. coli with susceptibility to porin specific phages, and by the appearance in the outer membrane of E. coli containing the clone of a new protein of 36 KDal. While the porin confers upon a porinless mutant of E. coli an increased susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, it does not react with serum from patients with typhoid fever in immunoblotting assays.
