Monoclonal antibodies delineate multiple epitopes on the O antigens of Salmonella typhi lipopolysaccharide. Fifteen monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against Salmonella typhi were produced and characterized. The specificities of the antibodies were determined by their binding patterns in an enzyme immunoassay, with a panel of lipopolysaccharides isolated from different bacteria. Seven MAbs reacted with S. typhi, Salmonella enteritidis, and Salmonella dublin (all belonging to serogroup D). One MAb also reacted with Salmonella paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B. Five MAbs reacted with S. typhi, S. enteritidis, S. dublin, and S. paratyphi B. Two MAbs did not bind to any lipopolysaccharide but showed reactivity with bacterial sonic extracts isolated from S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, Escherichia coli, and Shigella sonnei. These antibodies would be helpful in studying the complexity of antigenic determinants expressed by S. typhi and the nature of the antibody response during typhoid and paratyphoid fevers and also in the diagnosis of the disease.
