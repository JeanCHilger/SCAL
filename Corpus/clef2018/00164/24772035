Evaluation the surface antigen of the Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 ghosts prepared by "SLRP". Recently, bacterial ghosts (BGs) were prepared using a protocol based on critical chemical concentrations. It has been given the name "sponge like" (SL) protocol and used in its reduced form "sponge like reduced protocol" (SLRP). While specific antibody for Salmonella is available on the market under the commercial names (of some kits) such as Febrile Antigen Kit (N.S. BIO-TEC), we used the described Kit to investigate the validity of the SLRP. In this study, using SLRP we succeeded to prepare STGs with correct surface antigens could interact with their specific antibodies. Additionally the study has included oral vaccination with STGs with challenge test. The rats serums have been evaluated against both of the O and H antigens. The antigen-antibody interaction (agglutination) results of both the SLRP and the animal experiments prove that we have correct STGs able to immunize the rats against viable Salmonella. STGs could be used as vaccine and as adjuvant and in the antibodies and in the diagnostic kits production. This study is an additional step for the establishment of correct BGs for immunological purposes.
