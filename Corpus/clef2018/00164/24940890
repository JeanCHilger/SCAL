Sensitivity of three inmunocromathographic tests in faeces samples for Campylobacter and Salmonella detection in comparison to culture. Introduction: Campylobacter sp. and Salmonella enterica are two of the main organisms causing gastroenteritis in our environment. Immunochromatographic tests for antigen detection performed directly on stool samples for its simplicity and rapid results may make them useful diagnostic elements in the context of primary care.During October 2012 we selected all feces in which enteropathogenic bacteria are isolated from those received for stool culture in the laboratory of Microbiology of the University Hospital Virgen de las Nieves of Granada. After standard management of faeces samples and isolation of any enteropathogen, the commercial kits: Campy Leti, Ridaquick Campylobacterscreen and Salmonella Leti were tested for simultaneous research of Campylobacter and Salmonella antigens. Sensitivity and specificity were determined.Two hundred and thirty five stool samples were received in which 8 Salmonella enterica (7 B serogroup and 1 D serogroup), 7 Campylobacter jejuni, 4 Aeromonas hydrophila and 1 Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated. Campy Leti, Ridaquick Campylobacterscreen and Salmonella Leti presented a sensitivity of 100%, 100% and 75%, respectively. Specificities corresponded to 46%, 69% and 100%, respectively.Immunocromatographic tests can be useful for a first screening of enteropathogen in primary care.
