Production of antibody to and cellular localization of erythrocyte-sensitizing substance from Rickettsia rickettsii. Antibodies to Rickettsia rickettsii erythrocyte-sensitizing substance (ESS) were raised in rabbits by using a derivatized ESS. The resulting antibodies reacted with R. rickettsii and cross-reacted with Rickettsia conorii, a member of the spotted fever group rickettsiae, but did not react with Rickettsia typhi, a member of the typhus group rickettsiae, Legionella bozemanii, or Proteus vulgaris OX19 or OX2. Immunoblot analysis indicated that ESS was present in more than one fraction and that the major haptenic fraction was proteinase resistant. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that the antibodies to R. rickettsii were specific to components located on the cell surface and intracellularly to components between the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane.
