An unusual presentation of Salmonella typhi bacteriuria in a 10 year old girl from North India. Enteric fever caused mainly by Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), has a high incidence in India. We report a case of enteric fever in a ten year old patient presenting with clinical history of less than one week. Although blood culture, the most important diagnostic modality in early stage of enteric fever was sterile, S. typhi was isolated from culture of urine sample. Serum antibody titres against S. typhi were unusually raised considering that the infection was still in its early stage. Intravenous ceftriaxone therapy was given leading to complete recovery.
