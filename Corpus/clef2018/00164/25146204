Norovirus detection in children with community-acquired or nosocomial diarrhea at Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital in Concepción, Chile. Norovirus (NoV) are RNA viruses highly contagious, stable in the environment, genetically variable, and the most common cause of viral sporadic acute gastroenteritis worldwide. This is the first study carried out in Concepcion, Chile, to investigate the presence of NoV as an etiologic agent of viral diarrheas in hospitalized children. Objective. To detect the presence and genogroup of NoV in children with diarrhea and to compare it with rotavirus (RV) and adenovirus (AdV).A one year descriptive, prospective study in children 0-14 years old. A single diarrheic stool sample per patient was analyzed for the presence of NoV, RV and AdV. Clinical data were unknown at the moment of sampling. Real time RT-PCR with Taqman™ probes for NoV and the immunocromatography VIKIA™ kit for RoV /AV detection were used.Infection for NoV (25.5%) was significantly higher than for RV (15.9%) and AdV (6.2%). It was even greater in infants younger than 2yr. old (n: 103): NoV 34%, RV 17.5%, AdV 7.8%. Children 2-4 yr. old had 11.8% infection of NoV and RV. Children older than 4, only had 12% RV and 4% AdV. Children hospitalized for diarrhea (n: 92) had: 21.7% of both NoV and RV, and 7.6% AdV whereas children hospitalized for other causes (n: 53) had 32.1% NoV,5.7% RV and 3.8% AV. The proportion of infection due to NoV was significantly higher in males (31.5%) than in females (19.4%). The average frequency during the year was higher for NoV (30.3%) than for RV (14.7%) except in summer.The presence of NoV was higher than RV in children with diarrhea. NoV infection showed defined characteristics regarding age, gender, seasonal occurrence and nosocomial transmission that are important epidemiological features.
