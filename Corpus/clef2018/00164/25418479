Proteomic analysis of outer membrane proteins in Salmonella enterica Enteritidis. Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is the predominant agent causing salmonellosis in chickens and other domestic animals. In an attempt to identify antigenic S. Enteritidis outer membrane proteins (OMPs) that may be useful for subunit vaccine development, we established a proteomic map and database of antigenic S. Enteritidis OMPs. In total, 351 and 301 spots respectively from S. Enteritidis strain 270 and strain 350 were detected by twodimensional gel electrophoresis. Fifty-one antigen-reactive spots were detected by antisera on two-dimensional immunoblots and identified as 12 specific proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. OmpA and DNA starvation/ stationary phase protection protein (Dps) were the most abundant proteins among the identified OMPs, comprising 22 and 12 protein species, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the Dps of S. Enteritidis is also antigenic. OmpW was also verified to have high antigenicity. These results show that OmpA, Dps, and possibly OmpW are antigenic proteins. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the immunogenic characteristics of S. Enteritidis OMPs.
