Release of Vi antigens from Salmonella typhi: implications for virulence and diagnosis. The release of Vi antigens from three clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi was measured by a Vi-specific monoclonal antibody. Large quantities of Vi antigens were detected in the culture supernates from all three strains using either passive latex agglutination or rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Vi antigens were also detected in broth cultures of S. typhi containing about 10(5) cells/ml using the sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The significance of this finding in relationship to the virulence and the diagnosis of S. typhi was discussed.
