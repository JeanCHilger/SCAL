Usefulness of Immunochromatography Method for Malaria and Dengue Fever Diagnosis. There are three major differential diagnosis of febrile patients with history of travels to the tropical countries i.e., malaria, typhoid fever and dengue fever. Diagnosis of malaria patients undergoes sometimes arduous process due to the variable skills of laboratory technician, and more convenient method is warranted. Immunochromatography (IC) method is simple method and recently used for diagnosis of several infectious diseases. Here, we reported usefulness of IC method for malaria and dengue fever diagnosis. Forty-seven samples from 46 patients were retrospectively analyzed by both malaria IC method and microscopic examination. Furthermore, three patients were undergone dengue IC method followed by PCR and antibody examination (ELISA) if the results were positive. Several factors such as rheumatoid factor (RF) are known to affect the results of IC method. We also checked malaria and dengue IC method using serum known to be high RF results without malaria infection. Totally six patients were diagnosed as malaria i.e., 1 vivax malaria and 5 falciparum malaria. Sensitivity and specificity of the malaria IC method were excellent, 100% and 97.6%, respectively. Among three patients, one patient revealed false-negative results of dengue IC method, however, results of the other two patients revealed good correlation between IC method and PCR/ELISA results. Among four RF positive serums, 2 malaria IC method and 4 dengue IC method revealed false-positive results. In summary, IC method for malaria and dengue fever might be quick and convenient method and considered to be used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool.
