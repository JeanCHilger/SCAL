Systemic salmonella infections in chemotherapy in 2 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A 15 year old patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, previously diagnosed as being a salmonella carrier, developed S. typhimurium sepsis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, in spite of pretreatment with chloramphenicol. Clinical improvement and termination of salmonella excretion were achieved by treatment with multiple antibiotics. Another patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a 3 year old boy not previously identified as a salmonella carrier, also developed sepsis and osteomyelitis, together with pathological fractures during chemotherapy. Chloramphenicol, administered after isolation of S. typhimurium from blood cultures, led to resolution of the bony defects, complete recovery, and cessation of salmonella excretion. Selective cultures for salmonellae seem indicated in patients with malignant diseases, prior to chemotherapy.
