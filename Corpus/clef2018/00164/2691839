Transcriptional polarity enhances the contribution of the internal promoter, ilvEp, in the expression of the ilvGMEDA operon in wild-type Escherichia coli K12. The ilvG gene of Escherichia coli K12 produces a cryptic peptide as a result of a frameshift mutation located approximately halfway through the coding sequence of the gene. This mutation is polar on expression of the downstream genes (ilvEDA) because transcription terminates within the translationally barren region that results from the mutation. Contrary to this, Salmonella typhimurium produces a full-length functional ilvG protein and is therefore unlikely to manifest this polarity event. E. coli K12 strains with mutations either in the ilvG gene (which restores a full-length protein) or in the rho gene, relieve this polarity suggesting that this event couples transcription and translation in a manner analogous to attenuation. This paper describes experiments designed to determine the molecular nature and location of the polarity event. Most significantly, this work establishes the contribution of the internal promoter (ilvEp, located downstream of the polar site) to the expression of the downstream genes in E. coli K12 wild-type and mutant strains (ilvG) and by extension to the role of this promoter in S. typhimurium. This analysis suggests that ilvEp contributes as much as 90% of ilvEDA expression in wild-type E. coli K12 and only 15% in wild-type S. typhimurium when grown under non-repressing conditions.
