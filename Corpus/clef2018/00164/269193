Antibodies and the Aberdeen typhoid outbreak of 1964. I. The Widal reaction. The outbreak of typhoid fever in Aberdeen during 1964 (Walker, 1965) presented an opportunity to study the antibody titres of typhoid fever patients and of TAB immunized individuals to obtain further knowledge concerning the behaviour of these titres with the passage of time.This paper gives an abbreviated version of part of a research programme which followed the Aberdeen typhoid outbreak of 1964.The antibody titres of patients were followed up for a period of 2 years after discharge from hospital and the findings have been compared with those in TAB immunized healthy individuals.
