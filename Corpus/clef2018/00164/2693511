Mutagenicity of airborne particulates in the rubber industry. The aim of this work was to evaluate the mutagenic activity of airborne particulate matter in the rubber industry. Air was sucked through Whatman glass-fibre filters with Staplex pumps and adsorbed substances and fume particles were extracted with acetone or toluene for 2 h in a ultrasonic cleaner. After separation of the insoluble solid phase by filtration, solvent was evaporated at a temperature of 70 degrees C in an argon atmosphere. The residue was stored at -20 degrees C. Mutagenicity was determined by the Salmonella plate incorporation assay with the tester strain TA98 and activity is related either to the weight of aerosol (rev mg-1) or to the volume of atmospheric sample (rev m-3). The fumes emitted from the tyre tread line, calender feeding, and tyre vulcanizing processes, showed the highest mutagenic activity (55-211 rev mg-1, + S9). At these and at other workplaces (extruder mill, carbon black station, mixer loading), mutagenic activity related to the volume of air was in the range of 22-158 rev m-3, + S9. The results indicate the need to reduce and monitor mutagenic contamination in order to increase the safety of work in the rubber industry.
