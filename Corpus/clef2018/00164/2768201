Comparative sequence analysis of a genus-common rickettsial antigen gene. The genes encoding the 17-kilodalton genus-common antigen have been cloned and sequenced from Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia prowazekii, and Rickettsia typhi. Compared with the R. rickettsii sequence, this sequence had a high degree of homology within the coding and control regions (R. conorii, 99.8% R. prowazekii, 88.1%
