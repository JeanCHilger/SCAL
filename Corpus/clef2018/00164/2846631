Rapid chemiluminescent nucleic acid assays for detection of TEM-1 beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and other bacteria. Two new assays for the detection of TEM-1 beta-lactamase-mediated bacterial penicillin resistance were developed that involve the use of specific nucleic acid hybridization. Both techniques are based on a solution-phase hybridization of oligonucleotide probes to the target DNA sequence, solid-phase capture of the probe-target complex, and an amplified chemiluminescent labeling method. One configuration of hybridization probes detected the presence of TEM-1 in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (45 strains), Haemophilus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Salmonella typhi. A second configuration (TEM-1NH) detected TEM-1 beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance only in N. gonorrhoeae (97 strains) and Haemophilus (6 strains) isolates in which TEM-1 is inserted in a pFA7-type plasmid. Both methods were 100 times more sensitive than a commercially available colorimetric beta-lactamase activity test and approximately 5 times more sensitive than radioisotopic dot blot screening for the gene. The assays are particularly well suited to the analysis of large numbers of samples, can be performed in a total of 4 h, and are sensitive to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU.
