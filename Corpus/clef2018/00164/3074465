Norfloxacin in the treatment of infections caused by Salmonella typhi. The bacteriological and clinical efficacy of norfloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. was studied in an open, non-comparative trial. Twenty-seven patients with clinical symptoms of typhoid fever were included and assigned to treatment for 14 days. Salmonella typhi was found in stools and/or blood cultures from 12 patients. Subsequent cultures from ten of these patients were negative during treatment and in the follow-up period. Two patients remained positive in stool cultures. Body temperature normalized within one week in 11 of the 12 evaluable patients. In conclusion, these results indicate the potential clinical value of norfloxacin for treatment of typhoid fever. Further controlled and comparative studies are needed.
