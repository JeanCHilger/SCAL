Comparison of the Gruber-Widal and ELISA technics used to study Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi infections in patients. In this study, antibody levels were determined against the agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in 168 patient's sera and 40 healthy control sera by Gruber-Widal and ELISA techniques. We compared the results of these two techniques, and discussed. The needed antigens for both techniques were prepared from the local strains of the agents of these infections which were isolated in our laboratory. The widal's tube agglutination test was carried out by classical method, and the ELISA technique was done by the method of Woller et al. As a result, we found that the titers obtained by ELISA were as 4-6 times higher as than those of Widal's. Additionally nonspecific reactions were less seen in ELISA than in Widal.
