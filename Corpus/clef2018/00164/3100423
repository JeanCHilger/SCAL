Septic disease pictures in Salmonella infections. 3715 strains of salmonella have been isolated from various sources from 1976 to 1985. 26 of these isolates have been S. typhi and paratyphi B, 3689 isolates were nontyphoid strains. 7 isolates of S. typhi and S. paratyphi have been isolated from blood cultures. All persons infected with these strains have acquired these organisms in tropical and subtropical areas. In contrast, salmonella gastroenteritis is mainly confined to the intestinal tract. 21 isolates of nontyphoid salmonellae, however, have been isolated from blood cultures. The vast majority of these patients showed compromised host defense mechanisms. Newborn infants up to 3 months are considered particularly vulnerable for bloodstream invasion with nontyphoid salmonellae. Patients with chronic consuming disorders, solid tumors and haematologic malignancies, and the treatment of these ailments with immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids predisposes patients for extraintestinal spread of an enteric salmonella infection. Corticosteroid therapy seems to be particularly responsible for a fulminant course of the disease and poor outcome of the infection.
