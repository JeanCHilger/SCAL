Detection of Salmonella typhi protein antigen in serum and urine: a value for diagnosis of typhoid fever in an endemic area. Using haemoculture as the gold standard, a double antibody sandwich ELISA for the detection of Salmonella typhi Barber protein antigen (BP) was compared with the Widal test. Specimens used were serum and urine obtained from normal healthy individuals and from patients with typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, pyrexia caused by other bacteria and pyrexia with negative haemoculture. The ELISA for antigenuria gave a significantly higher sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive predictive value than the Widal test (p less than 0.05). The ELISA for antigenaemia gave a significantly higher sensitivity and positive predictive value only. All other values were not significantly different. The timing of specimen collection was critical for sensitivity in the ELISA for antigenaemia and antigenuria, and the best results could be obtained by carrying out both assays simultaneously. The clearance of BP from serum into urine occurred around 16 days after the onset of fever in one patient. In two patients, BP could be detected in sera up to 3 weeks after the onset of fever. In two patients, serum BP could still be detected although haemoculture was negative.
