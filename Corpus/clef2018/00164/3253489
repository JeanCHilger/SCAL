Ocimum sanctum--a preliminary study evaluating its immunoregulatory profile in albino rats. A methanol extract and an aqueous suspension of Ocimum sanctum leaves were investigated for their immunoregulatory profile to antigenic challenge of Salmonella typhosa and sheep erythrocytes by quantifying agglutinating antibodies employing the Widal agglutination and sheep erythrocyte agglutination tests and E-rosette formation in albino rats. The data of the study indicate an immunostimulation of humoral immunologic response as represented by an increase in antibody titre in both the Widal and sheep erythrocyte agglutination tests as well as by the cellular immunologic response represented by E-rosette formation and lymphocytosis. The results of the study indicate an immunostimulant capability for Ocimum sanctum which may be contributory in explaining the adaptogenic action of the plant.
