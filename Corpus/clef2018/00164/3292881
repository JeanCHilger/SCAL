Mycotic aneurysm of the thoracic aorta caused by Salmonella typhimurium. A fatal case of mycotic aneurysm of the thoracic aorta is described. Salmonella typhimurium was isolated from blood cultures and from cultures of a post-mortem sample of the aneurysm. A review of the literature showed that while endovascular infection is a recognized complication of salmonellal septicaemia in the elderly, infection of the thoracic aorta by Salmonella spp. is rare. A combination of surgery and antibiotic therapy always is required for a successful outcome.
