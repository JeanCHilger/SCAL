Salmonella bacteremia and generalized cryptococcosis, a double indicator of African AIDS. A male Rwandese adult with proven A.I.D.S. died from generalized cryptococcosis six months after episodes of recurrent fever with isolation of Salmonella enteritidis from the blood culture. The authors discuss the frequent and precocious appearance of Salmonella septicaemia in patients with A.I.D.S. They propose the inclusion of nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteraemia in the provisional W.H.O. case definition of adult A.I.D.S. in countries with limited diagnostic resources.This work argues that nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia should be included in the provisional World Health Organization case definition of adult AIDS for countries with limited diagnostic resources.  The case is described of a 50-year-old-man from Rwanda with proven AIDS who died from generalized cryptococcosis 6 months after episodes of recurrent fever during which Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from blood cultures.  3 months after the initial hospitalization with Salmonella bacteremia a positive hemoculture for Cryptococcus neoformans was obtained, and subsequent ELISA and immunofluorescence tests for AIDS were positive.  Adult nontyphoidal Salmonella septicemia affects weakened subjects suffering from deficits of cellular immunity:  leukemia, lymphoma, malignant tumors, or treatment with corticoid or other immunosuppressive medications.  Numerous publications have drawn attention to the association of Salmonellosis and AIDS.  Most of the authors observed the salmonelloses in AIDS patients were recurrent, and some recommended uninterrupted antibacterial treatment for such cases.  Several authors mentioned the early character of Salmonella, which often appeared before the 4 opportunistic infections recognized in the WHO definition of AIDS.
