Isolation of Salmonellae from streams in and about Ankara (author's transl). S.typhimurium, S.paratyphi B, S.typhi were isolated from 132 samples, collected from sewage of eight different regions, by using selenit F, Wilson Blair and Mac Conkey media. Isolations were done in September, October, November and December. The isolations were 53% positive in these months. It was seen that S.typhimurium was dominant in Ankara and Widal reaction has to be concidered.
