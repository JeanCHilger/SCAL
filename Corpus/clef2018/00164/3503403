Serodiagnosis of typhoid fever in paediatric patients by anti-LPS ELISA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis showed that up to 50% of the anti-typhoid antibody in sera from blood culture positive paediatric typhoid fever patients is directed against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen. Anti-Salmonella typhi LPS ELISA was therefore compared to Widal agglutination for serodiagnosis of typhoid fever in paediatric patients. Sera from 38 paediatric control individuals were ELISA negative for anti-S. typhi LPS IgG all but 2 of these specimens were negative for anti-S. typhi LPS IgM. Paediatric patients hospitalized with signs and symptoms of typhoid fever were separated into 4 groups and tested by ELISA with the following results: 46 patients negative by both culture and Widal agglutination tests, 48% positive for anti-S. typhi LPS IgG and 35% for anti-S. typhi LPS IgM
