Acute autonomic neuropathy with Salmonella typhi infection. A case report. Acute autonomic neuropathy is a well-described clinical entity that is easy to diagnose with appropriate bedside tests. This condition is described in a patient who had a concurrent Salmonella typhi infection. The relationship between the two conditions is not entirely clear, but the simultaneous disappearance of the S. typhi from stool, the drop in Widal titres and rather early recovery of the autonomic neuropathy tend to implicate S. typhi as the causative agent.
