Predicting enteric fever without bacteriological culture results. We used Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of enteric fever in 260 patients presenting with undiagnosed fever, without recourse to blood or stool culture results. These individuals were divided into 110 patients with enteric fever (63 culture positive, 47 culture negative) and 150 patients with other causes of fever. Comparison of the frequencies of occurrence of 19 clinical and laboratory events, said to be helpful in the diagnosis of enteric fever, in the two groups revealed that only 8 events were significantly more frequent in enteric fever. These were: a positive Widal test at a screening dilution of 1:40 a peak temperature greater than = 39 degrees C
