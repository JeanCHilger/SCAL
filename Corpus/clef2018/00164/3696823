Diagnostic value of the Widal test in childhood typhoid fever. The usefulness of the Widal test in diagnosing childhood typhoid fever in endemic areas was investigated. The test was done on 150 children with other febrile illnesses and 98 bacteriologically proved cases of typhoid fever. Of the 150 children with nontyphoidal fever, only one had an H agglutinin titer of 1:50. Using an H or O agglutinin titer of 1:50 or more as a criterion for diagnosis, a positive Widal test was found in 88% of typhoid fever cases on the first occasion on which the test was done. If the test was repeated at least 94% of the typhoid cases had a significant result. The Widal test is a useful diagnostic test in children in endemic areas, provided interpretation of the test is made against background information relating to agglutinin levels in normal children in the region.
