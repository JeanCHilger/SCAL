Psittacosis in the RSA. Patients usually provisionally diagnosed as having typhoid fever or pneumonia are regularly admitted to the Rietfontein Fever Hospital suffering from psittacosis. The main symptoms are intense headache, chills and fever and an irritating non-productive cough. Later most patients develop signs of pneumonitis most clearly seen on radiographic examination. An important clue to the diagnosis is a history of contact with birds, most often budgerigars and more recently cockatiels. The diagnosis may be confirmed by the isolation of Chlamydia psittaci, the causative organism, but more usually reliance is placed on the results of serological tests revealing the development of chlamydial antibodies. None of the patients in this series developed serious complications, but if not treated psittacosis sufferers may develop severe pneumonitis, hepatitis and gastro-enteritis the mortality rate is up to 20%. A rare but fatal complication is chlamydial endocarditis, presenting with the signs and symptoms of subacute bacterial endocarditis, but giving repeated negative blood cultures. The illness responds specifically to treatment with tetracycline antibiotics within 48 hours. Chlamydial infections are widespread among avian species. In the RSA most cases of psittacosis have resulted from contact with budgerigars and cockatiels, but outbreaks have been associated with imported batches of birds including South American parrots and Australian finches, emphasizing the need for vigilance at seaports.
