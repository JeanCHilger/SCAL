Typhoid fever in children in Tunisian rural areas. Epidemiologic and clinical study. Based on 140 cases of typhoid fever observed in the pediatrics service of the Menzel Bourguiba hospital (Tunisia), the authors demonstrate that such an endemic disease still exists in rural areas, with a peak during autumn-winter season. They underline the importance of the contamination due to water. The disease strikes all groups of age. Infants represent 15% of the patients. On its clinical and biological aspect, the disease is significantly different in child or infant. Blood cultures are positive in 2/3 of the cases, while fecal cultures are positive only in 1/3 of the cases. Despite some complications occurring in 1/6 of the cases, evolution is generally favourable. However, infant septicemia is severe, causing death in 1/3 of the cases.
