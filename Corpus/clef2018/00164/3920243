Comparison of a latex agglutination procedure with the microimmunofluorescence test for Rickettsia typhi. Sera submitted to the Texas Department of Health for the serodiagnosis of Rickettsia typhi were tested by the microimmunofluorescent antibody technique and a new latex agglutination procedure. Results indicated that the latex agglutination test was sensitive and specific and would serve well as a first-line screening test for murine typhus.
