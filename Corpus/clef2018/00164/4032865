Typhoid enteric perforations. Forty-five cases of typhoid enteric perforation are presented. The disease was most common in young males. Half of the perforations occurred during the second week of fever. Diagnosis was mainly clinical, supplemented by radiological evidence of pneumoperitoneum and confirmed at laparotomy by the presence of perforations in the terminal ileum. Laboratory investigations including Widal perforations in the terminal ileum. Laboratory investigations including Widal test and blood culture were of little value. All the 45 were managed operatively by simple closure of the perforation(s) and drainage of the peritoneal cavity. Burst abdomen occurred in 9 per cent and fecal fistula in 20 per cent. Overall mortality was 11 per cent--much lower than that reported in the literature in case of management of typhoid enteric perforations.
