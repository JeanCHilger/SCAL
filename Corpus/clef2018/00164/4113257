Microantiglobulin test for detecting Salmonella typhimurium agglutinins. A sensitive antiglobulin (AG) test procedure for the demonstration and experimental study of the agglutinin response of chickens infected orally with Salmonella typhimurium is described. A tetrazolium-stained S. typhimurium antigen was employed with microagglutination techniques and equipment for the first time in conducting the AG test. Results with the conventional macroscopy tube agglutination test for S. typhimurium and the 24-hr microtest were comparable however, the AG test enhanced titers as much as 16 times, and these persisted at a significant level for as long as 4 months. This study is being extended to other Salmonella serotypes and possible field applications of the AG test procedure.
