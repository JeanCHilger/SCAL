Typhoid fever in young children. One hundred and fifty cases of typhoid in infants and young children are reported. In children over 5 years of age the features resembled those in adults, but in those under this age they were often nonspecific including fever, convulsions, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Attention is drawn to the importance of a blood culture in anaemic afebrile children who develop rigors and high fever after blood transfusions.
