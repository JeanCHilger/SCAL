Myocarditis caused by Salmonella typhimurium. A 53-year-old man died on the eight day of an acute enteritis caused by Salmonella typhimurium. Clinical signs of shock were pronounced the electrocardiogram, initially not pathological, showed a peripheral low voltage with decreased R-amplitudes and distinct disturbances in repolarization. Laboratory findings demonstrating Salmonella typhimurium in blood cultures and stools and 45% band forms in the differential count were remarkable. The autopsy showed deep, fibrin-covered ulcera in the colon area and a dense submucous lympho-histiocyte cell infiltration. Histologically, a granulomatous myocarditis of the left ventricle with lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration and a focal myolysis was observed. In the right ventricle, however, only a minimal interstitial edema was found.
