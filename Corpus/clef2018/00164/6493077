Antibody titers in the serum of patients suspected of typhoid using the classical Widal and microagglutination tests. Blood serum samples taken from typhoid fever suspected patients during the last typhoid fever epidemic in Ankara in 1981 were tested comparatively with classical Gruber-Widal test and microagglutination technique using safranin-stained Salmonella typhi O and H antigens. Results showed that microagglutination technique was more reliable, less time and antigen consuming and permitted a more objective evaluation of agglutinin titers.
