Diagnosis of typhoid fever by indirect hemagglutination with lyophilized cells. An IHA test using stable sensitized red cells was developed for diagnosis of typhoid fever. The antibodies to LPS and CB coated cells were measured in 39 patients with typhoid fever and 79 healthy controls. The diagnostic titer greater than or equal to 1:80 of HA-LPS and Widal reaction and greater than or equal to 1 : 320 of HA-CB were considered significant. It was found that either IHA or Widal test gave the same degree of sensitivity capable of diagnosing 87.2% of patients with typhoid fever. Antigenicities of lyophilized sensitized cells were retained for at least 6 months of preservation.
