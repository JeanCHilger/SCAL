Enteric infections by Salmonella: occurrence of positive blood cultures, positive urine cultures and high antibody titres (author's transl). In the last two decades the classic typhoid and paratyphoid A and B became rare also in Istria being substituted by infections of salmonellas of the "minor group". Basing on observations on 418 patients (1970-1979) it was established that in 48.5% of them a significant increase of titers of antibodies, not only for group antigens but also for phasis antigens developed. This, together with positive hemocultures and urine cultures in a number of them, did lead the authors to the conclusion that the invasitivity of these salmonellas (e.g. S. enteritidis, typhi murium, hadar, agona, abony) is greater than previously presumed and that the diagnosis "Salmonella-Fever" or "Paratyphoid" also in infections of these salmonellas is more justified.
