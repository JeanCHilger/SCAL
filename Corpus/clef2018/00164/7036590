Towards serodiagnosis of Serratia marcescens infections: examination of sera from noninfected patients and from experimentally infected rabbits for anti-H and anti-O antibodies S. marcescens O-antigen cross-reactions with those of other enterobacteriaceae. Sera from 100 patients not infected with Serratia marcescens at the time of hospital admission lacked detectable H-immobilizing antibodies against all 20 currently recognized H-antigens of this microorganism. However, various patient sera revealed elevated titers of O-agglutinins against several of the 20 O-antigens of S. marcescens, in a particular O-antigens, O1, O3, O4, O5, O7, O8, O10, O11, O16, O17, O18, O19, and O20. Rabbit anti-Shigella serogroup B immune serum cross-reacted with S. marcescens O-antigens O1 and O10 anti-Shigella serogroup C serum cross-reacted weakly with S. marcescens O-antigen O8. Conversely, rabbit anti-S. marcescens O1 and O10 immune sera cross-reacted with a clinical isolate of Shigella flexneri. None of the anti-S. marcescens O1-O20 rabbit immune sera reacted with commercial febrile antigens of Salmonella serogroups A, B, C1,2, D, E1,2,3,4, Brucella abortus, Francisella tularensis, and Proteus OX19. However, a reference strain of Salmonella typhi (9
