Stress-inducible gene of Salmonella typhimurium identified by arbitrarily primed PCR of RNA. Fingerprinting of RNA by arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP) can be used to identify conditionally expressed genes in prokaryotes. Differential gene expression in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 in response to peroxide treatment was examined as a system in which to demonstrate this strategy. This treatment models the induction of bacterial protective proteins that may occur when mammalian phagocytes use peroxide to fight S. typhimurium infection. To identify genes inducible by hydrogen peroxide stress, total RNA from peroxide-treated and untreated bacterial cultures were RAP fingerprinted with six different arbitrarily selected primers. A 435-base RAP product that was differentially amplified by RAP using the reverse sequencing primer was cloned and sequenced. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the RNA corresponding to this clone, RSP435, was induced when bacteria were treated with hydrogen peroxide. The RNA was not induced in an oxyR1 mutant that constitutively expressed a subset of hydrogen peroxide-inducible genes. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and dot blot hybridization to an array of induced Mud-P22 integrations, the gene corresponding to RSP435 was mapped to two places, one between 19 and 21.5 min and one between 56 and 57 min. Thus, two similar or identical stress-inducible genes were found in different parts of the genome. Identification, cloning, and mapping of the conditionally expressed RSP435 cDNA were performed entirely by physical means, demonstrating that the strategy should complement genetic methods for many prokaryotic or archaebacterial systems and should be applicable to organisms in which genetic methods are difficult to perform or have not yet been developed.
