Structure/function analysis of the periplasmic histidine-binding protein. Mutations decreasing ligand binding alter the properties of the conformational change and of the closed form. The periplasmic histidine-binding protein, HisJ, is a receptor for the histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium. Receptors of this type are composed of two lobes that are far apart in the unliganded structure (open conformation) and drawn close together in the liganded structure (closed conformation). The binding of the ligand, in a cleft between the lobes, stabilizes the closed conformation. Such receptors have several functions in transport: interaction with the membrane-bound complex, transmission of a transmembrane signal to hydrolyze ATP, and receiving a signal to open the lobes and release the ligand. In this study the mechanism of action of HisJ was further investigated using mutant proteins defective in ligand binding activity and closed form-specific monoclonal antibodies (Wolf, A., Shaw, E. W., Nikaido, K., and Ames G. F.-L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23051-23058). Y14H is defective in stabilization of the closed form, does not assume the closed empty form, and assumes an altered closed liganded form. T121A and G119R are similar to Y14H, but assume a normal closed liganded form. S72P binds the ligand to the open form, but does not assume a recognizable closed form. S92F is defective in the ability to undergo conformational change and to stabilize the closed form. All other mutant proteins appear to fall within one of these four categories. The biochemical characterization of these mutant proteins agrees with the structural analysis of the protein. We suggest that mutant proteins that do not assume the normal closed form, in addition to their defect in ligand binding, fail to interact with the membrane-bound complex and/or to transmit transmembrane signals.
