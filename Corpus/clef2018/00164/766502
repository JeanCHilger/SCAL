Salmonella typhimurium masked as an Enterobacter species (author's transl). A bacterial strain at first sight appearing to be an Enterobacter species causing enteritis could be identified as Salmonella typhimurium showing only a low formation of H2S. This small degree of H2S formation could not be demonstrated on commercial media ready for use. The high antibiotics resistance of the strain in question points to the possibility of its having undergone several antibiotics passages without recognition. Thus, serological verification is recommended in the case of so-called Enterobacter species appearing as agents of enteritis.
