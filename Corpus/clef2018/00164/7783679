Serological studies of the antigenic similarity between typhus group rickettsiae and Weil-Felix test antigens. The sera from two patients with murine typhus reacted with whole cells of Rickettsia prowazekii, R. typhi, and Proteus vulgaris OX19, and with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the spotted fever group rickettsia strain TT-118 and P. vulgaris OX19 in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sera from these patients reacted with ladder-like bands of LPS from R. prowazekii and R. typhi in the immunoblot, whereas the reactivity of these sera with LPS from P. vulgaris OX19 differed from each other. These results indicate that LPS from the typhus group rickettsiae and P. vulgaris OX19 contain similar epitopes.
