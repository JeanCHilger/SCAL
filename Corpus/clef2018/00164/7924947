Lumbar spondylodiscitis caused by Salmonella enteritidis. A 19-year-old boy developed paravertebral muscular pain in the lumbar region after an episode of extremely arduous sporting activity, with fever followed by meningism. The cerebrospinal fluid showed a reactive pleocytosis. Initially, no acute inflammatory changes were present on serum and blood analysis, although the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was moderately increased to 25/60 mm. Pyrexia of up to 38.5 degrees C developed 6 days after admission. Because Borrelia IgM and IgG titres were positive, the diagnosis was at first thought to be atypical borreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics. However, after a further episode of fever. Salmonella antibody titres, which had initially been normal, rose to 1: 3200 (Salmonella typhi O and H antigens) and 1: 12800 (Salmonella enteritidis, H antigen). At this stage, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate rose to 86/120 mm and the C-reactive protein to 77 mg/dl. The white cell count remained normal throughout. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. Abnormalities on bone scintigraphy were confirmed by CT and MRI scans, showing spondylodiscitis of lumbar vertebrae 1 and 2 with limited osteolysis. The lesion resolved completely on 6 week's treatment with ciprofloxacin (200 mg twice a day intravenously) and conservative supportive treatment. Spondylodiscitis is an uncommon complication of salmonellosis and may occur long after the diarrhoea. Cross reactions with Borrelia flagellin antigens may lead to the wrong diagnosis being made.
