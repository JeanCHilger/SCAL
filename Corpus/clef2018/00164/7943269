Endotoxin tolerance is associated with decreased prostaglandin H synthases-1 and -2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces macrophage protein and eicosanoid synthesis. Previous studies have shown that LPS induction of eicosanoid metabolism is transcription dependent and that prostaglandin (PG) H synthase is the committed step in the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to thromboxane (Tx) B2. LPS tolerance induced by sublethal in vivo injections of LPS renders rats resistant to LPS in vivo and macrophages refractory to LPS-stimulated eicosanoid synthesis in vitro. This study examined potential activity and content changes in constitutive and mitogen inducible PGH synthase in LPS-stimulated control and tolerant macrophages. TxB2 levels were measured to evaluate basal PGH synthase activity and stimulation by Salmonella enteritidis LPS (50 micrograms/ml), calcium ionophore A-23187, and AA. All tolerant macrophage groups demonstrated decreased TxB2 synthesis. TxB2 synthesis stimulated by AA in tolerant cells was decreased by 70% (P < 0.05) compared with control macrophages. In subsequent studies changes in PGH synthase content were examined in rat peritoneal macrophages from tolerant and control rats incubated with and without LPS. Immunoblot analysis of PGH synthase-1 (constitutive) demonstrated no increase in cells stimulated with LPS compared with basal but was diminished by 62 +/- 9% (n = 4, P < 0.05) in tolerant macrophages compared with control cells. Immunoblot analysis of PGH synthase-2 (mitogen inducible) demonstrated induction in response to LPS that was maximal between 12 and 24 h. PGH synthase-2 was also induced in tolerant macrophages in response to LPS but was less than in control cells. The results demonstrate that endotoxin tolerance is associated with reduced activity and content of PGH synthase-1 and a decreased LPS induction of PGH synthase-2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
