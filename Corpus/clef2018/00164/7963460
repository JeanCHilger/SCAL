Salmonella bacteraemia in sickle cell disease at King's College Hospital: 1976-1991. A review of all blood culture isolates for the 16 years from 1976 were collated with prospective laboratory and clinical records of 620 sickle cell patients treated at King's College Hospital. Over half of all salmonella bacteraemias diagnosed in the clinical laboratory occurred in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Of 21 bacteraemias in SCD patients, 11 (52.3%) were due to Salmonella spp. compared with 23 (0.4%) of 4884 bacteraemias in patients without SCD (P = < 0.00001). In SCD, Gram-negative bacilli were responsible for 16 (76.2%) bacteraemias, of which 11 (68.8%) were due to Salmonella spp. but there were no cases of S. typhi or S. paratyphi. An increase in the number of salmonella infections over the past 5 years were noted in the SCD and non-SCD patients, nine and 16 cases respectively, compared with two and seven cases in the previous decade. However, the recent increase of S. enteritidis phage type 4 in the UK was not evident in SCD patients. These findings have important preventative and therapeutic implications for the management of SCD patients.
