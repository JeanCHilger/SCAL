Primary bacterial aneurysm of the aorta. 4 cases. The causal agent was a Salmonella in three cases and a Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in one case. In these four patients there was no evidence of endocardities and the causal germ was verified by the bacteriological cultures of the anevrysmal lesions and/or by the blood cultures. In one patient full recovery was obtained by surgical repair after complete bacteriologic cure.
