Patterns of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibitors during typhoid fever. Cytokines and inhibitors in plasma were measured in 44 patients with typhoid fever. Ex vivo production of the cytokines was analyzed in a whole blood culture system with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Acute phase circulating concentrations of cytokines (+/- SD) were as follows: interleukin (IL)-1 beta, < 140 pg/mL tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), 130 +/- 50 pg/mL
