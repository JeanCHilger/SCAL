Sepsis and spondylodiscitis caused by Salmonella enteritidis. Four weeks after an attack of bronchopneumonia a 59-year-old veterinary surgeon developed backache. The chest radiograph showed an impression fracture of the 11th thoracic vertebra. Persisting fever led to hospitalization. Several blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. Computed tomography demonstrated a fracture of the 11th thoracic vertebra with osteolytic infiltration and paravertebral soft-tissue infiltration. Bone scan showed band-like contrast enhancement in the same area. Treatment at first consisted of Ciprofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily intravenously for 5 days, then 750 mg orally twice daily for 3 months. The fever regressed within a few days. Sclerosis of the affected vertebral area became radiologically evident after 6 weeks. After this the patient was allowed to move around again, without any further problems.
