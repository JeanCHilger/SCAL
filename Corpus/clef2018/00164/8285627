Interleukin-6, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor receptors in typhoid fever related to outcome of antimicrobial therapy. To study mechanisms of antibiotic effects in typhoid fever, levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and cytokine receptors (tumor necrosis factor receptor [TNF-R] p55 and TNF-R p75) were measured in the plasma of 29 adult Nepalese with culture-positive typhoid fever before therapy and on days 4 and 15 after start of therapy with either ceftriaxone at 2 g/day for 3 days or chloramphenicol at 50 mg/kg of body weight per day for 14 days. Bacteriologic cure was defined as blood cultures testing negative on days 4 and 15 after start of therapy clinical cure was defined as symptomatic improvement within 5 days after start of therapy and absence of relapse. Clinical and bacteriologic cures occurred in 24 patients. There were two clinical failures, two patients who failed to complete therapy because of leukopenia, and one relapse. Mean levels before therapy were elevated compared with those in healthy controls (IL-6, 11.4 pg/ml
