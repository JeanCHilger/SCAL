Atypical salmonellosis: two cases of sacroiliitis. Two young adult males presented with fever, severe pain, redness, swelling over the left sacroiliac joint and inability to walk and squat. A differential diagnosis of tuberculous sacroiliitis was considered. On blood culture isolation of S. Typhi in both of them was suggestive of sacroiliitis of salmonella etiology. They recovered completely following specific antibiotic therapy, aspirin and bed rest. At recovery both showed extremely high Widal titres.
