False positive modified Widal test in acute malaria. The present study reports results of modified Widal test carried out on 96 cases of acute malaria and 25 healthy controls. Out of the 96 patients studied, 30 had complicated P.falciparum (CPF), 36 had uncomplicated P.falciparum (UPF) and 30 had P.vivax (pv) malaria. Modified widal test was done to know the Widal titers due to Igm type of anti-salmonella antibodies, which is considered very specific for diagnosis of recent enteric fever. This test was positive in 14.58% and 10.41% of malaria patients for salmonella 'o' and 'H' titers respectively. On four weeks follow up most of the positive test become negative. Non-specific polyclonal B lymphocyte stimulation due to malaria was postulated to be responsible for this phenomenon.
