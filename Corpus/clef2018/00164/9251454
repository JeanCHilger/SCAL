Cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of Salmonella typhi infection (enteric fever) in adults. A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cefuroxime Axetil in enteric fever was carried out in 30 adult hospitalised patients of either sex. A positive blood culture for S. typhi and sensitivity to cefuroxime axetil were confirmed prior to treatment. On admission, the baseline signs and symptoms were recorded and treatment initiated with cefuroxime axetil in a dose of 500 mg bd which was continued for 7 days after normalization of temperature. The various clinical parameters were followed up daily during the treatment period and discharge permitted on normalization of temperature. Blood culture for S. typhi was repeated 3 days after stopping treatment. Follow-up Widal, stool and urine cultures were done wherever possible to check for relapse or carrier state. All the patients responded clinically to treatment and had bacteriologically negative blood cultures by the end of 14 days treatment. 87% of the patients responded within 7 days of treatment of which 60% were graded as Excellent responders as they responded within 4 days itself
