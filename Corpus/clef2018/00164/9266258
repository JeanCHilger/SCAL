Differential cytokine production in stimulated blood cultures from intensive care patients with bacterial infections. Mice infected with bacteria develop an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) dependent hypersensitivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial components. The broader aim of this study is to find out whether such hypersensitivity also occurs in patients suffering from bacterial infections. The capacity of stimulated peripheral blood cells from infected, intensive-care patients to produce cytokines (IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) was compared to that of healthy donors. Culturing of the cells was carried out preferentially in whole blood diluted 1:3. Whole blood cultures (WBC) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whole killed Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus and concanavalin A (ConA), and the cytokine production was determined. Two main findings emerged from this study: The IFN-gamma production by WBC of patients was, compared to healthy donors, markedly suppressed, regardless of stimulus used. Further, patients' WBC exhibited a suppressed TNF-alpha production after stimulation with LPS. Surprisingly, following stimulation with bacteria (S. typhimurium and S. aureus) an elevated TNF-alpha and IL-6 response was obtained. Thus, in severely infected patients the cytokine responses of peripheral blood cells to LPS may be suppressed, while the response to other bacterial components is enhanced.
