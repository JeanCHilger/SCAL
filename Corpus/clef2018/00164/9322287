Construction of specific DNA probe for the detection of Salmonella in food. The Salmonella specific DNA fragment from genomic DNA of S. typhimurium ATCC 23566 was cloned in E. coli and successfully used as a digoxigenin labeled probe for detecting the presence of Salmonella serotypes in both artificially contaminated food and natural contaminated food samples.
