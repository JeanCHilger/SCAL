Recurrent Salmonella sepsis and aortitis in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. A 62 years old man was admitted to hospital because of fever a small superficial hepatic nodule was showed by ultrasonography. Blood cultures grew Salmonella enteritidis. Cefotaxime was administered for ten days. Fever promptly disappeared but one week later recurred with abdominal and back pain. Cultures grew again Salmonella enteritidis. Biopsy of the hepatic nodule showed hepatocarcinoma. Computed abdominal tomography showed a paraaortic mass. Angiography demonstrated hematoma communicating with the aortic lumen. The patient underwent revascularization of the involved aortic tract and resection of the hepatic nodule. Histology showed suppurative aortic endarteritis and a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with a large area of suppurative necrosis. The recovery of Salmonella species as of any uncommon bacteria from blood should warrant a through research of underlying disease, especially cancer.
