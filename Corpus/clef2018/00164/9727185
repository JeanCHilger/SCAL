Non-typhoid Salmonella gastroenteritis. To study the clinical features of non-typhoid Salmonella gastroenteritis and the incidence, risk factors and outcome of invasive complications in urban Malaysian children. To describe the serotypes of Salmonella species isolated and the pattern of antibiotic susceptibility.Retrospective review of a group of 131 children with non-typhoid Salmonella gastroenteritis seen at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from January 1994 to December 1996.Sixty-seven percent were infants below one year of age. Fever and vomiting were seen in nearly half of children. Seven children (5.3%) had invasive complications: 5 bacteraemia and 2 meningitis. Age below 6 months, fever > 38.0 degrees C, and dehydration on admission were significantly associated with invasive complications. The commonest serotypes isolated were S. enteritidis, S. paratyphi B, and S. bovis-morbificans. A total of 94-100% of isolates were susceptible to commonly prescribed antibiotics.Children with Salmonella gastroenteritis below 6 months of age who are febrile and dehydrated should be treated empirically with antibiotics until the result of blood culture is available.
