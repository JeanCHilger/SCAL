Typhoid fever in children--a retrospective study of 54 cases from Malaysia. Typhoid fever, which is endemic in Malaysia, affects all age groups and it has been stated that classical features described in textbooks were absent in children. The aim of this study was to find out whether this was true in the local setting and hence a retrospective study was undertaken.Fifty-four paediatric patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and all were seen consecutively during the study period of 10 years. Patients' records were reviewed for demographic data such as age, sex, ethnicity, clinical features, therapy and results of laboratory tests.Fever was the most common presenting symptom and diarrhoea was more common than constipation. Isolation of S typhi from blood and/or stools was the most important diagnostic tool *85.2%) and of these 99% had significant Widal titres. Clinical and bacteriological relapse occurred in 5 children (3%) who were successfully treated with ceftriaxone. The absence of mortality and low level of complications indicates either a mild nature of the disease or to early recognition or prompt and appropriate therapy.
