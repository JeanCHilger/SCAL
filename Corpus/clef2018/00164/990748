Further experience with amoxycillin in typhoid fever in children. A study of 155 children with typhoid fever proved by blood culture showed that amoxycillin was superior to chloramphenical with regard to clinical and temperature response and relapse and carrier rates. This confirmed the findings of a randomised clinical trial on 200 children with typhoid fever and lends support to the value of amoxycillin in this disease.
