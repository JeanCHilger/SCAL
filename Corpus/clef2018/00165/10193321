Chlamydia pneumoniae in atheroma: consideration of criteria for causality. (1) To seek evidence of the existence of Chlamydia pneumoniae in a spectrum of atheromatous lesions in different types of arteries from individuals of different ages, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay supported by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry (2) to use electron microscopy to examine interactions between C pneumoniae and the cells present in the arterial tissueAt necropsy examination, 35 arterial specimens were taken from 25 subjects. The grade of atheroma was determined macroscopically and microscopically and the tissues coded and examined by the three techniques.Of the 35 specimens, 24 had macroscopic or microscopic atheromatous lesions of varying degree. Twenty two of the 35 specimens were examined by electron microscopy, C pneumoniae-like bodies being found in 11 (50%) seven specimens were examined by the immunocytochemical method, positive staining being detected in threeThere is a strong correlation between C pneumoniae and arterial atheromatous lesions. The organism may contribute to the disease process by damaging smooth muscle cells.
