Seroepidemiological and molecular studies of human T cell lymphotropic virus type II, subtype b, in isolated groups of Mataco and Toba Indians of northern Argentina. We studied plasma samples from 2082 Mataco Indians living in 22 different communities in the western part of Formosa Province, northern Argentina. Samples were screened for HTLV-I/II antibodies by particle agglutination assay. All positive or borderline samples were then tested by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on C19 HTLV-II-producing cells. Western blot was used for confirmation of all IFA-positive plasma samples. The crude HTLV-II seroprevalence was 3.0% (62 of 2051), and 0.9% (5 of 588) in children less than 10 years old. The latter result suggests ongoing mother-to-child transmission, probably by breast feeding. There was a marked increase in HTLV-II seroprevalence with age (0.9%, 0-10 years 1.6%, 11-20 years
