Intracerebral tuberculomas in a pregnant Somalian woman. A pregnant Somalian woman aged 28 years, in the Netherlands for the last five years, suffered from a progressive hemiparesis, epilepsia, behavioural problems and low fever. Brain MRI showed multiple lesions with contrast enhancement. Extensive serologic and parasitologic tests on serum and cerebrospinal fluid did not disclose any cause. A brain biopsy revealed only necrosis, but bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) supplied the diagnosis of 'tuberculosis'. PCR on the cerebrospinal fluid remained negative. In the meantime the chest X-ray showed miliary tuberculosis and a spine MRI thoracic spondylodiscitis and a large paravertebral abscess. Subsequently the patient was treated successfully with tuberculostatic agents. Her healthy child which was born by caesarean section was treated with the tuberculostatic agents as well.
