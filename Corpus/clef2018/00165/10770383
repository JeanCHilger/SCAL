Renal expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and epidermal growth factor in children with obstructive hydronephrosis. The authors studied the potential role of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJ-O) in causing progressive renal damage in children through the renal expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA.Renal tissues were harvested from 11 children with UPJ-O and from 10 normal kidneys to study the renal expression of EGF and MCP-1 detected by means of in situ hybridization. Five of the patients were found to have a history of urinary tract infection (UTI).Children with UPJ-O had marked reduction of EGF gene expression when compared with controls. Interstitial expression of MCP-1 mRNA was present in all UPJ-O cases. Both EGF and MCP-1 expression did not correlate with age, with differential renal function, and with renal thickness measured through MAG3 renal scan. Children with a history of UTI had a more severe reduction of the renal thickness of the affected kidney compared with those without UTI. MCP-1 expression was higher and EGF more reduced in children with a history of UTI.Our results suggest a potential role of EGF and MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of renal damage and growth failure in UPJ-O, especially in children with UTI. These important functional changes begin early in life, possibly during fetal life.
