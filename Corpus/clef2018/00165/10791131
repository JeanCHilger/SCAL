Detection of enteroviruses in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction: prospective study of impact on the management of hospitalized children. A polymerase chain reaction kit (AMPLICOR EV) for the detection of enteroviruses (EV-PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was evaluated in clinical conditions in a prospective blinded-intention study. Forty-three children (mean age 2.7 years) hospitalized for suspected meningitis or fever of unclear etiology were enrolled. EV-PCR was performed on a daily basis. Results were available in less than 2 days in 72% of cases. EV-PCR was positive in nine (21%) children, including three infants without CSF pleocytosis. Knowing their EV-PCR result would have allowed a saving of 18 hospital days and 12 days of antibiotic therapy. The EV-PCR in the CSF can thus be practically useful for children hospitalized for meningitis or fever if available on-site on a daily basis.
