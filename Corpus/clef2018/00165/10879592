Herpesvirus DNA detection in cerebral spinal fluid: differences in clinical presentation between alpha-, beta-, and gamma-herpesviruses. To evaluate the role of 6 human herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV)) in infections of the nervous system, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 662 patients with suspected viral aetiology to neurological symptoms were investigated for presence of herpesviral DNA in a PCR-based study. Of the 69 patients (2 patients had 2 herpesvirus DNA detected in CSF) who had herpesvirus DNA detected in the CSF, 60 (87%) were non-immunocompromised (CMV 7 HHV-6 6
