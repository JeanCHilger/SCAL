Analysis of human rotavirus G serotype in Bangladesh by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction. Distribution of human rotavirus G serotype was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with faecal specimens obtained from children with diarrhoea in Bangladesh. By ELISA, subgroup and G serotype were determined for 59.5% and 28.6% of group A rotavirus-positive specimens respectively. However, of the 120 specimens, the G serotype of which was not determined by ELISA, serotype of the 112 specimens was typed by PCR. In total, G serotype was assigned for 95.2% of all the specimens, showing the highest rate of G4 (41.7%), followed by G1 (23.2%) and G2 (14.9%). Twenty-four specimens showed mixed types, such as G2 with G1, G8 or G9, or G1 with G4. These results indicate that PCR combined with ELISA is highly effective for G serotyping of rotavirus.
