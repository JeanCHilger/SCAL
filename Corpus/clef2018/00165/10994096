The use of PCR analysis for the diagnosis of HIV infection in infants in the 1st months of life. In this review the data of contemporary studies of dynamic changes in serological and virological markers in the course of HIV infection in infants aged 0-18 months, aimed at finding out the comparative value of different tests made with a view to established exact diagnosis, are discussed. The results of the study of the sensitivity and specificity of the RNA and DNA polymerase chain reaction in the diagnostics of HIV infection in infants during the first months of life, as well as the recommended time of testing, have been analyzed in detail. On the basis of the data presented in this review the author has formulated the scheme of the algorithm for diagnosing HIV infection in infants born of HIV-infected mothers with the following variants of the diagnosis: "possible infection", "seroversion" (marking it possible to exclude the presence of the infection) and "HIV infection". The proposed scheme has the character of recommendation, but under the conditions of the rapid spread of HIV infection with the involvement of infants into the process this scheme may be useful in pediatric practice.
