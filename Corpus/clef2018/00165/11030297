Emerging group-A rotavirus and a nosocomial outbreak of diarrhoea. A P[6]G9 group-A rotavirus caused a protracted hospital outbreak of neonatal diarrhoea in The Netherlands. The outbreak lasted 5 months with 52 cases and an average attack rate of 40%, 46 cases were in an incubator section for neonates under 1 month of age. Rotavirus P161G9 was detected by RT-PCR in stool samples from the 31 cases tested. Emergence of this genotype in Europe may have implications for neonates lacking protective maternal antibodies and for the development of rotavirus vaccines.
