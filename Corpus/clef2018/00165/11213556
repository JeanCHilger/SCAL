Congenital infection: diagnostic serology of the mother not always definitive. In 2 infants, a girl and a boy, congenital viral infection was diagnosed in the neonatal period. The prenatal examination (serologic investigation for Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and syphilis (TORCHES)) was negative. In both cases prenatal ultrasonography was abnormal and suggested intrauterine infection. The infants were born with typical symptoms of multisystem disease, known as symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection (jaundice, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and cerebral calcifications) and congenital rubella syndrome (intrauterine growth retardation, congenital heart disease, cataract, hepatosplenomegaly and cerebral calcifications), respectively. Both had severe cerebral damage. To diagnose severe congenital infection in the first trimester of pregnancy in presence of congenital anomalies in utero there are other possible methods than TORCHES investigation, such as polymerase chain reaction and virus culture in amniotic fluid or in foetal blood obtained by cord puncture.
