Vertical transmission of HIV in New York State: a basis for statewide testing of newborns. Infants (n = 313) of HIV-infected mothers were enrolled (mean age 1.9 weeks, range 0-8 weeks) in a 3-year prospective study of vertical transmission. Fifty-six infants (17.9%) had laboratory and clinical evidence of HIV infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provided early and reliable identification of infected infants. Thirty-one of the 56 infected infants had specimens submitted when the infants were 4 weeks of age or less and 30 (97%) tested PCR positive. This percentage increased to 100% by 8 weeks of age when 51 of the 56 infected infants had specimens tested for that time period. Immune complex dissociation (ICD) antigen testing was a sensitive method for diagnosis of infection but only in infants older than 1 month. p24 antigen testing, although free of false positives, is less sensitive than either of the other methods. Among surrogate markers of HIV infection, elevation of soluble CD8 levels precedes an increase in immunoglobulin levels or a decline in CD4 T lymphocytes. Vertical transmission is significantly lower in Central and Western New York State than other regions. Transmission is significantly higher in low birthweight babies and in infants whose mothers have CD4 counts < 500. This study provided the basis for establishing a Pediatric HIV PCR Testing Service for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in neonates.
