Early diagnosis of vertical HIV infection in infants by rapid detection of immune complex-dissociated HIV p24 antigen. Conventional HIV antibody detection was problematic for diagnosis of HIV infection in young infants < 18 months of age who were born to HIV-infected mothers. The HIV p24 antigen (Ag) is mainly bound to the antibody as an immune complex which causes underdetection by conventional methods. Attempts were made to dissociate these immune complexes to release free p24 Ag for detection. The current study's objective was to evaluate the rapid assays for detection of immune complex-dissociated p24 Ag (ICD p24 Ag) for early identification of HIV-infected infants as compared to the detection of HIV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The ICD was performed by acid dissociation and heat-denatured dissociation, and then the released ICD p24 Ag were detected. Tested were 41 HIV-infected children who acquired the infection perinatally and who had positive PCR and 30 HIV noninfected children with negative PCR. The overall sensitivity of the ICD p24 Ag detection after acid- and heat-denatured dissociation in the infected children was 85.4% and 87.8%, respectively, compared to 34.2% of p24 Ag without pretreatment for dissociation of the serum samples. The specificity of nonimmune complex dissociation and both methods of immune complex dissociation test were 100%. The sensitivity of ICD-p24 Ag test using these two methods showed excellent agreement (K = 0.893). Besides the relatively high sensitivity and specificity of the ICD p24 Ag test, its advantages include simplicity, rapidity, and relatively low cost--indicating ICD p24 Ag detection as a promising method for early diagnosis of vertical HIV infection in infants.
