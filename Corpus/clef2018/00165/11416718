Predictors of intrauterine and intrapartum transmission of HIV-1 among Tanzanian women. To examine predictors of vertical transmission of HIV-1 in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.Observational design.Consenting HIV-1-infected pregnant women (n = 1078) were enrolled in a trial to examine the role of vitamin supplements. Intrauterine HIV-1 infection (HIV-positive at birth) intrapartum and early breastfeeding transmission (HIV-positive at 6 weeks among those uninfected at birth) were defined using the PCR.Of 734 infants who had a specimen taken at birth, 62 were HIV positive [8.4% 95% confidence interval (CI),6.4--10.5%], whereas 59 infants were positive among 367 infants who were uninfected at birth and were retested at 6 weeks (16.1%Reducing prematurity, rate of HIV disease progression, and maternal viral load at or after delivery could help to reduce vertical transmission. Treatment of sexually transmitted infections at onset of prenatal care, about 20 weeks on average, was inadequate for prevention of transmission. Whether sustained clearance of lower genital tract infections result in reduced transmission remains to be determined.
