Cytomegalovirus infection: congenital or postnatally acquired? Importance of the Guthrie card. A girl aged 4 weeks had persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, haematological abnormalities and hepatosplenomegalia due to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection thereafter she had a psychomotoric retardation. A girl aged 6 months had psychomotoric retardation and microcephaly due to a CMV infection, with epilepsy and perception deafness. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV-DNA in the blood on the Guthrie card demonstrated retrospectively in both cases that the infection was congenital. A 4-month-old boy had parents who had both experienced a CMV infection around the birth of the child. The child was infected with CMV but the absence of CMV-DNA in the blood on the Guthrie card revealed that the infection was not congenital. Only 10% of infants with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth
