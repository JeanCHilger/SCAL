Timing and interpretation of tests for diagnosing perinatally acquired hepatitis C virus infection. The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children born to HCV-infected women is based on serologic assays and HCV RNA measurement by PCR. Interpretation of the results of these tests is hampered by uncertainty about the age distribution of loss of maternal antibody and the sensitivity and specificity of PCR at different ages. On the basis of findings from a recent vertical transmission study, we estimated the posttest probability of a child's being infected or uninfected under several test result scenarios. These estimates may assist clinicians in assessing the likelihood of infection in an individual child and in using the currently available assays cost effectively.
