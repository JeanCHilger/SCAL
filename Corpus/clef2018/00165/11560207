Intrapartum zidovudine infusion alone failed to reduce both maternal HIV-1 viral load and HIV-1 infection in infant. A pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy of intrapartum zidovudine (ZDV) infusion alone in the reduction of maternal viral load and its potential role in preventing vertical transmission of HIV-1. Twenty six, asymptomatic antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected pregnant women who had no prior antenatal care and were in labor were enrolled. Each patient received ZDV infusion at the rate of 2 mg/kg within the first hour. ZDV was then continuously infused at 1 mg/kg/h until delivery. Maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA prior to the commencement of ZDV infusion and within an hour after delivery were measured. HIV-1 transmission was documented by nested polymerase chain reaction in infants at six months of age. Median maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA prior to the ZDV infusion and after delivery was 29,401 and 32,555 copies/ml respectively, (p>0.05). The estimated HIV-1 transmission rate was 19.2 per cent (95% CI = 4-34). This result suggested that in asymptomatic HIV-1 infected pregnant women who were antiretroviral naïve and had no prior antenatal care, intrapartum ZDV infusion alone failed to reduce maternal HIV-1 viremia and the transmission rate of HIV-1.
