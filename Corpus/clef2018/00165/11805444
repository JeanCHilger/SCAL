Three cases with TT virus infection and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. We present three cases of infants with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis showing diffuse intrahepatic fatty degeneration. Prolonged cholestasis has improved immediately upon intravenous administration of a high-dose gammaglobulin treatment in all three patients. The TT virus (TTV) genome was detectable in the serum of two patients, in the duodenal fluid of one and in the liver of all three. By analyzing sequence homology, we observed that the respective TTV isolated from serum, duodenal fluid and liver tissue were completely identical in cases 2 and 3. These findings suggest that TTV infection was one of the contributing factors for neonatal cholestasis in these patients. TTV was isolated from the serum of two out of the three mothers. The viruses were either completely or almost identical in sequence to those isolated from their respective infants, suggesting that they had been transmitted from mother to infant in these 2 cases. The patients presented here, whose livers were infected with the TTV and showed a favorable response to gammaglobulin therapy, may represent a subset of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis patients.
