Neonatal enterovirus myocarditis. Enterovirus infections in neonates are difficult to diagnose. Diphasic pattern and possibly fatal myocarditis must be anticipated.A 14-day-old girl had presented a heart failure after an initial episode of gastroenteritis and supraventricular tachycardia. Investigation demonstrated global myocardial dysfunction. Diagnosis of neonatal enterovirus myocarditis was made by polymerase chain reaction detection of viral genome. Heart failure was controlled with medical treatment.Enterovirus myocarditis is typically a biphasic illness. Rapid diagnosis of enteroviral infection in neonatal period may be made by polymerase chain reaction detection of viral genome. There is anecdoctal evidence that immunoglobulin infusions may improve outcome.
