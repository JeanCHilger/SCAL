Human adenovirus and human cytomegalovirus infections in preterm newborns: no association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Connatal infection with human adenovirus (HAdV) has been recently proposed as a cofactor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants [Couroucli et al. 2000 Pediatr Res 47:225-232]. In another study, BPD was associated with an increased incidence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection [Sawyer et al. 1987 Am J Dis Child 141:303-305]. During a 18-mo study period, we investigated tracheal aspirates or pharyngeal aspirates and urine samples collected during the first month of life from 66 preterm newborns with very low birth weight (< or =1.500 g) for replication-potent HAdV as well as for adenoviral and HCMV DNA by virus culture and qualitative DNA PCR. Thus, our study included not only prenatal but also peri- and postnatal infections. Thirty-seven percent (24/66) of infants developed BPD(1), as defined by persistent oxygen dependency at day 28 of life. Replication-potent HAdV and/or adenoviral DNA could be detected repeatedly in tracheal aspirates/pharyngeal aspirates and/or urine from 20% (13/66) of preterm infants. Seventeen percent (4/24) of infants in the BPD(1) group and 21% (9/42) of infants in the non-BPD group had an HAdV infection, indicating that in our study the very recently proposed association between HAdV infection of the lung and BPD could not be confirmed. For comparison, active HCMV infection was diagnosed in 18% (12/66) of infants, 3 of which developed HCMV disease. 29% (7/24) in the BPD(1) group and 12% (5/42) in the non-BPD group were positive for HCMV. Again, there was no statistically significant association between HCMV infection and BPD. In summary, our findings indicate that HAdV and HCMV infection are frequent in preterm newborns with very low birth weight however, a causal association with the development of BPD seems unlikely.
