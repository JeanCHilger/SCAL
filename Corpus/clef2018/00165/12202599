Direct PCR detection of Burkholderia cepacia complex and identification of its genomovars by using sputum as source of DNA. We developed a nested PCR assay that detects the recA gene of the Burkholderia cepacia complex in sputum. The product of the first PCR round is also used to identify the genomovar of the pathogen. The protocol achieves high sensitivity and specificity with simple interpretation of genomovar status.
