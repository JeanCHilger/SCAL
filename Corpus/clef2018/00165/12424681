Burden of disease in hospitalized RSV-positive children in Germany. In spite of a large amount of data from other countries, those on the burden of disease attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Germany are lacking and are urgently needed.In a population-based cross-sectional study from July 1996 to June 1999 150 children from birth to 16 years of age hospitalized in Kiel and tested positive for RSV by polymerase chain reaction were investigated. Stepwise linear and logistic regression models were applied to predict a bacterial co-infection as well as the duration of hospitalization.Pneumonia (54 %) and wheezing bronchitis (including bronchiolitis, 27 %) were the predominating diagnoses 25 % had an underlying condition. Four patients needed nasal continuous airway pressure and one intermittent mandatory ventilationBacterial co-infection is the major confounder in burden of disease analyses in RSV. The decision not to administer antibiotics to children hospitalized with RSV can be risky, particularly when there is considerable diagnostic uncertainty. Within the realm of current clinical practice, complications and deaths related to RSV are rare in Germany.
