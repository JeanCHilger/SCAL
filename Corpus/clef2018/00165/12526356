The relation of neonatal hyaline membrane disease and congenital human cytomegalovirus infection. To study the relation of neonatal hyaline membrane disease (HMD) and congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, two pairs of primers were synthesized according to the sequence of HCMV conserved region of the immediate--early(IE) gene. The nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) was used for the detection of HCMV-DNA of the paraffin-embedded lung tissues from neonatal HMD and non-neonatal HMD. 11 of 30 neonatal HMD patients were positive, the positive rate was 36.7%. Specimens of non-neonatal HMD patients were all negative. The difference between the two groups was significant (chi 2 = 5.05, P < 0.025). There is close relationship between neonatal HMD and congenital HCMV infection.
