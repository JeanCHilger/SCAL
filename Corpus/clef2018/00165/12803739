HIV transmission through breastfeeding: problems and prevention. The greatest burden of HIV infection in women and their children is disproportionately borne by the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Breastfeeding is a major health-promoting factor for infants and children in developing countries but the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV by this route is challenging traditional practices and health policies in low-resource countries. Maternal and infant factors contributing to the risk of MTCT through breastfeeding are still poorly understood and not well researched. Factors identified include: advanced clinical stages of infection in the mother high maternal plasma HIV-1 load
