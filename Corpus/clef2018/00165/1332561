Failure to detect vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus. To search for transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) from infected mothers to their infants.Prospective clinical, serologic, and molecular biologic follow-up (at least 3 months) of the infants of mothers with anti-HCV antibody.A county hospital providing primary and referral care in high-risk obstetrics (perinatology).Twenty-three mothers with anti-HCV antibody and their 24 infants.An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) and a four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) were used to test for anti-HCV antibody serum HCV RNA was measured in two independent laboratories by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using nested primers in the 5'-noncoding region. Infant samples were tested for HCV RNA by PCR at delivery and after 3 to 6 months of follow-up. Each sample was tested at least four times in two independent laboratories.Twenty-nine of 648 mothers (4.5% 95% Cl, 3.0% to 6.4%) had anti-HCV antibodyInfant anti-HCV antibody is most likely acquired passively in utero, and vertical transmission of HCV is uncommon.
