Intestinal obstruction caused by congenital cytomegalovirus infection: report of a case. We report a case of coexistent congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with pseudo-Hirschsprung's disease in a female infant born at 39 weeks' gestation. The serologic data, urinary viral culture, and gene expression by in situ hybridization all suggested a CMV infection, and the pathologic findings of resected bowel specimens showed aganglionosis. Thus, congenital CMV infection may be etiologically associated with Hirschsprung's disease in some children.
