Development of a multiple PCR method for the identification of Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Ureaplasma parvum and Ureaplasma urealyticum, also known as biovar parvum and biovar T960, respectively, could be associated with several disorders in men, women, and mainly, in newborn children with under weight. Several methods have been developed in order to identify the species or biovars of ureaplasmas. We developed a Multiplex-PCR method using the UPS-UPSA and UUS2-UUA2 primers, specific for U. parvum and U. urealyticum, respectively. This Multiplex-PCR method was used to identify cultures of clinical positive samples to Ureaplasma spp. by the "MYCOFAST Evolution-2" Kit. Of 56 positive cultures to Ureaplasma spp. from newborn children, 70% were U. parvum and 30% U. urealyticum in 76 positive samples in women, 83% corresponded to U. parvum and 17% to U. urealyticum, while in 63 positive samples of men, 76% identified U. parvum and 24% U. urealyticum. The PCR-multiplex method showed specificity for the identification of the biovars or species of ureaplasmas of clinical interest.
