HIV-1 viral load and other risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in a breast-feeding population in Cote d'Ivoire. Short-course antiretroviral regimens have been evaluated to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV in resource-limited settings. This report from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, examines the risk factors for HIV transmission by 1 and 24 months among breast-feeding women. Eligible HIV-1-seropositive pregnant women enrolled in this randomized double-blind clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive either oral zidovudine (ZDV) (n = 126) prophylaxis or placebo (n = 124). Maternal prophylaxis began at 36 weeks of gestation (300 mg ZDV twice daily antepartum and 300 mg every 3 hours intrapartum) there was no neonatal prophylaxis component. The cumulative risk of transmission in the treatment group was 11.9% and 22.1% by 1 and 24 months, respectively. In adjusted analyses, viral load at enrollment was the strongest predictor of transmission (per log increment: odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-9.5 at 1 month
