Performance characteristics of HIV-1 culture and HIV-1 DNA and RNA amplification assays for early diagnosis of perinatal HIV-1 infection. A plasma HIV-1 RNA amplification assay (RNA assay), a quantitative peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) microculture (culture), and a PBMC HIV-1 DNA amplification assay (DNA assay) were compared for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants receiving zidovudine in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 185 assays were performed for all 24 infected and 100 uninfected infants. HIV-1 infection was defined as >or=2 positive cultures or positive antibody to HIV-1 at >or=18 months. Cultures were performed at birth and 6 and 24 weeks of age
