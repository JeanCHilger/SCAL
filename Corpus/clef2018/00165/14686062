Microbiological and serological diagnostic methods to detect intrauterine and perinatal infections. Due to the revolutional development in sampling devices, transport media, automated equipments, microvolume probes and molecular microbiological techniques in the last decade new possibilities have become available for diagnosing microbiologically congenital infections in both the mother and the foetus and the newborn. This minireview gives an insight into the diagnostic tuls of clinical microbiology and infection serology by showing laboratory diagnostic processes of most frequent protozoal, viral and bacterial infections step-by-step. It exhibit an almost complete list of transplacental, intrauterinal and connatal infections. Attention is also focused to the complexity of the interrelationship between the clinical microbiology and infection serology data concerning the infections of the mother and her offspring.
