Clonal and horizontal dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae expressing SHV-5 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a Mexican pediatric hospital. One hundred eighty-four clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were recovered from August 1996 to October 1997 at the Pediatric Hospital of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social in Mexico City, Mexico. Most of the isolates were collected from the neonatal intensive care unit and infant wards, which are located on the same floor of the hospital. Isolates were genotypically compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with XbaI restriction of chromosomal DNA. Of 184 clinical isolates, 91 belonged to cluster A and comprised three subtypes (A1, A2, and A3), while 93 isolates, comprising two minor clones, B (10 isolates) and C (7 isolates), and 76 unique patterns, were considered unrelated isolates (URI). Susceptibility patterns were indistinguishable in both groups. Fifty extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates, including 34 from clone A and 16 from URI, were examined for further studies. Molecular and genetic analysis showed that 47 of 50 clinical isolates expressed the SHV-5 beta-lactamase. This enzyme, in combination with TEM-1, was encoded in a >or=170-kb conjugative plasmid. Results indicate that dissemination of this resistance was due to clonal and horizontal spread.
