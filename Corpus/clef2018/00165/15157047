Immunohistochemical and in situ detection of cytomegalovirus in lung autopsies of children immunocompromised by secondary interstitial pneumonia. Secondary interstitial pneumonia (SIP), a disease affecting patients immunocompromised by primary underlying diseases during their treatment in hospital, is frequently associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a potentially treatable condition. However, in many cases, no infectious agent can be determined, and this clinical disease rapidly progresses to death. Theoretically, SIP could be caused by CMV, which may be present in such small amounts or such configuration that routine histopathological analysis or viral culture techniques cannot detect the virus. To test the hypothesis that immunohistochemistry (IH) and in situ detection by hybridization (ISH) provides more accurate results than the mere histological demonstration of CMV inclusions, these methods were applied to 37 autopsied lung sections obtained from children immunocompromised by primary underlying diseases and who died of SIP. As a result, the cases were subdivided into three groups: (1) children with SIP CMV inclusions (Diffuse alveolar damage-DAD-related) (n = 7) (2) children with SIP without classical viral inclusions (CMV-DAD-related) (n = 3)
