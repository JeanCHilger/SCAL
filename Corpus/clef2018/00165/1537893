Detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA in plasma samples from high-risk pediatric patients by using the self-sustained sequence replication reaction. There is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive methods to assess human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants and children. We evaluated an approach by using the self-sustained sequence replication reaction (3SR) to amplify HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA directly. The amplified RNA product was then detected by bead-based sandwich oligonucleotide capture hybridization and rare earth metal chelate time-resolved fluorescence. The sensitivity of this technology was determined to be less than 12 HIV-1 RNA copies with an amplification level of 10(10)-fold with purified HIV-1 RNA. Plasma samples from 19 high-risk pediatric patients younger than 5 years of age were examined, and results were compared with viral culture of patient plasma. Results from plasma culture and 3SR amplification agreed for 14 of these patients and disagreed for 5. Of the five samples which did not agree, four were positive by 3SR and negative by culture and one was positive by culture and negative by 3SR but became positive by 3SR at a subsequent testing. We conclude that 3SR amplification coupled with time-resolved fluorescence is a promising technology for investigating the relationship between the presence of HIV-1 RNA in plasma and progression of disease in HIV-infected pediatric patients. This technology should be important in the assessment of HIV-1 infection, in evaluating drug therapies, and in understanding the pathogenesis and transmission of the virus.
