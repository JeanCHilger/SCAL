Respiratory adenoviral infections in children: a study of hospitalized cases in southern Taiwan in 2001--2002. Adenoviruses account for 5-10 per cent of respiratory illnesses in children. To analyse the clinical features and the temporal frequency in acute adenoviral respiratory infections in hospitalized children in southern Taiwan, a total of 4333 children who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiaokang (KMHK) Hospital, with clinical evidences of acute respiratory infections between January 2001 and December 2002 were studied. Adenoviruses were isolated from 317 patients with an isolation rate of 7.67 per cent. Serotype analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 186 specimens. In 2001, adenovirus type 4 was found in the majority (57 per cent), followed by type 1.5.6 (15 per cent), type 2 (13 per cent), type 14 (8 per cent), type 3 (5 per cent), and type 7 (2 per cent). In 2002, type 3 became the major type (46 per cent), whereas the previously predominant type 4 decreased to 6 per cent, and type 7 increased from 2 to 19 per cent. The symptoms and signs included fever (98.7 percent), cough (77.6 per cent), abnormal breathing sounds (crackles and/or wheezing 23.3 per cent), abdominal pain (18.9 per cent), vomiting (21.8 per cent), and diarrhea (25.2 per cent). The mean duration of fever was 4.8 days (range 0-19 days). In the 186 cases in whom serotypes were analysed, pharyngitis and tonsillitis (47.8 per cent) were the most common presentation, followed by pneumonia (25.2 per cent), bronchitis (12.9 per cent), and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) (7.6 per cent). Children between 4 and 8 years old were the most common group of patients with respiratory adenoviral infections. Our patients all had good prognosis. This adenoviruses molecular epidemiological study provides information that helps physicians in clinical differential diagnosis and treatment of respiratory adenoviral infection in children in southern Taiwan.
