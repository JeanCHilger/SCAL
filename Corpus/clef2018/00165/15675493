An assessment of mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention in 16 pilot antenatal clinics in Jamaica. This study aims to determine the number and age distribution of pregnant women testing positive for HIV at 16 selected clinics in Jamaica between 2001 and 2002 the utilization of therapeutic interventions to minimize the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and the current status of the HIV-exposed infants and, finally, the number of children who received testing for detection of HIV and to calculate the incidence of MTCT in these children.A retrospective study was carried out at sixteen pilot clinic sites by examining the patient records for all confirmed HIV-positive pregnant mothers and the resultant infants at these facilities for the period January 2001 to December 2002.One hundred and twenty-three of 8116 pregnant women newly tested positive during the period January 2001 to December 2002 however, 176 HIV+ women delivered. Fifty-three (30%) knew their HIV status prior to participating in the programme. Sixty-two (1.4%) and 61 (1.6%) tested positive in 2001 and 2002, respectively. One hundred and ten (77%) and 113 (83%) mothers and infants, respectively, received ARV therapy, (92% - nevirapine, 8% - zidovudine). Twenty-three per cent of pregnant women received no ARV Forty-four (25.0%) of the 176 infants had a documented ELISA HIV test before eighteen months of age, none had a PCR test. The health status of 40 (23%) of these children was known: 30 (75%) were alive and well, five of whom did not receive any ARV, one (2.5%) was alive and ill and nine (22.5%) were reported dead, five of whom received ARV
