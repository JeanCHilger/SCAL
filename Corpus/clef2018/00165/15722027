A comparison of Thermo Electron RSV OIA to viral culture and direct fluorescent assay testing for respiratory syncytial virus. Rapid diagnostic methods for respiratory syncytial virus are useful tools available for the clinician.The Thermo Electron RSV OIA (optical immunoassay kit) was prospectively compared with direct immunofluorescent assay and viral culture at Primary Children's Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah.Specimens from three hundred and thirty patients exhibiting respiratory symptoms were collected for testing by the three methods above. Several specimens were positive by both OIA and DFA with a negative culture result. These culture results were verified by RT-PCR analysis.Overall, 107 specimens were positive for RSV by the reference tests (culture or RT-PCR). DFA analysis identified an additional 40 patient specimens positive for other respiratory viruses. Compared to the reference tests the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of the OIA for detection of RSV were 87.9%, 99.6%, 98.9% and 94.5%, respectively.The rapid OIA assay format proved to be cost effective, and simple to use in comparison to DFA and viral culture. Negative rapid test results should still be confirmed with a secondary test.
