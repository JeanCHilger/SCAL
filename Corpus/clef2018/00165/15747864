Quantitative laboratory methods for the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection in premature infants. 31 prematures with signs of the cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) were examined. The blood and urine samples were tested for direct viral markers, i.e. for infectious CMV by the rapid culture method (RCM) and for viral DNA by quantitative PCR. Besides, the parameters of the specific immune response were studied in the babies. CMV was detected by RCM and/or PCR in 25 of the 31 examined babies during their 1st life week. The highest content of CMV within the investigated samples, i.e. 100 antigen-containing cells per 2.5 x 10(5) culture cells and above 2000 copies/ml of viral DNA was detected in 8 (32%) children. The quantity of viral DNA did not exceed 1000 copies/ml and one to three of stained cells was detected by PCR in 13 (42%) children. A study of anti-CMV in sera revealed high-titer of AT IgG in all 30 children. High avidity of anti-CMV-IgG was demonstrated to correlate with a low viral load and a low CMV infection activity in the newborns. According to the results, at least 3 laboratory diagnosis tools should be used in the diagnosis, they are PCR, RCM and determination of the anti-CMV avidity.
