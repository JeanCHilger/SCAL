Detection of direct markers of cytomegalovirus. Research of the spectrum and avidity of antiviral antibodies in infants and preschool children. Thirty-three children aged 1 month to 3 years were examined within the case study. spELISA, immunoblot (IB), shell vial method (SVM) and PCR, were used for the detection of anti-CMV IgM and IgG, in the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus (CMV). Clinical signs of CMV infection (CMVI) were registered in 20 children (group 1) no CMVI specific signs were detected in the remaining 13 children (group 2). Class M antibodies were identified in 50% of group-1 sera. Around 80% of children in the group had anti-CMV-IgG. AI < 0.6 was in 3 (20%) of 15 examinees. Direct CMV markers (DNA and infection activity) were detected in 13 (65%) of 20 children. Sera of 13 children with non-specific symptomatology (group 2) had no anti-CNV-IgM, while IgG were found in 54% examinees in the group. The infectious active virus was not detected in a single baby. The used laboratory tools enhance the efficiency of CMVI diagnosis and denote a disease variation.
