Usage of dried blood spots for molecular diagnosis and monitoring HIV-1 infection. The usage of dried blood spots as specimens for diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 infection in Thailand was evaluated. EDTA blood samples, which were collected from 100 HIV seronegative and 109 HIV seropositive individuals, were tested on dried blood spots Whatman, Schleicher and Schuell (S&S) No. 903 and S&S IsoCode filter paper. Nucleic acid was extracted and used as a template for HIV-1 proviral DNA detection by an "in-house" multiplex PCR and a commercial Amplicor HIV-1 PCR test (Roche, version 1.0). HIV-1 RNA qualitative (QL) and quantitative (QT) detection was determined by Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA). The average DNA per blood spot recovered from Whatman and S&S IsoCode was not statistically different (p = 0.512) with a range of 218.9+/-46.84 and 225.63+/-88.33 microg, respectively. The concordance of HIV-1 proviral DNA detection by PCR from dried blood spots Whatman and S&S IsoCode was 94% versus 89.4% for sensitivity and 100% versus 100% for specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of HIV-1 RNA QL detection in dried blood spots was 89.7 and 97.5%, respectively. The HIV-1 RNA QT from dried blood spots showed a good correlation in paired dried blood spots and plasma with Pearson correlation, r = 0.817 (R2 = 0.667, P < 0.05). The data showed that dried blood spots could be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 infection.
