Effect of CCR2 chemokine receptor polymorphism on HIV type 1 mother-to-child transmission and child survival in Western Kenya. The effect of CCR2 polymorphism on HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission and disease progression has not been explored in depth within Africa. As the CCR2-64I variant of this putative HIV coreceptor has been associated with slower progression to AIDS in adults, the current study was undertaken to examine the relationship between CCR2 polymorphism and HIV-1 perinatal transmission and child survival in western Kenya. CCR2 genotype was determined for 445 HIV-seropositive mothers and their infants. The CCR2-64I allele frequency of both mothers and children did not differ by HIV-1 transmission status, regardless of maternal viral load, viral subtype, immune status, or placental malaria status. For infants who acquired HIV perinatally (n = 78), there was no association between CCR2 genotype and viral load upon infection or survival rate over the 2-year follow-up. Our results do not indicate an effect of CCR2-64I on perinatal HIV transmission and survival in Kenyan children.
