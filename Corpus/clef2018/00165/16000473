Rapid detection of human metapneumovirus strains in nasopharyngeal aspirates and shell vial cultures by monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were developed for direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of nasopharyngeal aspirates from 40 infants with respiratory infections, as well as for hMPV identification in shell vial cultures. With reference to reverse transcription-PCR, DFA staining showed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 73.9%, 94.1%, 94.4%, and 72.7%, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies are useful for direct hMPV detection.
