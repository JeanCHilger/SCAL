PCR-based diagnosis of neonatal staphylococcal bacteremias. We compared PCR with blood cultures in the diagnosis of neonatal staphylococcal sepsis. Significant association was observed between PCR-based and culture-based diagnosis of staphylococcal bacteremia. Positive and negative predictive values for PCR were 100% and 98%, respectively. These data indicate that PCR may serve as a useful adjunct for the rapid diagnosis of staphylococcal sepsis.
