Population-based epidemiological study of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Calgary Health Region: importance of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing strains. A study was conducted in the Calgary Health Region between May 2002 and April 2004 to define the population-based epidemiological characteristics of infections caused by imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to explore the clinical outcomes due to metallo- beta -lactamase (MBL)-producing and non-MBL-producing strains.Detailed clinical information was obtained by chart review, and phenotypic and molecular characterizations were performed using the MBL E-test, polymerase chain reaction with sequencing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.A total of 228 patients with infections caused by imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were identified (annual incidence, 10.5 cases/100,000 population), with the highest incidence rate in those >or=75 years old. MBL-producing strains (98/228) were associated with higher rates of multidrug resistance and bacteremia. Ninety MBL-producing strains also produced VIM-2, 4 produced IMP-7, and 4 were unclassified. A cluster of VIM-2-producing strains was responsible for a nosocomial outbreak during 2003. The case-fatality rate was significantly higher for infections caused by MBL-producing strains than for those caused by non-MBL-producing strains (25% vs. 13% relative risk, 1.98 [95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.90]MBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains were associated with a higher case-fatality rate and invasive disease. Our study highlights the potential importance of molecular laboratory techniques in infection control and patient care.
