The detection of human papilloma virus in juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis. To investigate the relationship between juvenile-onset respiratory papillomatosis (JOP) and human papilloma virus (HPV6, HPV11), and the immune function of patients.Fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) which combines PCR and fluorescence probe hybridization was used to detect HPV6 , HPV11 DNA in 130 cases. Of these, 68 cases were used Flow Cytometry to measure CD3, CD4, CD8.One hundred and fifteen of 130 cases were HPV6, HPV11 DNA positive, the average copy was 5.68 +/- 2.65. For 68 cases,the average percent of CD3,CD4,CD8 were 62.73 +/- 8.63, 30.54 +/- 7.05, 26.08 +/- 6.93, respectively. To compare with control group, there was not statistical significance.FQ-PCR is a convenient, accurate and specific method which can quantify the amount of pathogenic germs from 10(1) to 10(10), and is also a reliable factor to predicate clinical diagnose and cure.
