Detection of human cytomegalovirus DNA by in situ hybridization. A biotin labelled human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA probe of EcoRI D fragment (17kb) from HCMV AD 169 strain was prepared. In situ hybridization of HCMV was performed in paraffin section of tissues collected from an autopsy case of congenital and combined immunodeficiency syndrome associated with systemic HCMV and pneumocystis carinii infections. The pathological lesions of HCMV infection showed three different patterns: 1, necrotic granuloma type, 2, diffuse type, and 3, scattered type. HCMV DNA was identified in all the inclusion bodies and piled or granular positive material was found in the nuclei or cytoplasms of some giant cells. In addition, some morphologically intact cells might be observed positive for CMV DNA either in nuclei or in cytoplasms.
