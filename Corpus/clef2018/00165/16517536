No CMV DNA in Guthrie cards from children who later developed ALL. An association of a viral infection in utero and development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been suggested. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been reported as a leading agent of intrauterine infections resulting in some cases of congenital infections. The authors investigated the presence of prenatal CMV infection in children who later developed ALL. Guthrie cards were obtained from 48 children with ALL and 46 healthy children and were analyzed for the presence of CMV DNA by a real-time TaqMan PCR. CMV DNA was not detected in Guthrie cards from the children with ALL, from the control healthy children. The results show that prenatal CMV infection does not seem to be associated with later development of childhood ALL.
