Rotavirus diarrhea in children and adults in a southern city of Brazil in 2003: distribution of G/P types and finding of a rare G12 strain. Between May and August in 2003, a total of 251 fecal samples were collected from children and adults with diarrhea (5 inpatients and 246 outpatients) at a private hospital in the city of Ponta Grossa, the state of Paran√°, Brazil.

All 71 strains exhibited a "long" RNA pattern when analyzed by PAGE. Sixty-one positive samples that yielded enough RNA were submitted to PCR genotyping. The most frequent G/P genotype combination detected was G1P[8] (86.9% 53/61) followed by G9P[8] (3.3%
