The prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection among 2016 pregnant women and their children in the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. During the year 2000 a screening was performed to estimate the frequency of Toxoplasma gondii infections in 2016 pregnant women and their children in the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and in the Outpatient Clinic of the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. The study was based on identifying IgG and IgM specific antibodies. All tests were done in the Department of Immunology. Women with serologically diagnosed primary infection were offered further follow up, antibiotic therapy and care during delivery in the Institute of Mother and Child. Children born by infected mothers were examined serologically and observed in terms of congenital abnormality. There were 1294 (64.19%) seronegative 722 (35.81%) were infected before pregnancy (the presence of IgG antibodies). Five women with previous seronegative results (0.29%) were diagnosed as having primary infection during pregnancy. Congenital infection, confirmed serologically, was recognized in 3 newborn infants.
