Detection of Toxoplasma gondii in human placenta by PCR and placental histologic findings. Since isolation of Toxoplasma gondii from human placenta strongly correlates with fetal infection, the aims of the study were: to detect fragments of T. gondii B1 gene in human placentae by PCR and to evaluate their pathology. 36 placentae included in three groups were obtained: group I (n = 7) from pregnancies with prenatal diagnosis of fetal toxoplasmosis II (n = 17) from women with serologic features of primary infection during pregnancy
