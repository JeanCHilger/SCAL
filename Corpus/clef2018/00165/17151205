Detection of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum from skin lesions, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid in an infant with congenital syphilis after clindamycin treatment of the mother during pregnancy. We report here a case of congenital syphilis in a newborn after clindamycin treatment in pregnancy. Using PCR detection of tmpC (TP0319) and DNA sequencing of the genes TP0136 and TP0548, DNA sequences identical to Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum strain SS14 were detected in the infant's skin lesions, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid.
