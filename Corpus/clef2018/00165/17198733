Viral infections of the central nervous system in Brazil. Epidemiological studies have shown that most central nervous system (CNS) infections are viral. The objective of this study is to contribute to the knowledge base concerning viral CNS infections in Ribeir√£o Preto, Brazil.Two hundred cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken from patients with clinically suspected viral CNS infection and analyzed for herpesvirus, enterovirus, alphavirus and flavivirus using PCR assays.Viral genome was detected in 43 CSF samples (23.34%): 6% cytomegalovirus (CMV), 5% herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), 0.5% each varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and 11.34% enterovirus. Co-infections (CMV-enterovirus and CMV-HSV-1) were found in 3 patients. CSF parameters such as cytology and protein level were normal in many patients with viral genome-positive CSF.Data obtained in this study contribute to the knowledge base concerning viral CNS infections in Brazil. This information will have a major impact on the clinical management of patients with CNS disease.
