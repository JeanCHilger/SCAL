Rotavirus immunoglobulin levels among Indian mothers of two socio-economic groups and occurrence of rotavirus infections among their infants up to six months. Rotavirus specific immunoglobulin levels were estimated and compared between mothers undergoing delivery from two socio-economic groups (n = 56 each) by direct/capture ELISA. IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) of cord blood/mothers serum at delivery were significantly higher in the higher socio-economic group (HSG) as compared to the lower socio-economic group (LSG) (P < 0.01). Thirty-four mother-infant pairs (17 from each group) were followed-up up to 6 months for the occurrence of rotavirus infections. All follow-up LSG infants were low birth weight as against none from the HSG. Detection of virus by ELISA/RT-PCR and considering IgM/IgA seroconversion as an index of infection, 11 and 17 infants from HSG and LSG respectively had rotavirus infections. Two infants from LSG were hospitalized for severe rotavirus diarrhea but none from the HSG. Lower IgG levels in the LSG mother-infant pairs as compared to those of HSG, suggests a possible role of under nutrition in development of antibodies and immunity. Infants from the HSG who did not have rotavirus infections had significantly higher IgG GMTs in cord blood and serum samples at 6 months, than those HSG infants who had symptomatic/asymptomatic rotavirus infections (P < 0.05). In conclusion, fewer rotavirus infections occur when cord blood contains higher level of IgG antibodies, suggesting a role of protective immunity.
