Detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in young pediatric patients by using polymerase chain reaction and biotinylated probes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing using up to four primer pairs and biotinylated probes was 97.9% sensitive (188 of 192 specimens positive) and 100% specific (267 of 267 specimens negative) for detecting the presence or absence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pediatric patients whose HIV status has been confirmed. SK38/39 and SK145/150 were the most sensitive primer pairs, respectively detecting HIV DNA in 95.6 and 95.9% of peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens from HIV-infected children and collectively detecting all adequately tested PCR-positive specimens. Primer pairs SK29/30 and SK68/69 respectively detected HIV DNA in only 76.4 and 76.6% of HIV-positive specimens. Among infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers, 30 who subsequently were confirmed to be infected were sampled when they were less than or equal to 6 months of age in all but one infant, HIV DNA was found in the first specimen collected. Among the nine youngest infected infants tested, all were PCR positive by 38 days of age. PCR methods thus have reliably detected vertically transmitted HIV infection early in life.
