Specific real-time polymerase chain reaction places Kingella kingae as the most common cause of osteoarticular infections in young children. The use of universal 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has recently shown that the place of Kingella kingae in osteoarticular infections (OAI) in young children has been underestimated, but this technique is not the most sensitive or the most rapid method for molecular diagnosis. We developed a specific real-time PCR method to detect K. kingae DNA and applied it to the etiologic diagnosis of OAI.All children admitted to a pediatric unit for OAI between January 2004 and December 2005 were enrolled in this prospective study. Culture-negative osteoarticular specimens were tested by 16S rDNA PCR and by K. kingae-specific real-time PCR when sufficient sample remained.By culture alone, a pathogen was identified in 45% of the 131 specimens tested (Staphylococcus aureus, n = 25 K. kingae, n = 17The K. kingae-specific real-time PCR places K. kingae as the leading cause of OAI in children at our hospital.
