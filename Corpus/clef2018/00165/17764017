Diagnostic performance of a rapid antigen test for RSV in comparison with a 19-valent multiplex RT-PCR ELISA in children with acute respiratory tract infections. A rapid and reliable diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in childhood is very important for clinical management. In this study we compared a rapid antigen test (enzyme immunoassay, EIA) for the detection of RSV with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [19-valent multiplex RT-PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] to assess the diagnostic performance. Furthermore the diagnostic value of the EIA in terms of age and season relation was analyzed. A total of 400 nasopharyngeal or tracheal secretions from pediatric patients with clinical signs of lower respiratory tract infection were included. The specimen had to be taken in a standardized manner within 72 h after admission. Specimens were tested in parallel with the EIA and the multiplex RT-PCR ELISA. The RT-PCR technique was used as the target assay. The EIA reached a sensitivity of 58% and a specificity of 90% for all samples tested. For patients < [corrected] 1 year the post-test probability for a positive EIA was 91% during the RSV season a negative test result decreased disease probability from 53 to 25%. For older patients a positive test raised disease probability from 23 to 45% during the RSV season. Negative test results did not markedly change disease probability.
