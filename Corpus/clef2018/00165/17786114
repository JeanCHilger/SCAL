A de novo subtelomeric monosomy 11q (11q24.2-qter) and trisomy 20q (20q13.3-qter) in a girl with findings compatible with Jacobsen syndrome: case report and review. We report on a 2-year-old dysmorphic girl with prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, cardiopathy, left-sided hydronephrosis due to pyelourethral junction stenosis, frequent respiratory infections and psychomotor retardation, in whom a de novo unbalanced submicroscopic translocation (11q20q) was detected by subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Additional fluorescence in situ hybridization studies with locus-specific BAC probes and analyses with microsatellite markers revealed that this translocation resulted in a paternal chromosome 11q terminal deletion of approximately 8.9 Mb and a subtelomeric 20q duplication of approximately 3.7 Mb. A subtelomeric 20q trisomy has only been reported in four cases so far. A subtelomeric 11q deletion has been clinically reported in 18 patients. We review the clinical phenotype of these patients. We suggest that patients with a subterminal (11q24.2/25-qter) deletion may present with features of the well-known phenotype of terminal 11q deletion or Jacobsen syndrome.
