Approach to term neonates born after maternal intrapartum fever and unknown maternal group B Streptococcus status: value of serum C-reactive protein and 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification. Thirty-six term neonates born after maternal intrapartum fever, with premature rupture of membranes <18 hours and unknown maternal group B Streptococcus status had blood samples for complete blood count, C-reactive protein, culture, and 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification. Only 2 neonates were symptomatic and none had leukopenia, C-reactive protein >1.0 mg/dL, bacteremia, or positive polymerase chain reaction.
