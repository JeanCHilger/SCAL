Parvovirus B19 in pregnancy: literature review. Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy is at risk of adverse fetal outcome. The risk is increased if maternal infection occurs during the first two trimesters, but may also happen during the third trimester. Adverse first and third trimester fetal outcome were recently highlighted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral DNA detection. Parvovirus does not seem to be a significant teratogen. Infection during pregnancy can cause severe fetal anaemia and nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Cardiac tropism of the virus can cause myocarditis and aggravate the cardiac failure. Follow up of in utero anaemia is based upon the middle cerebral artery peak systolic flow velocity evaluation and treatment is based upon cordocentesis transfusion.
