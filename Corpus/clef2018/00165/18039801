Colonization and persistence of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains in infants nursed in two neonatal intensive care units in East London, United Kingdom. Stool samples were collected from infants nursed in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in East London, United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for the carriage of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae strains (MRE resistant to three or more classes of antibiotic) and the extent of the persistence of resistant strains following discharge. Sixty-two (50%) of 124 infants had acquired MRE by 2 weeks of postnatal age, and 69 (56%) infants had acquired MRE by discharge. The proportions of infants at 2 weeks carrying strains that were resistant to antibiotics were the following: tetracycline, 79%
