Optimum diagnostic assay and clinical specimen for routine rotavirus surveillance. Rates of detection of rotavirus were compared by diagnostic assay and specimen type. For bulk stools, rates of detection by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were similar, but 18% of healthy controls tested positive by RT-PCR. Testing of bulk stools by EIA appears to be optimum for rotavirus surveillance.
