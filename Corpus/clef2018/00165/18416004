Diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis: pre- and post-natal evaluation in Sicilian (Italy) epidemiological area. Preliminary data. To evaluate the usefulness of conventional serological methods with western blot assay (WB) in congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosis, we prospectively enrolled in a clinical and serological follow-up all pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii infection and their offspring, referred to us from October 2004. Western blot and standard serological test were performed on sera collected from mother during pregnancy and from mother and child at birth, at postpartum month 1-3-6-9 and 12. At this point in time, 22 pregnant women and 14 infants have completed the follow-up. 4 newborns were infected and 2 had specific toxoplasmosis anomalies at the birth. In mothers without seroconversion, the WB performed during pregnancy demonstrates the highest accordance with postnatal follow-up whereas in 1 case the negative result of PCR analysis was not confirmed by postnatal observation. The detection of anti-T gondii IgG against 8 kDa accessory antigenic band and against the accessory band included between 35 and 40 kDa band in immunoblot assay was useful for diagnosis of acute phase but did not improve the evaluation of comparative postnatal profile. Althougth few infants have concluded the postnatal follow-up, the preliminary results showed a greater value of using a IgM and IgA WB test than other standard method for the early diagnosis of toxoplasmosis at birth also in child born to treated mothers. The comparative anti-T gondii IgG immunoblot profile of mother and child permitted us to reduce the time of ruling out infection in newborns born to mothers with probable or possible infection and/or when prenatal diagnosis is negative or not performed.
