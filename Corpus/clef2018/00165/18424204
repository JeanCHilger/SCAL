Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of a de-novo t(2p7p) translocation involving TNS3 and EXOC6B genes in a boy with a complex syndromic phenotype. We describe a premature newborn child with left renal agenesis, right low functional kidney, altered chemical-clinical parameters, neutropenia, recurrent pulmonary infections, long bone diaphysis broadening, growth and developmental delay. Postnatal cytogenetic analysis revealed a 46,XY,t(27)(p13
