Mycoplasma hominis meningitis in a neonate: case report and review. Despite frequent colonization with Mycoplasma hominis, the invasive disease is rare in neonates. This study describes a neonatal case with meningitis in which M. hominis was isolated from a cerebrospinal fluid sample by culture and detected by PCR. The M. hominis infection was confirmed by elevated metabolic inhibition titers against the isolated M. hominis strain and anti-M. hominis antibodies in serum samples. Minocycline and moxifloxacin were effective against M. hominis, which caused meningitis in the patient. However, the patient exhibited left hemiplegia because of massive brain infarction. Based on data of the previously reported 28 cases in addition to our case, the high morbidity and mortality of the M. hominis central nervous system infection were confirmed it was assumed to result from delayed diagnosis and ineffective initial therapy. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment are necessary for a favorable prognosis. Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, especially moxifloxacin, deserve wider use in such cases.
