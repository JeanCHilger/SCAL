Occurrence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae in paediatric respiratory infections. An emerging body of evidence suggests that half of asthma in both children and adults is associated with chronic lung infection. The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of viable Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) and C. trachomatis (Ct) in the respiratory tracts of paediatric patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from 182 children undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical reasons were assayed using PCR analysis, in vitro tissue culture and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of Cp and Ct. Chlamydia-specific DNA was detected by PCR in 124 (68%) out of 182 patients 79 were positive for Cp, 77 positive for Ct and 32 for both organisms
