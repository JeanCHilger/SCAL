Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospitalized children: correlation of molecular analysis with clinical presentation and antibiotic susceptibility testing (ABST) results. The molecular analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from 98 children admitted to the Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, with serious MRSA infections during 2006-2007 was correlated with risk factors, clinical features, and antibiotic susceptibility testing (ABST) results. Isolates were characterized by staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type, the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, repetitive sequence (rep) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), requirement for surgical intervention, antibiograms, and response to therapy. rep-PCR was more rapid than PFGE typing and correlated well. SCCmec type IV-containing isolates caused 92.8% of all infections, but the demographics and diseases associated with subtypes IVa and IVd differed. Subtype IVa (all PFGE type USA300 and PVL-positive) was identified in 81/93 (87.1%) of patients with community-onset (CO) MRSA, including 21/35 of those with risk factors for health care-associated (HA) infection. All other clones were PVL-negative. Subtype IVd (10 isolates 9 USA800 and 1 eMRSA15) caused mainly HA-MRSA and no skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI). Seven classic HA-MRSA strains (SCCmec types II [6
