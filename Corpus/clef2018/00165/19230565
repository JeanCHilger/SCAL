Molecular epidemiology of malaria in endemic areas of Iran. In this study, 333 blood samples of malaria cases positive by microscopic test (70.6% male and 29.4% female, p<0.05) were investigated. The group included 55 cases (16.52%) from Minab (Hormozgan Province), 116 cases (34.82%) from Iranshahr (Sistan-Baluchesta Province) and 162 cases (48.65%) from Kahnouj (Kerman Province). The results showed 244 cases (73.27%) were diagnosed as P. vivax, 87 cases (26.13%) P. falciparum and 2 cases (0.6%) showed a mixed infection of both Plasmodia. In a molecular study of the same samples using nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR), 185 cases (55.6%) were P. vivax, 50 cases (15%) P. falciparum and 95 cases (29%) both Plasmodia. Comparing the two methods used in this study, the highest rate of infection was found to be P. vivax. However, the rate of mixed infections (0.6% microscopy, 29% nested-PCR) varied and depended on the assay used. This indicated that the sensitivity of nested-PCR was greater than microscopic examination, especially for the detection of mixed-infections (p<0.05) in the current malaria epidemiology study.
