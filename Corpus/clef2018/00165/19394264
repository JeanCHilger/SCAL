Direct identification of non-polio enteroviruses in residual paralysis cases by analysis of VP1 sequences. The 66 serotypes of human enteroviruses (EVs) are classified into four species A-D, based on phylogenetic relationships in multiple genome regions. Partial VP(1) amplification and sequence analysis are reliable methods for identifying non-polio enterovirus serotypes, especially in negative cell culture specimens from patients with residual paralysis.In Iran during the years 2000-2002, there were 29 residual paralysis cases with negative cell (RD, HEp(2) and L(20)B) culture results.The genomic RNA was extracted from stool specimens from cases of residual paralysis and detected by amplification of the 5'-nontranslated region using RT-PCR with Pan-EV primers. Partial VP(1) amplification by semi-nested RT-PCR (snRT-PCR) and sequence analysis were done.Specimens from the 29 culture-negative cases contained echoviruses of six different serotypes.The global eradication of wild polioviruses is near and study of non-polio enteroviruses, which can cause poliomyelitis, is increasingly important to understand their pathogenesis. The VP(1) sequences, derived from the snRT-PCR products, allowed rapid molecular analysis of these non-polio strains.
