By combining PCR amplification of toxin-encoding genes and sic gene sequencing, we distinguished 24 genotypes among 47 M/emm1 group A streptococci isolated from children and adults in France in 9 cases of infection comprising four clusters and 38 unrelated invasive infection cases used as controls.
