Genetic variation of G4P[6] rotaviruses: evidence for novel strains circulating between the hospital and community. One hundred forty-six fecal specimens collected between 2007 and 2008 from infants with acute gastroenteritis were screened for rotavirus by ELISA with VP6-specific antibody. One hundred twenty-three of the samples (84.2%) were confirmed to be positive for group A rotavirus (community-acquired, n = 90 [73.2%] and nosocomial, n = 33 [26.8%]), and were typed subsequently using RT-PCR and sequence analysis methods. Determination of G- and P-type combinations showed that G4P[6] (78.9%) was the most common strain, followed by G3P[8] (7.3%), G1P[8] (6.5%), G2P[4] (0.8%), G2P[6] (0.8%), G1P[6] (0.8%), and G9P[8] (0.8%) strains. Of the 97 G4P[6] strains, 62 (63.8%) were responsible for community-acquired cases and 35 (36.1%) were hospital-acquired cases. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene from the G4P[6] strains revealed that both the community-acquired and nosocomial strains were segregated to the human rotaviruses circulating world-wide, including the prototype vaccinal strain, ST3, which constituted a novel sublineage in lineage 1. Owing to the recent emergence of G4P[6] rotaviruses within the hospital, as well as in the community, the findings from this study are important since they provide new information concerning the community and nosocomial spread of rotaviruses.
