Identification of two sublineages of genotype G2 rotavirus among diarrheic children in Parauapebas, Southern Pará State, Brazil. On a world scale, group A human rotaviruses are the most common cause of severe acute gastroenteritis during infancy and childhood, including five (G1, G2, G3, G4, and G9) epidemiologically important genotypes. Among these, G2 denotes a different genogroup which appears to have a cyclic pattern of occurrence and yet little information is available about its genetic variability. The aim of this report was to characterize the emergence of G2 genotype in Paraupebas, Southern Pará State, Brazil, some of which detected after introduction of rotavirus vaccine. A total of 241 fecal specimens from young children with acute gastroenteritis were collected from the "Yutaka Takeda Hospital," a Municipality Hospital, and at the Parauapebas' Health Unit, Pará, from January to September 2006 and during March to November 2008. All samples were tested for rotavirus using immunochromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and RT-PCR, yielding an overall positivity of 12.45% (30/241). Rotavirus G2P[4] was identified in 27 of 30 samples (90%), followed by G1P[8] (2/30, 6.67%) and G9P[8] (1/30, 3.33%). Phylogenetic analysis was performed in 15 of the G2 strains, all of which grouped into lineage II. Four of these strains clustered into sublineage II-a (year 2006) and 11 into one possible new sublineage named II-c (year 2008, except SAL-1920-C). The recent re-emergence of G2 genotype associated with lineage II in Brazil warrants the continuous monitoring of circulating rotavirus strains following the nationwide universal use of rotavirus vaccine.
