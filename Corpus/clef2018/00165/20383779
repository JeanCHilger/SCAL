Rapid typing of neonatal Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates using polymerase chain reaction for repeat regions in surface protein genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a significant pathogen in neonatal sepsis and other nosocomial infections. For further investigations of the colonisation patterns and invasive pathways, typing methods that are applicable on large populations of bacterial isolates are warranted. In the present study, a genotyping method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the repeat regions of four genes (sdrG, sdrF, aap and sesE) that encode for bacterial surface proteins was developed and applied to a sample of well-characterised neonatal blood isolates of S. epidermidis (n = 49). The PCR products were visualised on agarose gel (sdrG, sdrF and sesE) or by fragment analysis (aap). The discriminatory index (D-index) for genotyping of the different genes was compared to genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The highest D-index for the PCR-based typing methods was found for the combination of sdrF, sdrG and aap (D-index 0.94), whereas the optimal two-gene combination (sdrF and aap) resulted in a D-index of 0.92. We conclude that the described method can be used for the genotyping of large populations of S. epidermidis isolates with a sufficient discriminatory capacity, and we suggest that the combination of sdrF and aap is the most suitable to use.
