Molecular surveillance of Staphylococcus aureus colonization in a neonatal intensive care unit. In a survey of staphylococcal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 7 of 67 infants (10%). Two of the infants (3%) carried methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), revealing an unsuspected transmission of MRSA within the neonatal intensive care unit. Molecular surveillance of S aureus provided useful information to improve infection control practices.
