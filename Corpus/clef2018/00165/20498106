HIV-1 vertical transmission in Rio Grande, Southern Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the rate and risk factors of HIV-1 mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), the timing of transmission and the transmitted subtype in a population where subtypes B and C co-circulate. One hundred and forty-four babies born to HIV-1-infected mothers were studied. Subtype and timing of transmission were determined by a nested polymerase chain reaction of the gp41 gene. Seven children were infected (4.9%): four were infected intrautero and one intrapartum. The higher frequency of intrautero transmission was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in the three stages of gestation was a protective risk factor for MTCT (PR = 0.42 CI: 0.21-0.83
