Significance of diagnostics and treatment in preventing congenital infections with Toxoplasma gondii (Tg), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvowirus B19 (PVB19). Common use of available techniques detecting perinatal infections needs to be accompanied with knowledge of proper interpretation of the tests and indications for treatment as well as communication with patients. The aim of this paper is to summarize current standards of diagnosis and treatment of infections in pregnant women and neonates. The detection of specific IgG antibodies in pre-conceptive period excludes the risk of transplacental Tg and PVB19 infection, while the risk of CMV infection is diminished and probable symptoms alleviated. Confirmed diagnosis of primary infection during pregnancy: 1. Toxoplasmosis (seroconversion, presence of IgA and IgM, low avidity IgG, PCR in amniotic fluid) is an indication for antimicrobial therapy 2. Symptomatic CMV infection [seroconversion, virus detected in blood and urine (PCR, pp65 antigen)] for prophylactic IgG administration in mother
