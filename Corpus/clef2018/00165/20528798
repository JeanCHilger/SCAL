Detection of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization in newborn infants using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization on neonatal units is a common and important clinical problem. Effectiveness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting MRSA nasal colonization of infants was evaluated and compared to culture-based methods. The effect of skin decolonization in affected infants was studied.Paired nasal swabs were collected from infants in our neonatal unit over a 12-month period (September 2007-2008). Colonization with MRSA was determined with a commercially available PCR method and compared to culture.A total of 696 paired nasal swabs were taken. Three infants were colonized at the beginning and were included. There were positive PCRs in 12 infants. Five infants cultured MRSA from a nasal swab at the same time. No infants were culture-positive when PCR was negative (sensitivity 100%, specificity 99% compared to culture). PCR results were available within 24 h. Five infants were PCR+ and isolated meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. This organism gave a false-positive PCR result. Two infants transferred in on broad-spectrum antibiotics were PCR+ and negative by culture. Decolonization led to negative nasal PCR and culture in 4/5 infants to discharge.PCR methods are sensitive and specific for detection of MRSA colonization in newborn infants of all gestations with results 1-2 days before culture.
