Detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis and common respiratory viruses in children with acute respiratory infection in Nanjing. To investigate the nonbacterial pathogens in children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Nanjing.The presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) was determined by quantitative PCR in the nasopharyngeal samples from 1 592 hospitalized children with ARI. Common respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus types A and B (IVA and IVB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3(PIV-1, 2, 3) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), were detected using direct immunofluorescence assay.MP and CT were detected in 25.7% and 2.4% of the 1 592 samples respectively. The overall positive rate of respiratory viruses was 40.9%. Among the viruses, the top detected virus was RSV (61.3%), followed by PIV-3 (6.7%) and hMPV (4.9%). Mixed infection among MP, CT and viruses was observed in 107 cases (6.7%). The infants under 1 year old were susceptible to mix-infection (68/107, 63.6%).Respiratory virus is the main pathogen responsible for ARI in children from Nanjing. RSV is the most commonly identified virus. MP is also the frequently identified pathogen for ARI in children. Mixed infection is common in infants under 1 year old.
