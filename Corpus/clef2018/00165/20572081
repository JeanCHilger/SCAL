Adenovirus genome in the placenta: association with histological chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. Adenovirus is isolated frequently from the amniotic fluid and has been implicated in severe neonatal infections. A case control study was carried out to examine the association of detection of adenovirus in placentas with preterm birth and histological chorioamnionitis. Placentas from preterm and full term deliveries were collected prospectively. Preterm cases were divided into three subgroups according to the gestational age. PCR was carried out on placental tissues for the detection of adenovirus genome. Placentas were evaluated histologically for the presence of chorioamnionitis. Chi-square and odds ratios (OR) were used to determine if detection of adenovirus is associated with preterm birth and histological evidence of inflammation. Seventy-one preterm and 122 full term placentas were studied. Adenovirus genome was detected in 29 (40.8%) of preterm cases and in 25 (20.5%) of the full term controls (OR = 2.6 95% CI, 1.4-5.1
