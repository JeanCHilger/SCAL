Improved detection of HIV-1 envelope sequences using optimized PCR and inosine-substituted primers. We describe inosine-substituted 'consensus' primers for the detection of HIV-1 envelope sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. The primers, modifications of SK68 and SK69, are highly specific (100%) and sensitive (greater than 94%) and they prevent false-negative results due to variation in the HIV-1 genome. Consensus primers are needed to ensure the detection of most, if not all, variants of HIV-1 including American, African and newly emerging strains.
