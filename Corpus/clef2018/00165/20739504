Serological evidence of human klassevirus infection. Klassevirus is a proposed new genus of picornavirus that has been associated with pediatric diarrhea. In this study, we used recombinant klassevirus 3C protease as the capture antigen for an indirect serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Four of six klassevirus reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-positive individuals demonstrated seroconversion against the 3C protease, suggesting that klassevirus infection and replication occur in humans. Additional screening of 353 samples from an age-banded serological cohort from two St. Louis hospitals indicated a seroprevalence of 6.8%.
