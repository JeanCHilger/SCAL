Management of pregnancy in an HIV elite controller. Elite control of HIV infection has been defined as spontaneous and sustained maintenance of HIV RNA to <50 copies/mL in the absence of therapy. It is estimated to occur in approximately one in 300 HIV-infected individuals. We present the case of a Zimbabwean woman who tested positive for HIV-1 infection on routine antenatal bloods at 15 weeks gestation. Her CD4 count was 500 cells/mm(3) however, HIV-1 RNA viral load measured below the level of detection on several assays. A Cavidi ExaVir reverse transcriptase assay was below the level of detection. Pro-viral DNA was positive using long terminal repeat primers and sequencing demonstrated subtype C virus. Zidovudine monotherapy (250 mg twice daily) was commenced at 24 weeks for the prevention of mother to child transmission. She was keen for a standard vaginal delivery, having had one previously, and she delivered a healthy baby without complications at 39 weeks gestation. The neonate received four weeks of Zidovudine and tested negative for HIV infection. We discuss some challenges involved in the management of a pregnant 'elite controller'.
