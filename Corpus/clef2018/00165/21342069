Animal bite-associated infections: microbiology and treatment. Human and animal bites may lead to serious infection. The organisms involved tend to originate from the oral cavity of the offending biter, as well as the environment where the injury occurred. A variety of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms have been isolated from bite wounds, with infection ranging from localized cellulitis to systemic dissemination, leading to severe disease ranging from abscess to bone and joint infection, to endocarditis and brain abscess. Immediate wound management, including recognition of the most commonly associated infectious pathogens, and judicious use of empiric antibiotics are crucial in providing the best care after a bite. Here, we discuss the common animal bite associated infections, and provide the most up to date information regarding their management.
