Candida utilis candidaemia in neonatal patients. In recent years, an evident rise in the frequency of candidaemia caused by non-albicans Candida species has been reported. In this paper we present three cases of clinically manifested candidaemia caused by Candida utilis in neonatal patients hospitalized in the same neonatal intensive care unit within a 6 month period. To the authors' knowledge, only two cases of C. utilis candidaemia have been reported in the literature to date, but neither of these involved newborns. Clinical resolution and elimination of C. utilis from the blood were achieved using liposomal amphotericin B or caspofungin in all patients.
