Blood, urine and CSF analysis. This is an interpretative article concerning about the biomarkers of patients with acute encephalitis and acute encephalopathy. Firstly, examinations from blood and/or CSF specimens for the diagnosis of patients with encephalitis are considered using two guidelines. One is the guidelines for the management of encephalitis prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). The other is those prepared by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS). CSF PCR is most useful to detect the pathogen (usually virus) of acute encephalitis. Secondly, a brief outline of acute encephalopathy associated with viral infections from the standpoint of examination is given. Finally, biomarkers of brain injury are considered through a systematic review in term neonatal encephalopathy.
