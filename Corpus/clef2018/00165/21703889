Concentration gradient of CXCL10 and CXCL11 between the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma in children with enteroviral aseptic meningitis. Lymphocyte migration from the blood into the CNS is mediated by chemokines and chemokine receptors. Chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 are important for the recruitment of CXCR3-expressing Th1 lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.To determine the concentrations of CXCL10 and CXCL11 in the CSF and plasma of children with enteroviral aseptic meningitis (EV AM) and controls and the contribution of these chemokines to the chemokine concentration gradient between the periphery and the CNS.The study included 26 pediatric patients with EV AM and 16 controls in whom CNS infection is excluded by negative CSF examination. Chemokines were quantified by using enzyme immunoassay. Etiological diagnosis of EV AM was based on the detection of enteroviral RNA in the CSF using real-time PCR.CXCL10 (median 12 725 pg/ml) and CXCL11 (median 187 pg/ml) concentrations in CSF of patients with meningitis were significantly higher compared to plasma (median 173 pg/ml and median 110 pg/ml p < 0.001, p = 0.026 respectively). CXCL10 concentrations in the CSF (median 198 pg/ml) and plasma of controls (median 124 pg/ml) were not significantly different (p = 0.642). CXCL11 concentrations in the CSF of controls (median 89 pg/ml) were significantly lower compared with plasma (median 139 pg/ml, p = 0.004). Chemokine concentration gradient was not influenced by pleocytosis, nor dependent on cytologic CSF formula or the presence of proteinorrachia.CXCL10 and CXCL11 concentration gradient between the CSF and plasma in children with EV AM suggests an important role of these chemokines in the T-cells recruitment into the CNS and local immunoreaction.
