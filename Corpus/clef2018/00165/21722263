Colonization of paediatric lower respiratory tract with genital Mycoplasma species. Recently, much attention has been given to the possible role played by pathogens that colonize neonatal or paediatric airway and their potential involvement in chronic respiratory disease. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the prevalence of Mycoplasma organisms in the BAL fluid of paediatric patients suffering from a variety of chronic respiratory diseases to determine if there was any clear disease association with bacterial presence.We examined 319 paediatric BAL samples for the presence of M.genitalium, M.hominis, U.urealyticum, U.parvum and M.pneumoniae DNA with species-specific PCR.Mycoplasma DNA was found in 32.6% (104/319) of patient samples 10% (32/319) for M.pneumoniae, 8.8% for U.parvum, 2.8% for U.urealyticumOur data indicate that in addition to M.pneumoniae, urogenital Mycoplasma species may colonize the airway of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. There was, however, no association between chronic asthma diagnosis and Mycoplasma colonization in this study.
