Fetal outcome and amniocentesis results in pregnancies complicated by varicella infection. To evaluate the outcome of infants born to mothers with varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in pregnancy who had second trimester amniocentesis for detection of placental transfer.We interviewed women who had had VZV infection in pregnancy and who underwent diagnostic amniocentesis to detect transplacental infection using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cell culture methods to characterize their children's clinical and psychomotor development.Twenty women who had a diagnosis of primary VZV during pregnancy were available for interview. The mean gestational age at which primary VZV was acquired was 11Â±3.5 weeks. One infant had hypospadias and developmental delay. He was born to an epileptic mother who had been treated during pregnancy with sodium valproate and clonazepam. Another infant had abnormal brainstem auditory-evoked potentials. All other infants were reported to have normal clinical and psychomotor development.In cases of varicella infection during pregnancy, negative studies of amniotic fluid using PCR may contribute to decision making.
