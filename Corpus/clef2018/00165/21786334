Correlation of Chlamydia and Chlamydophila spp. IgG and IgM antibodies by microimmunofluorescence with antigen detection methods. Correlation of serologic titers for Chlamydia trachomatis with other tests has been based on direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) testing and culture, but not on nucleic acid-based tests that are used for screening. We retrospectively reviewed the specificity of antibodies against C. trachomatis, Chlamydia psittaci, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) when compared with DFA, culture, nucleic acid probe, and transcription-mediated amplification. Over a 6-year period, 226 cases had both MIF and one of these other methods performed for comparison. Agreement between C. trachomatis antigen or nucleic acid detection and MIF results was 87% (197/226). C. trachomatis serology had a negative predictive value of 98%, and 10.6% of cases were positive by serology and negative by antigen testing. Of the 13 patients who had a positive C. trachomatis antigen or nucleic acid test result, 9 had IgG and/or IgM titers highest against C. trachomatis, 3 had IgG titers highest against C. pneumoniae, and 1 had undetectable titers for the three chlamydial species. Twenty-five patients had positive IgG and/or IgM titers to C. trachomatis but negative antigen test results. Serologic testing can increase the sensitivity of detecting C. trachomatis infections.
