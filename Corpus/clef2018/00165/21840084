Investigation of a cluster of cutaneous aspergillosis in a neonatal intensive care unit. Between December 2007 and July 2008, three neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Salford, UK, were diagnosed with primary cutaneous aspergillosis (PCA) due to Aspergillus fumigatus. The first PCA case, in December 2007, developed multi-organ failure leading to death within a short time frame: the other two cases survived after treatment with intravenous antifungal therapy followed by oral posaconazole. Air, surface, and water samples were collected within the NICU and from the incubators that were occupied by the neonates. All recovered fungal isolates were confirmed as A. fumigatus by sequencing the beta-tubulin region. Microsatellite strain typing demonstrated genotypically related A. fumigatus isolates from the neonates and the humidity chambers (HCs) of the neonates' incubators, suggesting that the source of the infection may have been the HCs/incubators used in the NICU. Aspergillus strain typing may be a useful tool in clinical outbreak settings to help understand the source of exposure and to design targeted environmental interventions to prevent future infections.
