Detection of toxigenic Clostridium difficile in pediatric stool samples: an evaluation of Quik Check Complete Antigen assay, BD GeneOhm Cdiff PCR, and ProGastro Cd PCR assays. The performance of C. Diff Quik Chek Complete (QCC), BD GeneOhm Cdiff PCR (BD), and ProGastro Cd PCR (PG) assays was evaluated in detecting Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children using 200 frozen stool specimens. The results of the tests were compared to the toxigenic culture (TC) as 'gold standard.' The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were as follows. QCC antigen (GDH + Toxin-A/B) = 70.8%, 97.4%, 89.5%, and 91.4% BD PCR = 89.6%, 96.7%, 89.6%, and 96.7%
