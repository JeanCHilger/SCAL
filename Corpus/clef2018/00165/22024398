Detection of enterovirus RNA in cerebrospinal fluid: comparison of two molecular assays. Enterovirus (EV) and human parechovirus (HPeV) are a major cause of infection in childhood. A rapid diagnostic test may improve the management of patients with EV and HPeV infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the GeneXpert enterovirus assay (GXEA) for detection of EV RNA compared to a user-developed reverse-transcriptase (RT) quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in routine clinical practice. Also a RT-qPCR assay for detection of HPeV RNA in different clinical samples was developed and evaluated. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 232 patients suspected for meningitis was collected and tested for EV and HPeV using RT-qPCR assays. In parallel an aliquot of the samples was tested using the GXEA and viral culture. EV RNA was detected in 22 (19.0%) and 28 (24.1%) of 116 samples using the GXEA and RT-qPCR assay, respectively. EV was isolated from 10 of 116 (8.6%) samples by viral culture. GXEA had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 82.1%, 100%, 100% and 96.2%, respectively. In this study, molecular assays were superior to viral culture for detecting EV RNA in CSF. GXEA showed a high specificity but a lower sensitivity for the detection of EV RNA compared to the RT-qPCR assay.
