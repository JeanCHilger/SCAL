Distribution of UL144, US28 and UL55 genotypes in Polish newborns with congenital cytomegalovirus infections. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection. HCMV strains display genetic variability in different regions. Distribution of HCMV genotypes in the population of congenitally infected newborns from Central Poland and viral load in newborns' blood is described and discussed. HCMV isolates were analysed by sequencing at three sites on the genome: the UL144 tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±)-like receptor gene, the US28 beta-chemokine receptor gene and the UL55 envelope glycoprotein B (gB) gene. The newborns' blood was examined for HCMV DNA with a nested (UL144, UL55) or heminested (US28) polymerase chain reaction, and the genotypes were determined by sequence analysis. HCMV DNA was detectable in 25 out of 55 examined newborns born by HCMV-infected mothers (45.5%). The blood viral load in mother-infant pairs was determined. Most of the newborns had identical virus genotype, gB2 (96%), UL144 B1 (88%) and US28 A2 (84%). These genotypes were detected in all newborns with asymptomatic congenital infection. The occurrence of UL144 B1 or US28 A2 genotypes in the babies examined was significant in comparison to other genotypes (p=0.0002 and p=0.040 respectively). There was no association between specific gB subtypes in all patients groups (p=0.463). There was no correlation between HCMV genotypes and the outcome.
