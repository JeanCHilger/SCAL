Relationship between the preterm low birth weight infant and the periodontal pathogen bacteria in maternal saliva. To investigate the possible relationship between the preterm and/or low birth weight (PLBW) and three anaerobic microorganisms in saliva of their mothers, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema Denticola (Td).110 retrospective cases were collected from 4 hospitals in Beijing urban and suburban areas. PLBW group included 72 subjects and NBW group included 38 subjects. They were made up of 2:1 matched data. Nonstimulated saliva samples were collected from all the individuals. The periodontal examinations included plaque index (PLI), probing depth (PD), bleeding index (BI), and clinical attachment loss (CAL) were performed in 1-1.5 years after preterm. According to the PCR results in their saliva, they were divided into positive group and negative group of Pg, Tf, Td.CAL in PLBW and NBW groups were 0.18 (0.00, 4.97) mm and 0.08 (0.00, 1.81) mm respectively which was significantly different (P<0.05). The detection rates of Pg in PLBW and NBW groups were 94.4% and 78.9% respectively (P<0.05). The detection rates of Tf were 84.7% and 94.7% respectively (P>0.05). The detection rates of Td were 86.1% and 89.5% respectively (P>0.05). The clinical parameters of CAL [2.25(0.54, 4.00) mm, 1.44(0.63, 3.80) mm], PD[(2.47 ± 0.43) mm, (1.94 ± 0.39) mm], PLI (1.80 ± 0.44, 1.36 ± 0.34) in Pg positive group was significantly higher than those in Pg negative group. The birth weight of Pg positive group [(2 482.95 ± 813.17) g] was significantly lower than Pg negative group [(3 425.00 ± 1 024.36) g]. CAL [0.14(0.00,4.9) mm, 0.03(0.00,0.44) mm], PD[(2.44 ± 0.46) mm, (2.17 ± 0.38) mm] were significantly different between Tf positive and negative group. PD [(2.44 ± 0.46) mm, (2.14 ± 0.43) mm] and BI (2.31 ± 0.86, 1.83 ± 0.68) were significantly different between Td positive and negative group.There is higher level of Pg, Tf and Td in the saliva of both PLBW and NBW groups. The detection of Pg may be related to PLBW.
