Evaluation of multiplex polymerase chain reaction and microarray-based assay for rapid herpesvirus diagnostics. Rapid diagnosis is critical to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with infections of the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we evaluated the performance of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray-based method, Prove-itâ„¢ Herpes, in a routine clinical laboratory setting for the diagnostics of 7 herpesviruses in viral CNS infections. Cerebrospinal fluid samples (n = 495), which had arrived for diagnostics in the 5 participating laboratories, were analyzed for herpesvirus DNA both by the current PCR-based method of the laboratory and by the microarray assay. The sensitivity and specificity for the microarray assay were 93% and 99%, respectively. The microarray assay was considered as a rapid and robust diagnostic platform that was easily implemented into the laboratory workflow. The broad herpesvirus coverage and the small sample volume required by the assay could benefit the diagnostics and thus the treatment of life-threatening infections of the CNS, especially among immunocompromised patients.
