Clinical features of different genotypes/genogroups of human metapneumovirus in hospitalized children. To explore the clinical features of different human metapneumovirus (hMPV) genotypes/genogroups in hospitalized children.From January 2005 to April 2010, 3313 children's respiratory specimens sent for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen were also tested for hMPV by real time-polymerase chain reaction. Demographics, clinical presentations, and laboratory findings of patients infected with different genotypes/genogroups of hMPV were compared.A total of 725 samples were positive for hMPV (positive rate, 23%). The F gene was sequenced for 279 isolates of these, genotype A was identified in 51% (A1, 6.1%hMPV accounted for a substantial proportion of hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infection with a high co-infection rate. The A2 subgroup was the most frequently observed, followed by B2. No significant difference was found among patients infected withÂ different genotypes/genogroups of hMPV in terms of clinical manifestations.
