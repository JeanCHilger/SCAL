Measles in France. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases implicated in an outbreak in Western Europe for a few years. In France, the outbreak began in 2008, especially in the southern regions. Most of the cases are mild but deleterious effects can occur in infants, during the pregnancy, or in immunosuppressive patients. Pneumonia and encephalitis are the major complications in these patients. Measles illness during pregnancy results in a higher risk of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low-birthweight infants. Death from measles was reported in approximately 0.3% of cases. The National Reference Center for measles and paramyxoviridae is implicated in biological confirmation of cases and epidemiologic surveillance. Virologic diagnosis consists in a direct detection of viral RNA (real time PCR), or indirect detection of the immune response (IgM and IgG) in saliva samples. The measles genotype is determined by sequencing a 450 nucleotids fragment of the N gene, as the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. This molecular analysis helps determine the geographic origin of the virus and the viral strains circulating in the country. In 2011, 3105 specimens were received. PCR was positive for 1990 patients (64%), with a large majority of children younger than 2 years of age and young adults. The most important cause of measles resurgence is low vaccination coverage. The role of pediatricians is important in order to achieve the goal of 95% of vaccination coverage established by the WHO.
