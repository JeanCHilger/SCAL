Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 at San Felipe, Valparaiso Region, Chile: June-August 2009. In order to understand the clinical and epidemiological aspects of infection with the AH1N1 influenza virus in Chile, a prospective study in the city of San Felipe was undertaken. It analyses the trends in consultations for respiratory causes in three primary care centers and hospital discharges by comparing data from years 2008 and 2009 until epidemiological week 37.It also includes a study of cases of ILI / SARI (influenza like disease/severe acute respiratory disease) in which viruses were detected by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) of nasopharyngeal aspirates and by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the case of influenza A (H1N1) 2009. A household survey was conducted in those cases with confirmed A (H1N1) infection, to identify contacts and history related to influenza virus transmission. The results indicate that the behavior of the pandemic was similar to that observed in the rest of the country, with an increase in emergency room visits for ILI. The most affected age group was from 5 to 14 years (26.5 per thousand inhabitants) and the least affected 60 years or older (1.2 per thousand). A 2.78% of the cases corresponded to SARI and the fatality rate was 0.11%.
