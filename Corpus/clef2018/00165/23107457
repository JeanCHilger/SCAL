Significance of maternal screening for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infection in cases of fetal growth restriction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the significance of maternal toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) screening in cases of fetal growth restriction (FGR).The medical records of women carrying fetuses with FGR who underwent TORCH screening over a 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed for maternal and congenital TORCH infection. Women carrying fetuses with FGR routinely underwent serologic TORCH tests and systematic ultrasound evaluation for congenital abnormalities. If a congenital CMV infection was suspected, amniotic fluid, placenta or neonatal urine was used for CMV DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction.In 319 patients, no cases of maternal or congenital infection with toxoplasma, rubella, or herpes simplex virus were found. Conversely, six cases (1.8%) were diagnosed with congenital CMV infection, two of which had no structural abnormalities other than FGR.A complete maternal TORCH screening for cases of FGR appears to be unnecessary. Although a maternal CMV test can be considered, the incidence of congenital CMV infection was found to be low in FGR cases.
