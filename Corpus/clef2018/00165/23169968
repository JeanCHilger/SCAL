Viral etiology of influenza-like illnesses in Cameroon, January-December 2009. No information is available on the viral etiology of upper respiratory tract infections in Cameroon.We prospectively enrolled outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting at 14 sentinel clinics located across the country from January through December 2009. The specimens were tested using real-time and multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods for the detection of 15 RNA respiratory viruses.We detected at least 1 respiratory virus in 365 of 561 specimens (65.1%). Overall, influenza virus was the most commonly detected virus (28.2% of specimens), followed by human rhinovirus (17.8%) parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-4 (7.5%)We found that respiratory viruses play an important role in the etiology of ILI in Cameroon, particularly in children <5 years of age.
