IL-17 level in patients with Dengue virus infection & its association with severity of illness. Clinical symptoms of Dengue vary from mild febrile illness to severe infection. A potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-17, secreted by mainly Th17 cells mediate inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Role of IL-17 in pathogenesis of dengue virus (DV) infection is not clear.Total 211 dengue patients and 70 healthy controls were enrolled. IL-17 level was tested in serum samples from all cases and controls. Cases were grouped as either dengue or severe dengue based on WHO (2009) classification. Anti DV IgG antibody detection and DV serotype specific PCR were also done. Levels of IL-17 in dengue and severe dengue patients, primary and secondary DV infection were compared. Association of DV serotypes with severity of illness and various clinical and laboratory features with IL-17 levels were analyzed.Of total 211cases, 90 and 121cases were presenting as dengue and severe dengue illness, respectively. Levels of IL-17 were significantly higher in dengue patients as compared to control. Mean level of IL-17 was higher in severe cases than non severe cases however difference was not statistically significant. Stratified analysis of IL-17 level in different age group showed significantly high IL-17 levels in children with severe dengue. Mean level of IL-17 was also significantly higher in cases with secondary DV infection in comparison to primary DV infection. Levels of IL-17 were higher in patients with DV-2 infection in comparison to cases with DV-1 and DV-3 infection. Significant positive association of high IL-17 levels was seen with pleural effusion and respiratory distress.IL-17 appears to be associated with severe DV infection. It is very important to understand the exact role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of severe DV infection.
