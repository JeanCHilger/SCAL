Etiological detection of severe hand-food-mouth disease and related genetic characteristics of enterovirus type 71 infection in Beijing, 2010. To study the etiological detection on samples from severe hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) cases and the genetic characteristics of enterovirus type 71 (EV71) isolates from severe patients in Beijing, 2010.Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect EV71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CoxA16) and RD cells were used to separate virus strains from samples. Homogeneity of EV71 isolated strains were also analyzed.Four hundred and fourty-two severe cases were detected and 253 were positive, taking up 57.24% of the total (253/442). The overall positive detection rate on EV71 was 54.55% (138/253), with CoxA16 as 5.93% (15/253), and with other enterovirus group was 39.53% (100/253). The nucleotide homogeneity of VP1 within these 12 strains was 97.2% - 100.0%, and with Beijing strains in 2007 - 2010, Shandong strains in 2007 and Anhui Fuyang strains in 2008 and the Guangdong strains in 2008 as 94.0% - 99.9%.Severe HFMD cases were most oftenly caused by EV71 but less caused by CoxA16 or other enterovirus. The HFMD in 2010 in Beijing was mainly caused by EV71 subgenotype C4a with 4 transmission chains. Twelve isolated EV71 strains had high homogeneity with strains isolated from severe cases in Anhui Fuyang in 2007.
