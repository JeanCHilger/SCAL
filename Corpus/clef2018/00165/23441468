Psychomotor development after ganciclovir selectively treated congenital and perinatal cytomegalovirus infection. To study the development of children with selectively treated cytomegalovirus infection.We studied prospectively a risk group of 12 children with cytomegalovirus infection. These children were diagnosed by serological screening in the first three months after birth and are defined as congenital and perinatal infections. Thirteen infants with no serological evidence of previous or present cytomegalovirus infection at 4-12 months of age were used as controls. Ganciclovir in a dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day for at least 2 weeks followed by 5-7.5 mg/kg/day administered intravenously for at least 2 weeks more was given to 4 children from the risk group with PCR confirmed cytomegalovirus infection: to one with suspected congenital infection that presented with encephalitis, to two children with abnormal auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and other non-neurological symptoms of a suspected congenital infection, and to one child with proven congenital infection with systemic manifestations. There was no infant with cytomegalic inclusion disease in the study. All other children in the risk group that had clinically manifested infection received isoprinosine in a dose of 50 mg/kg for one month.Psychomotor development delay at age three was found in two children from the risk group and in one child in the control group. There was no difference between the two groups regarding the frequency of paroxysmal events, sensory deficiency or frequent illnesses.The prognosis in cases of cytomegalovirus infection diagnosed at three years of age and treated selectively can be similar to that in infection free 3-year-old children (if there are no cases of CMV inclusion disease).
