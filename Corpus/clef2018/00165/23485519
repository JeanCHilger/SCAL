Mother-to-infant transmission of hepatitis B virus infection: significance of maternal viral load and strategies for intervention. Immunoprophylaxis reduces but does not completely eradicate hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission. This prospective study aims at assessing the rate and risk factors of maternally transmitted HBV infection.We enrolled 303 mother-infant pairs with positive maternal hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) under current immunization program. Maternal viral load was determined by a real-time PCR-based assay. The children were tested for HBsAg at 4-8 months and/or 1-3 years of age. Rates of HBV infection were estimated using a multivariate logistic regression model.HBeAg-positive mothers (81/303, 26.7%) had higher viral loads than HBeAg-negative mothers (7.4 ± 1.9 vs. 2.7 ± 1.4 log10 copies/ml, p<0.0001). Ten children, born to HBeAg-positive mothers with high viral load (median, 8.4 range, 6.5-9.5 log₁₀ copies/ml), were chronically infected. After adjustment for maternal age, birth type, factors related to maternal-fetal hemorrhage, gestational age, infant gender, birth weight, timeliness of vaccination, and feeding practice, maternal viral load was significantly associated with risk of infection (adjusted odds ratio for each log₁₀ copy/ml increase, 3.49Additional strategies to further reduce transmission should be considered in mothers with a viral load above 7-8 log₁₀ copies/ml.
