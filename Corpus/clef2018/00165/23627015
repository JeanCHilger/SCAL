The detection and clinical feature of HcoV-nL63 in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou city. To investigate the prevalence and clinical characterization of HCoV-NL63 (NL63) in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in Lanzhou with other respiratory viruses. The prevalence of HBoV1 in ALRTI was obviously city,China.From November 2006 to October 2009,1169 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from children under 14 years old with ARTIs. Samples were screened for NL63 using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Demography and clinical information were recorded.NL63 was detected in 35 (2.99%) of the 1169 children. The peak of the positive rate were in August, September 2007, July, August 2008 (23.53%,17.65%, 50%, 33.33% separately).

No significant differences of infective rate of NL63 was found between < or = 3 years age group and > 3 years age group. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia were the most frequent diagnoses in NL63 positive patients and the major symptoms were fever and cough in our study. Between the monoinfection group and the coinfection group of NL63-positive patients, no differences were found in symptoms and clinical diagnoses except symptoms of gastrointestinal.HCoV-NL63 is an important pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection in children in Lanzhou city. The peak of HCoV-NL63 infections was in summer. There were annual differences in the prevalence of HCoV-NL63. HCoV-NL63 infections existed a high rate of mixed infection, and mixed infection does not increase the severity of the disease.
