Risk factors of the vertical transmission of human papilloma virus in newborns from singleton pregnancy - preliminary report. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the frequency of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) isolation in pregnant women and their offspring, and to assess the risk of maternal-neonatal transmission.The study included vaginal/buccal smears of 135 pregnant women, as well as the buccal smears and the respiratory discharge samples from their neonates. The material was tested for the presence of HPV DNA by means of PCR.Twenty-two HPV 11-positive cases (16.3%) were detected amongst pregnant women, along with 16 neonatal HPV 11-positive cases (11.85%). The concordance rate of maternal and neonatal HPV 11 DNA was 54.5%. Three maternal variables: the presence of HPV 11, less than 10 years of education, and common law proved significant risk factors for vertical transmission.Asymptomatic HPV infection of a pregnant woman rather than the mode of delivery or other obstetrical characteristics constitutes significant risk factor of vertical transmission.
