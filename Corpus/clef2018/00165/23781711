Genetic diversity of rotavirus group a: correlation between G3 type and severity of the infection. Valencia, Venezuela. Genetic and antigenic rotavirus (RV) variabilities may have implications in the severity of the infection caused by these agents however the studies are not conclusive. For that purpose, the mean severity scores of diarrhea episodes caused by RV types G1 and G3 were compared, at Ciudad Hospitalaria "Dr. Enrique Tejera" in Valencia, Venezuela, between 2001-2005. RV were identified by ELISA, G and P types by RT-PCR. The severity of infection was determined using the Ruuska-Vesikari system and the mean severity values were compared using the Student's t-test (two-tailed, 95% CI). RV were detected in 24.5% of patients (3193/13026), being G3 the most common (50.3%), followed by G1 (39.2%), G9 (6.2%), G2 (0.6%), G4 (0.6%) and of mixed infection 3.1% (G1 + G3). Type P[8] was present in 87.3% of samples, 10.9% P[4] and 1.8% P[6]. There were not statistically significant differences (P > or = 0.05) observed between the episodes caused by G1 and G3 when age, breast feeding, and degrees of malnutrition and dehydration were considered. Nevertheless, in the G3 positive group, fever, episodes of more than 6 days, 6 or more evacuations in 24 hours and 3 or more days with vomit, were observed. The mean severity score for the G3 episodes (11.1) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for G1 (7.8). These results show that G3 was associated with severe diarrhea, supporting the hypothesis that the knowledge of the variability and frequency of viral types is essential to measure the impact of an anti-rotavirus vaccine.
