Epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in a tertiary care centre in the era of molecular diagnosis, Geneva, Switzerland, 2011-2012. Few studies have examined the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in large tertiary centres over more than one season in the era of molecular diagnosis. Respiratory clinical specimens received between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012 were analysed. Respiratory virus testing was performed using a large panel of real-time PCR or RT-PCR. Results were analysed according to sample type (upper versus lower respiratory tract) and age group. In all, 2996 (2469 (82.4%) upper 527 (17.6%) lower) specimens were analysed. Overall positivity rate was 47.4% and 23.7% for upper and lower respiratory samples, respectively. The highest positivity rate was observed in patients under 18 years old (p <0.001)
