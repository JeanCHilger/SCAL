Detection of K1 antigen of Escherichia coli rods isolated from pregnant women and neonates. The K1 antigen is an important virulence determinant of Escherichia coli strains and has been shown to be associated particularly with neonatal meningitis, bacteraemia and septicaemia. Thus, its detection seems to be useful, especially in the case of E. coli strains isolated from pregnant women and newborns. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the latex agglutination test (Pastorex Meningitis) for identification of E. coli serogroup K1 were assessed, using PCR as the gold standard. Our results showed that consistency of results between latex agglutination test and PCR amounted to 98.5%. Therefore, Pastorex Meningitis is a good alternative to PCR and could be used for rapid K1 antigen detection, especially in local non-specialized laboratories with limited resources where PCR assay is not applied.
