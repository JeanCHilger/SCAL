Evaluation of the RIDAGENE real-time PCR assay for the detection of GI and GII norovirus. The current study examined the efficacy of the RIDAGENE norovirus (NoV) real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany) for use in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The RIDAGENE assay had an overall sensitivity of 98% but was more sensitive for GII than GI NoV. The assay had a specificity of 98%. The RIDAGENE assay could detect a variety of GI and GII open reading frame 2 genotypes including GI.1, GI.3, GI.8, GI.13, GII.2, GII.3, GII.4 (including the following variants: 2006b, 2009, 2012, and 3 others that have not been assigned), GII.6, GII.12, and GII.13. The assay did not cross react with a number of gastroenteritis viruses including adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and sapovirus. The assay was straightforward to perform, and for a run of 50 specimens, a result was obtainable in roughly 4 hours. The RIDAGENE assay can be recommended as a valuable detection method for NoV.
