Characterization of BZLF1 gene and its promoter Zp of EBV strains in children with EBV-associated diseases in recent 5 years in Beijing area. This study aims to investigate the genetic characteristics of BZLF1 gene and its promoter Zp of the epidemic strains in children with primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases. Total DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 134 children with EBV-associated infectious mononucleosis (EBV-IM) and 32 children with EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) who were admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital from 2006 to 2011. The EBNA3C, BZLF1, and Zp genes were amplified by PCR assay. Typing of EBV was performed according to the size of the amplification product of EBNA3C gene the amplification products of BZLF1 and Zp genes were subjected to direct sequencing, and sequence analysis was performed using BioEdit 7. 0. 9. The results were as follows: (1) EBV-1 was present in 140 samples (97.2%, 140/144) and EBV-II in 4 samples (2.8%, 4/144). (2) Three BZLF1 genotypes and their 12 subtypes (including 6 newly found subtypes) were detected in this study
