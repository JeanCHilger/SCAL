Detection of mixed infection level of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax by SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR in North Gondar, north-west Ethiopia. Malaria is caused by five Plasmodium species and transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. It occurs in single and mixed infections. Mixed infection easily leads to misdiagnosis. Accurate detection of malaria species is vital. Therefore, the study was conducted to determine the level of mixed infection and misdiagnosis of malaria species in the study area using SYBR Green I-based real time PCR.The study was conducted in seven health centres from North Gondar, north-west Ethiopia. The data of all febrile patients, who attended the outpatient department for malaria diagnosis, from October to December 2013, was recorded. Dried blood spots were prepared from 168 positive samples for molecular re-evaluation. Parasite DNA was extracted using a commercial kit and Plasmodium species were re-evaluated with SYBR Green I-based real time PCR to detect mixed infections and misdiagnosed mono-infections.Among 7343 patients who were diagnosed for malaria in six study sites within the second quarter of the Ethiopian fiscal year (2013) 1802 (24.54%) were positive for malaria parasite. Out of this, 1,216 (67.48%) Plasmodium falciparum, 553 (30.68%) Plasmodium vivax and 33 (1.8%) mixed infections of both species were recorded. The result showed high prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax, but very low prevalence of mixed infections. Among 168 samples collected on dried blood spot 7 (4.17%) were P. vivax, 158 (94.05%) were P. falciparum and 3 (1.80%) were mixed infections of both species. After re-evaluation 10 (5.95%) P. vivax, 112 (66.67%) P. falciparum, 21 (12.50%) P. falciparum + P. vivax mixed infection, and 17 (10.12%) Plasmodium ovale positive rate was recorded. The re-evaluation showed high level of mixed infection, and misdiagnosis of P. ovale and P. vivax.The result shows that P. falciparum prevalence is higher than P. vivax in the study area. The results, obtained from SYBR Green I-based real time PCR, indicated that the diagnosis efficiency of microscopy is very low for species-specific and mixed infection detection. Therefore, real time PCR-based species diagnosis should be applied for clinical diagnosis and quality control purposes in order to prevent the advent of drug resistant strains due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment.
