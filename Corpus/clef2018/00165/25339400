Comparison of test specificities of commercial antigen-based assays and in-house PCR methods for detection of rotavirus in stool specimens. Seven commercial rotavirus antigen assays were compared with in-house PCR methods for detecting rotavirus in stool specimens. The assay sensitivities were 80% to 100%, while the specificities were 54.3% for one commercial immunochromatographic (ICT) method and 99.4% to 100% for other assays. Thus, except for one commercial ICT, all the assays were generally reliable for rotavirus detection.
