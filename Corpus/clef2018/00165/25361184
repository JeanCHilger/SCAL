The burden of single virus and viral coinfections on severe lower respiratory tract infections among preterm infants: a prospective birth cohort study in Brazil. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), especially in preterm infants. Other viruses, co-detected with RSV, may play a role in the severity of respiratory outcomes.This prospective epidemiologic study of severe LRTI incidence among children born â‰¤35 weeks gestational age at 3 sites in Brazil (2008-2010) followed a birth cohort for 1 year post-enrollment. Nasal washes from subjects with LRTI were tested for respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe LRTI requiring hospitalization associated with RSV infection. Secondary outcomes included identification of viruses associated with LRTI, alone or coinfections, and risk factors associated with severe LRTI.Among 303 subjects, 176 (58.1%) experienced LRTI. Among these subjects, 162 had samples tested using polymerase chain reaction 27.8% (45/162) experienced severe LRTI. More subjects with severe LRTI were infected with RSV (30/45, 66.7%) than with other viruses. RSV was present in 33.1% (143/432) of LRTI events tested, 57.3% (82/143) were coinfections. RSV was the virus most frequently associated with severe LRTIs (34/56 events, 60.7%)This study confirms the association of RSV alone or as a coinfection with severe LRTI and reinforces the importance of providing adequate prophylaxis for susceptible infants.
