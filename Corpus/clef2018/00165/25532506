Faecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli in hospital settings in southern France. The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli is a worldwide problem. To date, no study has evaluated the prevalence of faecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR GNB) in France. From 1 February to 30 April 2012, we conducted a prospective, multicentre study in three University Hospitals and four General Hospitals in the south of France. The carriage of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and other CR GNB was screened by both cultivation on chromID® CARBA and chromID® OXA-48 media (bioMérieux) and molecular tools [multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and NucliSENS EasyQ® KPC (bioMérieux)]. The genetic relationship between isolates was assessed by rep-PCR (DiversiLab, bioMérieux) or multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The prevalences of CR GNB and carbapenemase-producing bacteria were 2.4 % (27/1,135) and 0.4 % (n = 5), respectively. Two strains corresponded to OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter baumannii and belonged to the widespread sequence type (ST) 2/international clone II, whereas one strain was an ST15 OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two OXA-48-producers were detected exclusively by PCR. This first French study revealed the very low dissemination of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in patients attending hospitals in southern France during a non-outbreak situation. However, the increasing description of epidemic cases in this area must reinforce the use of hygiene procedures to prevent diffusion of these multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
