Candida fermentati as a cause of persistent fungemia in a preterm neonate successfully treated by combination therapy with amphotericin B and caspofungin. A case of persistent candidemia in a preterm neonate caused by Candida fermentati, identified by sequencing of the internally transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), is described. The neonate was treated for 30 days by combination therapy with amphotericin B (AmBisome) and caspofungin with a successful outcome, and no drug-related side effects were observed.
