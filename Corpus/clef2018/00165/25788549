Comparison of the Vidas C. difficile GDH Automated Enzyme-Linked Fluorescence Immunoassay (ELFA) with Another Commercial Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) (Quik Chek-60), Two Selective Media, and a PCR Assay for gluD for Detection of Clostridium difficile in Fecal Samples. Prevention and management of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can be improved by rapid and reliable diagnostics. The Vidas C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase assay had performance comparable to that of the Quik Chek-60 assay (overall agreement, 95%) and a sensitivity of >93% thus, it is suitable as the first test in two-stage algorithms for a CDI diagnosis.
