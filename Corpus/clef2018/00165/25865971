Utility of whole-cell repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR) for the rapid detection of nosocomial outbreaks of multidrug resistant organisms: experience at a tertiary care center in North India. There is a huge need to develop molecular typing methods which are simple to perform, rapid and cost effective to confirm clonality of nosocomial isolates in outbreak situations.The aim of the study was to investigate a hospital outbreak of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Klebsiellapneumoniae septicemia in a paediatric surgery intensive care unit (PSICU) using a repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR).MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from an outbreak of nosocomial sepsis were typed byREP-PCR using consensus primers. Isolates from different intensive care units (ICUs) but with similar antibiogram were also genotyped for comparison.A cluster of twelve MDR K Pneumoniae septicemia cases was identiÔ¨Åed at the PSICU by genotyping using REP-PCR. Surveillance cultures failed to pick up any source of infection. REP-PCR was found to be a rapid and simple tool for investigation outbreaks in hospitals. Due to early detection we could initiate infection control practices with focus on hand washing and prevent the further transmission of the organism.
