Enterovirus and Parechovirus viraemia in young children presenting to the emergency room: Unrecognised and frequent. Human Enterovirus (EV) and Parechovirus (HPeV) are well recognised as agents causing disease in neonates, but their importance is poorly described in the general paediatric population consulting with a suspicion of infection.We investigated the prevalence of EV- or HPeV-associated infections in children presenting to a paediatric emergency department with a suspicion of infection.Plasma specimens collected in our paediatric emergency room for clinical reasons were screened by specific real-time RT-PCR for the presence of EV and HPeV.Based on an analyses of 233 plasma specimens, up to 6.9% and 2.6% were positive for EV and HPeV, respectively. Amongst the population <3y.o, prevalence of EV and HPeV viraemia was 11% and 3.7%, respectively. Importantly, 56.3% of positive EV specimens were detected in infants >3 months of age.The prevalence of EV and HPeV viraemia in children <3 years old is largely underestimated. Our results confirm that EV should be suspected and included in the work-up in children >3 months of age and not restricted to neonates.
