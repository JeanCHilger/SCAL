Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Neonatal HSV Infection on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy. Optimal acyclovir dosing under continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in neonates is unknown. We monitored serum acyclovir levels and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) DNA levels in a neonate with disseminated HSV-1 infection and renal failure undergoing CRRT. A full-term, 5-day-old female presented with a 2-day history of lethargy and fever. She developed fulminant hepatitis and was diagnosed with HSV-1 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Acyclovir was initiated at 60 mg/kg/day, which was lowered to 20 mg/kg/day because of development of renal failure. She was placed on continuous hemodialysis. Acyclovir dosing was adjusted according to serum acyclovir levels, and HSV-1 viral load was sequentially monitored. Semiquantification of serum HSV-1 levels was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Acyclovir levels were measured by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Acyclovir was administered at 20 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour peak concentration was 18.9 Î¼g/mL. The half-life of acyclovir was estimated to be 2 to 3 h. Viral load remained high during dosing every 24 hours, with a decline of 0.17 log copies/24 hours. Acyclovir dosing was changed to 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours, with an average viral load decline of 0.44 log copies/24 hours. Despite the guideline recommendation of 24-hour redosing, acyclovir was dialyzed at a rate that resulted in suboptimal treatment. Individual therapeutic drug monitoring for acyclovir and dosing adjustment may be required to optimize therapy for patients undergoing CRRT.
