Perinatal management of fetal supraventricular tachycardia complicated by maternal pertussis. Prenatal pertussis has become a concern once again with the reappearance of the disease in the USA. A 30-year-old mother whose pregnancy was complicated with fetal arrhythmia was referred for further evaluation in the third trimester. After initial treatment with antiarrhythmic medications due to continued irregular rhythm, she was revisited for persistent hacking cough at 38 weeks gestational age. PCR examination confirmed pertussis diagnosis. Owing to increased risk of digoxin toxicity with concurrent antibiotic administration, antiarrhythmic medication was discontinued. Delivery was induced 2 days after the initiation of azithromycin therapy to prevent the transmission of the disease to the neonate. A well-planned delivery in a patient with prenatal diagnosis prevents neonatal infection while considering the obstetrical dilemma for concurrent management of the intrauterine arrhythmia and antibiotic administration.
