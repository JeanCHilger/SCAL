Plastic Expander-Related Gordonia Sputi Infection: Case Report and Literature Review. Gordonia sputi causes rare bacterial infections resulting from a contaminated indwelling medical device. We report the case of a postoperative plastic expander abscess in a woman, with G. sputi identification by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. This report indicates that Gordonia spp. should be included in the list of organisms causing plastic implant infections.
