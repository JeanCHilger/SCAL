Detection of human bocavirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates versus in broncho-alveolar lavage fluids in children with lower respiratory tract infections. To compare the presence of human bocavirus (HBoV) in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) versus broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BAL) in children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), as revealed by real-time PCR, in order to confirm the diagnostic validity of NPA samples. A retrospective 5-year study was performed from 2009 to 2014 in 1,194 patients under the age of 17 years (mean age of 3 years) that were diagnosed with LRTIs and from whom both NPA and BAL were obtained. Clinical and demographic data were recorded, and NPA and BAL samples were analyzed for HBoV-positivity by real-time PCR. Of the 1,194 patients enrolled, 65 (5.4%) patients had HBoV detected from NPA, and 61 (5.1%) had HBoV detected from BAL. For HBoV, there was a significant association between the NPA and BAL samples (P < 0.001), but the diagnostic validity was relatively low (kappa = 0.414). When real-time PCR-positivity for HBoV in BAL was used as a reference for diagnosis, NPA had a good specificity and better positive predictive validity in male patients or those younger than 3 years of age. NPA has a similar yield and a good specificity for diagnosis of LRTIs with HBoV compared to BAL. The best diagnostic validity for NPA was detected in male patients or those younger than 3 years old.
