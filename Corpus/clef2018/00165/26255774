Diversity in KIR gene repertoire in HIV-1 exposed infected and uninfected infants: A study from India. Natural killer (NK) cells have antiviral activity mediated through killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs). Studies have shown the importance of KIR receptors in HIV infection. However reports on association of KIR genes in HIV infection from Indian population are limited, not a single study is reported in HIV exposed uninfected (EU) and infected infants. This study compared the KIR gene repertoire of HIV-1 positive (n = 29) with EU (n = 76) infants to elucidate its association with transmission. KIR genotyping was analysed using the PCR-SSP method. Viral load of mothers, CD4 count of both mothers and infected infants were done using commercial kits. The data was analysed using SPSS software. Results revealed presence of significantly high frequencies of activating gene KIR 2DS5 (P = 0.040) and inhibitory gene KIR 2DL3 (P = 0.013) in EU infants as compared to HIV-1 positive infants, confirmed with multivariable linear regression modelling. Fifty-nine KIR genotypes were identified in these 105 infants. Nine genotypes were unique, reported for the first time. Twenty six genotypes were shared with the World populations. Twenty four genotypes were reported for the first time from India. Specific KIR genotype combinations (GIDs) were exclusively present either in HIV-1 positive (n = 19) or in EU infants (n = 30). The Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis shows a strong linkage between four pairs of genes in HIV-1 positive and three pairs of genes in EU infants. In conclusion, this study revealed that, besides maternal confounding factors such as ART and viral load, specific KIR genes are associated independently with perinatal HIV infection.
