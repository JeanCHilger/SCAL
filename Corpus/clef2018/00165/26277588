Correlation between presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 and clinical characteristics of nasal mucosal leishmaniosis. Mucosal leishmaniosis (ML) is a severe clinical form of leishmaniosis. Complex factors related to the parasite and the host are attributed to the development of mucosal lesions. Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) can disrupt immune response, and may be the main determinant of severity of the disease it should be investigated.To study the existence of clinical differences between patients with ML with endosymbiosis by LRV1 and. those without it.A cross-sectional cohort study with clinical evaluation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of Leishmania, species classification, and search of LRV1 was performed. Only patients with confirmed diagnosis of ML by positive PCR and with nasal mucosa injuries were included in this analysis.Out of 37 patients, 30 (81.1%) were diagnosed with Leishmania braziliensis, five (13.5%) with Leishmania guyanensis, and two (5.4%) with mixed infection of L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis. LVR1 virus was present in 26 (70.3%) of the cases.Correlation between clinical phenotype and presence of LRV1 was not observed, although the frequency of the virus is two-fold higher in mucosal lesions than that found in the literature on skin lesions in the same geographical area.
