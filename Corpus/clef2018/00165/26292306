One-Step Multiplex PCR Assay for Differentiating Proposed New Species "Clostridium neonatale" from Closely Related Species. "Clostridium neonatale" sp. nov., previously involved in an outbreak of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, was recently proposed as a new species of the Clostridium genus sensu stricto. We developed a one-step multiplex colony PCR for C. neonatale identification and investigated C. neonatale intestinal colonization frequency in healthy preterm neonates.
