Severe Neonatal Legionella Pneumonia: Full Recovery After Extracorporeal Life Support. Legionella pneumophila is responsible for hospital or community-acquired pneumonia. Neonatal legionellosis is associated with rapidly severe clinical course and high mortality rates. We describe a case of hospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia in a newborn with undiagnosed tracheoesophageal fistula and acute respiratory failure requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support before fistula repair. Standardized multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay allowed early diagnosis. Extracorporeal life support associated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, surfactant, and steroid therapy was effective in achieving complete recovery. This is the first report of successful neonatal extracorporeal life support for respiratory failure secondary to L pneumophila.
