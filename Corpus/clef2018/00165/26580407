Adenovirus species C detection in children under four years of age with acute bronchiolitis or recurrent wheezing. Lower respiratory tract viral infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Among viral etiological agents the human Adenovirus (AdV) has been associated to mild or severe respiratory tract infection.To detect the presence of human Adenovirus (AdV) in children with acute bronchiolitis or recurrent wheezing, describing their clinical features and determining Adenovirus species and AdV association to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human Metapneumovirus (MPV) and Parainfluenza virus (PIV).A total of 155 children bellow 48 months of age with acute bronchiolitis or recurrent wheezing were investigated for the presence of AdV, RSV, MPV and PIV in nasopharyngeal aspirate, by real-time PCR method.AdV, predominantly of species C, has been detected as the unique pathogen (AdVi) or in association to other pathogens (AdVa.), in 39/155 samples. Crackles were more frequent in children with AdV. RSVi was detected predominantly in children with acute bronchiolitis while AdVi and AdVa were detected more frequently in patients with recurrent wheezing.A small outbreak of AdV species C was observed in 2012 and 2013. AdV was detected more frequently in children with recurrent wheezing while RSVi was more frequent in infants with acute bronchiolitis.
