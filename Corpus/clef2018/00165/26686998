High predicted strain coverage by the multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) in Poland. Neisseria meningitidis of serogroup B (MenB) is currently responsible for more than 70% of cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Poland and Europe as a whole. The aim of this study was to estimate strain coverage of a multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) in Poland the meningococcal antigen typing system (MATS) was used to test a panel of 196 invasive MenB strains isolated in Poland in 2010 and 2011. The strains were also characterized by MLST and sequencing of porA, factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial heparin-binding antigen (nhba) and Neisserial adhesin A (nadA) genes. MATS and molecular data were analyzed independently and in combination. The MATS results predicted that 83.7% (95% CI: 78.6-91.0%) of isolates would be covered by the 4CMenB vaccine
