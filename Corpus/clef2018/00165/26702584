Multiplex-PCR for the detection of viruses in the CSF of infants and young children. We aimed to establish the utility of the Fast-track diagnostics Viral meningitis multiplex PCR kit for the diagnosis of central nervous system infection in infants. The multiplex assay had reduced sensitivity for the detection of enterovirus, the predominant pathogen in young infants, when compared to our in-house singleplex PCR. In our infant population, multiple singleplex PCR assays perform better than a multiplex assay for the detection of CSF viruses. J. Med. Virol. 89:559-561, 2017. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
