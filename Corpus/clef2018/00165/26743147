PCR-RFLP Provides Discrimination for Total flaA Sequence Analysis in Clinical Campylobacter jejuni Isolates. The aims of this study were to determine the genetic relatedness among 20 clinical Campylobacter jejuni samples isolated from children with diarrhea in Iran and to introduce the best method of discrimination based on flagellin gene (flaA) sequence divergence. A total of 400 stool specimens were obtained from children under 5 years of age from July 2012 to June 2013. Primers were designed based on conserved sequences flanking the flaA gene that encompassed and amplified the entire flaA gene and followed by sequencing and data analysis with MEGA version 6.0.6 software. Ninety amino acids and 560 nucleotide polymorphic sequences were detected within 1,681 bp of the flaA sequence of which 43 (2.5%) and 12 (0.7%) were singletons, respectively. New repeat boxes within the flaA sequences were found in this study. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean dendrogram based on nucleotides of the full length flaA gene, the flaA short variable region gene and the in silico flaA phylogenic tree of DdeI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles produced very similar clustering with a diversity index of 0.86 for each of the 3 methods. We conclude that flaA typing based on DdeI RFLP of the PCR products is a cheap, rapid, and reliable method for the epidemiological study of C. jejuni isolates of clinical origin in resource-limited regions or in large-scale population surveillance.
