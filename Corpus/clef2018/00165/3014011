Detection of human cytomegalovirus in urine by DNA-DNA and RNA-DNA hybridization. A diagnostic hybridization assay for detecting human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in urine specimens was developed by using cloned viral DNA and in vitro-synthesized RNA probes. Both probes detected 3 pg of homologous DNA and hybridized with DNA of HCMV but not with other viral or human cellular DNA tested. In 95 urine specimens simultaneously tested by cell culture, the sensitivity of hybridization was at least 83%, and the specificity was at least 92%. This assay will be useful for rapid viral diagnosis with wide clinical applications such as screening of immunocompromised patients and quantitation of viral shedding in patients with primary or reactivated HCMV infection who may be receiving antiviral therapy.
