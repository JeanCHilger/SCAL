Congenital cytomegalovirus infection with osteolytic lesions: use of DNA hybridization in diagnosis. A case of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with long-bone lesions is presented. The bone lesions consisted of broad regions of generalized osteopenia with irregular fragmentation and spiculization at the zone of provisional calcification. Diagnosis of CMV infection was made by DNA spot hybridization of the urine sediment to DNA from the Towne strain of CMV, demonstrating the usefulness of DNA hybridization for identification of CMV in clinical specimens. Bone lesions associated with congenital CMV infection are useful early clues to diagnosis but can be indistinguishable from those of congenital rubella syndrome.
