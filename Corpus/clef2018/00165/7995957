HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in the first year of life. HIV-1-specific CTL responses were prospectively evaluated in infants born to HIV-1-seropositive women to assess the capability of the young infant to generate HIV-1-specific CTL and to examine the potential role of HIV-1-specific CTL in the pathogenesis of vertical infection. Our results indicate that some young infants, and even the fetus, seem to be capable of generating virus-specific CTL responses. The detection of HIV-1-specific CTL responses varied among infants, however, with respect to timing, HIV-1 gene product recognition, and the magnitude of detectable responses HIV-1-specific CTL responses were uncommonly detected in the first few months of life. The less consistent detection of HIV-specific CTL in early infancy contrasts with reports of the detection of HIV-1-specific CTL soon after primary infection in adults. HIV-1-specific CTL were not detected in any uninfected infants born to HIV-1-seropositive women. This description of HIV-1-specific CTL in infants may have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of vertical HIV-1 infection and for the development of a vaccine to interrupt vertical infection.
