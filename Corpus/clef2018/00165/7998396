The optimization of the PCR for detecting cytomegalovirus in the urine of newborn infants. A quantitative comparison of 4-primer PCR-diagnosticum potentials for detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in urine specimens in different methods for DNA isolation was carried out. Comparatively simple DNA isolation procedures were considered for express diagnosis in clinical conditions. A scheme of successive use of diagnostic preparations was proposed.
