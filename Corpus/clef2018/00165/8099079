Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction provides rapid differentiation of Proteus mirabilis isolates from a pediatric hospital. During a systematic survey, maternal carriage of Proteus mirabilis was found over a 25-day period in 18 pregnant women admitted to the delivery ward of our hospital maternity. Five neonates born to these mothers were found to be colonized with P. mirabilis. We report here on the use of DNA fingerprinting by the arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction technique (AP-PCR) for the epidemiological investigation of this sudden outbreak. This approach was compared with the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of ribosomal DNA regions (ribotyping). Results of the AP-PCR and of ribotyping were in complete agreement in showing the genetic unrelatedness of the isolates obtained from each mother. Moreover, the results showed mother-to-infant vertical transmission of P. mirabilis in the neonates. AP-PCR is a rapid and discriminative method which seems particularly well suited to the epidemiological study of P. mirabilis.
