A comparative study of congenital and postnatally acquired human cytomegalovirus infection in infants: lack of expression of viral immediate early protein in congenital cases. Postmortem tissues from infants with congenital and postnatally acquired human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection were examined by routine histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) to determine the dynamics of viral replication in vivo. Histologically, infants in both groups showed characteristic inclusion-bearing cells most commonly in lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. IHC for late proteins using a rabbit polyclonal antibody and ISH for viral genomes detected most of the infected cells as nuclear and/or cytoplasmic signals. However, immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody against viral immediate early (IE) proteins was variable depending on the stage of viral replication within an individual infected cell. In tissues of infants with postnatal HCMV infection, many cells harboured IE antigens, while in tissues from congenital cases most of the affected cells lacked IE antigens and only a few showed cytoplasmic staining. The difference was not caused by the antigenic diversity among viral strains as confirmed by in vitro study. Our findings suggested that congenital infections exhibited uniformly late stage proteins with inactive viral replication at death, while acquired ones remained active. The different viral activity may reflect the immune status of congenital and acquired HCMV infections.
