Detection of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection by the polymerase chain reaction using dried blood specimens on filter papers. A simple method for detection of proviral DNA sequences of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was developed using dried blood specimens on filter papers. The whole blood was blotted onto the Guthrie paper. After the blood has dried, the blotted paper was punched out into small discs. The discs were then boiled to prepare the template for PCR (filter paper-PCR method). The filter paper-PCR method detected even a single HTLV-1-infected cell in three discs. The sensitivity of the filter paper-PCR method was equivalent to that of the method in which DNA was extracted with phenol and used as the template for PCR (DNA extraction-PCR method). In addition, DNA in the blotted filter paper was still utilizable as the template after the storage at 25 degrees C for at least 7 wk. A total of 53 clinical specimens from 30 seropositive and 23 seronegative individuals who were screened by particle agglutination (PA) test were analysed for HTLV-1 DNA by both PCR methods. Of 30 PA-positive specimens, 28 were also positive for HTLV-1 antibody by Western blot (WB) analysis, but two were indeterminate. The twenty eight WB-positive and one of the two indeterminate specimens were positive for HTLV-1 proviral DNA by both PCR methods. Of 23 PA-negative specimens, 22 were negative for HTLV-1 proviral DNA by both PCR methods. However, one PA-negative specimen was positive by both PCR methods. This patient was a 16-mth-old infant who was born to an HTLV-1 carrier mother and fed thereafter without her breast milk. In comparison to DNA extraction-PCR method, the sensitivity and specificity of the filter paper-PCR method was 100%, respectively.
