Latent herpes simplex virus type 1 in human vestibular ganglia. Viral infection has been considered to be a possible pathogenesis of vestibular neuronitis, and reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is one of the most likely causes. However, it remains unknown whether the human vestibular ganglia contain latent HSV. We examined 26 vestibular ganglia from autopsied adults in search of HSV type 1 (HSV-1). To detect HSV-1, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining. HSV DNA was detected in 6 of 10 vestibular ganglia using the PCR method. However, the latency-associated transcript (LAT) of HSV-1 was negative in all of the 16 vestibular ganglia examined. No HSV antigen was detected in any of the ganglia. These results indicate that HSV-1 is latently infected in the human vestibular ganglia, and that LAT is transcribed weakly or not at all.
