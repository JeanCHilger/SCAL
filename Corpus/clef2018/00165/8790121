Prospective comparison of culture vs genome detection for diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis in childhood. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with uninterrupted reverse transcription and complementary DNA amplification (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of enteroviral (EV) meningitis in children.A prospective, cohort study.Two medical centers: 1 university hospital and 1 children's hospital in San Diego County, California, during a 5-week period.All pediatric patients younger than 16 years who underwent a lumbar puncture for evaluation of possible meningitis.The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) RT-PCR were compared with viral cultures and clinical histories.During the 5-week period, 90 patients were entered into the study. Nonpolio EVs were cultured from 10% (9/90) of the patients from the following sites: CSF, 6.7% (6/90) of the patients stool, 19% (4/21) of the patientsThe new RT-PCR assay is a rapid and reliable method for the detection of EV infection in childhood.
