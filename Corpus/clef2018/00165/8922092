Detection of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in Chinese newborn infants using polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 1000 urine specimens from Chinese newborns for defining the incidence of congenital CMV infection in the Chinese population. The major immediate-early and the late antigen genes of CMV were amplified and detected by gel electrophoresis. There were 18 congenitally infected infants found when tests were performed with one or both primer pairs. Comparing with tissue culture, PCR of both primer sets provided a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 100% and a predictive value of positive result of 100%.
