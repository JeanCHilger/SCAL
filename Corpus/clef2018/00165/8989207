Vertical HIV-1 transmission correlates with a high maternal viral load at delivery. Transmission of HIV-1 from an infected mother to her child occurs in around 20% of cases. Although maternal, immunological, and virological factors have been implicated in transmission, clear association is not yet well defined. For this reason, we have conducted a study to determine the relative contribution of the above-mentioned factors with special emphasis on quantitative viral load. We studied 67 HIV-1-infected mothers during pregnancy and labor and their 69 newborns (two sets of twins) from two university hospitals in Barcelona. Plasma and cell samples were collected at delivery between January 1992 and May 1994, and HIV-1 RNA and p24 in plasma, CD4 cell counts, and tissue culture infectious doses (TCID) were measured. Diagnosis of infection in children was based on persistence of anti-HIV-1 antibodies at 18 months of age, a positive HIV-1 culture or polymerase chain reaction in two separate samples, or presence of signs or symptoms of AIDS before 18 months of age. Results showed a very high relationship between > 10(5)/ml viral RNA copies (odds ratio [OR] 22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-119.2, p < 0.00001), > 0.5 TCID (OR 17, 95% CI 2.1-139.7, p = 0.001), CDC B + C (OR 3.5, 95% CI 0.98-12.5, p = 0.055), < 400 CD4 cells (OR 4.1 95% CL 1.1-15.4, p = 0.01) and transmission of HIV-1. In this study, a strong association between mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 and a high maternal viral RNA load in plasma at delivery is demonstrated. Viral load, which is related to clinical and immunological status in the mother, is the main contributing factor for HIV-1 vertical transmission, and these findings may have global and even individual therapeutic implications.
