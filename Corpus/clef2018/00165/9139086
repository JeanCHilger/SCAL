Detection of latent varicella-zoster virus infection in human vestibular and spiral ganglia. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) becomes latent in the sensory ganglia after primary infection and VZV DNA has been found in human trigeminal, thoracic, and geniculate ganglia. In this study, human vestibular and spiral ganglia, which do not received innervation from the skin, were examined for VZV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. VZV DNA was detected in 2 of 10 (20%) vestibular ganglia and in 2 of 10 (20%) spiral ganglia from five adults. VZV DNA was undetectable in either type of ganglion from a newborn and from two of the five adults. These two adults were VZV seronegative. The results indicate that VZV becomes latent in several types of sensory ganglion after primary infection and suggest the possibility that reactivation of the virus from the vestibular and spiral ganglia may cause disorders in the labyrinth.
