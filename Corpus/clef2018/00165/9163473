Random amplification of polymorphic DNA reveals serotype-specific clonal clusters among enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from humans. The genetic diversity of 47 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains of serotypes O6:H16, O27:H7, O29:H21, O128ac:H12, and O153:H45, previously isolated from diarrheic patients in Brazil over a period of 15 years, was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Informative band arrays were obtained with three 10-mer primers with G+C contents of 50, 60, and 70%. Based on the combination of the band profiles generated by the three primers 22 RAPD types were detected, and 5 major clonal clusters, each one with at least 80% identical bands, were established. The clonal clusters corresponded to strains having the same serotype which, in most cases, also had the same virulence factors (colonization factors and toxin types) and outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles. The results suggested a correlation between phenotypic properties and genetic relatedness of ETEC isolates of human origin and indicated that a reduced number of clonally related strains are found in areas of ETEC endemicity in Brazil. Moreover, the RAPD technique revealed intraserotype-specific variations, undetectable by the combination of several phenotypic typing methods, among the ETEC strains analyzed. These results show that RAPD typing represents a useful tool for population genetics as well as for epidemiological studies of ETEC.
