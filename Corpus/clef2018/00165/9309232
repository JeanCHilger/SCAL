PCR value in the diagnosis of feto-placental human parvovirus B19 hydrops fetalis: apropos of 10 cases. Human parvovirus B19 primary infection during pregnancy is responsible for 27% of non autoimmune hydrops fetalis. Parvovirus B19 antigen detection and parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG antibody determination using enzyme immunoassays are not reliable for diagnostic purposes and lack of specificity. Parvovirus B19 DNA detection in amniotic fluid, fetal blood, ascitic fluid, and fetal biopsies or placenta specimens seems to be the best method for the diagnosis. Ninety-seven samples from 70 cases of spontaneous abortions after fetal death or hydrops fetalis were examined using PCR. A 270-bp length fragment of the NSI gene was amplified using PCR followed by electrophoresis, by Dot-blot hybridization assay using a biotinylated probe and by Southern-blot hybridization assay using a horseradish peroxidase-labelled probe followed by chemiluminescent assay. The Southern-blot hybridization assay was the longest test but the most sensitive. The parvovirus B19 genome was identified in 10 cases. In two cases, intrauterine blood transfusions led to the cessation of symptoms and to the birth of normal babies.
