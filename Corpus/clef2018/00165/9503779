Increased IL-2 and sIL-2R in sera of infants with HTLV-I infection from mother. In our laboratory, children born to women are known to be infected with Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type-1 (HTLV-I) have been followed using, detect of gene by PCR and antibody by Western Blot Assay (WB) and Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA) test from 1990 through 1996. Four children out of 123 delivery cases have been confirmed to be infected with HTLV-I. We analyzed the correlation between the concentration of cytokines (IL-2, sIL-2R, IFN-gamma) and HTLV-I infection. IL-2 and sIL-2R in sera increased after HTLV-I infection. There was no correlation between the concentration of IFN-gamma and HTLV-I infection. These result suggested that detection of IL-2 and sIL-2R might be the marker of HTLV-I infection.
