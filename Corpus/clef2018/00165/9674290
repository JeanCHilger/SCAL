PCR in the first oropharynx aspirate of the newborn: a possible source for identification of congenital infection agents. We present a case of prenatal diagnosis of congenital rubella. After birth, in addition to traditional serologic and clinical examinations to confirm the infection, we could identify the virus in the "first fluid aspirated from the oropharynx of the newborn", using polimerase chain reaction (PCR). We propose that this first oropharynx fluid (collected routinely immediately after birth) could be used as a source for identification of various congenital infection agents, which may not always be easily identified by current methods.
