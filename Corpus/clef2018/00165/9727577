Sensitivity and specificity of a qualitative RNA detection assay to diagnose HIV infection in young infants. Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an RNA detection assay for diagnosing perinatal HIV infection.Plasma and serum specimens taken during the first 3 months of life from HIV-infected and uninfected children enrolled in a cohort study were assayed for HIV RNA using the qualitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) kit. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated. NASBA results from infected children were compared with DNA PCR results from the same blood samples. Autoantibody patterns of suspected false-positive specimens were compared with those of subsequent specimens from the same child to exclude specimen labelling errors.Amongst 131 specimens from 105 HIV-infected children, the sensitivity of the qualitative NASBA assay was 13 out of 34 [38% 95% confidence interval (CI), 22-56] at < 7 days, 56 out of 58 (97%The qualitative NASBA RNA assay is highly specific and more sensitive than DNA PCR. Qualitative RNA assays may be useful for diagnosing and excluding perinatal HIV infection in children after the first week of life for such purposes as initiating antiretroviral therapy and other treatment, resolving parental uncertainty, determining timing of transmission, and providing endpoints for intervention trials.
