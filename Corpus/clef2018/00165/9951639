Ten years' surveillance of viral conjunctivitis in Sapporo, Japan. We set out to establish the epidemiology of viral conjunctivitis over a 10-year period in Sapporo, northern Japan.A total of 965 patients with clinically suspected viral conjunctivitis during the 10-year period from 1985 to 1994 in Sapporo were evaluated.Among the 965 patients, cumulative frequency of adenovirus (Ad) was 721 (75%). The dominant serotype of Ad changed with time each serotype peaked at 3- to 5-year intervals. Adenoviral conjunctivitis occurred most often in July and August each year. Ad3 and Ad4 were predominantly identified in patients 30-39 years old. No enterovirus 70 has been detected. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Chlamydia trachomatis had no significant peak. HSV was isolated throughout the year, and C. trachomatis had two peaks of detection: in March and from July to September. HSV and C. trachomatis were predominantly detected in patients 20-29 years old.In this study, the main etiological agent of viral conjunctivitis in Sapporo, Japan, was Ad however, attention should be paid to non-adenoviral agents, such as HSV and C. trachomatis, as possible causes of acute conjunctivitis.
