Congenital toxoplasmosis and cerebral involvement inspite of prenatal treatment. Maternal toxoplasmosis seroconversion during the first trimester of pregnancy raises an important risk of toxoplasmic fetopathy.Primary toxoplasmosis was identified between 9 and 17 weeks of gestation. PCR analysis of the amniotic fluid confirmed fetal infection. The mother was given a sulfadoxine-piremythamine combination and monthly ultrasonographic surveillance was initiated. At birth, the female infant was found to have diffuse cortical lesions and a chorioretinitis compatible with toxoplasmic fetopathy. She was given sulfadoxine-piremythamine. At 2 years, the clinical and neuroradiological course has been favorable.Despite antenatal and postnatal treatment and despite ultrasonographic surveillance, it is difficult to predict the course of congenital toxoplasmosis. This case illustrates the importance of informing parents of the risk and the requirement for careful follow-up after antenatal diagnosis of first-trimester toxoplasmosis.
