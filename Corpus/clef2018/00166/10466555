Nosocomial pertussis in healthcare workers from a pediatric emergency unit in France. After pertussis was diagnosed in July 1997 in a 55-year-old nurse (case) from a pediatric emergency unit who had a respiratory illness and paroxysmal cough for 5 weeks, an epidemiological investigation was initiated to determine if other healthcare workers (HCWs) from the same unit also had pertussis.Interviews were conducted to assess symptoms occurring in the previous months. Two sera were collected 2 to 3 months apart for 59 of 61 HCWs of the unit. The IgG response to pertussis toxin was determined using Western blot assay.Pediatric emergency unit (61 HCWs) of a 2,500-bed university hospital.There was a total of 10 (5 confirmed and 5 probable) cases of pertussis identified in this outbreak. Nine HCWs (15%) had results suggesting recent or acute pertussis. To avoid transmission to patients and other HCWs, all HCWs with cough were treated for 14 days with erythromycin, and those having acute cough were given a 5-day sick leave. Despite these measures, a new acute pertussis case was identified in a 41-year-old nurse, with a positive culture from nasopharyngeal aspirates. Thus, all HCWs in the unit were prescribed spiramycin for 10 days to prevent any further spread of pertussis.Pertussis should be considered a threat to HCWs who are in contact with children. For HCWs, diagnosis of pertussis should be made on a clinical basis, giving greater importance to sensitivity of diagnosis criteria, and on early bacterial identification by culture of the organism or by polymerase chain reaction.In case of pertussis in an HCW, all staff in the unit who have had unprotected and intensive contact with that person should be provided with macrolide treatment to stop any transmission to colleagues and to young patients. Furthermore, the possibility of providing these HCWs with acellular pertussis vaccines warrants further investigation.
