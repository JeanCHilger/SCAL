A novel serotype of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) as a major pathogen in an outbreak of infantile diarrhoea. An outbreak of infantile diarrhoea was investigated in 32 children, all <2 years old, in the tropical north of Australia. Rotavirus (63%) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (59%) were the most common pathogens identified. Of the 19 EPEC isolates, 14 (74%) were of serotype O126:H12, hitherto unreported as an EPEC serotype. Other pathogens isolated included Salmonella spp. (16%), Campylobacter spp. (3%), Giardia (3%) and Shigella spp. (3%). EPEC-related gastro-enteritis is an uncommon but recognised cause of diarrhoeal outbreaks in Australia and clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of this serotype being implicated. This report highlights the disadvantages of relying on serotyping alone for the recognition of EPEC.
