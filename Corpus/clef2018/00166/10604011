Neonatal staphylococcal epidermolysis due to maternal-fetal transmission. The staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is due to exfoliative toxins A or B excreted by some strains of Staphylococcus aureus. This syndrome is exceptional in the first hours of life. We report a case of SSSS due to materno-fetal infection.At 31 weeks of pregnancy a 40-year-old mother was febrile (39 degrees C) and a premature rupture of the amniotic sac occurred the following day. SSSS was diagnosed at 6 hours of life in the newborn, a 1760 g female. Staphylococcus aureus grew on the blood and vaginal bacterial cultures of the mother, as well as, from cultures of skin, nose, throat, and umbilical catheter in the newborn. The strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the mother and the child had identical characteristic antibiotype and genotype by Random-PCR. The genes for both exfoliations A and B were present. Epidermization was rapidly obtained and no septicemia or septic complication was noted.Staphylococcus aureus is usually responsible for nosocomial infections which occur in the early newborn period. In most cases, the infection is transmitted by a carrier who manipulates the child (family, visitors, nurse or medical staff). In our case, onset of SSSS early after birth suggested a perinatal transmission, due to lower genital tract infection in the mother. The presence of SSSS in the child and not in the mother may be explained by a massive perinatal infection and low elimination of the toxin in the newborn resulting in higher concentrations of exfoliative toxins in the blood.
