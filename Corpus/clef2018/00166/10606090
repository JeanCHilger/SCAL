Genetic analysis reveals ongoing HIV type 1 evolution in infected human placental trophoblast. To provide a better understanding of the role of placenta in vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, we have studied the infection of placental trophoblast in a group of 15 mother-neonate pairs. By nested PCR amplification of the C2V3 env gene region, HIV-1 has been found to infect the placenta in five cases (33%). Phylogenetic analysis of the cloned sequences showed that all recovered maternal variants were of the B subtype. Further investigation into the ancestral relationships at the nucleotide level revealed that the trophoblast sequences evolved into a quasispecies population clearly distant from that observed in the mother. As expected, the populations transmitted to the trophoblast were also found to be more homogeneous than those in the mothers when characterized on the basis of pairwise nucleotide sequence distances. With regard to the predicted biological properties, the primary amino acid structure of the V3 loop domain was consistent, with a macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing phenotype in all patients. We also attempted to determine if any of a number of selected maternal or viral factors was associated with trophoblast infection. However, none of the followed parameters, including maternal age, disease stage, antiretroviral therapy, CCR5delta32 deletion status of the infant, and viral genotype, could be associated with viral transmission. Moreover, in one pair with proven trophoblast infection, HIV was also detected in the cord blood. Taken together, our data suggest that the productive trophoblast infection by HIV-1 in vivo is a relatively frequent event that may bear direct implications for a further transplacental propagation of the virus.
