Detection of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in the autopsy cases of abnormal birth and teratosis by polymerase chain reaction. Toxoplasma gondii DNA in the autopsy tissues of 72 cases of the premature, stillbirth and congenital malformation was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The specific amplified products were found in 9 cases, i.e. one case of premature, 3 cases of stillbirth, one case of hydrocephalus and 4 cases of other teratosis. The positive rate was 12.5%. Ten control samples were negative. The results showed that Toxoplasma gondii infection was present in the disease cases. The finding indicates that the infection of Toxoplasma gondii may be one of the main causes of the abnormal birth and the congenital teratosis.
