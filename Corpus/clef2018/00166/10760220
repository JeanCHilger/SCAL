Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction typing of isolates of Enterobacter cloacae from an outbreak of infection in a neonatal intensive care unit. Enterobacter cloacae has become a common cause of nosocomial infections. This study was designed to investigate the pattern of spread of E cloacae during an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit.Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction was used to examine 111 E cloacae isolates from 17 patients, including 81 from surveillance cultures, 23 from endotracheal tubes, 3 from eyes, and 1 each from blood, urine, skin, and throat. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were also obtained.Infection with E cloacae resulted from endogenous bacteria and from horizontal transmission. One group of 61 isolates, a third of which were obtained from clinical specimens, was uniformly susceptible to imipenem and ciprofloxacin only. A second group of 50 isolates, only 18% of which were obtained from clinical specimens, was susceptible to all antibiotics tested except for aminopenicillins and first-generation cephalosporins.These data indicate that (1) patient-to-patient spread is an important cause of E cloacae infection in the neonatal intensive care unit and (2) highly antibiotic-resistant E cloacae may emerge during an outbreak.
