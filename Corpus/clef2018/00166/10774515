Estimate of HIV-1 infection prevalence in pregnant women and effectiveness of zidovudine administered during pregnancy in the prevention of vertical transmission. Despite the proven efficacy of zidovudine (ZDV) for reducing perinatal transmission of HIV-1, questions remain about its implementation and effectiveness in routine practice. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of ZDV administered during pregnancy in preventing perinatal HIV-1 transmission, and to determine the proportion of early identification of maternal HIV-1 infection over time.We prospectively followed from birth a cohort of children born between 1/1/1987 and 31/10/1997 to HIV-1-infected mothers. Infant infection status was assessed by follow-up beyond 18 months or HIV-PCR up to 3 months of age.229 mothers and 248 infants were identified in the cohort. ZDV was administered during pregnancy as monotherapy to 34 mothers for a mean of 4.7 (3.1) months prior to delivery. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the treated and untreated groups. Mean (SD) CD4 cell count was 465 (261) cells x 10(6)/l. Factors associated with transmission were a more prolonged time of rupture of obstetric membranes (median 6 vs 1.04 hours p = 0.023) and ZDV treatment. Among the ZDV-treated mothers only one child was infected (2.9%), whereas 37 children born to 212 untreated women became infected. (OR: 0.14In this study, the estimated prevalence of HIV-1 infection is high. ZDV during pregnancy is significantly associated with a decrease in perinatal transmission in our setting. The awareness of an effective treatment might have contributed to the increased identification of HIV-infected mothers prior to delivery observed over time in our cohort of children born to HIV-infected mothers.
