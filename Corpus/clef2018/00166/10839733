Chlamydia pneumoniae in atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic tissue. The positivity rate and localization of Chlamydia pneumoniae were investigated in atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic tissues by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, and cell culture. In total, 67 atheromatous plaques from Japanese symptomatic patients and 110 nonatherosclerotic tissues and organs were evaluated. Of these, 62% of atherosclerotic plaques from symptomatic patients were infected with C. pneumoniae compared with just 2% of nonatherosclerotic tissues. Immunohistochemically stained C. pneumoniae were found most often in smooth muscle cells, less often in macrophages, and in a few endothelial cells.
