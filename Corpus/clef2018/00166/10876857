Immunoenzyme analysis and polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of an intrauterine infection in newborn infants with cerebral lesions. The comparative evaluation of the diagnostic value of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in the detection of intrauterine infection (IUI) in 48 newborn infants with cerebral lesions was made. Tests for the presence of the infective agents of IUI, most frequently occurring in the region (Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus, Chlamydia trachomatis), were carried out. The levels of serum IgA, IgG and IgM were evaluated in the course of the primary screening of IUI. Laboratory samples for PCR from infants with IUI were selected at random. The study demonstrated that in PCR the frequency of positive results was significantly greater than in EIA.
