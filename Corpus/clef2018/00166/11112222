Fatal intrauterine adenoviral endomyocarditis with aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis: diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction. We report a case of fatal hydrops fetalis owing to adenoviral endomyocarditis with aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis. A 1850-g macerated male stillborn delivered 1 week after fetal ultrasonography showed hydrops, cardiomegaly, and possible aortic valve stenosis. Autopsy confirmed hydrops and showed thickened, fibrotic semilunar valves with stenosis. The myocardium was focally fibrotic with areas of calcification. Polymerase chain reaction study of myocardial and aortic valve tissue was positive for adenovirus. Intrauterine viral myocarditis has been reported only rarely, but cases owing to Coxsackie B virus, adenovirus, and parvovirus B19 have appeared in the literature. With the exception of rubella, viral causation of significant valvular lesions in humans has received scanty support in the literature. This report suggests a broader group of causative agents.
