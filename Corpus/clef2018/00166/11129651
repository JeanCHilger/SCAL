Identification of mature and immature human thymic dendritic cells that differentially express HLA-DR and interleukin-3 receptor in vivo. We have previously shown that thymic CD34+ cells have a very limited myeloid differentiation capacity and differentiate in vitro mostly into CD1a+-derived but not CD14+-derived dendritic cells (DC). Herein we characterized the human neonatal thymic DC extracted from the organ in relationship with the DC generated from CD34+ cells in situ. We show that in vivo thymic DC express E cadherin, CLA, CD4, CD38, CD40, CD44, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-R (GM-CSF-R CD116) but no CD1a. According to their morphology, functions, and surface staining they could be separated into two distinct subpopulations: mature HLA-DRhi, mostly interleukin-3-R (CD123)-negative cells, associated with thymocytes, some apoptotic, and expressed myeloid and activation markers but no lymphoid markers. In contrast, immature HLA-DR+ CD123hi CD36+ cells with monocytoid morphology lacked activation and myeloid antigens but expressed lymphoid antigens. The latter express pTalpha mRNA, which is also found in CD34+ thymocytes and in blood CD123hi DC further linking this subset to lymphoid DC. However, the DC generated from CD34+ thymic progenitors under standard conditions were pTalpha-negative. Thymic lymphoid DC showed similar phenotype and cytokine production profile as blood/tonsillar lymphoid DC but responded to GM-CSF, and at variance with them produced no or little type I interferon upon infection with viruses and did not induce a strict polarization of naive T cells into TH2 cells. Their function in the thymus remains therefore to be elucidated.
