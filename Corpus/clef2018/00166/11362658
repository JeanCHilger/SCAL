CDC recommends HIV testing for all pregnant women. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On July 7, 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidelines for testing pregnant women for HIV infection to prevent perinatal transmission of the disease, and such measures mandating testing seems likely to pass Congress. ACTG 076 results that show expectant mothers given AZT significantly reduced vertical transmission has prompted belief in testing. Questions surrounding the use of AZT, how high a level of HIV in the mother creates transmission, and other drugs that could be potentially safer and more effective than AZT have not stopped the CDC from issuing the guidelines. A three-part AZT regimen is recommended, however, it will make a difference in outcome in only one out of six babies, and its safety is not yet resolved. Women rejecting the regimen may be reported to child welfare authorities. The CDC advocates training medical professionals to help counsel women in a supportive and sensitive manner. The author suggests that mandated testing adds a threat of coercive medical care without providing any protection against abuse of power by medical practitioners.
