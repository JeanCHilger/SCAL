Predominant human rotavirus genotype G1P[8] infection in infants and children in Bangkok, Thailand. Human rotavirus is the major etiologic agent of infantile diarrhea on a worldwide scale. In this study, rotaviruses were detected by reverse-transcription PCR in 42 of 83 stool specimens from children below the age of 3 years with acute diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand, between November 1998 and August 1999. G and P types of all samples were characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) and multiplex PCR typing assay, respectively. Strain G1P[8] (76.1%) was the predominant type, followed by G1P[6] (2.4%). Strain G1 combined with mixed P[8]/P[6] was identified in 2 specimens (4.8%) and 7 untypeable G strains (16.7%) were observed. This information on the circulating G and P combinations should be useful for understanding the epidemiology of human rotavirus in Bangkok, Thailand.
