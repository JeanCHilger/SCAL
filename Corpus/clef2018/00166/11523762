Postnatal zidovudine in prevention of vertical HIV-1 transmission in a service setting. We sought to determine the efficacy of a 4-6 week course of zidovudine (ZDV) in a group of infants exposed to HIV-1. A retrospective chart review was conducted on HIV-1-exposed neonates identified from February 1998 to August 1999. These infants received ZDV and their mothers were counselled regarding the risks and benefits of breastfeeding. After informed consent was obtained, the HIV-1-status of the infant was determined by RNA-PCR after 1 month of age.

In all but three, the diagnosis was suspected because of maternal illness, 19 of 26 mothers having either stage 3 or 4 disease. The transmission rate was 15.4 per cent (4 of 26). Errors in ZDV administration were detected in 20 neonates of whom four were infected (p = 1
