Diagnosis of enteric pathogens in children with gastroenteritis. The aim of this study was to determine the isolation trends of common and emerging pathogens in children over a 12-month period. The study group included 412 children under 6 years with diarrhoea who were either hospitalised, or seen in the outpatients department of The Sydney Children's Hospital. Pathogens were detected in 137 (33%) samples, with rotavirus most common (40%), followed by adenovirus (26%), astrovirus (12%), Campylobacter jejuni (12%), Salmonella spp. (10%) and Giardia lamblia (< 1 %). Giardia-specific antigen (GSA) was detected in 11 of 382 (3%) using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and this included four samples in which cysts of G. lamblia were detected by microscopy. Using electron microscopy (EM), viruses were detected in 29 of 120 (24%) samples from hospitalised children and 53 of 171 (31%) outpatients (P = 0.23). Amongst this subset, Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) were detected by RT-PCR in 10 samples including six of 14 with small round viruses, one of seven with small viral-like particles (SVLPs), and three of 126 EM-negative samples. Lactoferrin, detected by EIA, was 59% more likely to be positive in samples infected with salmonella/campylobacter than in samples in which bacterial pathogens were not isolated. As an indicator for infection with these bacterial agents, the assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 40.3%, respectively. A routine microbiological analysis of stools from children of this age group should include a screen for foodborne bacterial agents and rotavirus. Tests for adenovirus, astrovirus and NLVs should be secondary. The cost-effectiveness of including the EIAs for lactoferrin and G. lamblia in the routine testing protocol needs to be evaluated.
