Treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected children with nifurtimox: a 3 year follow-up by PCR. Patients suffering from Chagas' disease, as determined by positive serological results, were tested for further evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection by xenodiagnosis and PCR. The patients included 67 children aged from 0 to 10 years and 75 adults. All children were positive by PCR on their pre-therapy sample, while only 69% of the seropositive adults and none of the 78 seronegative control adults were PCR positive. Xenodiagnosis was positive in 79% of the children, but only in 21% of the adults. A group of 66 children was treated with nifurtimox, and followed up every 3 months during the first year and every 6 months during the second and third year post-therapy, by PCR, xenodiagnosis and serology. We concluded that PCR was the most effective test to monitor children for 3 years post-chemotherapy, when all the cases converted from positive to negative. Conventional serology, however, remained positive after that period in most cases. In contrast, conversion to negative xenodiagnosis occurred very early after treatment.
