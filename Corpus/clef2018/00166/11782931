Enteroviral meningitis in Northern Jordan: prevalence and association with clinical findings. During the summer-autumn of 1999, 390 specimens of cerebrospinal fluid were taken from infants and children younger than 15 years of age. They were suspected of having meningitis and were admitted to Princess Rahma Hospital, Northern Jordan. They were investigated for the presence of enteroviruses using shell vial culture and indirect immunofluorescence assays. Most cases (46.9%) occurred in children younger than 1 year of age in which males represented 71.9%. The common symptoms were fever, vomiting, and headache. Enteroviruses were isolated from 32 (8.2%) cases, coxsackievirus B types 2, 4, and 5 from 15 (46.9%) cases, and echovirus 9 (31.3%) was the most common identified serotype. The virus isolation rate was directly proportional to the number of leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, enteroviral isolation was demonstrated in 4 (12.5%) of 32 cerebrospinal fluid specimens without pleocytosis. Leukocyte differential count revealed a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells in 71.4% of the cases. Hospitalization ranged from 1 day to 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The majority of enterovirus-infected patients (88.9%) were treated with at least one type of antibiotic. These results emphasize the importance of shell vial culture assay for diagnosing enteroviruses, especially in laboratories that do not have access to advanced techniques such as polymerase chain reaction.
