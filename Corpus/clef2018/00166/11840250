Fetal demise due to herpes simplex virus: an illustrated case report. We report and illustrate a case of fetal demise at 31 weeks caused by fulminant herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The 15-year-old mother reported no past history or symptoms of an HSV infection during pregnancy. Autopsy revealed extensively ulcerated skin and necrosis of the liver, adrenal glands, brain, and placental membranes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies of the lungs, liver, adrenal glands and placenta were positive for HSV, but did not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2. A maternal postpartum blood sample was positive for HSV-2 by immunoblot assay.
