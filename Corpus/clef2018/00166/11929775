Effects of exogenous interleukin-7 on human thymus function. Immune reconstitution is a critical component of recovery after treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cancer chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The ability to enhance T-cell production would benefit such treatment. We examined the effects of exogenous interleukin-7 (IL-7) on apoptosis, proliferation, and the generation of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) in human thymus. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the highest level of TRECs (14 692 copies/10 000 cells) was present in the CD1a(+)CD3(-)CD4(+)CD8(+) stage in native thymus, suggesting that TREC generation occurred following the cellular division in this subpopulation. In a thymic organ culture system, exogenous IL-7 increased the TREC frequency in fetal as well as infant thymus, indicating increased T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement. Although this increase could be due to the effect of IL-7 to increase thymocyte proliferation and decrease apoptosis of immature CD3(-) cells, the in vivo experiments using NOD/LtSz-scid mice given transplants of human fetal thymus and liver suggested that IL-7 can also directly enhance TREC generation. Our results provide compelling evidence that IL-7 has a direct effect on increasing TCR-alphabeta rearrangement and indicate the potential use of IL-7 for enhancing de novo na√Øve T-cell generation in immunocompromised patients.
