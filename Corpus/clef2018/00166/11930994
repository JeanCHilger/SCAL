Detection of cytomegalovirus in infant cerebrospinal fluid by conventional PCR, nested PCR and PCR-Digene. The possibility of amplification of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of HCMV central nervous system (CNS) infection in infants was studied. Single-step PCR, nested PCR and PCR-Digene were used to assay CSF specimens from 37 patients. Criteria for patient inclusion in the study were: 1. clinical manifestations suggesting CMV neuroinfection such as seizures, hypertonia, hypotonia, intracranial calcification, microcephaly, chorioretinitis 2. any of the following symptoms: anaemia, hepetomegaly, prolonged cholestatic jaundice, or hepatitis, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, intrauterine hypotrophy
