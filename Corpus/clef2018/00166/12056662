Expression of mRNA for cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1alpha) in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The study was aimed at detecting cellular sources of transcripts for two cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1alpha in infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). The studies were performed on paraffin sections of organs (liver, pancreas, spleen, lungs) obtained upon autopsy from a child deceased due to acute inborn HCMV infection, on paraffin sections of liver biopsy, obtained from a child with HCMV-induced chronic hepatitis, and of liver biopsies obtained from children with chronic type B hepatitis (n = 13). The classical in situ hybridization was applied with digoxygenin-labeled probes and amplification by the ImmunoMax technique. In HCMV infection, the most pronounced expression of mRNA for TNF-alpha and Il-1alpha was detected in pancreatic islets (mainly in beta cells) and, then, in a decreasing sequence, in liver (in macrophages and sinusoidal endothelial cells) and in lungs (in alveolar macrophages). No expression of the two cytokines was detected in the spleen. In HBV infection, weak expression of TNF-alpha and more intense expression of IL-1alpha in the liver were observed, mainly in sinusoidal endothelial cells and in macrophages as well as in hepatocytes. These results were confirmed by immunocytochemical experiments.
