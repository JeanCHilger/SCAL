CMV and blood transfusions. Among the human herpesviruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the only one that has assumed significant importance in blood transfusion. Transfusion transmission of CMV (TT-CMV) to seronegative immunocompromised patients can lead to lethal CMV disease. Studies over the past 30 years have demonstrated that monocytes latently infected with CMV represent the primary vector for TT-CMV, and that TT-CMV can be largely abrogated by transfusing at-risk patients with either seronegative units or blood filtered to remove white blood cells. However, the small number of cases of breakthrough TT-CMV that follow transfusion of either seronegative or filtered blood still produce morbidity and mortality. These circumstances have motivated ongoing efforts to provide improved protection from TT-CMV, including the use of CMV DNA amplification for blood screening, and pathogen inactivation to sterilise all blood components prior to transfusion.
