Human cytomegalovirus load in various body fluids of congenitally infected newborns. Congenital human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection is the most common intrauterine viral disease in western countries. Little is known about hCMV virus load in various body fluids of congenitally infected children.To determine virus load in various body fluids. To assess the impact of hCMV virus load to predict the outcome of congenitally infected newborns and efficacy of antiviral therapy.Cord vein blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of congenitally hCMV-infected children were investigated and hCMV load was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fourteen of 30 children had clinical symptoms and/or pathological laboratory results and 16 had none of them at birth. Ganciclovir was given to 21 children (10 of them with symptoms, 11 of them without symptoms). Viral load before and after therapy was measured.There was a significant difference between median virus load in cord vein blood (2.3 x 10(3) copies per ml) and in urine (4.2 x 10(5) copies per ml P<0.001) at diagnosis of congenital hCMV infection. At that time, no significant difference of virus load was found between the various groups (symptomatic vs. asymptomaticAt birth, virus load in urine seems to be superior to that in cord vein blood to reflect the situation in the organs precisely. As predicting factor for the risk of developing symptoms, only hCMV detection in the CSF appears to be promising. The significant decrease of virus load in children with therapy may reflect the efficacy of therapy. Studies including a greater number of children are needed.
