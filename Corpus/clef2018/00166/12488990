Renal function and effect of aminoglycoside therapy during the first ten days of life. The effect of aminoglycoside administration on kidney functional maturation was evaluated in groups of 30 preterm and 30 fullterm infants who were treated for 7 days because of suspected infection. One of three different aminoglycosides was administered to each subgroup of ten preterm and ten fullterm infants. Changes in tubular function in groups of ten preterm and ten fullterm infants who were not given antibiotics were also compared. The mean gestational age for preterm infants from 32.5 to 33.6 weeks and for fullterm infants between 39.2 and 39.5 weeks. The renal tubular function was assessed by examining the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), potassium (FEK), phosphorus (FEP), magnesium (FEMg) and uric acid (FEUA) as well as by the urinary excretion of calcium as the calcium/creatinine (UCa/UCr) ratio. Gentamicin affected the normal plasma creatinine (PCr) decline in both treated groups (fullterm and preterm). Disturbances in FENa and UCa/UCr were more pronounced in treated preterm than in fullterm infants especially after netilmicin and gentamicin administration. FEMg was significantly affected in preterm infants treated with gentamicin. The findings of this study indicate that the effect of aminoglycosides on tubular function is dependent upon kidney maturity and the type of the aminoglycoside used for therapy.
