Antenatal inflammation and infection in chronic lung disease of prematurity. In spite of improved neonatal care, chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in extremely preterm infants. Our current understanding is that antenatal infection can trigger intra-uterine inflammation which then promotes preterm labour. Recent studies suggest that antenatal infection and inflammation can also increase the preterm infant's susceptibility to develop CLD. It may be that exposure of the fetal lung to high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the cause of this increased susceptibility. One candidate for initiating intra-uterine inflammation is ascending infection by the vaginal commensal Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu). Antibiotics administered to mothers prior to delivery appear to improve the neonatal outcome in cases of preterm prolonged rupture of membranes, but not in cases of preterm labour with intact membranes. Uu can be transmitted vertically to the airways of the preterm infant, but the role of Uu in causing CLD remains uncertain. Small trials of antibiotics given to preterm infants after delivery have not shown any consistent benefit in reducing CLD. Although CLD remains a significant problem for the extremely preterm infant, it is likely that molecular biology techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction, will enhance the detection of antenatal infection and further our understanding of the pathogenesis of CLD.
