Matrix metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 in acute pyelonephritis and renal scarring. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and its main inhibitor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), in acute pyelonephritis and the process of renal scarring. Urine samples from 40 children with acute pyelonephritis, 16 children at 6-wk follow-up and 15 children with nonrenal fever were analyzed using ELISA. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were compared with the outcome of pyelonephritis as measured by renal static scintigraphy. A mouse model of acute ascending pyelonephritis was used to localize the sites of production and the kinetics of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Human renal epithelial A498 cells, primary mesangial cells and monocytic THP-1 cells were stimulated by Escherichia coli. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and protein production by ELISA. We demonstrate a significant increase of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in the urine of children with acute pyelonephritis. Both proteins were produced mainly by leukocytes, and TIMP-1 also by resident kidney cells. Cells reacted differently after stimulation by bacteria. In mesangial cells and monocytes a decreased constitutive TIMP-1 production was found, which was in contrast to epithelial cells. Out of 40 children with pyelonephritis, 23 had higher urinary TIMP-1 than MMP-9 levels. These children had significantly more severe changes in both acute and follow-up scintigraphy scans indicating higher degree of acute tissue damage and renal scarring. Thus, our findings suggest an association between TIMP-1 and the process of renal scarring.
