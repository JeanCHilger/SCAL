Molecular typing of exfoliative toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains involved in epidermolytic infections. Genotyping of sixteen exfoliative toxin-producing (ET-positive) strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in maternity units of two distant hospitals was accomplished by PFGE, ribotyping, PCR ribotyping, and prophage carriage. Three strains secreted combined ETA + ETB, and the remaining produced ETA and enterotoxin C, or TSST-1. The comparison of various genomic profiles resulted in the identification of nine genotypes. The presence of one prevailing genotype was demonstrated in each hospital. Evidence was given that the outbreak-related ET-positive strains causing the skin disease pemphigus neonatorum disseminated in both the hospitals did not originate from a single source or a common ancestor.
