Deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 and outcome in patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect. The 22q11.2 deletion (del22q) is present in many patients with conotruncal abnormalities including pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD). We sought to determine the impact of the del22q on outcome in subjects with PA/VSD.We reviewed the experience for all patients with PA/VSD who were born between January 1993 and April 2002 and presented to our institution. Patients with conotruncal defects were routinely evaluated for genetic disorders including del22q. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to test for del22q.There were 67 subjects with PA/VSD who presented during that time period testing for del22q was performed in 58 of 67 (87%) and these 58 patients comprised the study population. The 22q11.2 deletion was present in 20 of 58 (34%) patients tested. Major aortopulmonary collaterals were defined by angiography and were present in 27 (47%). These collaterals were significantly more common among subjects with del22q (13 of 20, 65%Patients with del22q and PA/VSD are at increased risk for death owing to a variety of factors including less favorable pulmonary artery anatomy. A better understanding of del22q, pulmonary artery anatomy, and outcome is required.
