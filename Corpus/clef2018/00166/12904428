Vertical transmission of the hepatitis C virus to infants of anti-human immunodeficiency virus-negative mothers: molecular evolution of hypervariable region 1 in prenatal and perinatal or postnatal infections. In a prospective study of 33 infants born to hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive human immunodeficiency virus-negative mothers the vertical transmission of HCV occurred in 6.8%. The evolution of HCV infection in two babies was studied from birth up to 5 or 6 years of age, and the sequencing of the hypervariable region (HVR) of the putative envelope-encoding E2 region of the HCV genome was performed. The HVR1 sequence variability and the different serological profiles during follow-up could reflect the differences in HCV transmission routes, HCV genotypes, and clinical evolution of infection.
