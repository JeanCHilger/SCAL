Prospective study of pregnants and babies with risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in municipal district of Rio Grande do Sul. This study followed up 2,126 pregnant women cared for at SUS day-care clinics (Public Health Insurance System) of the northwest of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. After serological screening we performed a follow up of all pregnant women and their babies. Serologic tests included: IgG, IgM, IgA and IgG avidity levels, mice inoculation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also placentas and umbilical materials were tested using immunoperoxidase as well as clinical evaluation. Of all the pregnant women screened, 74.5% were reactive to toxoplasmosis, and 3.6% presented IgM seropositivity. At ophthalmic evaluation ten women had ocular lesions and one infant presented eye lesions and brain calcification. The presence of anti-T.gondii specific IgM throughout the entire pregnancy did not characterize acute phase infection, for this, complementary tests were necessary. The importance is underscored for attendance of the newborn of mothers presenting serology compatible with this infection even in the absence of signs and symptoms of congenital toxoplasmosis.
