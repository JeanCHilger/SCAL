Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C virus detected by nested polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples from eight pregnant women and their offspring were studied by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA to evaluate mother-to-child transmission of this virus. The mothers were all infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) none showed symptoms of HCV infection. Anti-HCV antibodies were tested for by recombinant immunoblot assay. HCV viral sequences were found in five of the mothers and four of eight children, three of them at birth. Viremia was persistent in one infant who had chronic transaminase elevation and persistently remained anti-HCV-positive. The other three babies had intermittent viremia
