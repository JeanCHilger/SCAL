Stability of dried blood spot specimens for detection of human immunodeficiency virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Blood sampling on filter paper has many advantages for the detection of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, if the method is to be widely used, an assessment of its performance under field conditions is required. To simulate conditions in the field, 50-microliters aliquots of whole blood containing low levels of HIV proviral DNA (4 to 1,024 copies per 100,000 nucleated cells) were spotted onto filter paper dried
