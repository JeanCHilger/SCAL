PCR-based diagnosis of enterovirus and parvovirus B19 in paraffin-embedded heart tissue of children with suspected sudden infant death syndrome. The diagnosis of viral myocarditis remains difficult and generally depends on clinical and histologic criteria. Viral cultures and serology are often unrewarding with low yields. The purpose of this study was to analyze the usefulness of PCR in the rapid diagnosis of myocarditis in children. PCR was used to analyze 120 myocardial tissue samples from 60 cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and 56 myocardial tissue samples from 36 cases with well-known causes of sudden death (11 children younger than 1 year and 25 children 1-10 years old). The myocardial tissue samples were evaluated for the presence of enteroviruses and parvovirus B19 using PCR primers designed to consensus and unique sequences of these viral genomes. Enteroviruses could be detected in 14 cases of SIDS, whereas the detection of enteroviral nucleic acid within the control group was negative. Seven cases with myocardial infection caused by parvovirus B19 were found in the SIDS group. The detection of parvoviruses in the control group of the 11 children younger than 1 year was negative, whereas 3 positive cases of parvoviruses could be detected in the control group of children from 1 to 10 years old. In the myocardial sample of one SIDS case, both enteroviruses and parvovirus B19 could be detected. Our results emphasize the importance of modern molecular biologic methods in cases of sudden infant death even when conventional histologic examination revealed no serious findings in heart muscle tissue.
