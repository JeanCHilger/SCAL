Polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of viral infections in the newborn. Two hundred and ten newborns from among a high risk group were examined for intrauterine infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the aim of assessing the clinical information density of the method in the diagnostic sphere. The patients were examined for the presence of DNA/RNA viruses and bacteria. Genetic samples of various causative agents were detected in 49% of the newborns. No correlation was established between the clinical pattern and the presence of DNA of certain microorganisms. The most severe condition of newborns was noted in cases when a DNA causative agent was found in several different biological samples. The highest mortality (in per cent) was registered in the group of newborns with detected DNA of Herpesviridae viruses. The PCR clinical value was affirmed for establishing a disease etiology in newborns.
