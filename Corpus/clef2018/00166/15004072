Surveillance of childhood influenza virus infection: what is the best diagnostic method to use for archival samples? Despite the clinical importance of influenza virus in pediatric respiratory infections, the optimal set of diagnostic tests to use when conducting studies using archival samples is not clear. In this study, we compared diagnostic tests for influenza virus in 75 children younger than 5 years of age who presented with symptomatic respiratory infection during one of four influenza seasons, had negative viral cultures for other respiratory pathogens, and had both an archival nasal aspirate obtained at the time of illness and serology spanning that influenza season. For all eligible children, we compared the results of viral culture performed at the time of collection with serology and PCR of archival nasal aspirates. Using real-time viral culture as the "gold standard," the test characteristics of PCR of archival nasal aspirates (sensitivity, 82% specificity, 100%) and serology (sensitivity, 82%
