The detection of Helicobacter pylori in paraffin sections using the PCR technique and various primers as compared to histological techniques. Helicobacter pylori is thought to represent a significant etiopathogenic factor in diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract. It seems, therefore, important to elaborate effective techniques for its detection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori detection using the PCR technique on paraffin sections with various pairs of primers and to compare the results with those of a histological appraisal. Material for the studies involved 50 paraffin blocks with gastric mucosa biopsies fixed in 4% buffered formalin. In this material 4 tests were performed with the aim of diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection: 1) H+E staining, 2) staining by the Giemsa technique, 3) an immunocytochemical technique with antibodies against H. pylori and 4) the PCR technique with various primers. In the present study the most reliable results for H. pylori detection as well as the most pronounced correlation were obtained by using the PCR technique with primers for the ureC gene, immunohistochemistry and staining according to Giemsa. Less compatible results were obtained employing the two PCR techniques which utilise various primers. The experiments confirmed the usefulness of the PCR technique in the detection of Helicobacter pylori in paraffin sections by using a suitable pair of primers, and also indicated that Giemsa staining and immunohistochemistry should be taken into account.
