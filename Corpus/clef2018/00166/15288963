Few modifications of the Cobas Amplicor HIV Monitor 1.5 test allow reliable quantitation of HIV-1 proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recent studies have suggested that monitoring the amount of HIV provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may be a useful end point for HAART where, in combination with plasma viral load, it provides additional information as to the possibility of virus eradication. In the present study, a modified version of the Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test (CAHIM), currently used to quantify plasma viremia, have been evaluated to also measure the amount of proviral DNA in PBMCs. The analytical and clinical performance of the modified CAHIM test was assessed by quantifying different amounts of a standard HIV-DNA preparation obtained from the 8E5 cell line and by analysing 165 patients and controls samples. In these experiments, the modified test, that showed a linear dynamic range from 1.7 to 4.7 log10 copies/10(6) cells (r = 0.99) with a maximum CV of 20%, proved able to detect and quantify HIV-DNA in all but one clinical samples, with concentrations varying from 1.3 to 3.8 log10 copies/10(6) cells. During anti-retroviral treatment, the assay revealed different proviral DNA time courses associated with viral load changes and inversely correlated with CD4+ cells count. As expected, HIV-DNA was always detectable even when plasma viremia fell below the CAHIM cut-off. The modified CAHIM test specificity was confirmed by testing 20 HIV-negative samples in triplicates. Taken together, the data showed that the modified CAHIM test can be used to monitor HIV proviral DNA changes during HAART and can help in investigating further the clinical use of this marker.
