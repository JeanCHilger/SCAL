Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus in a hospital in southern Brazil. There still are controversies concerning the vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus.To evaluate the prevalence of antibodies against hepatitis C virus in pregnant women, as well as the rate of vertical transmission of this virus.Between August 1998 and November 1999, 1,090 consecutive pregnant women were screened for anti-hepatitis C virus positive results were confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction assay. Patient's viral load was evaluated by the branched deoxyribonucleic acid assay. Hepatitis C virus genotype was identified by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction amplification products. The same tests were performed in the children born from infected mothers at the 1st and 6th month of life.Of the 1,090 mothers surveyed, 29 were positive for anti-hepatitis C virus (prevalence of 2.66%). Twenty-five patients presented with hepatitis C virus RNA, with a median hepatitis C virus viral load of 3.132 +/- 5.891 MEq/mL. Twenty-two patients (six human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected) were followed and gave birth to 23 children 18 of them had blood samples tested at the 1st month of life, and 22, at the 6th month. Vertical transmission rate was 5.56%These results suggest that the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in pregnant women should not be neglected, and early diagnosis of vertical transmission and the follow up of infected children should be emphasized.
