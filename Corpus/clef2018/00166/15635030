Comparison of the Mycoplasma Duo test with PCR for detection of ureaplasma species in endotracheal aspirates from premature infants. We compared the Mycoplasma Duo kit (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur) with PCR for detection of Ureaplasma spp. in endotracheal aspirates from 60 premature neonates. The overall agreement between the two tests was 96%. The Mycoplasma Duo assay is a useful alternative to culture and PCR for detection of neonatal Ureaplasma infection.
