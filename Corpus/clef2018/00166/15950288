Trends in anti-bacterial resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the USA, 2000-2003: PROTEKT US years 1-3. To determine geographic and temporal trends in anti-bacterial resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections as part of the PROTEKT US surveillance study (2000-2003).From 2000 to 2003, 31 001 isolates of S. pneumoniae were collected. Anti-bacterial minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined at a central laboratory using the CLSI broth microdilution method. Macrolide resistance genotypes were determined by PCR.Overall, 29.4, 22.5, 0.9, and 0.02% of S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin, respectively, with considerable regional variability. Multidrug resistance was stable at approx. 31%. Among macrolide-resistant isolates, mef(A) was the most prevalent resistance gene identified however, the percentage of isolates with this gene decreased from 68.8% (2000) to 63.9% (2003), while the prevalence of isolates containing both the erm(B) and mef(A) genes increased (2000, 9.7%Penicillin and erythromycin resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae from the U.S.A. remained high over the 3 years of the study. Telithromycin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against pneumococcal strains.
