Herpetic neonatal hepatitis. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can affect various organs-systems in the neonatal period. Herpetic hepatitis was seldom reported in the literature. We report on 2 cases. Firstly, a 16 day-old newborn infant was admitted because of haemorrhagic syndrome and shock. Biological assessment showed a severe hepatic insufficiency. Antibiotic and aciclovir therapy was started as HSV infection was suspected. Five days later, the herpetic attack was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The genotye of the virus in the CSF was HSV1. Treatment included aciclovir for 21 days intravenously and 2 months orally. At 10 months, the clinical and biological examinations were normal. Secondly, a 4 day-old newborn was hospitalised because of fever and polypnea. Pulmonary X rays showed heterogeneous opacities of the right base. Serum C reactive protein was 30 mg/l. Antibiotic therapy was started. Two days later, the fever persisted while a severe hepatic insufficiency developed. The diagnosis of herpetic hepatitis was evoked and the child was given aciclovir. Forty-eight hours later, the PCR confirmed a HSV in blood, while viral culture of a mouth swab found HSV 2. Evolution was favourable after 21 days of specific and symptomatic treatment. Aciclovir treatment was continued orally for six months. Herpetic hepatitis is rare in the neonatal period. Diagnosis must be evoked early when facing severe neonatal hepatic insufficiency. Provided specific treatment, prognosis is good.
