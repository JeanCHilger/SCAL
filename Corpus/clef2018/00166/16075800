Epidemiology of Chagas disease in San Roque, Corrientes. Triatomine infestation and human seroprevalence. This investigation was aimed to evaluate triatomine colonization in domestic and extradomestic ecotopes located around a palm community, to determine triatomines infection index and to obtain human seroprevalence rates. Samplings were performed in spring 1998 and summer 1999 in Colonia Laurel, Department San Roque, Corrientes, Argentina. Timed-collection of triatomines (man/hour method) was performed. Trypanosoma cruzi identity was determined by morphological criteria and by PCR. Indirect hemagglutination and indirect immunofluorescence antibody tests were used for detection of T. cruzi infection in human volunteers. Sixteen human dwellings were analized, 11 resulted infested by Triatoma infestans and two by Triatoma sordida. A total of 122 T. infestans of all age classes were collected and T. cruzi infection was recorded in 16.7%. Triatoma infestans was confirmed as the predominant species in the domicile and T. sordida in the peridomicile. Diagnosis of Chagas disease infection was performed in 77.9% (88/113) of the inhabitants and the prevalence was 26.1%. A relatively high infection rate was observed in the 0-10 age group. Seropositives percentages increased with age and reached 66.6% in older than 40 years. Presence of T. infestans, human seroreactivity to T. cruzi, < or = 4 year old seropositives and precarious life conditions prove that this endemic disease is still a problem in the studied area.
