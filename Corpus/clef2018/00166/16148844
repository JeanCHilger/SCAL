Ganciclovir therapy for congenital cytomegalovirus infection in six infants. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common, and its morbidity rate is high. Ganciclovir (GCV) treatment has been used for congenital CMV infection, but there are few reports on viral loads associated with GCV therapy.A real-time PCR assay was used to monitor viral load in 6 cases of symptomatic CMV infection that received GCV therapy. Initially GCV was given at a dose of 5-12 mg/kg/d for 2-7 weeks. In 2 cases, additional doses were given as symptoms returned.After GCV administration, active signs of chorioretinitis, thrombocytopenia and anemia disappeared or improved in all cases. During GCV therapy, viral loads decreased while patients improved clinically and increased again when GCV therapy was stopped. Although CMV DNA continued to be detectable for a long period, clinical findings did not always worsen. In 2 cases, an improvement of hearing loss was observed.GCV therapy transiently suppresses the CMV concentrations. Subsequent increases of viral titers do not appear to be correlated with the clinical course or neurologic outcome.
