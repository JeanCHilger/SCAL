Polymerase chain reaction for detection of Toxoplasma gondii in human biological samples. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Toxoplasma gondii from gene TGR1E with primers TGR1E-1, TGR1E-2 (standard PCR), and from B1 gene with primers TM1, TM2, TM3 (hemi-nested PCR) was detected in biological samples from 347 individuals (441 biological materials). Of the total of 441 biological materials, T. gondii DNA was detected in 5.2 % it was positive in the following samples: blood (n = 6), blood from newborns (2), biopsies (2) and samples of progenitor cells (2) (from candidates for bone marrow transplantation). DNA of T. gondii was also revealed in 11 samples (8.3 %) of 120 cases of pregnant women during prenatal examinations. A positive result in the blood was also found in two cases of newborn babies from mothers who were infected in later pregnancy. The positive PCR examination was confirmed by serological methods (ELISA and complement fixation test). Agreement of PCR results and the detection of antibodies against toxoplasma was found in 83.3 %. Rapid PCR examination for the confirmation of acute parasitemia T. gondii is particularly important for the patients in whom the infection may cause serious consequences (e.g., for fetus in pregnant women or for patients suffering from imunosuppression).
