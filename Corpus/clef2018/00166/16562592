Isolated central diabetes insipidus in a newborn with congenital toxoplasmosis. We present a 5 day-old male newborn with isolated central diabetes insipidus due to congenital toxoplasmosis. This patient was referred to us for hydrocephalus. As we investigated the aetiology of the hydrocephalus, the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid tested positive for toxoplasmosis via ELISA and polymerase chain reaction. Computed tomography showed obstructive hydrocephalus and disseminated cranial calcifications. Central diabetes insipidus developed on the 10th day, apparently as a result of the toxoplasmosis infection, and was treated successfully with oral desmopressin.
