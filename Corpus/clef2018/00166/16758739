Influence of ureaplasma infection on the clinical state of newborns. The aim of this study was the analysis of the clinical state of newborns infected with various species of ureaplasma.50 prematurely born patients with respiratory disturbances and confirmed presence of ureaplasma in the respiratory tract were analyzed. Endotracheal aspirates were collected for examination. Presence of ureaplasma was confirmed by culture and a commercial test (Biomerieux), the ureaplasma species were identified using PCR.In 40 examined newborns Ureaplasma parvum (U.p.) was found, in 10 Ureaplasma urealyticum (U.u.). Newborns infected with U.u. were subject to more frequent and longer therapeutic procedures supporting respiration (respirator, nCPAP), needed more frequent surfactant and antibiotic administration. In the mentioned group the mortality rate was 33%, while in newborns infected with U.p. it was 15%.Initial results suggest worse clinical status and higher mortality of prematurely born infected with Ureaplasma urealyticum.
