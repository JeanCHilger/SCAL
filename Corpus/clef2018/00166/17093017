Age-related urinary excretion of BK polyomavirus by nonimmunocompromised individuals. Two polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV), are ubiquitous in the human population, generally infecting children asymptomatically and then persisting in renal tissue. It is generally thought that reactivation leads to productive infection for both viruses, with progeny shed in the urine. Several studies have shown that the rate of JC viruria increases with the age of the host, but a systematic approach to examine the shedding of BKV has not been developed. To elucidate the relationship between BK viruria and host age, we obtained urine from donors (healthy volunteers or nonimmunocompromised patients) who were divided into nine age groups, each containing 50 members. A high-sensitivity PCR was used to detect BKV and JCV DNA from urinary samples, and the specificity of amplification was confirmed by sequencing or restriction analysis of the amplified fragments. The rate of BK viruria was relatively low in subjects aged <30 years but gradually increased with age in subjects aged > or =30 years. However, BK viruria was less frequent than JC viruria in adults. The detected BKV isolates were classified into subtypes, and detection rates for individual subtypes were compared among age groups this analysis showed that viruria of subtypes I (the most prevalent subtype) and IV (the second most prevalent subtype) occurred more frequently in older subjects. Therefore, our results reveal new aspects of BK viruria in nonimmunocompromised individuals.
