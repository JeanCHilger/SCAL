Anticipating rotavirus vaccines in Brazil: detection and molecular characterization of emerging rotavirus serotypes G8 and G9 among children with diarrhoea in Recife, Brazil. In 2006, Brazil will initiate universal immunization of its 4-million infants with a live attenuated serotype G1P[8] human rotavirus vaccine. In anticipation of the national immunization program, this study was undertaken to characterize rotavirus strains circulating among children in Recife, one of the largest cities in the northeast region of Brazil. Group A rotaviruses were detected in 102 (35%) of 290 faecal specimens collected from children under 5 years of age who presented with acute diarrhoea during a 1-year period between May 2004 and April 2005. In addition to the globally common G1P[8] serotype that accounted for 49% of strains, emerging rotavirus serotypes G8P[6] and G9P[8] represented 2% and 29% of strains, respectively. Following cell culture adaptation, RNA-RNA hybridization demonstrated that two Brazilian G8P[6] rotavirus strains shared a high level of genomic RNA homology with Malawian G8P[6] strains, and a Brazilian G9P[8] strain was related most closely to a G9P[8] strain from India. The results suggest that certain rotavirus strains have a much wider global circulation than generally appreciated. Continued global spread of such strains might challenge the efficacy of current rotavirus vaccines.
