Molecular epidemiology of astrovirus type 1 in Belém, Brazil, as an agent of infantile gastroenteritis, over a period of 18 years (1982-2000): identification of two possible new lineages. Human astroviruses (HAstV) are worldwide recognized as important viral enteropathogens during childhood. This study aims to determine the incidence, genetic diversity and intertype variability of HAstV-1 in children less than 5 years of age enrolled in several studies conducted in Belém/Pará, and São Luís/Maranhão, Brazil, from December 1982 to May 2000. Using EIA and RT-PCR, an overall positivity of 6.1% (155/2.534) was achieved, of these, 140 were positive by RT-PCR. The analysis of a 348bp ORF2 fragment revealed that HAstV-1 was the predominant genotype (85/140, 60.7%) throughout the 18 years of study. Phylogenetic analysis was performed for 81 of these strains, and 76 (93.8%) were genetically classified as HAstV-1a. The remainder of strains (n=5) were assigned to possible new lineages, 1e and 1f. Four of these five strains were detected in 1983 and 1984, and the lineage 1a circulated during 10 consecutive years (1990/2000). Genome sequence variation was found among the HAstV-1 strains involving all lineages, but only five nucleotide changes translated into aminoacid changes over this period, suggesting that HAstV-1 was very stable. The data obtained in this study should be useful for further studies at molecular level, including improvement of disease surveillance based on molecular diagnostic tools, and vaccine development.
