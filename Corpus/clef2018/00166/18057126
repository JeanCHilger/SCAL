Evaluation of the one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR ProFlu-1 assay for detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses in children. We evaluated the one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR ProFlu-1 assay for the detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses from 353 pediatric nasopharyngeal aspirates. As assessed by comparison with the results of immunofluorescence testing and cell culture, the specificity and the sensitivity of the ProFlu-1 assay ranged from 97% to 100%. In addition, the ProFlu-1 assay amplified 9% of samples not detected by conventional methods.
