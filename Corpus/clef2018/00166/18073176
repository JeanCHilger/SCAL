Bacterial sepsis. Bacterial sepsis remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the newborn. The severe outcome of neonatal sepsis, despite the advances in perinatal and neonatal care and use of potent antibiotics, is related to the neonatal reduced immune defenses and the complex interactions between the infecting microorganism and the host responses. An early diagnosis, based on the clinical picture, the isolation of microorganisms and the positivity of inflammatory indexed, is mandatory. A timely treatment should be aimed to the elimination of pathogens with antimicrobials. Intravenous immunoglobulin and hematopoietic growth factors may be considered to improve the disturbed immune homeostases.
