Australian Rotavirus Surveillance Program: annual report, 2006-07. The National Rotavirus Reference Centre, together with collaborating laboratories Australia-wide, conducts a laboratory based rotavirus surveillance program. This report describes the serotypes of rotavirus strains responsible for the hospitalisation of children with acute gastroenteritis during the period 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007. One thousand and two faecal samples from across Australia were examined using a combined approach of monoclonal antibody immunoassays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and polyacrylamide gel analysis. Serotype G1 was the dominant serotype nationally, representing 36.7% of all strains, followed by serotype G9 (31.1%), and serotype G3 (23.3%). Serotype G2 represented less than 5% of strains, while no serotype G4 strains were identified. All G1, G3 and G9 strains assayed for P genotype contained the P[8] genotype, bar one G1 strain, which possessed a P[6]. Uncommon rotavirus genotypes, G8 (n = 1) and G12 (n = 2) were identified in children with acute gastroenteritis during this study period.
