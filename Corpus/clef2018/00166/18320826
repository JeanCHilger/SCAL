Discovery and identification of WU polyomavirus in children from Zhejing region. WU polyomavirus, which was firstly discovered in 2007, is a new human polyomavirus belonging to Polyomaviridae and containing circular double-stranded genomic DNA. In this study, the 278 clinical sputum specimens from children under 5 years old were collected from Wenzhou Medical College affiliated Wenling First Hospital, Zhejiang Province. Based on identification assay of WU polyomavirus previously reported, a WU polyomavirus was identified from clinical samples successfully, the positive rate was 0.4%. The sequences of PCR products were identical to that of VP2 gene and large T antigen gene derived from WU polyomavirus reported. The above results strongly suggested that the WU polyomavirus isolated was firstly found in Chinese children with acute lower respiratory tract infections. This study provides a firm basis for further research of WU polyomavirus.
