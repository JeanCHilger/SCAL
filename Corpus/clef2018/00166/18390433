Septicaemia with Capnocytophaga sputigena in a newborn child. We describe in this article a case of septicaemia with Capnocytophaga suptigena in a premature newborn child. The newborn child exhibited fever at birth, a light inflammatory syndrome and a respiratory failure. The germ was initially identified in the blood-culture of the newborn child by conventional techniques, and then confirmed by sequencing of the ARN 16S. After investigation, it was also found in the mother's vaginal sample. Capnocytophaga sputigena carried by the mother is certainly responsible for infection of the newborn child by ascending way. After antibiotherapy, both mother and child did not present aftereffects. This is the 16th case described in the literature Capnocytophaga sputigena carried in vaginal area is responsible for preterm labor and for septicaemia associated to respiratory failure of the newborn child. It is thus important not to neglect this germ and to estimate its sensibility to antibiotics.
