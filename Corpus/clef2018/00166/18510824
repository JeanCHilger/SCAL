Congenital tuberculosis: the value of laboratory investigations in diagnosis. Two cases of congenital tuberculosis are described. Case 1 presented at 12 days of age. The mother had been symptomatic for tuberculosis in the 1st trimester but was not diagnosed until her infant developed symptoms. The infant's gastric aspirate was acid-fast-bacilli (AFB)-positive and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture-positive. PCR on the gastric specimen and mother's sputum demonstrated identical strains. Case 2 presented at 45 days of age and the gastric aspirate was both AFB- and culture-positive. The mother was asymptomatic and contact-tracing of the family failed to detect infection. However, genital tuberculosis was demonstrated on an endometrial biopsy.
