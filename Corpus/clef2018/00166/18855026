Unexpected substitution of dominant rotavirus G genotypes in French hospitalized children over five consecutive seasons. The study was designed to evaluate the circulation of group A rotaviruses in French hospitalized children, and to detect unusual strains. This prospective study was conducted from 2001 to 2006 in children consulting for acute diarrhea at the pediatric emergency department in three French University Hospitals. The rotaviruses were detected by rapid test and genotyped by RT-PCR on the basis of their outer capsid proteins VP4 (P-type) and VP7 (G-type). The stools from 757 children were analyzed. G1P[8] strains were predominant (44.0%), followed by G9P[8] (17.7%), G3P[8] 13.1%, G4P[8] (9.5%), and G2P[4] (1.8%) mixed rotavirus infections occurred in 2.3%. G9 rotaviruses emerged during the 2004-2005 season (73.4%) and remained the second most prevalent strains. Few unusual strains, G6, G8, G12 and P[6]-types, were detected. The monitoring of rotavirus infections should be maintained to document strain distribution and to assess the emergence of new reassortants that may not respond to current rotavirus vaccines.
