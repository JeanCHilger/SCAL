Congenital measles caused by transplacental infection. We report the case of a male infant born to a mother diagnosed as having measles before delivery. Although he was given standard immunoglobulin soon after delivery, he developed congenital measles. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology and PCR assay from the infant's pharyngeal secretions.
