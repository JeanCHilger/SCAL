Lymphoepithelial cyst of the parotid gland: its possible histopathogenesis based on clinicopathologic analysis of 64 cases. Sixty-four cases of lymphoepithelial cysts of the parotid gland, the largest scale collection in the literature, were clinicopathologically analyzed for their possible pathogenesis. All 64 cases were unilateral, 27 left and 37 right. There were 28 male and 36 female patients with a ratio of 1:1.3. The mean age of the patients was 52.0 years, and their average duration of symptoms was 29.3 months. The mean longest diameter of the cysts was 3.0 cm. Histologically, lymphoepithelial cysts were classified into 3 subtypes: type I, a cystic dilation of ducts within parotid glands (9 cases, 14.1%) type II, partially demarcated cystic lesions with lymphoid stroma (27, 42.2%)
