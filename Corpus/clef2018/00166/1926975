Prenatal rubella diagnosis. Primary rubella infections during the first trimester of pregnancy are an indication for the termination, although not all of fetuses will be infected. Concerning this situation a prenatal rubella diagnostic in 55 pregnant women was carried out to demonstrate a fetal infection. Simultaneously or separately, as methods the determination of rubella IgM antibodies in fetal blood, the demonstration of viral RNA by DNA-RNA-hybridization and the cultivation of rubella virus from amniotic fluid samples were used. In 7 of 40 women the investigation of amniotic fluids showed a positive reaction of the hybridization, in 2 cases a rubella virus could be isolated. IgM rubella antibodies were found in 5 fetuses. Because of its insufficient effectivity at present the prenatal rubella diagnostic should be applied only in special situations, e.g. in cases of a wanted child.
