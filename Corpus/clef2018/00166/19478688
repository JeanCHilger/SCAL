Cytomegalovirus blood viral load and hearing loss in young children with congenital infection. This study was designed to determine whether elevated viral load in infants and young children is associated with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related hearing loss.Blood samples were obtained from 135 children with congenital CMV infection. CMV DNA in the peripheral blood was quantitated with a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Viral load measurements were analyzed in 3 different age groups (<2 months, 2-12 months, 12-36 months).In children with symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, CMV DNA levels were not different between children with hearing deficit and those with normal hearing in all 3 age groups. In children with asymptomatic infection, the positive predictive value of a peripheral blood viral load >3500 genomic equivalents per milliliter (ge/mL) at <2 months and 2 to 12 months of age is 8%, and at 12 to 36 months of age is 11.8%. However, the negative predictive value of a viral load <3500 ge/mL is 94.4% at <2 months of age, and 100% at 2 to 36 months of age.Peripheral blood viral load is not associated with hearing loss in children with congenital CMV infection. However, a viral load of <3500 ge/mL is associated with a lower risk of hearing loss in children born with asymptomatic congenital infection.
