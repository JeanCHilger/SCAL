Human parechovirus-3 infection: emerging pathogen in neonatal sepsis. Human parechovirus-3 (HPeV-3) is an emerging pathogen that has been described as a cause of neonatal sepsis. Human parechoviruses are a family of viruses closely related to enteroviruses however, enteroviral PCR will not detect HPeVs. We present clinical details of neonatal meningoencephalitis and hepatitis-coagulopathy syndrome caused by HPeV-3 infection.
