Group B streptococcus and early-onset sepsis in the era of maternal prophylaxis. Despite an era of marked success with universal screening, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) continues to be an important cause of early-onset sepsis, and thus remains a significant public health issue. Improved eradication of GBS colonization and disease may involve universal screening in conjunction with rapid diagnostic technologies or other novel approaches. Given the complications and potential limitations associated with maternal intrapartum prophylaxis, however, vaccines may be the most effective means of preventing neonatal GBS disease. The global utility of conjugated GBS vaccines may be hampered by the variability of serotypes in diverse populations and geographic locations. Modern technologies, such as those involving proteomics and genomic sequencing, are likely to hasten the development of a universal vaccine against GBS.
