Human bocavirus. Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified parvovirus associated with acute respiratory infections in young children in different parts of the world. It is not inconceivable that this virus is also capable of causing acute gastroenteritis and asymptomatically persisting in infected children. HBoV is the third widespread human respiratory virus after respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. Polymerase chain reaction remains the most reliable of HBoV detection in clinical samples. Phylogenetic analysis shows the presence of at least 2 circulating variants (genotypes) of HBoV.
