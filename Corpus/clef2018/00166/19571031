Evaluation of a new rapid antigen test using immunochromatography for detection of human metapneumovirus in comparison with real-time PCR assay. A new rapid human metapneumovirus (hMPV) detection kit using immunochromatography (SAS hMPV test) was compared to real-time PCR for 224 nasal swab specimens, 96.4% of which were obtained from children of <15 years of age. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 82.3% and 93.8%, respectively, suggesting that this test is useful for pediatricians to diagnose hMPV infection in a clinical setting.
