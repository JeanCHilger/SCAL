Evaluation for Helicobacter pylori in Meckel's diverticulum by using real-time PCR. Although Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been identified in heterotopic gastric mucosa of Meckel's diverticulum, controversial results are reported in the pertinent literature.The aim of this study was to evaluate for the presence of H. pylori histologically using hematoxylin-eosin and Toluidine Blue in Meckel's diverticulum and by real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in those with heterotopic gastric mucosa.The study included 21 consecutive patients who had undergone resection of Meckel's diverticulum at our hospital between 1995 and 2007. The paraffin-embedded tissues were retrieved and reviewed for the presence of histological abnormalities and H. pylori-like organisms and for the presence or absence of heterotopic mucosa. H. pylori was sought in those cases that contained heterotopic gastric mucosa using real-time TaqMan PCR to amplify a fragment of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of H. pylori.Upon histological examination, heterotopic gastric mucosa was found to be present in 12 cases. H. pylori was not identified in any of the sections examined. A genomic PCR product was also not obtained in real-time PCR study.We have confirmed that colonization of H. pylori, if it occurs at all, is exceedingly rare in heterotopic gastric mucosa of Meckel's diverticulum.
