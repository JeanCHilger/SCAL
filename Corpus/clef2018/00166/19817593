Multicenter, hospital-based surveillance of rotavirus disease and strains among indian children aged <5 years. Current, nationally representative data on rotavirus disease burden and rotavirus strains in India are needed to understand the potential health benefits of rotavirus vaccination.The Indian Rotavirus Strain Surveillance Network was established with 4 laboratories and 10 hospitals in 7 different regions of India. At each hospital, children aged <5 years who presented with acute gastroenteritis and required hospitalization with rehydration for at least 6 h were enrolled. A fecal specimen was obtained and was tested for rotavirus with use of a commercial enzyme immunoassay, and strains were characterized using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.From December 2005 through November 2007, rotavirus was found in approximately 39% of 4243 enrolled patients. Rotavirus was markedly seasonal in northern temperate locations but was less seasonal in southern locations with a tropical climate. Rotavirus detection rates were greatest among children aged 6-23 months, and 13.3% of rotavirus infections involved children aged <6 months. The most common types of strains were G2P[4] (25.7% of strains), G1P[8] (22.1%), and G9P[8] (8.5%) G12 strains were seen in combination with types P[4], P[6], and P[8] and together comprised 6.5% of strains.These data highlight the need for development and implementation of effective prophylactic measures, such as vaccines, to prevent the large burden of rotavirus disease among Indian children.
