Invasive infections caused by non-Aspergillus moulds identified by sequencing analysis at a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan, 2000-2008. The clinical and microbiological characteristics of 103 patients with cultures positive for non-Aspergillus moulds in the period 2000 to 2008 were described. Among these patients, 27 had proven or probable invasive infections caused by Fusarium (n = 12), Paecilomyces (n = 7), Zygomycetes (n = 5) and Scedopsorium species (n = 3). The incidence of invasive infections caused by these moulds has not increased during the study period. Lung was the most common infection site and disseminated disease was observed in three leukaemic patients. The overall mortality rate was 40.7%, and was highest in cases zygomycosis. Antifungal susceptibility varied considerably among species. Amphotericin B and posaconazole demonstrated greatest activity against these moulds.
