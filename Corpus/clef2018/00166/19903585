Rapid detection and differentiation of the exfoliative toxin A-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains based on phiETA prophage polymorphisms. The exfoliative toxin A (ETA) is encoded by the gene located on Staphylococcus aureus prophages. We have developed a single-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid and specific detection of various phiETA prophages of serogroup B responsible for dissemination of eta gene and ETA production in clinical strains. This PCR strategy enabled to classify the ETA-positive strains into 6 groups designated ETA-B1, ETA-B2, ETA-B3, ETA-B4, ETA-B5, and ETA-B6. The method was tested on a diverse set of 101 ETA and/or ETB-positive S. aureus strains isolated in 22 Czech maternity hospitals and 1 Slovak maternity hospital between 1998 and 2009. This novel PCR strategy is reliable in the rapid identification of yet undescribed ETA-converting B prophages and differentiation of the closely related ETA-positive strains, and it is a convenient tool for hospital epidermolytic infection control.
