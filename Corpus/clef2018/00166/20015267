Impact of diagnostic procedures on patient management and hospitalization cost during the 2000 and 2005 enterovirus epidemics in Marseilles, France. Enteroviruses are frequent aetiological agents of central nervous system infections in humans. In 2000 and 2005, two large outbreaks of Echovirus 30 (a member of species human enterovirus B) were observed in the University Hospitals of Marseilles (France). Between the two epidemics, the diagnostic protocols for enterovirus infection were modified, moving from viral cultures and classic RT-PCR in 2000 to real-time RT-PCR in 2005. We compared some viral and epidemiological characteristics of the 2000 and 2005 outbreaks with special attention to diagnostic procedures and to the subsequent clinical management of patients. Despite similar virological and epidemiological characteristics during both outbreaks, our results show that real-time RT-PCR techniques used in 2005 noticeably shortened the period of time necessary to deliver diagnostic results and suggest that this was associated with a decrease in the duration of hospitalization for positive cases. In conclusion, this study suggests that the improvement of enterovirus diagnosis had a major financial impact on the management of the 2005 epidemic in Marseilles and may constitute an interesting example of how new diagnostic methods in microbiology can be self-financed through improvement in patient management.
