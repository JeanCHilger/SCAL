Molecular detection and characterization of noroviruses from children in Botswana. Stool specimens were collected from 100 children in Botswana. RT-PCR analysis detected noroviruses (NoVs) in 24% of samples tested. Genogroup I and genogroup II strains were identified. There was no association between NoV detection and age or gender. This study is the first indication that NoVs circulate widely in Botswana.
