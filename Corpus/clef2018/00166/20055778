Skin and soft tissue infections caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus among children in China. To investigate the characteristic of community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) among children in China.Forty-seven children with CA-MRSA SSTIs were enrolled in this study. Clinical information was collected and analysed. The strains from the children were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and spa typing. The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene was also detected.The majority of the 47 cases were impetigo (20 42.6%) and abscesses (14The most common disease of CA-MRSA SSTIs was impetigo, and PVL-positive abscess was associated with incision and drainage. ST59-MRSA-IV with t437 was the most prevalent clone, and the multiresistant rate was high in Chinese children.
