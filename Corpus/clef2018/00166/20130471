Antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent perinatal HIV transmission in St. Petersburg, Russia: too little, too late. We evaluated the influence of type and timing of prophylaxis on perinatal HIV transmission in St. Petersburg, Russia.We linked surveillance data for 1498 HIV-infected mothers delivering from 2004 to 2007 with polymerase chain reaction data for 1159 infants to determine predictors of transmission.The overall perinatal transmission rate was 6.3% [73 of 1159, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9% to 7.7%]. Among the 12.8% (n = 149) of mother-infant pairs receiving full course (antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal) dual/triple antiretroviral prophylaxis, the transmission rate was 2.7%. Among the 1010 receiving less complete regimens (full course zidovudine, single-dose nevirapine, or incomplete), transmission ranged from 4.1% to 12.2%. Among the 28.9% (330) of mothers initiating antiretroviral drugs <or=20 weeks gestation, perinatal transmission was 1.8%, compared with 4.0%, 8.6%, and 11.3% for those initiating antiretrovirals at 21-28 weeks, 29-42 weeks, or during labor and delivery, respectively (P for trend <0.0001). Compared with those initiating antepartum prophylaxis <or=20 weeks, those initiating antepartum prophylaxis >or=29 weeks (or not at all) had increased transmission odds (adjusted odds ratio: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.8 to 12.9 odds ratio: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.0 to 13.1, respectively).In St. Petersburg, the potential for further reductions in perinatal transmission is evident, given low transmission among women receiving early combination prophylaxis.
