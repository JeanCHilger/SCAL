Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus aureus in Lebanon. Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen and is a growing public health concern. In this study, 130 S. aureus, 93 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 37 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), clinical isolates recovered from Lebanon were typed by protein A gene (spa) sequencing and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Forty-eight different spa types were identified and clustered into 30 different groups. MLST revealed 10 sequence types (STs) among the isolates. There were eight major MRSA clones defined as isolates with the same ST and the same SCCmec type. The majority of the PVL-positive isolates (53%) were ST80-MRSA-IVc. Systematic surveillance of both hospital and community isolates in Lebanon together with measures designed to limit the spread are required.
