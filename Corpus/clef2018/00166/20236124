De novo duplication of MECP2 in a girl with mental retardation and no obvious dysmorphic features. Loss-of-function mutations of MECP2 are responsible for Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mainly girls. The availability of MECP2 testing has led to the identification of such mutations in girls with atypical RTT features and the recognition of milder forms. Furthermore, duplication of the entire gene has recently been described in boys with mental retardation and recurrent infections. We describe a girl with a heterozygous de novo MECP2 duplication. The patient, at the age of 19, has mental retardation with no autistic features. She is friendly but gets frequently anxious. She has neither dysmorphic features nor malformations. Her motor development was delayed with walking at 20 months. Speech is fluid with good pronunciation but is simple and repetitive. Diagnosis was made after single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of MECP2. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis showed a duplication of 29 kb including MECP2 and part of IRAK1. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has revealed that the duplicated region is inserted near the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 10. X-chromosome inactivation in leukocyte DNA was not skewed. We conclude that it is likely that this MECP2 duplication is responsible for the mental retardation in this patient. This case broadens the phenotypic spectrum of MECP2 abnormalities with consequent implication in diagnosis and genetic counselling of girls with non-syndromic mental retardation.
