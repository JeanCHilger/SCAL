Etiology of DNA virus infections in liver transplant recipients with neonatal hepatitis. Neonatal hepatitis is a syndrome of symptoms associated with a history that includes any type of infectious, genetic, toxic, or metabolic causation. Various infectious agents have been implicated in hepatic inflammation in neonates including bacterial and viral pathogens, especially DNA viruses. We used molecular and antigenic methods to evaluate the role of DNA viruses, such as hepatitis type B viruses (HBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and adenovirus, in neonatal hepatitis complications. Twenty-six paraffin-embedded biopsy and autopsy tissues obtained between 1996 and 2007 from 22 infants with neonatal hepatitis were studied retrospectively. The genome prevalence of HBV, HCMV, HSV, and adenovirus were analysed using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. The antigenic presentation of HSV-1, HSV-2, HBV, HCMV, and adenovirus were evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods. The HCMV genome was detected separately in 1 of 22 (4.5%) paraffin-embedded autopsy and biopsy tissues. Also 3/22 (13.6%) samples were infected with HBV and HSV genomes. HBV and HSV-1 antigens were present in 1/26 (4.5%) neonatal samples and HSV-2 antigens in 5/26 (22.7%) by IHC protocols, but adenovirus and HCMV antigens were not detected among samples from infants with neonatal hepatitis. Detection of separate co-infections of HSV, HCMV, and HBV genomes in autopsy and biopsy tissues of HBV and HSV-1 or HSV-2 antigens in these patients, showed the importance of these viral infections in clinical neonatal hepatitis.
