Molecular identification of human enteroviruses in children with neurological infections from the central region of Argentina. In the central area of Argentina, epidemiological and molecular characteristics of human enterovirus infections are still unknown. RT-nested PCR of the highly conserved 5'NCR was used to detect enteroviruses in 168 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from hospitalized patients with suspected infection of the central nervous system (2007-2008), and 13 (7.7%) were positive. Molecular typing was performed by sequencing of the 3'-half VP1 region. Echovirus 30 was the predominant type detected, followed by coxsackie viruses A9 and B4. All echovirus 30 strains of 2007 clustered in lineage H, whereas the echovirus 30 isolate obtained in 2008 was more distantly related, possibly representing a new lineage.
