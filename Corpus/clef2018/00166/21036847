Symptomatic and asymptomatic Cryptosporidium infections in children in a semi-urban slum community in southern India. Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of childhood diarrhea in developing countries. We investigated symptomatic and asymptomatic cryptosporidiosis in 20 children less than two years of age in a semi-urban slum in southern India. All surveillance (conducted every two weeks) and diarrheal samples from 20 children (n = 1,036) with cryptosporidial diarrhea previously identified by stool microscopy were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism for species and subgenotype determination. Thirty-five episodes of cryptosporidiosis were identified in 20 children, of which 25 were diarrheal. Fifteen episodes were associated with prolonged oocyst shedding. Multiple episodes of cryptosporidiosis occurred in 40% of the children. Most infections were with C. hominis, subtype Ia. Children with multiple infections had significantly lower weight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores at 24 months but had scores comparable with children with a single episode by 36 months. Multiple symptomatic Cryptosporidium infections associated with prolonged oocyst shedding occur frequently in this disease-endemic area and may contribute to the long-term effects of cryptosporidiosis on physical growth in these children.
