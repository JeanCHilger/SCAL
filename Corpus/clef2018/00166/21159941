Adenovirus infections in hospitalized patients in Israel: epidemiology and molecular characterization. Adenoviruses can cause a broad spectrum of clinical diseases, most of which are self-limited. However, adenovirus infection can occasionally result in severe or lethal infection. Fifty-five adenovirus serotypes are known today, and they are classified into 7 subgroups (subgroups A to G). Here we examined 282 samples derived from hospitalized patients in Israel (September 2006 to August 2008) who were diagnosed as suffering from adenovirus infections. We used a recently described PCR amplification method and subsequent sequencing to identify the adenovirus. In addition, we studied the medical charts of 106 hospitalized patients from Sheba Medical Center in Israel. The most prevalent adenovirus serotypes found were serotypes 1 (22.8%), 2 (19.2%), 7 (18%), and 3 (14%). In addition, we identified several serotypes that have not been identified previously in Israel. Overall, serotypes of subgroup B were found to be approximately 4 times more prevalent among immunocompromised children than among generally healthy children (52.6% P < 0.007). The realization that the virus subtypes are different among healthy and immunocompromised patients may lead to more efficient treatment of adenovirus infections among immunocompromised children in the future.
