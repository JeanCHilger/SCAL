Prospective study of congenital toxoplasmosis screening with use of IgG avidity and multiplex nested PCR methods. Acute infection with Toxoplasma gondii during pregnancy can cause congenital toxoplasmosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether screening with the use of IgG avidity and multiplex nested PCR methods was effective to detect a high-risk pregnancy. In a prospective study, serum T. gondii IgG avidity was measured in consecutive 146 pregnant women testing positive for T. gondii antibody and either positive or equivocal for IgM. Multiplex nested PCR for T. gondii DNA on amniotic fluid, maternal blood, and umbilical cord blood were performed with informed consent. A total of 51 (34.9%) women presented with low IgG avidity (<30%), 15 (10.3%) presented with borderline avidity (30 to 35%), and 80 (54.8%) presented with high avidity (>35%) indices. Amniotic fluid obtained at amniocentesis or birth yielded positive PCR results in nine women with low IgG avidity indices. Of these nine women, three had congenital toxoplasmosis. None of women with high or border line IgG avidity indices had a positive PCR result in the amniotic fluid or congenital toxoplasmosis. No congenital toxoplasmosis was detected in women whose amniotic fluids yielded negative PCR results. Ingestion of raw or undercooked meat was found to be the main risk factor for acute T. gondii infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis screening with a combination of IgG avidity in the maternal blood and multiplex nested PCR in the amniotic fluid was useful for detecting a high risk pregnancy and diagnosing congenital toxoplasmosis.
