Differentiating inherited human herpesvirus type 6 genome from primary human herpesvirus type 6 infection by means of dried blood spot from the newborn screening card. To differentiate active human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) infection from inherited HHV-6 (iHHV-6), we analyzed dried blood spots from archived newborn screening cards in 3 patients with high HHV-6 DNA copy numbers. Two patients were positive for HHV-6 DNA as neonates suggesting iHHV-6. In 1 patient, the absence of HHV-6 DNA excluded iHHV-6.
