Influenza A H1N1 in neonatal intensive care unit: analysis and lessons. Since WHO announced the flu-like pandemic H1N1v in autumn 2009, data on clinical presentation and treatment of H1N1v infection in preterm infants with oseltamivir remain scarce. We cared for four infected preterm infants and ordered prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir in 13 additional contact preterm infants. A number of lessons can be drawn from this experience. The first two cases in twins were revealed by an increase in the number of apnea and one infant required mechanical ventilation. Cough was the major symptom in the two other infected infants. No digestive intolerance was observed among the 17 preterm infants during oseltamivir treatment. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quickly determined whether an infant was infected, making it helpful in deciding on initial containment. PCR remained positive, whereas culture became negative. Therefore, culture appeared to be more relevant in deciding on the end of containment. Follow-up of the four infected infants showed their ability to develop immunity against H1N1v.
