Fulminant gestational hepatitis due to primary herpes simplex type 2 infection: use of serum HSV polymerase chain reaction for noninvasive diagnosis. Acute gestational hepatitis from herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. We present the first reported case of primary HSV type 2 hepatitis in a pregnant woman who was diagnosed by detection of HSV-2 viremia via real-time polymerase chain reaction. The patient was successfully treated with acyclovir and delivered a healthy infant.
