A novel real-time PCR method for determination and quantification of each cytomegalovirus glycoprotein H subtype in clinical samples. To investigate reinfection in patients with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, we established a CMV subtype-specific real-time quantitative PCR method targeting the CMV gH epitope region that can be used for evaluating pathogenic CMV strains in cases of mixed CMV infection.
