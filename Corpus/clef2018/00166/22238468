Reduction of antimalarial antibodies by HIV infection is associated with increased risk of Plasmodium falciparum cord blood infection. Plasmodium falciparum infection in pregnancy can lead to congenital malaria, which has detrimental health consequences for infants. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) might increase cord blood P. falciparum infection by decreasing maternal antimalarial-specific antibodies.HIV-negative (n=133) and HIV-positive (n=55) Mozambican pregnant women were assessed at delivery for maternal and cord P. falciparum infection by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and P. falciparum-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry.Prevalence of qPCR-detected cord blood infection was 8.0%. Risk of cord infection was increased in presence of HIV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.80 P=.04) and placental malaria (AOR, 22.08HIV-associated impairment of antibody responses in pregnant women may contribute to a higher transmission of P. falciparum to their infants.
