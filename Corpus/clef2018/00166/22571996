Molecular detection and incidence of human papillomavirus in neonates: methodology and a pilot study in a medical center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can cause laryngeal papillomas in children. Vertical transmission has been confirmed. This study aimed to establish a sensitive molecular diagnostic method and understand the incidence of the HPV-6 and HPV-11 in neonates with intubation.We enrolled 108 newborns between October 2007 and January 2010. All neonates were intubated due to underlying disease. The specimens were collected via endotracheal aspiration. DNA of HPV types 6 and 11 was detected by real-time PCR and nested PCR.HPV-DNA was detected in eight of the 108 newborns studied. Seven respiratory specimens tested positive for HPV-11 and one was positive for HPV-6. The HPV 6/11 detection rate in neonates was 7.4% (8/108).A rapid, sensitive, specific, and reproducible RT-PCR method and nest PCR were developed for the detection and differentiation of HPV-6 and HPV-11 genomic variants in a single PCR reaction. The assays are of great value for clinical and epidemiologic studies of HPV-6 and HPV-11 infections. Neonatal HPV colonization may be related to juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The transmission route may be from mother to child. The clinical significance of neonatal carriage of HPV-6 or HPV-11 warrants further study.
