Viral infection of central nervous system in children: one year prospective study. Viral infection of central nervous system (CNS) is a common problem worldwide, especially in children. The clinical manifestations of viral CNS infection are the most important clues for diagnosis and treatment. The 1-year prospective study to explore the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings of viral CNS infection in children, including human herpes virus (HHV) type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7, enterovirus B, mumps virus, measles virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, JC virus, BK polyomavirus, Nipha virus and influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2) were performed. Total of 71 children suspected CNS infection, aged between 2 days to 12.9 years were enrolled from May 2009 to April 2010. Total 4 children with non CNS infection, 5 bacterial meningitis, 2 tuberculous meningitis CNS infection were excluded. The HHV2 (50.0%) was the most common viral CNS infection. Other viral CNS infection included HHV1 (11.60%), VZV (6.7%), HHV6 (3.3%), HHV7 (3.3%), enterovirus B (1.67%) and H3N2 (1.67%). Diarrhea, irritability and CSF pleocytosis may helpful for differentiation between subtype of viral CNS infection.
