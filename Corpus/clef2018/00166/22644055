MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and microsatellite markers to evaluate Candida parapsilosis transmission in neonatal intensive care units. Recent studies on outbreaks of Candida showed an increased incidence of bloodstream infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) caused by C. parapsilosis species, highlighting the need for the proper identification and epidemiology of these species. Several systems are available for molecular epidemiological and taxonomic studies of fungal infections: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) represents the gold standard for typing, but is also one of the most lengthy and expensive, while simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and is, therefore, faster. Only recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been used to identify and type microorganisms involved in nosocomial outbreaks. In our study, 19 strains of C. parapsilosis isolated from the blood cultures of neonates admitted to the University Hospital Federico II were genotyped by the amplification of eight SSR markers and by MALDI-TOF MS. Electrophoretic and spectrometric profile results were compared in order to identify similarities among the isolates and to study microevolutionary changes in the C. parapsilosis population. The discriminatory power and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrograms generated were compared in order to evaluate the correlation of the groups established by the analysis of the clusters by both methods. Both methods were rapid and effective in highlighting identical strains and studying microevolutionary changes in the population. Our study evidenced that mass spectroscopy is a useful technique not only for the identification but also for monitoring the spread of strains, which is critical to control nosocomial infections.
