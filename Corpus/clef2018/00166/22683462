Chromosomal microarray analysis of functional Xq27-qter disomy and deletion 3p26.3 in a boy with Prader-Willi like features and hypotonia. Duplications of the long arm of the X chromosome are rare. The infantile phenotype shares some resemblance with the Prader-Willi syndrome, presenting severe psychomotor retardation, facial dysmorphic features with a broad face, a small mouth and a thin pointed nose, hypotonia, urogenital malformation and proneness to infections. We report a boy with an additional Xq27-qter chromosome segment translocated onto the short arm of chromosome 3. The karyotype was 46,XY,der(3)t(X3)(q27.3
