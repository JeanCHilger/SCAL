Use of cytomegalovirus hyperimmunoglobulin for prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus disease: a retrospective analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the current prenatal "off-label use" of cytomegalovirus hyperimmunoglobulin (CMV-HIG) in the prevention and treatment of congenital CMV (cCMV) infection, including the long-term outcome of the children.This retrospective observational study comprised mothers and their children, born between January 1, 2006, and October 30, 2010. Prenatal CMV-HIG was administered after diagnosis of primary CMV infection of the mother. Clinical and virological data were collected from maternal and pediatric medical and laboratory reports. Follow-up was 12-36 months after birth.Forty-two women and 43 children met the study criteria. In total, 40 mothers and six unborn infants received 115 doses of CMV-HIG. The treatment group (TG CMV-DNA polymerase chain reaction-positive amniotic fluid) included four mothersCMV-HIG was well tolerated. Compared with published untreated mother-child pairs, we observed a trend toward a smaller risk for intrauterine CMV transmission following CMV-HIG application. Signs of prenatal cCMV disease were not reversed after CMV-HIG.
