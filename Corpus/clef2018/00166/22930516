Phylogenetic analysis of rubella virus strains during an outbreak in S達o Paulo, 2007-2008. Rubella virus (RV) is an important human pathogen that causes rubella, an acute contagious disease. It also causes severe birth defects collectively known as congenital rubella syndrome when infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Here, we present the phylogenetic analysis of RV that circulated in S達o Paulo during the 2007-2008 outbreak. Samples collected from patients diagnosed with rubella were isolated in cell culture and sequenced. RV RNA was obtained from samples or RV-infected cell cultures and amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequences were assigned to genotypes by phylogenetic analysis using RV reference sequences. Seventeen sequences were analyzed, and three genotypes were identified: 1a, 1G, and 2B. Genotypes 1a and 1G, which were isolated in 2007, were responsible for sporadic rubella cases in S達o Paulo. Thereafter, in late 2007, the epidemiological conditions changed, resulting in a large RV outbreak with the clear dominance of genotype 2B. The results of this study provide new approaches for monitoring the progress of elimination of rubella from S達o Paulo, Brazil.
