Laboratory survey on the incidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii - obviously a peculiar fungus, but also a rare pathogen?. Pneumocystsis jirovecii is a peculiar fungus for a variety of reasons. This opportunistic pathogen multiplies in humans only under certain conditions a defect in the T-cell defense system creates a predisposition to this infection. In 2010 a data survey (IFT as well as PCR) from a few laboratories in Germany revealed 412 positive individuals. Even if only a few patients test positive for the colonization stage of this pathogen, the sheer number of individuals testing positive for other stages of infection indicate that the incidence of pneumocystosis in immunocompromised patients in Germany is underestimated.
