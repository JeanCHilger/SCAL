A comparative study of virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction, and antigen detection in children of mothers infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We report on an investigation designed to compare the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with culture and p24 measurement for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants and children. Forty-five children born of mothers with antibodies to HIV type 1 were studied P24 antigen was measured in plasma, and HIV-1 proviral DNA was sought in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by PCR. In 26 cases, blood specimens were cultured for HIV
