Evaluation of the LightCycler® SeptiFast test in newborns and infants with clinical suspicion of sepsis. Neonatal sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and prompt antimicrobial therapy are crucial for a favorable outcome of the newborn child. Blood culture, the current "gold standard" method for diagnosing bloodstream infections, has a low sensitivity in newborns. We evaluated the multiplex real-time PCR LightCycler(®) SeptiFast (LC-SF) for detection of bloodstream infections in newborns, compared with conventional blood culture.A total of 42 blood samples were obtained from 35 subjects presenting with a febrile episode and hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit at Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves. Two samples were collected during each febrile episode in order to carry out LC-SF assay and blood culture, respectively.Sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 87%, respectively, compared with clinical diagnosis, were obtained for LC-SF. Contamination rate of blood cultures was 16.7%, mainly due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and viridans groups of streptococci. Contamination rate of LC-SF by CoNS was 2.4%. Concordance between LC-SF and blood culture was moderate (kappa index: 0.369). LC-SF demonstrated a higher concordance (kappa index: 0.729) with the final clinical diagnosis than blood culture (kappa index: 0.238).LC-SF assay could be a useful diagnostic tool, along with a conventional blood culture, in newborn, for confirming or ruling out those cases that blood culture could not determine, shortening the time to result to 7 hours.
