Virological tools for the diagnosis, the prognosis and the surveillance of congenital cytomegalovirus infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the main cause of congenital infection in industrialized countries. The virological tools used for the diagnosis of congenital CMV are serology for diagnosis of primary infection in the mother, CMV PCR in amniotic fluid for diagnosis of fetal infection, PCR in urine or saliva for neonatal diagnosis and PCR in dried blood spots on Guthrie cards for retrospective diagnosis in young children. The prognostic value of viral load in amniotic fluid, fetal blood and neonatal blood will be discussed. The performance of the virological tests for antenatal or postnatal screening of congenital CMV will also be discussed.
