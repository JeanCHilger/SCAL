Molecular typing of adenoviruses isolated from clinical specimens by PCR and DNA sequencing methods. Adenoviruses are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, including upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URTIs and LRTIs, respectively), conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and hemorrhagic cystitis. The aim of this study was to determine the adenovirus (AdV) types isolated from clinical specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. A total of 22 AdV strains isolated between January 1st 2011 to May 31th 2011, from various samples (295 nasopharyngeal swabs, 42 conjunctival swabs, 13 stool) sent to our routine virology laboratory were included in the study. Of the 22 patients whose samples yielded adenovirus positivity, 8 were adult (4 were male median age: 32.5 years) and 14 (7 were male
