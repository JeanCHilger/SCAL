Clinical features and molecular diagnosis of three patients with DiGeorge anomaly. To investigate the clinical features and molecular diagnostic methods of three patients with DiGeorge anomaly.The clinical manifestations and immunological features of the three cases with DiGeorge anomaly were analyzed. We detected the chromosome 22q11.2 gene deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).(1) CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: All three cases had varying degrees of infection, congenital heart disease and small thymus by imaging two cases had significant hypocalcemia (1.11 mmol/L and 1.22 mmol/L, respectively), accompanied by convulsionsDiGeorge anomaly showed diverse clinical manifestations. We should consider the disease if patients had congenital heart disease, thymic hypoplasia, hypocalcemia and/or impaired immune function. FISH for detecting chromosome 22q11.2 gene deletion can be used as accurate and rapid diagnostic method. Thymosin treatment and other clinical intervention may help to improve the prognosis of patients with partial DiGeorge anomaly.
