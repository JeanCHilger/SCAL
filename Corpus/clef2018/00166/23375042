Pathogen diagnosis of children sepsis by LAMP technology. To explore a rapid diagnostic method in neonatal sepsis and bacterial meningitis.The primers were designed and synthesized based on 16S rRNA gene of Staphylococcus aureus. Four specimens of Staphylococcus aureus, 16 specimens of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 2 specimens of Enterococci, 3 specimens of Streptococcus, 1 specimen of Micrococcus, 3 specimens of Escherichia coli, 4 specimens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 specimens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 specimens of Enterobacter cloacae, and 5 specimens of Acinetobacter were tested by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A total of 118 clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were collected and detected with both LAMP assay and blood culture.By designing primers specific for Staphylococcus aureus, specimens containing different kinds of pathogens were carried out by LAMP assay, and our data showed LAMP technology for the specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus in samples was successfully established. All clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were tested by both blood cultures and LAMP, and our data showed that compared wit blood culture method, the LAMP technology showed significantly high detection rate (P <0.01).As a quick and easy detection of Staphylococcus aureus, the LAMP technology was successfully established, laid the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of children Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and showed great promotion and application value.
