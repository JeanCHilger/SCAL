Multilocus sequence typing of DNA from faecal specimens for the analysis of intra-familial transmission of Helicobacter pylori. This study used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of total DNA extracted from faecal specimens to genotype Helicobacter pylori to analyse intra-familial transmission. Faecal DNA was extracted and amplified by nested PCR. The products were analysed by direct sequencing and the allele type was determined using an MLST website. Mother-to-child transmission was suspected in at least two of three families, and father-to-child transmission was suspected in one family.
