Prevalence of viruses in stool of premature neonates at a neonatal intensive care unit. Premature neonates represent a population highly vulnerable to infection. This study aims to profile viral colonisation of gut and the associated clinical manifestations among premature neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Australia.In a cohort of 75 premature neonates born at less than 32 weeks gestation, who were followed for 4 weeks following admission to a NICU in Sydney, Australia, multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine viral presence in stool, and clinical data were examined.Overall, viral RNA or DNA was detected in 24/419 (5.7%) of specimens, including norovirus genogroup 2 (1.9%), enterovirus (1.2%), herpes simplex virus-2 (1.2%), cytomegalovirus (0.7%), Epstein-Barr virus (0.5%) and rotavirus (0.2%). Viral infection was detected in 13/75 (17%) of premature neonates at some time point, including five (7%) neonates shedding more than one type of virus in stool. A higher rate of infection was observed among premature neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (56%) compared with those infants born appropriate for gestational age (12%. P = 0.006).The overall viral detection rate in stool of 5.7% (affecting 17% of neonates) indicates viral infections are an important health risk for premature infants in NICU.
