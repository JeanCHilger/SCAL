Clinical evaluation of a real-time PCR assay for identification of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter (Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli), and shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli isolates in stool specimens. Enteric illness affects millions of individuals annually in the United States and results in >50,000 hospitalizations. The rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis can aid acute patient management decisions, including the use of antibiotic therapy and infection control. This study compared the ProGastro SSCS multiplex real-time PCR assay (Gen-Probe Prodesse, San Diego, CA) to culture for the identification of Campylobacter spp. (Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli), Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. and to broth enrichment followed by an FDA-cleared enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the identification of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) isolates in stool specimens. Stool samples submitted in preservatives for routine culture and EIA were prospectively enrolled and tested at four clinical centers. Discrepancies between the ProGastro SSCS assay and culture or EIA were resolved using bidirectional sequencing. The overall prevalence of the pathogens as detected by culture was 5.6% (1.8% Campylobacter, 1.8% Salmonella, 1.3% Shigella, and 0.8% STEC). When results based on the ProGastro SSCS assay and bidirectional sequencing were applied, the overall prevalence increased to 8.3% (2.3% Campylobacter, 2.6% Salmonella, 1.8% Shigella, and 1.6% STEC). Following resolution of the discrepant results, the sensitivity of the ProGastro SSCS assay was 100% for all pathogens, and the specificities ranged from 99.4% to 100%. The sensitivity of culture compared to sequence-confirmed ProGastro SSCS results ranged from 52.9% to 76.9%, with the specificities ranging from 99.9% to 100%. Overall, these results suggest that the ProGastro SSCS assay is highly sensitive and specific in a clinical setting.
