Mycoplasma, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria BVAB3, race, and risk of preterm birth in a high-risk cohort. Genital tract infection accounts for approximately 25-40% of all preterm births. We sought to assess the relationship between preterm birth and selected vaginal bacterial taxa associated with preterm birth either directly or through their association with bacterial vaginosis (BV).Vaginal fluid for Gram stain was collected between 17 and 22 weeks' gestation as part of a randomized trial of ultrasound-indicated cerclage for preterm birth prevention in women at high risk for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. Bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the Gram stain slides and analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Among the 499 participants, Mycoplasma was positively correlated with increased risk of preterm (risk ratio [RR], 1.83 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-2.22) as was Mobiluncus (RR, 1.36BV is characterized by a reduction of Lactobacillus, and lactic acid-producing bacteria and the presence of Mobiluncus we found these factors and the presence of Mycoplasma to be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. By contrast, the presence of a recently identified organism sufficient to cause BV, BVAB3, decreased the risk of preterm birth. These findings give insight into why treating BV has mixed impact on risk of preterm birth.
