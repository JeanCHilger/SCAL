Neonatal adenoviral infection: a seventeen year experience and review of the literature. To describe the clinical manifestations and short-term outcomes of adenoviral infections in neonates and review all published cases to better determine impact and treatment outcomes.Retrospective cohort study of all neonates hospitalized at Children's Medical Center (CMC) and Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH), Dallas, TX with laboratory-confirmed adenoviral infection from January 1,1995-December 31, 2012. Neonates were identified by review of the CMC Virology Laboratory's prospective database of all positive adenovirus tests performed in the inpatient and ambulatory settings, and at PMH, of a prospective neonatal database that included all neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Patients also were identified by discharge International Classification of Disease, 9th edition codes for adenoviral infection. The medical records were reviewed, and a review of the English literature was performed.During 17 years, 26 neonates had adenoviral infection (25, CMC 1, PMH). The principle reasons for hospitalization were respiratory signs (88%) and temperature instability (65%). Five (19%) had disseminated disease and 4 (80%) of these infants died. Ribavirin or cidofovir treatment, as well as immune globulin intravenous, did not improve outcomes except in 1 neonate. Literature review (n = 72) combined with our data found that disseminated infection was associated with death (68% vs 21% with localized infection, P < .001). In addition, neonates <14 days of age were more likely to have disseminated disease (44% vs 12%, P = .004) and death (48% vs 8%Adenoviral infection in hospitalized neonates was associated with severe morbidity and mortality, especially when infection was disseminated and involved the respiratory tract. Development of new therapeutic strategies is needed.
