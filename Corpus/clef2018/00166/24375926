Molecular epidemiologic trends of diarrhea-causing virus infection from clinical specimens in Cheonan, Korea, in 2010-2012. The enteric viruses have high health significance in humans, ranging from poliomyelitis, hepatitis, and gastroenteritis to innocuous infections, and the human enteric viral infection is the one of the most common diseases during early childhood. This study was conducted from July 2010 to October 2012.We subjected 788 stool specimens using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) tests that could simultaneously detect five enteric viruses, group A rotavirus (GAR), enteric adenovirus (EAdV), norovirus GI (NoV-GI), norovirus GII (NoV-GII), and human astrovirus (HAstV). The data were analyzed according to seasonality and patient age and sex.Two hundred and seventy specimens (34.3%) were positive, 276 viruses were detected in the 788 sample. The prevalence of GAR, EAdV, NoV-GI, NoV-GII, and HAstV infections in the 270 mPCR-positive specimens was 101 (36.6%), 28 (10.1%), 4 (1.4%), 132 (47.8%), and 11 (4.0%), respectively six specimens (2.2%) contained double infections. NoV-GII and GAR infections occurred mainly in the winter and spring.We described the epidemiological analytic data of the diarrhea-causing viruses in the population of local society of Korea. These results could be helpful for the diagnosis and subsequent epidemiological surveillance of enteric viral infections.
