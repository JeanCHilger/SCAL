Molecular characterisation of Giardia intestinalis assemblages from human isolates at a tertiary care centre of India. The aim of the study was to determine the genetic heterogeneity of Giardia intestinalis isolates detected in stool samples of the study population using polymerase chain reaction assay and restriction fragment length polymorphism. We also tried to correlate the association/differences between the clinical symptomatology and infection by different assemblages (genotypes) of G. intestinalis.This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2008 to June 2010. A total of 40 adults (n = 40) and 42 children (n = 42) below the age of 12 years with the clinical suspicion of giardiasis and with the onset of one or more of the following five symptoms, i.e., loose stool, nausea, weight loss, fatigue and foul smelling faeces and confirmed laboratory diagnosis of giardiasis at least once during the current episode of diarrhoea were included in this study.Of the 82 patients (males 66) enrolled in the study, 70 (85%) presented with diarrhoea (56 males) and 12 (15%) without diarrhoea (10 males). Out of 70 diarrheic patients, 61 (87%) had chronic diarrhoea, 8 (11.5%) had acute diarrhoea and 1 (1.5%) had persistent diarrhoea. Of the total patients, 63 (77%) were clinically assessed and were apparently immunocompetent, whereas, 19 (23%) immunocompromised patients had different underlying conditions besides giardiasis. Genotyping identified all 82 (100%) isolates as assemblage B.We found that assemblage B of G. intestinalis presents with all kinds of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic carriage to acute, persistent or chronic diarrhoea.
