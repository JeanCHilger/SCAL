Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive infections in Burkina Faso, 2007 to 2011. We had for aim to determine the epidemiology of meningeal and lung invasive infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae in Burkina Faso.We screened for S. pneumoniae with the usual bacteriology techniques and with real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) in 7917 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and pleural fluid (PF) collected in the Ouagadougou Yalgado Ouedraogo Teaching Hospital, from 2007 to 2011.S. pneumoniae was identified in 476 (6%) samples including 455 (5.7%) in CSF and 21 (0.3%) in PF. Sixty-seven percent of invasive infections occurred in patients 15 years of age or less, without any significant sex ratio difference. The infections occurred most frequently between January and August, with the first and most important peak between January and May (dry season) and the second peak between June and August (at the beginning of rain season). The introduction of rt-PCR proved the under diagnosing of invasive infections by usual bacteriological methods (latex agglutination assay and culture).Invasive pneumococcal infections occur mainly in patients 15 years of age or less, without any difference in sex ratio and with peaks in the dry season. Vaccinal schedules should include all age ranges in Burkina Faso.
