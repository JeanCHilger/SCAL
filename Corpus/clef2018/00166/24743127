Prognosis of rotavirus infection in children. The aim of the research was to develop the method for predicting the course of rotavirus gastroenteritis in children.Under the supervision were 3607 children aged from 9 days to 5 years with the diagnosis of "Acute gastroenteritis" and "Acute gastroenterocolitis". The diagnosis of rotavirus infection was on the basis of a set of clinical, epidemiological data and the results of para-clinical and bacteriological studies and data of detection of rotavirus antigen strain. Genotyping of rotavirus group A was performed by PCR 269 faecal samples. For rotavirus infection is characterized by the following clinical symptoms: intestinal disorders, symptoms of intoxication, signs of dehydration. Clinical manifestation of rotavirus infection is closely correlated with indicators of leukogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the degree of metabolic acidosis. The presence of concomitant bacterial infection burden for rotavirus, but the presence of conditionally pathogenic flora practically did not influence on the clinical manifestation of the disease. The longest duration of diarrhea was observed in patients with rotavirus gastroenteritis was caused by a strain with genotype PCR they often occurred in children older than 2 years (t=3,4 p<0.01)). Special scheme has been developed for predicting the course of rotavirus gastroenteritis, including the availability of mix infection, to determine the severity of the pathological process a specially designed scale.
