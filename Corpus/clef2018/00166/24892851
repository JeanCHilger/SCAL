Clinical and laboratory characteristics of central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection in neonates and young infants. We reviewed the characteristics of infants <3 months of age with central nervous system herpes simplex virus infection at our institution. Twenty-six cases were identified. The age range was 4-73 days. Most infants presented with fever, seizure activity and skin lesions. The blood herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction was positive in 91% of patients tested. Suppressive oral acyclovir therapy was likely helpful in preventing disease recurrence.
