Molecular epidemiology of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Spain: 2004-12. In Spain, despite the high rates of healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the incidence of community-associated (CA) MRSA seems to be low on the basis of a small number of studies. We analysed the evolution of CA-MRSA in Spain from 2004 to 2012, and identified the clonal lineages and population structure.The study included 8326 MRSA strains. Susceptibility to 18 antimicrobials was determined. Isolates were tested for the presence of mecA, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) by PCR, and typed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec, PFGE, spa, multilocus sequence typing and agr.Among the 8326 isolates, 246 (2.9%) were CA-MRSA. We identified genotypically 226 PVL-positive CA-MRSA isolates (88% agr type I, 10.2% agr type III and 1.8% agr type II) and 20 PVL-negative CA-MRSA isolates (all agr type I) from children and adults (82.1% from wounds) from 13 different geographical areas. A significant increase in the rates of CA-MRSA was observed when comparing 2004-07 (0.43%) with 2008-12 (5.44%). Resistance rates were as follows: only Î²-lactams, 84.5% erythromycin, 12.8%We confirm an increase in CA-MRSA in Spain, the predominance of the ST8-IVc clone, the emergence of the USA300 clone, a high genetic diversity among PVL-positive CA-MRSA isolates and the recent emergence of the pig-associated ST398-V clone.
