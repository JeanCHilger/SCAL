Clinical application of viral cerebrospinal fluid PCR testing for diagnosis of central nervous system disorders: a retrospective 11-year experience. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard to detect cerebral viral activity. As positive findings do not prove an impact on the neurological disorder, data interpretation is difficult. To better assess the impact of positive CSF PCR findings in different neurological diseases and to identify coherences facilitating CSF PCR data interpretation, we performed this retrospective analysis of CSF PCR data of 481 pediatric and 2604 adult patients, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and enteroviruses (EV). Nucleic acid of EBV was detected in 1.6% (39/2449), of VZV in 1.3% (34/2624), of HSV in 1.24% (37/2994), of EV in 0.4% (10/2364), of HHV-6 in 0.17% (4/2417), and of CMV in 0.2% (5/2514) of the patients. Newborns and elderly people showed highest infection rates. HSV, VZV, and EV prevailed in typical infectious central nervous system (CNS) diseases EBV, in further inflammatory neurological diseases
