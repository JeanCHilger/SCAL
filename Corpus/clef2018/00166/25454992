Screening, prevention, and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a leading cause of permanent disability in children. The main source of maternal infection is from contact with young children. Primary maternal infection is diagnosed with demonstration of seroconversion or a positive CMV IgM in combination with a low-avidity CMV IgG. Fetal infection may be diagnosed with amniotic fluid polymerase chain reaction and culture. CMV-specific hyperimmune globulin has shown promise as a possible means to prevent congenital infection large randomized trials are ongoing. To date, the only effective means of prevention is through reducing exposure to the virus. Rates of maternal infection may be reduced through education regarding sources of infection and improved hygiene.
