Fatal adenovirus pneumonia in a newborn identified by electron microscopy and in situ hybridization. A male infant born at 25 weeks' gestation died at 2 weeks of age from progressive respiratory insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. Autopsy revealed extensive hemorrhage and necrosis in the lungs, as well as hyaline membrane disease. Alveolar and bronchiolar lining cells contained frequent intranuclear inclusions visible by light microscopy that corresponded to arrays of icosahedral particles suggestive of adenovirus by electron microscopy. Confirmation of overwhelming adenovirus infection was made with in situ DNA hybridization. This case demonstrates the advantage of DNA probe analysis for retrospective diagnosis when no adequate specimen is available for culture or antigen detection. This case is also unusual in that a premature newborn had severe adenovirus infection.
