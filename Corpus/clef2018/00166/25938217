Clinical chorioamnionitis at term II: the intra-amniotic inflammatory response. Recent studies indicate that clinical chorioamnionitis is a heterogeneous condition and only approximately one-half of the patients have bacteria in the amniotic cavity, which is often associated with intra-amniotic inflammation. The objective of this study is to characterize the nature of the inflammatory response within the amniotic cavity in patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term according to the presence or absence of 1) bacteria in the amniotic cavity and 2) intra-amniotic inflammation.A retrospective cross-sectional case-control study was conducted to examine cytokine and chemokine concentrations in the amniotic fluid (AF). Cases consisted of women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term (n=45). Controls were women with uncomplicated pregnancies at term who did not have intra-amniotic inflammation and were in labor (n=24). Women with clinical chorioamnionitis were classified according to the results of AF cultures, broad-range polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and AF concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) into those: 1) without intra-amniotic inflammation, 2) with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, and 3) with intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable bacteria. The AF concentrations of 29 cytokines/chemokines were determined using sensitive and specific V-PLEX immunoassays.1) The AF concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-4 (IL-4), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (except Eotaxin-3) were significantly higher in women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term than in controls (term labor without intra-amniotic inflammation) 2) patients with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, and those with intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable bacteria, had a dramatic differential expression of cytokines and chemokines in AF compared to patients with spontaneous labor without intra-amniotic inflammation. However, no difference could be detected in the pattern of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response between patients with intra-amniotic inflammation with and without detectable bacteriaPatients with clinical chorioamnionitis who had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation or intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable bacteria had a dramatic upregulation of the intra-amniotic inflammatory response assessed by amniotic fluid concentrations of cytokines. A subset of patients with term clinical chorioamnionitis does not have intra-amniotic infection/inflammation, as demonstrated by elevated AF concentrations of inflammation-related proteins, when compared to women in term labor with uncomplicated pregnancies, suggesting over-diagnosis. These observations constitute the first characterization of the cytokine/chemokine network in the amniotic cavity of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term.
