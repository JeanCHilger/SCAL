Urine Collection Method for the Diagnosis of Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is traditionally diagnosed by virus detection in saliva or urine. Virus culture was positive in significantly fewer urine samples collected using cotton balls in diapers (55.2%) than with samples collected by bags (93.2%) from newborns screened positive for CMV in saliva. However, polymerase chain reaction was positive in 95% of urine samples regardless of the collection method.
