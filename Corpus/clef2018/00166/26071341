False-positive PCR detection of cyclovirus Malawi strain VS5700009 in human cerebrospinal fluid. Cyclovirus (CyCV) Malawi strain VS5700009 has recently been discovered and reported in clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Further epidemiological and case-control studies are warranted. The availability of a highly sensitive and specific detection assay for this new virus is thus crucial.To evaluate the performance of the first and the only available PCR assay for CyCV-VS5700009.A total of 100 CSF samples collected during January-December 2010 were selected for PCR detection of CyCV-VS5700009. Positive PCR amplicons were subjected to sequencing confirmation and BLAST analysis.Initial PCR screening for CyCV-VS5700009 identified one sample, showing a PCR band of expected size (380 bp). Sequencing and BLAST analysis, however, indicated that the band was 364 bp in length and showed >99% nucleotide homology to a human gene known as nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCOA6). Pairwise sequence alignment confirmed that both the forward and reverse PCR primers used had significant homology (>70%) to NCOA6. None of the CSF samples tested were positive for CyCV-VS5700009.The original PCR assay for CyCV-VS5700009 detection may have potential cross-reactivity with contaminating human genomic DNA. The assay may be of little diagnostic use on clinical specimens that are rich in host DNA such as biopsy tissues.
