Clinical utility of serum samples for human parechovirus type 3 infection in neonates and young infants: The 2014 epidemic in Japan. During the 2014 human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) epidemic in Niigata, Japan, this prospective observational study identified HPeV3 from 43/85 (51%) febrile young infants <4 months using PCR analysis of serum (n = 42) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n = 32) and genetic sequencing of the VP1 region of HPeV3. HPeV3-infected patients (median age, 32 days range, 4-113 days) were diagnosed as having sepsis (79%), sepsis-like syndrome (19%), or encephalitis with septic shock (2%). Other than fever, mottled skin (67%) was significantly more frequent in HPeV3-infected patients than other virus-infected patients (P = 0.005). The rate of HPeV3 RNA detection in CSF without pleocytosis was high (88%
