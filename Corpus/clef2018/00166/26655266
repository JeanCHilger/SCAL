Enterovirus infections in hospitals of Ile de France region over 2013. The monitoring and genotyping of Enterovirus (EV) infections can help to associate particular or severe clinical manifestations with specific EV types and to identify the aetiology of infectious outbreaks.To describe the epidemiological features of EV infections diagnosed during the year 2013 in the Greater Paris area (Ile de France).During 2013, 2497 samples taken from 470 patients in 33 hospitals of Ile-de France were tested for EV genome by RT-PCR. EV genotyping was performed by the National Reference Centre (NRC) laboratories. EV infections were retrospectively reviewed by retrieving clinical and genotyping data from the NRC database.Of the 2497 samples, 490 (19.6%) was positive for EV genome detection. These EV infections represented 88.7% and 24.1%, respectively, of all reported regional and national infections. Twenty-seven different genotypes were identified. Echovirus 30 (E-30) accounted for 54.1% of all characterized strains and caused a large outbreak. Four severe neonatal infections were reported, of which two were caused by EV-A71. Respiratory infections involving EV-D68 were observed in two adults. One fatal case of Coxsackievirus A2-associated myocarditis was reported.Monitoring EV infections in combination with EV genotyping via the French EV network characterized the epidemiology of EV infections in the Ile de France region in 2013 and documented severe EV infections associated with EV-A71 or CV-A2.
