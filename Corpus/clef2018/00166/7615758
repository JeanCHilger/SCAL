Differentiation of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains in Brazilian children by PCR. A PCR technique to differentiate pathogenic enteric Escherichia coli strains in a field setting was evaluated. Among 76 children with acute diarrhea, this technique identified 12 children (16%) with enterotoxigenic E. coli, 6 (8%) with enteropathogenic E. coli, and 1 (1%) with enteroinvasive E. coli infection. Compared with the conventional assays, the PCR method proved to be simpler, more rapid, and inexpensive and therefore suitable for application in a developing-country field setting.
