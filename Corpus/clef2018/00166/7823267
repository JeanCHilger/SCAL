Fetoneonatal hydrops from human parvovirus B19. Case report. Authors report the case of a newborn who died just a few hours after the birth as a result of intrauterine Parvovirus B19 infection. Diagnosis of fetal hydrops was made by ultrasound examination at the 25th week of pregnancy. Etiology was established on the basis of specific antibody findings in the serum of the mother, the fetus (by cordocentesis), and the neonate B19 virus was then observed in the fetus and the neonate tissues after death using the dot-blot hybridization assay and the polymerase chain reaction technique for viral DNA. The severe fetal anemia was treated with intrauterine transfusions, but achieved poor results. The pathogenesis of fetal hydrops and advisability of intrauterine treatment in such cases are discussed.
