Gene amplification in viral CNS infections. Rapid diagnostic identification of herpesviruses. DNA amplification with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used as a diagnostic test on cerebrospinal fluid samples in cases where herpesvirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) was suspected. During the period, 1992-93, 47 (8.9%) of 528 patients tested were positive for one or another of the following herpesviruses: herpes simplex virus type 1 (n = 16) or type 2 (n = 9), cytomegalovirus (n = 16), varicella-zoster virus (n = 4), or Epstein-Barr virus (n = 2). The study showed PCR to be a rapid and useful diagnostic method in clinical routine, enabling early antiviral intervention in several cases with an atypical clinical picture. Moreover, cytomegalovirus was found to be an important CNS pathogen in addition to herpes simplex virus, especially during childhood.
