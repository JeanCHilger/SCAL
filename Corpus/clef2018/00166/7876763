Detection of human cytomegalovirus in urine of infants by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral isolation and serological methods were used to diagnose HCMV infection in infants. Specimens of urine and clotted blood were collected from suspected cases of congenital or HCMV infection who attended the Pediatric Clinic, Siriraj Hospital. Prevalence of HCMV infection was found in 3 per cent of infants aged under 14 days and increased to 48 per cent in infants aged over 14 days. PCR was the most sensitive technique, it could detect HCMV infection in 29 per cent of the study infants, whereas, detection rate by isolation was 17 per cent and by specific IgM ELISA was 15 per cent. Sensitivity and specificity of PCR compared with isolation and/or serology were 93 per cent and 96 per cent, respectively. Detection of HCMV in urine by PCR can be used as a sensitive and rapid test for diagnosis of HCMV infection in infants.
