Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA typing: a useful tool for rapid epidemiological typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Discriminatory typing methods are invaluable in the investigation of outbreaks of infectious diseases. Single primers were used to generate randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles from Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates of various serotype and K. pneumoniae isolates from cases of sepsis at a Malaysian hospital and two English hospitals. RAPD profiles of acceptable reproducibility, a maximum of three minor band variations, were produced using a rapid DNA extraction method. RAPD typing of K. pneumoniae was shown to be as discriminatory as restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using pulsed field gel electrophoresis yet quicker and less costly. The findings suggest that RAPD typing may be a useful tool for the epidemiological typing of K. pneumoniae.
