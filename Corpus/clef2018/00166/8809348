PCR diagnosis of viral pneumonitis from fixed-lung tissue in children. Viral infection in children commonly causes acute lung disease leading to respiratory decompensation requiring intensive supportive therapy. Definitive diagnosis of the causative virus may be difficult, relying on serologic data since viral cultures are frequently negative lung biopsy may be necessary to increase the diagnostic yield. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analyzing Formalin-fixed lung tissue from autopsies of 32 patients with pneumonitis in whom cultures, serology, and histopathology results were blinded to the investigators, and 10 negative control samples, PCR was performed for cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Among the 32 affected specimens, 7 were culture-positive for a specific virus in the lung
