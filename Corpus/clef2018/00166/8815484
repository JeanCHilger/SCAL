Neonatal herpetic encephalitis. Current concepts concerning a case. We describe a newborn patient with herpes simplex infection localized to the central nervous system. The diagnosis was suspected on clinical grounds and it was corroborated by tissue culture isolation of the virus and by herpes simplex glycoprotein B DNA detection by PCR in cerebrospinal fluid. We describe the clinical manifestations of this patient and we present some considerations regarding pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this viral infection in the newborn period.
