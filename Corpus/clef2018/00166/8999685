Development and application of immunoenzyme test-system for the diagnosis of acute cytomegalovirus infection. Enzyme immunoassay for the detection of IgM antibodies to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been developed. Use of horseradish peroxidase conjugated monoclonal antibodies to human IgM helped create a highly specific test system. The rheumatoid factor was removed from the serum by staphylococcal reagent containing protein A. The results of the newly developed assay are in good correlation with the clinical course of the disease and data of polymerase chain reaction and the test making use of the Labsystem.
