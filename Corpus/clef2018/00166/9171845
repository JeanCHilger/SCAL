Serotype of Nigerian rotavirus strains. Three hundred and fourteen stool samples collected from children < 5 years between December 1993 and August 1995 were analysed by PAGE, ELISA, PCR and Dot-blot hybridization technique for electropherotype and serotype distribution of rotavirus infection among Nigerian paediatric patients. 14.3% of the children were positive for rotavirus antigen. Children aged 6-9 months were most often infected, accounting for 35.6% of all positive samples, 91.1% of rotavirus-positive samples could be serotyped. Serotypes G2, G4 and G8 were not detected. Serotype G3 predominated (62.5%) in southern Nigeria, while mixed infection specificity was more widespread (63.6%) in northern Nigeria. The presence of some untypeable samples may indicate serotypes which the serotype-specific primers and cDNA probes used could not detect. Electropherotypes of 26 (57.7%) of the positive samples were determined. Two and 3 migration patterns were observed among the short and long-pattern electropherotypes, respectively. Implications for vaccine development and utilization in the country are discussed.
