Effect of maternal CD4+ cell count, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and viral load on disease progression in infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. New York City Perinatal HIV Transmission Collaborative Study Group. Among a cohort of 152 infants perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and their mothers, we correlated infant outcome with material CD4+ lymphocyte count and the presence of maternal acquired immunodeficiency syndrome near delivery. In a subset of 50 mother-infant pairs, we also correlated infant outcome with maternal quantitative viral burden as measured by the nucleic acid sequence based amplification system. We found that low maternal CD4+ cell count and high viral burden were associated with decreased time to category C disease or death in infants infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. In a multivariate analysis, high maternal viral load and maternal acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were independently associated with shorter time to category C disease or death in infants with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. High viral load in pregnant women, independent of the presence of advanced maternal disease, appears to increase the risk of rapidly progressive disease in their infected offspring.
