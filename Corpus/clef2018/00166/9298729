Evaluation of a newly developed HIV antigen test. A new monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassay (Innogenetics) for the detection and quantification of p24 core antigens of HIV-1 (group M and group O) and of HIV-2 was evaluated on 2745 serum samples and 18 culture supernatants and compared with a reference (Coulter) HIV-1 p24 antigen assay. Positive results were confirmed by neutralization with the reagents of the respective tests. As demonstrated by dilution series of HIV cocultures, the new test recognizes p24 antigen of the most common HIV genetic subtypes, including group O and HIV-2. Titres ranged from 729 to 531441. Therefore p24 antigen assay is but very weakly reactive with HIV-2 (titres from 9 to 81). The new test is considerably more sensitive than the reference. In a population of 365 follow-up samples from 86 different patients, representing all stages of infection, the new test detected p24 antigen at least once in 52% (45/86) of these patients, whereas the reference was positive in 31% (27/86). The newly designed test detected antigen in 40% (145/365) of the samples, while the reference was positive in 21% (75/365). In a group of PCR and/or culture positive neonates, 33% (9/27) of the samples were positive with the new test versus 18% (5/27) with the reference. The specificity of the new test, as determined on 2,000 blood donor samples, was 99.65% (initially), 99.80% (after repetition), and 100% (with neutralization). The reference scored 99.95%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. In 300 seronegative samples from persons at risk, the initial specificity of the new test was 98.67% (the reference, 99.00%). With neutralization, both assays were 100% specific.
