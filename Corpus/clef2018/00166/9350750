Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections with herpes simplex virus by PCR performed with cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Until recently, the laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been limited by poor sensitivity and/or specificity. We assessed the diagnostic utility of PCR for detection of HSV in over 2,100 specimens referred to the Mayo Clinic from August 1993 to May 1996. DNA extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples with IsoQuick was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers directed to the DNA polymerase gene of HSV, yielding a 290-bp amplicon. HSV DNA was detected in 150 (135 by gel electrophoresis, 15 by Southern blotting only) of 2,106 (7.1%) specimens. PCR-positive CNS disease occurred in patients ranging in age from 13 days to 89 years 59% of the cases occurred in patients between the ages of 30 and 69, and 21 (14%) of the patients were infants. Genotype analysis was not routinely performed
