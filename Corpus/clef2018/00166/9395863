Infections of the central nervous system in the newborn. Safe, effective vaccines and potent antimicrobial agents have diminished substantially the morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal infections of the central nervous system (CNS), and new molecular methods, such as the polymerase chain reaction, enable clinicians to detect micro-organisms rapidly. Despite these advances, CNS infections remain an important cause of death and neurodevelopmental sequelae. This article summarizes current concepts regarding infections of the developing CNS.
