Diagnosis of congenital and perinatal infection by cytomegalovirus using polymerase chain reaction. The practical application of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for the diagnosis of congenital and perinatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections was evaluated. Three hundred five urine samples were tested by PCR and conventional virus isolation in cell culture. Viruria was detected in 47 urine samples by PCR using a primer pair which amplifies part of the major immediate-early (MIE) CMV genome. The PCR compared to virus isolation showed 89.6% sensitivity, 98.5% specificity and 91.5% positive predictive value. PCR with primer pairs amplifying parts of the glycoprotein B and glycoprotein H genes of CMV were used for confirmation of the positivity of the 47 urine samples. We concluded that this CMV PCR assay in urine has a suitable sensitivity for the diagnosis of congenital and perinatal infections and its specificity is highly increased by use of more than one pair of primers among the ones we used.
