Comparison of a rapid culture method combining an immunoperoxidase test and a group specific anti-VP1 monoclonal antibody with conventional virus isolation techniques for routine detection of enteroviruses in stools. In order to shorten the time required for the detection of enteroviruses in stool specimens, an 18-h immunoperoxidase test combining low-speed centrifugation and the use of a group specific anti-VP1 monoclonal antibody (5-D8/1, Dako) was developed. This rapid culture assay (RCA) was compared blindly to a conventional culture assay (CCA) on a panel of 180 children's stool specimens received for routine diagnosis of enterovirus infection. The same cell lines (human embryonic fibroblasts and KB continuous cell line) were used in both tests. Discrepancies in results were analysed by a PCR technique with primers located in a conserved part of the 5' non-coding region of the enterovirus genome. Fourteen specimens were positive and 158 were negative with both tests. Four samples were positive with the RCA yet negative with the CCA and 3 others showed the opposite pattern an additional sample positive by RCA was uninterpretable by CCA due to bacterial contamination. Subsequent PCR testing of these 8 samples showed no discrepancies
