A cluster of cases of neonatal coxsackievirus B meningitis and myocarditis. Three babies were referred with enteroviral meningitis and myocarditis during a 4-month period. During this same period there was an increased frequency of coxsackievirus B type 2 isolates reported to the National Centre for Disease Control. Myocarditis was simultaneous with meningitis in one baby, but delayed by 10 weeks in another, in whom myocarditis mimicked myocardial infarction. Two of the three mothers experienced abdominal pain, one with antepartum haemorrhage, which has been described previously with coxsackievirus infection in pregnancy. Diagnosis was made in two babies by polymerase chain reaction on cerebrospinal fluid.
