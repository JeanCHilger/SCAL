Thymic dysfunction and time of infection predict mortality in human immunodeficiency virus-infected infants. CDC Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study Group. The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced thymic dysfunction (TD) on mortality was studied in 265 infected infants in the CDC Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study. TD was defined as both CD4 and CD8 T cell counts below the 5th percentile of joint distribution for uninfected infants within 6 months of life. The 40 HIV-infected infants with TD (15%) had a significantly greater mortality than did the 225 children without TD (44% vs. 9% within 2 years). Infants with TD infected in utero had higher mortality than did those infected intrapartum (70% vs. 37% within 2 years), while no significant difference was noted between infants without TD with either mode of transmission. The TD profile was independent of plasma virus load. Virus-induced TD by particular HIV strains and the time of transmission are likely to explain the variation in pathogenesis and patterns of disease progression and suggest the need for early aggressive therapies for HIV-infected infants with TD.
