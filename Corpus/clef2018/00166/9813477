Care for the Cuban child born to an HIV-seropositive mother. Up to this moment, 25 children have been born from mothers seropositive to HIV. Of these, only 12 who are seropositive have been studied. Four of these children had developed the disease (33.3%), and the route of transmission was a blood transfusion. From the moment they were born, these children had been followed up monthly at the out-patient service and the polymerase chain reaction test, as well as ELISA and western blot is performed at 3, 6, and 9 months of age. Also, the same test are performed at 18 and 36 months of age for diagnostic confirmation in order to know whether they are virus carriers.
