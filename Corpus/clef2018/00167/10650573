Analysis of a case of severe congenital toxoplasmosis. To describe a case of severe congenital toxoplasmosis because of inadequate surveillance of a seronegative pregnant woman and to evaluate the usefulness of different microbiological diagnostic methods after birth.We applied serology, DNA amplification by one-tube semi-nested PCR, cell culture and mice inoculation analysis.Anti. T. gondii serology was useful for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. PCR analysis of neonate cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood were positive, and yielded negative results after a few days of specific treatment. Cellular culture and mice inoculation yielded negative results.Our results suggest that serology and PCR are useful methods for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in newborns. Prenatal toxoplasmosis screening and suitable follow up of the seronegative pregnant women are necessary to prevent cases of severe infection in our area.
