Distribution and expression of bca, the gene encoding the c alpha protein, by Streptococcus agalactiae. A total of 52 clinical isolates of group B streptococci (GBS) was tested for expression of the c protein c(alpha) by a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and by PCR amplification of a 202-bp stretch within the repeat unit of the bca gene encoding the c(alpha) protein. The strains were categorised as follows: c(alpha) FAT positive and PCR positive with amplification products of multiple sizes (category A, n = 12) FAT negative and with PCR products of multiple sizes (category B, n = 11)
