Cytomegalovirus infection in infants with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Fas-mediated apoptosis may be one of the effector pathways leading to the elimination of virus-infected cells. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in two brothers with Fas deficiency associated with autoimmunity and benign lymphoproliferation (ALPS) provided a unique opportunity to study the clinical course of CMV infection in children with defective apoptosis. The clinical courses of two brothers with autosomal dominant ALPS who were infected with CMV in the neonatal period are described. CMV was detected from throat and urine culture from the brothers. ALPS was confirmed by in vitro anti-CD95 MoAb-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis assay and subsequent sequencing and identification of mutations in the Fas gene. A de novo mutation in the Fas gene, leading to a truncated cytoplasmic Fas product, was associated with autosomal dominant ALPS in a mother and her two sons. Both boys had evidence of CMV infection acquired early in infancy which cleared by the age of 2-3 years. There were no neurodevelopmental sequelae. The natural history of CMV infection in two infants with ALPS was similar to that described in normal children.
