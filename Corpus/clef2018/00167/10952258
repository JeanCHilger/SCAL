Detection of congenital malaria by polymerase-chain-reaction methodology in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The examination of congenital malaria was performed by Giemsa staining and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) methodology. We randomly selected 298 neonates who had been admitted to Muhimbili Medical Center (MMC) at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. One baby among all the enrolled neonates was recognized as having a congenital malaria infection, which gave a prevalence of 0.33%. The present result was 5-fold the clinically recognized prevalence of congenital infection with malaria in the ward. The PCR method identified two cases, one of which was negative as determined by the Giemsa-staining method. Therefore, the PCR method was useful for the detection of scant amounts of malarial parasites in numerous blood samples. The screening of malaria by a sensitive PCR method contributes to reduce the mortality of asymptotic neonates in particular.
