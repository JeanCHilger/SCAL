Simultaneous multiorgan presence of human herpesvirus 8 and restricted lymphotropism of Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences in a human immunodeficiency virus-negative immunodeficient infant. Because a profound dysregulation of the immune system occurs in primary immunodeficiencies, viral infections are not uncommon. Human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, Southern blotting, and in situ hybridization (ISH) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymphoid organs (bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes) and endothelial and epithelial cells and macrophages from several organs (skin, lung, esophagus, intestine, choroid plexus [but not in brain or cerebellum], heart, striated muscle, liver, and kidney) of a human immunodeficiency virus-negative infant with DiGeorge anomaly who died of disseminated infection. Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences were detected in the spleen and lymph nodes (by PCR and ISH) and in bone marrow (only by ISH) but not in blood or nonlymphoid organs. This report is believed to be the first of multiorgan dissemination of HHV-8 in a primary immunodeficiency.
