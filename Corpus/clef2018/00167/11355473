Detection of human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 in laryngeal cancer using PCR methods. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small DNA virus. HPV is can be divided into two groups: mucosal and cutaneous. HPV have various oncogenic potential. The correlation between presence of high oncogenic type of HPV and carcinogenesis was confirmed in human anogenital tract and cervical carcinoma. The latest studies suggest HPV infection involvement in benign and malignant lesions of aerodigestive tract. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of the HPV genes E6/E7. The specimens were taken after total laryngectomy from 20 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The fresh tissue specimens were frozen at -70 degrees C until DNA extraction and HPV detection. The presence of HPV DNA was assessed by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for HPV 16 and 18 E6/E7. There were 7 (35%) HPV positive specimens in our group. 5 (25%) specimens were HPV 16 positive, 4 (20%) specimens were HPV-18 positive. In two cases HPV 16 and HPV 18 was present. The results suggest that high oncogenic types of HPV may play a role in pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinoma.
