Diagnostic value of human cytomegalovirus late-mRNA detection for intrauterine active human cytomegalovirus infection. To study diagnostic value of late-mRNA detection for intrauterine active human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection.The HCMV late-mRNA in peripheral blood of the pregnant women with HCMV-IgM positive and their fetal appendages (such as chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, umbilical blood and placenta) were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR).The late-mRNA was detected in 23 out of 42 HCMV-IgM positive pregnant cases, with the 54.3% of corresponding rate between the results of HCMV-IgM and HCMV late-mRNA. 7 samples out of 13 fetal appendages from m-RNA positive mothers were late-mRNA positive, while in 12 mothers with late-mRNA negative group only one fetal sample was late-mRNA positive, Between two groups there was significant difference in mother-fetus transmission rate.The positive result of HCMV-IgM can not accurately reflect HCMV activity at the time being detected, which is closely related to the mother-fetus transmission rate. As a symbol of active HCMV infection, late-mRNA can not only reflect the mother-fetus transmission rate during active HCMV infection correctly, but also provide some information about activity of the HCMV in fetal tissue, It also has a great value in prediction for prognosis of infectious fetuses.
