The effect of chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnant women on pregnant outcome and neonates. To determine the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in pregnant women and its effect on pregnant outcome and neonate.Specimen of cervical swab were collected and detected for CT by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method meanwhile relevant factors were investigated. Pregnant outcome and neonatal situation were also followed up.The infection rates of CT in pregnant women were 35.90%. The Incidence of abnormal pregnant outcome (premature delivery and abortion) was significantly higher in CT positive groups (24.72%) than that in negative groups (12.20%) (P < 0.05). Incidence of neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia were significantly higher in CT positive groups (17.98%) than that of negative groups (0.61%) (P < 0.01). There was statistically significant difference in the prevalence of low birth weight (< 2,500 g) between the two groups (13.48% versus 4.88%) (P < 0.05), and mode of delivery also had influence on neonatal morbidity.Prevalence of CT infection in pregnant women is rather common, and it may cause adverse pregnancy outcome.
