Retrospective study of children born to HIV-1-infected mothers in a pediatric hospital in Argentina. The aim of this retrospective study, which included 103 children born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- infected mothers, is to initiate a database on HIV-infected children, which has to date been unavailable in Argentina. All HIV-1 seropositive children admitted to the Pedro de Elizalde Children's Hospital in Buenos Aires from March 1, 1987, to December 31, 1992, were enrolled in this study. The number of patients enrolled dramatically increased each year during the period of study. Of the 60 infected children, 22 (36.66%) have died with a clinical diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in 10 of those children HIV infection was also confirmed by P24 antigenemia and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 20 qualified for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) P2D class (P2D1 = 7, P2D2 = 10, P2D3 = 3), 1 for P2C, and 1 for P2A, whose cause of death was pneumonia. The mean age of death was 14.8 months, 18 (82%) died before 18 months. When immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA levels were determined according to age and clinical status, significant differences (P < 0.005) were observed when both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected children (P1, P2) were compared with noninfected children (P3). A significant difference was also obtained between those children who qualified for P2 classification prior to 12 months of age who died early (at or prior to 25 months) and those who reached stage P2 after 12 months of age and have survived to date (X2 = 24.73, p < 0.0001
