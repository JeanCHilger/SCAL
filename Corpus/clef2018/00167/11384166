Identification of Trypanosoma cruzi genotypes circulating in Chilean chagasic patients. Parasite DNA amplified by PCR from blood of 73 chagasic children and adults of two endemic areas of Chile were studied by Southern blot and/or dot blot hybridization analysis with a panel of three minicircle probes corresponding to the parasite genotypes (clonets 19, 33 and 39). The hybridization pattern of the PCR positive samples identified clonets 39, 19/20, and 32/33 with frequencies of 0.84, 0.32 and 0.26, respectively. A total of 31 samples corresponded to mixed infections. The most frequently found mixtures were: clonets 39 and 19/20 (14 cases), followed by clonets 39 and 32/33 (8 cases), clonets 39, 32/33 and 19/20 (8 cases), and clonets 32/33 and 19/20 (1 case). Amplified DNA from 9 cases showed no hybridization signal with none of the three studied probes indicating that other genotypes different to the ones mentioned are circulating in humans, but that the clonets used as probes are the most prevalent ones in terms of transmission in the endemic areas studied. A biological characterization of 34 T. cruzi populations isolated from the xenodiagnosis of the patients was performed on an experimental murine model. The biochemical characterization of the parasite populations by molecular karyotype determined that the most frequent parasite isolated from patients belongs to clonet 39.
