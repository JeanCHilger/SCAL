A comparison of nested polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence for the diagnosis of respiratory infections in children with bronchiolitis, and the implications for a cohorting strategy. Cohorting bronchiolitis patients infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and/or influenza viruses is paramount in preventing cross-infection of these viruses in hospital. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) was compared with immunofluorescence (IF) for the detection of RSV subtypes A and B in children with suspected bronchiolitis. Co-infection with influenza A(H3N2), Chlamydia spp. and picornavirus/rhinovirus was also investigated using molecular techniques.A total of 50 nasopharyngeal secretions collected from babies admitted with bronchiolitis in the month of January 2000, comprising IF RSV positive (N= 27) and RSV negative (N= 23) specimens, were tested for both RSV subtypes, influenza A(H3N2), Chlamydia spp. and picornavirus/rhinovirus by nPCR. Nested PCR detected 28 specimens positive for RSV (RSV A = 20, RSV B = 8), which was two more than detected by IF. Influenza A(H3N2) was detected in three specimens, Chlamydia trachomatis in one, and picornavirus in 11, of which nine were confirmed to be rhinovirus by nPCR. Dual infection was detected in five cases using nPCR. Nested PCR proved useful in detecting RSV and influenza A(H3N2) infections missed by IF, and also other respiratory tract pathogens not routinely investigated. The clinical implications and risk of cross-infection with potentially virulent viruses due to inaccurate results from insensitive techniques, highlights the need for molecular assays such as nPCR to be employed as a routine method of investigation, provided as part of the laboratory service. Cohorting of patients with clinical bronchiolitis should continue, whilst awaiting laboratory confirmation.
