Human cytomegalovirus immediate-early messenger RNA in blood of pregnant women with primary infection and of congenitally infected newborns. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate-early messenger RNA (IEmRNA) in sequential blood samples from 32 pregnant women with primary infection and from 14 congenitally infected newborns was qualitatively investigated by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. IEmRNA was detected in 100%, 75%, 36.3%, 22.2%, and 0% of samples collected 1, 2, 3, 4-6, and >6 months after onset of primary HCMV infection, respectively, showing 83.7% sensitivity and 92.2% specificity, compared with results of quantitative DNAemia (detection of viral DNA in blood). In infected newborns, IEmRNA was positive in 100% of samples collected 1-7 days (median, 1.5 days) and in 46.4% of samples collected 27-260 days (median, 88 days) after birth, showing 75.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity, compared with DNAemia results. IEmRNA was not detected in HCMV-immune individuals with remote or recurrent HCMV infection or in uninfected newborns. IEmRNA determination appears to be a valuable tool for early diagnosis of both primary and congenital HCMV infection.
