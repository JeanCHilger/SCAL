Prevention of HIV transmission from mother-to-child in Srinagarind Hospital. From January 1996 to December 1999, HIV infected pregnant women and their newborns were studied. Informed consent was obtained and HIV-tests were performed after counselling. ZDV for perinatal prophylaxis starting on week 14 to week 36 of gestation and continued throughout pregnancy was given following an ACTG 076 regimen except that during labour, intravenous ZDV was replaced by oral ZDV 300 mgs, given every 3-hours as a loading dose and ZDV syrup 2 mgs/kg every 6 hours for 7 days orally for the newborns. Newborn HIV-Ab and PCR were done at 6 weeks and 6 months after birth. Eighty-four HIV infected pregnant women were enrolled in the study, eighty-three of whom were delivered. The overall transmission rate was 5.2 per cent, with 3/58 children confirmed infected with HIV by at least two positive PCR test results.
