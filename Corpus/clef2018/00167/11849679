Differentiation of subtypes B and E of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 by polymerase chain reaction using novel env gene primers. Novel sets of env gene PCR primers for distinguishing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and E were designed. These primers anneal to different regions of the env gene and amplify DNA fragments of distinct sizes in a subtype-specific manner. Blood samples from 11 HIV-1 carriers in Thailand and 46 carriers in Japan were examined by PCR. The new env primers detected HIV-1 proviral DNA in 100% (11/11) and 88% (37/42) of the subtype B and E infection cases, respectively. The env primers also detected proviral DNA in saliva and breast milk samples in seven of 11 cases and two of three cases, respectively. The PCR subtyping results matched completely with those obtained by nucleotide sequencing of the env V3 region. The results suggest that the PCR using the env primers designed in this study may be an accurate and cost-effective method for differentiating subtypes B and E of HIV-1 in a large number of clinical samples. However, subtype E specific primer cross-react with subtype A, C, G, the new primer in this study is useful for regions in South East Asia where subtype E is predominant.
