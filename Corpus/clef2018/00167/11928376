Hepatitis C and pregnancy. Today, the natural course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during pregnancy and the prevalence of mother-to-child transmission are better known.Antenatal screening for HCV infection needs to be proposed to women with risk factors. Viral replication needs to be confirmed by PCR in pregnant women with antibodies against HCV. To date, the clinical course of pregnancy and the mode of delivery have not been changed by HCV infection. Rates of vertical transmission of HCV are about 6% in women with HCV alone and 15% in women co-infected with HIV. A screening for HCV markers is required 18 months after delivery for infants born to HCV mothers. Because of the relatively low rate of HCV vertical transmission, pregnancy can be allowed in infected women. However, taking into account the efficacy of new antiviral strategies, treatment of HCV infection could be proposed before pregnancy.In case of HCV infection, a careful follow-up of both mother and newborns is required. Long-term follow-up of infected infants is needed to assess the consequences of perinatal HCV infection.
