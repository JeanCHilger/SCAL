Genetic variation of hepatitis B surface antigen coding region among infants with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Variants in the amino acid composition of the primary antibody-binding site of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) have been identified in a number of populations with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Direct sequencing of amplified or cloned PCR products, solid phase detection of sequence-specific PCR products (SP-PCR), and limiting dilution cloning PCR (LDC-PCR) were compared to determine their sensitivity in detecting differing concentrations of HBsAg variants. LDC-PCR had the greatest sensitivity and could detect HBsAg variants at a concentration of 0.1% of the total viral population. HBsAg variants were detected in 51% of infants with chronic HBV infection acquired after postexposure prophylaxis, and more than half of the variants were detected only by the most sensitive methods.
