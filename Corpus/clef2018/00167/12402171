High incidence of JC viruria in JC-seropositive older individuals. The prevalence of the human JC virus (JCV) in the general population at various ages was investigated. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect viral DNA in the urine. The results showed that the incidence of JC viruria was low in the young population, but it was high in the elderly. Hemagglutination inhibition assay was performed for JCV seroprevalence study. The results showed that the seropositive rate of JCV was lower in children than that in adults. The ratio of viruria to seropositive for JCV increased with age and reached 79.7% for those older than 70 years. The results indicated that aging immunity may correlate with JCV reactivation.
