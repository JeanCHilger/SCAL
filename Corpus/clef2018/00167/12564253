PCR and the notification of meningococcal disease. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to investigate suspected meningococcal infection, with rapid results. We became aware that Birmingham Health Authority was not being informed about certain patients on whom meningococcal PCR had been performed. To establish whether notification was overlooked in some patients with suspected meningococcal disease, or whether PCR was performed on patients in whom it was thought meningococcal disease was unlikely, we compared numbers of patients notified to us over six months who had PCR with numbers of patients not notified who had PCR. Between 1st August 1999 and 31st January 2000, 54 PCR requests were made on seventy-seven notified patients 51 PCR requests were made on non-notified patients and none were positive. Median age and length of stay were shorter in the non-notified patients. We conclude: (i) PCR may be being used inappropriately on younger patients who have shorter admissions and are unlikely to have meningococcal disease
