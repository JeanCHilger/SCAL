Infantile viral gastroenteritis: on the way to closing the diagnostic gap. A total of 305 faecal specimens collected from children under the age of 5 who presented with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis either as inpatients at Addenbrooke's Hospital (N = 100) or to General Practitioners in East Anglia (N = 205) during 1999-2001 were tested for the presence of rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, enteric adenoviruses (Group F, serotypes 40 and 41), and astrovirus. An aetiologic agent was found in 184 specimens (60.3%). The most commonly found single viral pathogen was rotavirus (27.9%), followed by norovirus (13.4%), enteric adenoviruses (7.9%), astrovirus (2.3%), and sapovirus (1%). Mixed infections were observed in 27 specimens (8.9%), and no aetiologic agent was found in over a third of the specimens tested. These data demonstrate that the diagnostic gap can be reduced considerably through the use of molecular amplification and detection techniques. However, additional work is required to reduce this deficit further by optimising sampling algorithms and by identifying other agents associated with viral gastroenteritis.
