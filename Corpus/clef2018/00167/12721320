Molecular epidemiology of an outbreak of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a Tunisian neonatal ward. During the first quarter of 1996, a major outbreak of clinical infection caused by multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (MRKP) occurred in the neonatal ward of the 'Maternit√© Wassila Bourguiba' in Tunis, Tunisia. In total, 32 isolates of MRKP, comprising 23 clinical isolates and nine surveillance isolates, were recovered during this period and analysed for epidemiological relatedness. The isolates were compared with 17 other isolates of MRKP that were recovered during 1995. Macrorestriction profiles of total genomic DNA following XbaI restriction endonuclease digestion were analysed by PFGE this typing classified 56% of the 32 isolates recovered in 1996 into two major clusters. Cluster A included ten isolates from 1996 and three isolates recovered in 1995, whereas cluster B included eight isolates from the outbreak of 1996. The remaining isolates were genetically unrelated to those of clusters A and B
