Congenital tuberculous lymphadenitis in a preterm infant in Greece. Congenital tuberculosis is a rare disease. The risk of tuberculosis in pregnancy has increased owing to recent changes in the epidemiology of the disease, which have led to an increased risk of congenital tuberculosis. We present a case report on a 6-d-old premature infant with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Smears of the lymphatic tissue contained acid-fast bacilli, and cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis hominis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of the suppurative material of the lymph node was positive for M. tuberculosis. Twenty days before onset of labour, the mother developed miliary tuberculosis and meningitis.The atypical clinical manifestations of congenital tuberculosis and the devastating consequences in the absence of early therapy signify the importance of early diagnosis and treatment during the neonatal period. PCR assay is a useful technique for prompt diagnosis in neonates with clinically suspected infection.
