Development of a rapid method using nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for the detection of astrovirus. We have developed a rapid method to detect astrovirus in fecal specimens utilizing nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and several detection methodologies, including a sandwich hybridization assay based on DNA-tagged liposomes (liposome-strip detection assay). RNA was extracted from 65 stool specimens that were positive for astrovirus by enzyme immunoassay and was amplified by both NASBA and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Also extracted and amplified were 19 specimens containing rotavirus, 20 specimens containing norovirus, five specimens containing adenovirus, 15 water negative control specimens, and eight specimens containing astrovirus reference strains. NASBA products were detected by electrochemiluminescence detection (ECL) and by liposome-strip detection RT-PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining following gel electrophoresis and by liquid hybridization assay (LHA). There was no significant difference in the detection rates of NASBA- and RT-PCR-based assays, with one exception in which the NASBA/ECL assay detected astrovirus in eight specimens that tested negative by the RT-PCR/LHA assay. These results suggest that these NASBA-based detection methods have detection rates that are as good as or better than those of RT-PCR-based methods. Both NASBA and liposome-strip detection may be useful for field studies and environmental testing because these methods are rapid and do not require specialized equipment.
