Molecular epidemiology of group B streptococcal infections: use of restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal DNA and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms of ribosomal RNA genes (ribotyping). Epidemiologic investigation of group B streptococcal (GBS) infections has been limited by the lack of a discriminatory typing system. Therefore, the use of restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal DNA (REAC) and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rRNA genes (ribotyping) to subtype molecularly GBS isolates associated with human invasive disease was investigated. Chromosomal DNA of selected GBS isolates was initially digested with 24 different restriction enzymes. HhaI gave the best discrimination of hybridization banding patterns (ribotypes) and was used with all study isolates. Ribotyping and REAC differentiated among isolates of the same and different serotypes. Nine ribotype patterns were noted among the 76 isolates studied, including 4 among serotype Ia/c and 4 additional ribotypes among serotype III isolates. Epidemiologically related isolates (e.g., mother-infant or twin-twin pairs) had identical REAC and ribotype patterns. Epidemiologically unrelated isolates with the same ribotype usually had different REAC patterns, suggesting that REAC may be a more sensitive technique for strain differentiation. REAC and ribotyping were reproducible and proved to be successful molecular epidemiologic methods for subtyping GBS.
