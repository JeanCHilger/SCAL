Disseminated neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infection diagnosed by HSV DNA detection in blood and successfully managed by liver transplantation. We report a case of neonatal herpes presenting with liver failure and disseminated coagulopathy which followed unrecognised maternal primary genital herpes and was diagnosed by herpes simplex virus DNA detection in blood by polymerase chain reaction 2 weeks after initiation of empiric intravenous aciclovir. The child underwent liver transplantation while receiving suppressive antiviral therapy and remains well after 10 months of follow-up.our case highlights potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of neonatal herpes and indicates a role for blood herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction as a sensitive diagnostic tool in disseminated infection. It is one of very few reports where liver transplantation has been successfully carried out in a neonate with herpes simplex virus-induced liver failure.
