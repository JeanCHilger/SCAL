Rapidly increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-nonproducing, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b in patients with meningitis. A total of 395 Haemophilus influenzae strains from 226 Japanese institutions participating in the Nationwide Surveillance Study Group for Bacterial Meningitis were received from 1999 to 2002. All strains were analyzed by PCR to identify the resistance genes, and their susceptibilities to beta-lactam agents were determined. Of these strains, 29.1% were beta-lactamase nonproducing and ampicillin (AMP) susceptible (BLNAS) and lacked all resistance genes 15.4% were beta-lactamase producing and AMP resistant and had the bla(TEM-1) gene
