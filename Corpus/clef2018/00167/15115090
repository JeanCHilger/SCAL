Parturient and perinatal dengue hemorrhagic fever. A Thai woman in the shock stage of dengue hemorrhagic fever delivered a healthy infant by normal delivery. She had high, prolonged fever for five days, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia and a right pleural effusion. The serology performed later established a diagnosis of secondary dengue infection. She had no serious complications except for postpartum anemia. The newborn became febrile at the 48th hour of life. He had fever for 2 days, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia and a right pleural effusion. Dengue virus type 1 was detected from his serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although he developed prolonged, marked thrombocytopenia (12 days), his illness was uncomplicated. He recovered uneventfully and was discharged with his mother. This report was one of dengue vertical transmission with dengue hemorrhagic fever in humans.
