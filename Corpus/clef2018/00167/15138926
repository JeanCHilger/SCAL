Histologic correlates of viral and bacterial infection of the placenta associated with severe morbidity and mortality in the newborn. The purpose of this study was to correlate the histologic features of the placenta with the in situ detection of viral or bacterial nucleic acids in cases of severe morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period. The criteria for the cases were either fetal or neonatal death (11 cases with autopsy material available in 8 cases) or idiopathic severe respiratory distress or central nervous system-related symptoms at birth (49 cases). Controls included 11 placentas from births with no morbidity and 6 placentas that were associated with severe neonatal morbidity of known etiology (trisomy, ruptured uterus, prolapsed cord). The 77 placental tissues were analyzed with a consensus bacterial probe and for a wide variety of viral infections. An infectious cause was found in 46/60 (76%) of cases these were distributed as follows: enterovirus, 23 cases (22 were coxsackie virus)
