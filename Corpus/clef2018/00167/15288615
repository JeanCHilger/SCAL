Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus load in Argentinean transplant recipients using real-time PCR. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a frequent and severe Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated complication in transplant recipients that is caused by suppression of T-cell function.Evaluation of the diagnostic value of EBV DNA load in non-fractionated whole blood samples (n = 297) from 110 pediatric transplant patients by real-time PCR.Patients with PTLD had a median viral load of 1.08 x 10(5) copies/ml blood (n = 24), which was significantly higher compared with patients without PTLD (median: 50 copies/ml blood, n = 273, P < 0.0001). From receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis we obtained a cut-off value of 6215 copies/ml blood with a sensitivity of 95.8%, specificity of 71.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.5% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 22.8%. Thus, real-time PCR proved to be more useful in ruling out than in indicating the presence of PTLD. Further analysis showed that patients without PTLD but developing a post-transplant EBV-primary infection had associated high viral loads that were indistinguishable from those of the PTLD group (statistically not significant). Similarly, the presence of clinical symptoms of disease in patients without PTLD was associated with higher viral loads than in patients that were asymptomatic (P < 0.0001), but the difference was much less significant when compared with the PTLD group of patients (P = 0.0391). These patients who had a high viral load may benefit from a close follow-up of the viral burden.
