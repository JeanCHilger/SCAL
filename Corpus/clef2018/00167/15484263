Evidence of rotavirus AU32 like G9 strains from nontypeable fecal specimens of Indian children hospitalized during 1993-1994. Serotyping of 432 rotavirus positive fecal specimens collected from hospitalized children during 1990-1997 was carried out at National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, India, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against VP7 determinant of serotypes G1-G4, G6, G8, and G10. However, significant number of specimens, that is, 47.92% remained nontypeable. The aim of the present study was to culture adapt the nontypeable specimens and to characterize them further. Since the fecal specimens were not tested by MAb to G9 serotype, which has emerged as an important serotype infecting humans recently, presence of G9 serotype was expected in nontypeable specimens. Therefore, we selected specimens from those children, who showed higher neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer in their convalescent serum samples to G9 serotype than their mothers. Out of six isolates having long electropherotype, five isolates showed subgroup II, and one showed subgroup I, II. The isolates were confirmed as G9 by MAb based ELISA, neutralization assay, and PCR. The G9 specific nested PCR products of four isolates showed 96-99% identities to AU32 G9 strain reported from Japan. P type of four isolates was determined as P8. Besides isolates, four additional nontypeable fecal specimens were confirmed as G9 by MAb based ELISA. Thus, 10 (28.57%) out of 35 nontypeable specimens were identified as rotavirus serotype G9. The results indicate that serotype G9 may represent significant proportion of specimens, which were previously nontypeable.
