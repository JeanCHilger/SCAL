The Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER): rationale and design. The Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER) was initiated in December 2001 as a single-centre prospective birth cohort study and will include a population-based sample of at least 2000 healthy newborns. The aims of WHISTLER are to investigate determinants for wheezing illnesses (including neonatal lung function, viral infections, asthma-susceptibility genes and endotoxin exposure) and to derive a comprehensive risk score, that is appropriate for use in primary health care and allows for efficient planning of early preventive strategies. Baseline examination includes a questionnaire evaluating known risk factors for wheezing illnesses anthropometric measurements
