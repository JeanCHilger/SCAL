Detection of Helicobacter pylori in the stools of newborn infants. To investigate the transmission route of Helicobacter pylori, stool specimens of 50 infants 3 days old were studied by a stool antigen immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By PCR, H. pylori DNA was detected in 15 neonates (30%). The stool antigen test was positive in only 1 neonate with a positive PCR. The detection rate of H. pylori DNA in neonates was significantly higher for those with mothers having urines positive for anti-H. pylori IgG antibody (60%) than for those mothers with negative urines (17%) (P < 0.01). A follow-up study was done 24 months later on 8 of the 15 infants with positive PCR results, including the infant with a positive stool antigen test. All infants were negative by both PCR and stool antigen test.
