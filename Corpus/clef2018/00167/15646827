Incidence and outcome of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in selected groups of preterm and full-term neonates under intensive care. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading cause of mental retardation and hearing impairment. Examination for the presence of CMV infection was carried out in a selected population of 70 neonates. Urine samples were tested for CMV by means of a nested polymerase chain reaction. CMV was detected in 6 (16.7%) of the 36 preterm newborns and in 5 (14.7%) of the 34 full-term newborns. One preterm neonate died and the remaining 10 newborns were followed up. Two children born at full-term did not excrete CMV at 2 years of age and were symptom-free. Of 8 CMV-excreting children (5 preterm and 3 full-term), 2 were symptom-free (1 preterm and 1 term). Symptomatic CMV disease developed in 6 children (4 preterm and 2 full-term), with mental retardation (n=4), hearing loss (n=1), strabismus (n=2) or bronchial asthma (n=1). Screening of such neonates is important those identified as congenitally CMV-infected can be monitored to correct any sequelae immediately.
