Molecular epidemiological profile of rotavirus in South Korea, July 2002 through June 2003: emergence of G4P[6] and G9P[8] strains. To determine the distribution of rotavirus strain genotypes in South Korea, rotavirus-positive stool specimens were collected from July 2002 through June 2003 at 8 hospitals in the Korean Rotavirus Strain Surveillance Network, and they were genotyped by means of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The globally uncommon G4P[6] type was the most prevalent type identified among strains (27% of strains), the newly emerging G9P[8] strain accounted for 11% of strains, and the globally common genotypes (i.e., G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8]) constituted 55% of the strains characterized. Ninety percent of G4P[6] strains were detected in specimens obtained from neonates. Common genotypes were responsible for the rotavirus epidemic that began in January 2003 and ended in May 2003 however, an early peak in infections with the G4P[6] strain occurred from August through October 2002, and infections with this strain were detected throughout the remaining study period. G4P[6] strains were most commonly identified at 6 urban health care centers, but they were absent from 2 rural health care centers. The newly emerging strain G9P[8] represented a relatively greater proportion of strains identified at a hospital in the central region of Korea and at 2 hospitals in the southern region. The identification of novel rotavirus genotypes in this laboratory-based surveillance study underscores the importance to public health of continued strain surveillance among children for whom prevention of rotavirus infection by vaccination might be considered.
