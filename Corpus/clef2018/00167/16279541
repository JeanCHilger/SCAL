Detection of the markers of herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus in newborns and infants. A total of 111 children suspected for herpesvirus infection were examined. In blood and urine samples the infectious activity of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was detected by the rapid culture method (RCM) and the presence of virus DNA--by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HSV and/or CMV were detected by two laboratory methods in 57 examined children (51%). Of these, in 18 children (16.2%) both HSV and CMV were detected. The coincidence of the results of the detection of HSV and CMV by these two methods was observed in 72.4% and 75.2% of cases respectively. The comparative analysis of the detection of anti-CMV IgG and IgM was made with the use of commercial test systems produced bythe following manufacturers: "Vector-Best" and "Bioservice" (Russia), "HUMAN" and "Boehringer" (Germany). The effective detection of both anti-CMV (IgG and IgM) was ensured by the test systems "Boehringer". The test system "Vector-Best" for anti-CMV IgG proved to be not inferior as regards sensitivity and specificity. The German test systems demonstrated the highest specificity in the detection of low-avid antibodies. The data obtained in this study indicate that the detection rate of HSV and CMV markers in newborns and infants suspected for herpesvirus infection was, on the average, 20 - 40%. Reliable diagnostics in newborns and infants is possible only in the presence of the combination of at least 2 serological tests (the determination of antivirus IgM and IgG avidity) and 2 methods for the detection of direct herpesvirus markers (PCR and RCM).
