Viral coinfection in the oral cavity of HIV-infected children: relation among HIV viral load, CD4+ T lymphocyte count and detection of EBV, CMV and HSV. Viral coinfection in the oral cavity associated to HIV infection was evaluated in 180 children from birth to 13 years of age of both sexes. The oral examinations were performed at the Pediatric AIDS Outpatient Clinic, SÃ£o Lucas Hospital and Clinic Hospital, both in Porto Alegre, Brazil and at the School of Dental Medicine, University Hospital Center, State University of New York at Stony Brook, USA. The aim of this study was to identify the presence of viral infections in the oral cavity. PCR technique was used to determine opportunistic viral infections caused by CMV, EBV, and HSV in mucosal swabs. A high frequency of viral infection was detected in the oral cavity of HIV-infected children determined by the PCR technique. HIV-infected children with viruses had a favorable CD4+ T lymphocyte count and unfavorable viral load.
