Detection of human metapneumovirus in children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory infection in Santiago, Chile. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has recently been described as a new causal agent of acute low respiratory infection (ALRI) in children. In South America, detection has been reported only in Brazil and Argentina.To detect hMPV in children hospitalized for ALRI in Santiago, Chile.Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect N gene of hMPV in 182 nasopharyngeal aspirates that were negative for common respiratory viruses, obtained from children hospitalized for ALRI during 2003.Ten samples (5.4%) were positive, most of them detected during spring months.Since hMPV was detected among infants with ALRI in Santiago, further studies on their prevalence should be done in South America.
