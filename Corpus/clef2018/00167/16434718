Kodamaea (Pichia) ohmeri fungaemia in a premature neonate. Kodamaea ohmeri is a yeast that rarely causes human infections. The first case of K. ohmeri fungaemia in a premature neonate is reported it was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B. Biochemical identification of the yeast was performed by Vitek II and API and was confirmed by rRNA gene sequencing. K. ohmeri as a human pathogenic yeast is uncommon to hospitalized neonates and immunocompromised individuals.
