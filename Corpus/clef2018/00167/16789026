Detection of group a human rotavirus G9 genotype circulating in Córdoba, Argentina, as early as 1980. The incidence of human rotavirus G types was determined over a 25-year period (1979-2003) by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to examine 519 stool specimens found to be positive for rotavirus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). These stool samples were obtained from children under 3 years old who had been treated for acute diarrhea at public hospitals in Córdoba, Argentina. The present study describes the continued circulation of the common human G types G1 (53.8%), G2 (10.2%), G3 (4.4%), and G4 (27%), and also the detection of the unusual types G8 (0.5%) and G9 (4.2%). Genotype G9 was detected during the 1980-1988 and 1997-2003 periods at relatively low rates. Rotavirus G types distribution was independent of age (1-18 months), gender or out-patient or in-patient status. Unexpectedly, 44.6% of mixed infections were detected, involving common and unusual genotypes. Overall, 95.4% of the typed strains belonged to the most prevalent human serotypes (G1-G4) but the detection of G9 infection throughout this study period highlights the importance of this serotype as a human pathogen.
