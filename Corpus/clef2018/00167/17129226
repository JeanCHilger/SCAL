Clinical and molecular analysis of haemoglobin H disease in Sardinia: haematological, obstetric and cardiac aspects in patients with different genotypes. In this study, 251 Sardinian patients (187 adults and 64 children) with haemoglobin (Hb) H disease were evaluated. Two-hundred and sixteen patients (86%) had the deletional type (- -/-alpha) and 36 (14%) patients had the non-deletional type (- -/alpha(ND)alpha). A clear genotype-phenotype correlation was found, with the non-deletional type more severe than the deletional type. Diagnosis of Hb H disease was incidental in about 60% of cases. Aplastic crises due to B19 parvovirus infection were found in five patients (2.1%), while 23 patients (9.6%) experienced one or more haemolytic crises. Nineteen patients with Hb H received sporadic red blood cell transfusions and three patients were repeatedly transfused. Forty-seven of 61 married women (77%) had 82 pregnancies. In children, mean serum ferritin was 87 +/-92 mug/l and in adults, was 192 +/- 180 mug/l in females and 363 +/- 303 mug/l in males. For the 98 male patients, a significant correlation was found between ferritin values and age (r2 = 0.33, P < 0.0001). In the Sardinian population, Hb H disease needs regular monitoring for early detection and treatment of possible complications, such as worsening of anaemia that may require red cell transfusion, cholelithiasis and iron overload.
