Comparison between two real-time PCR assays and a nested-PCR for the detection of Toxoplasma gondii. In recent years, the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis has been improved by Real-time PCR assays. In this study we compared the performances of two Real-time PCRs (FRET and TaqMan protocols) already described in the literature, and one nested-PCR, currently used in our laboratory for the molecular diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.We evaluated the sensitivity and the specificity of a FRET- and a TaqMan-based Real-time PCRs targeting a 529 bp repeat region and the 18S RNA gene, respectively, and a nested-PCR, targeting the B1-gene of Toxoplasma gondii. We also tested, through nested-PCR, 46 biological samples obtained during a period of 29 months from pregnant women or immunocompromised patients with suspected T. gondii infection.The analytical sensitivity of nested and TaqMan PCRs was approximately 10(3) tachyzoites/ml. FRET assay showed a sensitivity of 102 tachyzoites/ml. Three out of 46 biological samples were nested-PCR-positive and these results were also confirmed by both Real-time PCRs.Nested- and real-time PCRs evaluated in this study resulted very sensitive and specific in particular FRET PCR resulted more sensitive than the other assays, probably because of the greater copy number of the target sequence. Real-time PCR assays are easy-to-use, producing results faster than conventional PCR systems and reducing contamination risks.
