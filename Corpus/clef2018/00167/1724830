The central nervous system of infants born to HIV-positive mothers-- neuropathology, immunohistochemistry in in situ hybridization. The central nervous system (CNS) of 12 fetuses from human-immunodefiency-virus-seropositive mothers was investigated. Postconceptional ages ranged between 15 and 21 weeks. 3 preterm infants born to HIV positive mothers whose survival ranged from 6 hours to 6 months were included in the study. In all cases, the development of the CNS was macroscopically normal. The microscopic examination showed many ectopic neurons indicating disturbances of normal neuronal migration. As a regular finding there was a significant increase in microglia in all areas of the CNS but no microglial nodules were found. In all cases haematogenous monocytes were scattered in the perivascular space of the cerebral parenchyma as well as in the chorioid pexus. The virus-antigen p24 could neither be detected immunohistochemically in the paraffin sections nor in the frozen material of the brain or by in-situ-hybridization. In contrast, in five of the cases investigated the placenta showed macrophages, socalled Hofbauer cells with p24-associated antigen.
