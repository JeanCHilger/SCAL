Real-time PCR assay using specimens on filter disks as a template for detection of cytomegalovirus in urine. Since congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection causes late-onset sequelae, the identification of CMV-infected newborns is important. For this purpose, we established a simple real-time PCR assay using a filter disk. Combined with the collection of urine using filter papers placed in the diaper, this assay can make CMV screening more feasible and cost-effective.
