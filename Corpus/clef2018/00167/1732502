Diagnosis of vertical HIV-1 transmission using the polymerase chain reaction and dried blood spot specimens. We have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HIV proviral sequences in minute amounts of peripheral blood collected onto newborn screening blotters. Forty-three newborns, infants, and children of HIV-infected mothers were serially studied: dried blood spot (DBS) specimens were processed for PCR serum was assayed for HIV antibodies, p24 antigen, and immunoglobulins
