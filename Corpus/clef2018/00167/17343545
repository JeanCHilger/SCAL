Detection rate of Helicobacter pylori stool antigen in newborn infants and small children. To investigate the prevalence of H. pylori antigen in the stools of Norwegian neonates and small children.A total of 249 children aged 0 days-3 years were tested for the presence of H. pylori antigen in feces using the HpSA immunoassay. For verification purposes, a selection of samples were analyzed with PCR targeting the 16 S rDNA Helicobacter gene.H. pylori antigen in stool was detected in 52% (36/69) of the neonates, in 15% (7/46) of infants aged 7 days-1 month, and in 5% (7/134) of children aged 1 month-3 years. In neonates, H. pylori antigen detection was significantly associated with mode of delivery: 59% (30/51) with uncomplicated vaginal births were HpSA positive compared to only 10% (1/10) of infants delivered by cesarean section (P=0.02). Positive PCR results were found in 35% (9/26) of HpSA positive samples. Sequencing of PCR products revealed 97-100% homology with gene sequences from both H. pylori and other Helicobacter species.The low H. pylori antigen detection rate in children >1 month of age is in accordance with previous prevalence studies from Western countries. The unexpected finding of a high H. pylori antigen detection rate in neonates suggests that transient colonization may occur in the neonatal period.
