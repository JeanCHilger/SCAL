Role of mutations on the "hepatitis B virus 'a' determinant hotpoint" to the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine. To study how hepatitis B virus(HBV) 'a' determinant hotpoint mutations were influecing the hepatitis B vaccine efficacy.Primers were designed in HBV conservative region, and the degenerate probes for detecting 16 'a' determinant hotpoint mutations were developed for gene chips. Sensitivity and specificity of the gene chips were evaluated by clone sequencing. Sera of 47 pairs of mothers and infants with immune failure and 323 mothers of children with immune protection of HB vaccine were detected by the gene chips.Result from clone sequencing demonstrated that the gene chips were specific for the detection of 'a' determinant hotpoint mutations. The wild type of HBV was still dominant, with the prevalence of 78.66%, and the mutation frequencies of 126A, 145R, 126S-1, 126S-2, 129H, 144A, and 129R were 11.27%, 5.76%, 5.28%, 4.56%, 1.20%, 0.72% and 0.24%, respectively. The prevalence of 126A mutation was significantly higher than that of other mutations(P < 0.01). No significant differences were found in mother-infant transmission rates of 126A, 126S-1, 126S-2 and 145R variants.The currently available hepatitis B vaccine could block mother-infant transmission of 126A, 126S and 145R variants. It appears that there is no need to develop a new hepatitis B vaccine against 126 and 145 variants at present, but the consistent epidemiological surveillance on HBV mutants should be carried out.
