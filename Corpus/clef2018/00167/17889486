Fungemia due to Candida guilliermondii in a pediatric and adult population during a 12-year period. Candida guilliermondii fungemia is usually described in adults with hematologic malignancies, but in children, only 2 episodes have been published. From 1995 to 2006, 7 episodes (5 in children) were detected in our hospital. Molecular typing excluded a common infection source. C. guilliermondii fungemia may occur in children with underlying conditions other than cancer.
