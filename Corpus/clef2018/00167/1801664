Intrauterine and postnatal pneumonia in acquired immunodeficiency of infants. The autopsy material of 15 children aged from 2 months to 3 years from the zonal group of increased risk of the ecologic pathology, acquired immunodeficiency and viral infections was assessed morphologically and clinically. Decreased number of T-cells (T4, T8), an increase of the level of serum IgA, IgE and immune complexes, HIV-antibodies (4 cases) were found in the patients. The method of the molecular hybridization by means of virus-specific 32P-DNA probes was used. Bronchopneumonia was the cause of death. Severe deficiency of the organs and cells of the immune system, alternative-proliferative lung inflammation, mainly in the form of pneumonitis and alveolitis, were found. The latter differed either individually or as a result of the predominant infectious agent (RNA- or DNA-viruses, pneumocysts, bacterial flora, fungi). Considerable immunity dysfunctions enhanced the intensity of the specific features in pneumonia morphology.
