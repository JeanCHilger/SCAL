New diagnostic tools for neonatal sepsis: the role of a real-time polymerase chain reaction for the early detection and identification of bacterial and fungal species in blood samples. Early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal sepsis are essential to prevent severe and life threatening complications. Consequently, rapid diagnostic tests capable to differentiate infected from non-infected newborns have the potential to make a significant impact on neonatal care. A new real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR LightCycler SeptiFast test M GRADE) has been proposed in the routine assessment of neonatal sepsis for the detection and identification of bacterial and fungal DNA from microorganisms which cause approximately 90% of all blood stream infections. The LightCycler SeptiFast test can detect and identify simultaneously the 25 most important bacterial and fungal species causing bloodstream infections within few hours by using a small volume of a single whole blood sample. Real-time PCR can be easily incorporated into the hospital setting for term or near-term infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for sepsis evaluation.
