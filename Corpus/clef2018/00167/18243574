Detection of the human Parvovirus B19 in nonimmune hydrops fetalis using immunohistochemistry and nested-PCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded placenta and fetal tissues. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is an association between Parvovirus B19 infection and hydrops fetalis setting in fetus and neonate. Twenty-nine samples were analyzed by three methods. Each sample was histologically examined for viral nuclear inclusions in fetal organs and placenta, then immunohistochemical study using Parvovirus B19 antibody that recognized the VP2 protein of the Parvovirus B19 capsid was done in tissue embedded in paraffin (lungs, liver, thymus, kidneys, heart and placenta). Nested-PCR analysis was done after DNA extraction from paraffin blocks and using specific primers of the Parvovirus B19 VP1 gene. Apparent causes of hydrops were eliminated such as metabolic diseases, cardiac failure or malformation. The standard histological study objects viral inclusion in one case (lung tissue). However, the immunohistochemical study was negative in all cases. Nested-PCR demonstrates the presence of the viral DNA in five cases. Our study demonstrates that the implication of Parvovirus B19 in hydrops fetalis must be affirmed by the use of more than one method. Nested-PCR is the most sensitive method in our study and can be easily used for the detection of Parvovirus B19 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.
