Genotype variability of human metapneumovirus, South Korea. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a virus causing lower respiratory tract infections in children, is classified two major groups or genotypes of hMPV and recently existence of multiple lineages has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of genetic variation and circulation pattern of hMPV in Korea. Between January 2005 and April 2007, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 1,214 children <16 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection at Sanggyepaik Hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for common respiratory pathogens using immunofluorescence or multiplex RT-PCR. RT-PCR was used to detect hMPV. The PCR products were purified and subsequently sequenced directly on both strands. hMPV was detected in 8.4% (102/1,214) of nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with acute respiratory tract infection. The 102 hMPV strains detected in this study were classified into two distinct F lineages, 87 strains belonged to genogroup A2 (A2a in 42, A2b in 45) and 15 strains to genogroup B. All hMPV subtypes except A1 co-circulated in Korean population. Although alternating predominance of hMPV subtypes from year to year could not be found, the changing predominance of sublineage A2a and A2b was demonstrated.
