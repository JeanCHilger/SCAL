A Chryseobacterium meningosepticum outbreak observed in 3 clusters involving both neonatal and non-neonatal pediatric patients. Three clusters of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum infections in a tertiary health center in July 2006 and January 2007 involving 8 newborns and 5 older children were investigated. The index patient was from the neonatal intensive care unit, and the older patients were from other pediatric wards. Cultures were obtained from the environment and from health care workers' hands as part of an outbreak investigation. C meningosepticum was isolated from hand cultures obtained from a senior resident and from environmental cultures obtained from powdered infant formula, an electrical button, a computer keyboard, phone, a doorknob, and an Ambu bag. Antibiogram typing and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction indicated that all of the isolates were epidemiologically related. Nine patients improved on antimicrobial treatment, and 4 premature infants died after the infection. C meningosepticum is a well-known etiologic agent for nosocomial infections involving newborns and immunocompromised patients. Wet and dry environmental surfaces and equipment may act as a source or play a role in disseminating the microorganism. Outbreaks may be controlled with strong emphasis on infection control measures.
