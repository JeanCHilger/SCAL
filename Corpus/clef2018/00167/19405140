Neonatal acute myeloid leukemia in an infant whose mother was exposed to diethylstilboestrol in utero. We report on an acute myeloid leukemia in a neonate whose mother was exposed to diethylstilboestrol in utero. The newborn presented with leukemia cutis, hemorrhagic skin lesions, hyperleucocytosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. A bone marrow examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia with a t(1119) MLL-ELL fusion transcript. Chemotherapy was initiated but the child developed a bilateral pulmonary infection that led to fatal respiratory distress. This case shows acute myeloid leukemia and the third pediatric leukemia reported after maternal diethylstilboestrol exposure.
