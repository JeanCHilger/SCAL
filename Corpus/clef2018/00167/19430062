Cytomegalovirus infection in six neonates. Neonatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common, has myriad presentations and severe sequelae. Six neonates clinically suspected of CMV infection were confirmed by qualitative PCR (Digene) and evaluated. Those with persistent viremia were treated with Ganciclovir intravenously for 4-6 weeks, and continued orally, if required, with close monitoring. All had prolonged jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and hematological manifestations in the acute stage. Complications included developmental delay (66%), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (33%), chorioretinitis and obstructive jaundice (18% each). Three cleared viremia spontaneously. The remaining were offered Ganciclovir. One declined, and two completed therapy with clinical resolution and no adverse events. Accurate diagnosis of neonatal CMV enables appropriate treatment with Ganciclovir, which can reverse end-organ damage and limit sequelae.
