Congenital toxoplasmosis after a preconceptional or periconceptional maternal infection. We report a case of asymptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis following a periconceptional infection of the mother. Fetal infection is very uncommon in such a situation, and mostly associated with fetal damage. We recommend that newborns undergo postnatal screening, even after maternal periconceptional infection, and receive specific therapy to reduce long-term sequelae.
