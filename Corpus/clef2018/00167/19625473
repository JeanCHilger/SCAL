New real-time PCR detects prolonged norovirus excretion in highly immunosuppressed patients and children. Noroviruses (NoV) are a major cause of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis and affect all age groups worldwide. Three of five NoV genogroups, namely, genogroup I (GI), GII, and GIV, are associated with human disease. Unfortunately, these genogroups demonstrate a high degree of sequence diversity, complicating the design of pan-NoV diagnostic PCR tests. To decrease the risk of false-negative test results, we have developed a new one-step real-time TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR protocol. This protocol detects all human NoV genogroups in one reaction with a sensitivity of 400 virus genome equivalents/reaction for both GI and GII. The use of in vitro-transcribed NoV RNA as an external standard allows (semi)quantification of viral loads in samples. In a retrospective analysis of 206 stool samples from 77 patient episodes, the duration of NoV excretion and the amount of virus excreted were determined. Twenty (26.0%) of these episodes lasted longer than 10 days. Univariate risk factor analysis revealed the patient status after organ transplantation (odds ratio [OR], 7.49 [95% confidence interval, 2.06 to 28.32] P < 0.001), immunosuppression (OR, 9.19 [95% confidence interval, 2.50 to 35.39]
