Comparison of the effect of antibiotic treatment on the possibility of diagnosing invasive pneumococcal disease by culture or molecular methods: a prospective, observational study of children and adolescents with proven pneumococcal infection. Detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in culture specimens in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) may be hampered by antibiotic treatment administered before hospital admission. Realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays do not require viable bacteria and are therefore less influenced by antimicrobial therapy. It is not known how long results of culture or molecular tests remain positive after antibiotic therapy is begun.The goal of the current study was to assess, in a pediatric population with a diagnosis of IPD confirmed by laboratory tests (culture and/or RT-PCR assay), the relationship between use of antibiotic therapy before hospital admission and the result of diagnostic methods (culture or molecular techniques) after admission.This prospective, observational study was conducted from April 2006 through March 2009. All children and adolescents aged 0 to 16 years, admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of IPD confirmed by culture and/or molecular methods, were included in the study. Previous antibiotic treatment (drug, duration of therapy) was recorded. Primers and probes designed from the pneumococcal autolysin gene (lytA) were used in an RT-PCR assay for detection of S pneumoniae. Antibiotic tolerability, permanent sequelae (after a 6-month follow-up), and deaths were recorded.Eighty-three patients (50 males, 33 females 80 white, 3 AsianIn these children and adolescents with IPD, the molecular methods used appeared to be more sensitive than culture in any IPD patient, with a higher statistical significance in patients previously treated with antibiotics and in patients with pneumonia.
