Diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii by ELISA and PCR in mothers and their infants. Congenital Toxoplasma gondii infection may lead to abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death as well as severe congenital toxoplasmosis in the newborn infants. No doubt, early and proper diagnosis of infection pregnant women or her baby pave the way to effective treatment and minimize complications. In this study the PCR and ELISA-IgM were used to diagnose active toxoplasmosis. The results revealed that PCR detected very recently infection (23/70 subjects) than ELISA-IgM (18/70 ones). However, the use of both ELISA-IgM and PCR together improved the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
