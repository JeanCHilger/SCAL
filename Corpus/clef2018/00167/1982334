Characterization of strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Wien isolated in Italy: an epidemiological evaluation. In the years 1987-1988, 110 strains of Wien serovar were isolated from a gastroenteritis outbreak in a neonatal unit in Palermo (Sicily). These strains showed different drug resistance patterns and plasmid profiles. Analysis of endonuclease restriction fragments of chromosomal DNA by hybridization with E. coli rRNA has demonstrated that a single bacterial clone or its derivatives were responsible for the outbreak. Furthermore, the study of 139 strains, isolated since 1970 from different geographic locations of the Mediterranean area, has confirmed a notable degree of homogeneity within Wien serovar, even though the detection of genetic polymorphisms in some isolates suggests that a number of distinct bacterial strains contributes to maintain the circulation of Wien serovar.
