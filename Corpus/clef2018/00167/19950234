High prevalence of species D human adenoviruses in fecal specimens from Urban Kenyan children with diarrhea. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide range of clinical syndromes and are classified in seven species, A-G, comprising 52 serotypes. HAdV-A31, -F40, and -F41 have been associated with diarrhea in infants and young children. In developing countries gastroenteritis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and, in comparison to rotaviruses, there are no data on the HAdVs associated with diarrhea in pediatric patients in Kenya. This study investigates the prevalence and genotypes of HAdVs in 278 stool specimens (211 diarrheal 67 non-diarrheal) from children < or =14 years of age in urban and rural areas in Kenya. Stool specimens were screened for HAdVs using a nested polymerase chain reaction and the HAdVs genotyped by sequence analysis of a conserved hexon gene fragment. HAdVs were detected in 104/278 (37.4%) of the stool specimens: 35/43 (81.4%) of diarrheal and 10/61 (16.4%) of non-diarrheal stool specimens from children in an urban hospice
