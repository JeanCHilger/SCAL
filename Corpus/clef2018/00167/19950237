Detection of GII-4/2006b variant and recombinant noroviruses in children with acute gastroenteritis, South Korea. Norovirus (NoV), a single-stranded, positive RNA virus, is an important etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. In this study, a total of 434 fecal samples collected from 434 children with acute gastroenteritis in Seoul, between September 2007 and July 2008 were tested to determine the molecular epidemiology of NoVs and characterize recombinant strains by using RT-PCR followed by sequencing. Of the 434 specimens, NoV, rotavirus, and adenovirus were detected in 155 (35.8%), 72 (16.6%), and 19 specimens (4.3%), respectively. NoV GI was detected in 7 specimens (1.6%) and GII in 148 (34.1%) specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of capsid sequences in the GII-positive specimens revealed the presence of the following strains: GII-4, 111 (75.0%) GII-3, 35 cases (23.6%)
