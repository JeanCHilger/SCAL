Clinical characteristics and outcomes of neonatal pertussis: a comparative study. We describe the features and outcomes of neonatal pertussis and compare these with neonates with non-pertussis acute respiratory illness from July 2000 through December 2007. Patients with pertussis had a more severe course of disease as evidenced by the clinical presentation, length of hospitalization, and oxygen requirement. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion so that appropriate supportive care can be initiated promptly.
