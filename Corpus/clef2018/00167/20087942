Detection and molecular characterization of human rotaviruses isolated in Italy and Albania. Rotaviruses are one of the most important causes of gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old. Analysis of G and P rotavirus genotypes in circulation is crucial in evaluating the appropriacy of mass vaccination of children worldwide. Overall, 592 stool samples were collected in Tirana (Albania), the Salento peninsula (South Italy), and three different hospitals in Rome (Central Italy). Of the total samples, 31.3% were rotavirus positive in Albania, 78.3% in the Salento, and 40.3% in Rome. The samples collected in Tirana and Rome were G-P typed, whereas the samples collected in the Salento were only G typed. Overall, in Italy the most frequent combinations were G4 P[8] (54.5%), G1 P[8] (27.3%), and G2 P[4] (18.2%) in Albania they were G9 P[8] (72.1%), G4 P[8] (8.8%), G1 P[8] (5.9%), and G2 P[4] (2.9%). The prevalence in Albania of atypical combinations was 7.4% for G4 P[4] and 2.9% for G9 P[4]. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed to assess the genetic relatedness of the strains. J. Med.
