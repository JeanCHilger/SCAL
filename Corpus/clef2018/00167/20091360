Antenatal diagnostic problem of congenital rubella. We present a preterm neonate who developed congenital rubella syndrome in a mother who had rubella at 5 months of gestation. An amniocentesis was done in the mother at that time but amniotic fluid rubella PCR was negative. Thus, inspite of prenatal screening, one cannot definitely conclude absence of perinatal transmission of rubella.
