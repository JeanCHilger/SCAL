Usefulness of two new methods for diagnosing metapneumovirus infections in children. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is associated with acute respiratory tract infections, mainly in paediatric patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of two new commercial techniques available for the detection of hMPV in clinical samples from children: an enzyme immunoassay, hMPV EIA (Biotrin International Ltd), and a molecular assay, real-time RT-PCR (Pro hMPV Real Time Assay Kit Prodesse). A total of 184 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 173 children aged less than 5 years who were hospitalized with acute wheezing were analysed. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 27% of the samples, followed by influenza A virus (6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV)3 (2.2%), adenovirus (2%), PIV1 (1.1%), PIV2 (1.1%), and influenza B virus (0.5%). The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples, using the real-time RT-PCR and EIA. Real-time RT-PCR detected 13 hMPV-positive samples (8%), and EIA detected 17 (9.3%). When the EIA results were compared with those of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of hMPV, a good correlation was found (94%). A relatively low co-infection rate (15%) was observed in our patients. RT-PCR and EIA provide robust methods for the diagnosis of hMPV infection in children.
