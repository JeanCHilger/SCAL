Detection of group B Streptococcus bacteria in LIM enrichment broth by peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (PNA FISH) and rapid cycle PCR. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values for the detection of group B Streptococcus (GBS) in 206 LIM enrichment broths by the use of subculture, GBS peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (PNA FISH), and GBS PCR were 96.9%, 100%, 98.6%, and 100% 98.4%, 100%, 99.3%, and 100%
