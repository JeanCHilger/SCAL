Repeated polymerase chain reaction complementary to other conventional methods for early detection of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. The efficacy of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for early detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in infants at risk for HIV infection was assessed. The PCR method was added to the routine laboratory test programme in these patients in 1988. PCR was performed in a total of 26 children at risk (age range 2 days to 58 months), including 17 infants born to HIV-infected mothers, who were followed up clinically from the time of birth for a mean period of 23 months (range 6 to 54) in a prospective study. Twelve children were PCR-positive. Eight had AIDS, ARC or symptoms suggestive of HIV infection. All these patients had at least one culture positive for HIV (6/8) and/or one positive serum p24-antigen test (5/8). One child was repeatedly PCR positive, but asymptomatic as well as virus- and antigen-negative. Three asymptomatic children with a single positive PCR result were PCR negative in subsequent tests. Fourteen children with negative PCR did not show clinical or immunological signs suggestive of HIV infection. Their cultures for HIV and antigen-p24 assays were negative. It is concluded that in addition to clinical and immunological parameters PCR is a useful technique for diagnosis of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. However, in case of negative HIV cultures and/or serum p24-antigen tests, single positive PCR results in asymptomatic patients must be interpreted with caution and should be confirmed by repeated tests.
