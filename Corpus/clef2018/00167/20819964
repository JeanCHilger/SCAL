Cerebrospinal fluid enterovirus testing in infants 56 days or younger. To determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enterovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of febrile neonates is associated with a shorter hospital length of stay (LOS).Retrospective cohort study.Urban tertiary care children's hospital emergency department.Febrile infants 56 days or younger evaluated by means of lumbar puncture.Performance of CSF enterovirus PCR testing.Hospital LOS.A CSF enterovirus PCR test was performed in 361 of 1231 eligible infants (29.3%) 89 of those tested (24.7%) were positive. The median LOS was 2 days. In multivariable analysis, CSF enterovirus PCR testing was associated with a 26.0% shorter LOS for infants with a positive test result (adjusted beta coefficient, -0.305Among infants 56 days or younger, a positive CSF enterovirus PCR test result was associated with a shorter LOS compared with untested infants. The CSF enterovirus PCR test may improve the care of infants with fever.
