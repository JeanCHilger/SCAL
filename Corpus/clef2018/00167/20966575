Nosocomial outbreak of septicaemia in neonatal intensive care unit due to extended spectrum β-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae showing multiple mechanisms of drug resistance. A total of 14 phenotypically similar clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, resistant to multiple drugs including cefotaxime and ceftazidime, were isolated from blood of neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within a short span of 10 days. Alarmed at the possibility of occurrence of outbreak, a thorough investigation was done. Microbiological sampling of the NICU and labour room (LR) environment yielded 12 K. pneumoniae isolates. The presence of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) in the clinical and environmental strains was detected by double-disk synergy test (DDST), CLSI phenotypic confirmatory disk diffusion test (PCDDT) and E-test ESBL strips. Amp-C screen (disk) test was done to determine Amp-C β-lactamase production. 100% clinical strains, 57% NICU strains and 80% LR strains were ESBL positive. 57% clinical, 43% NICU and 20% LR strains were Amp-C screen positive. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of representative ESBL positive (10 clinical and 5 environmental) strains showed CTX gene and TEM and/or SHV gene in all. K. pneumoniae showing multiple mechanisms of drug resistance was responsible for the outbreak.
