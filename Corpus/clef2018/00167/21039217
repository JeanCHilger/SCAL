Rotavirus antigenemia in Indian children with rotavirus gastroenteritis and asymptomatic infections. Rotavirus gastroenteritis results in significant morbidity and mortality in Indian children. Although there are numerous studies on rotavirus diarrhea, there are few reports on antigenemia and extraintestinal presentations in these populations.Following screening for rotavirus antigen of stool samples from children with and without acute gastroenteritis with a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA), a total of 199 stool and serum sample pairs were identified for additional testing. All EIA-positive stool samples were genotyped, and viral load estimated by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were tested for rotavirus antigen by an in-house EIA, and antigen was quantified by optical density. Scoring of disease severity was performed for all hospitalized children. Data on extra-intestinal presentations were collected if available.Based on screening of stool samples by EIA, the study population could be divided into 3 groups, including 111 children with rotavirus diarrhea, 44 children with diarrhea and no rotavirus detected in stool specimens, and 44 children with asymptomatic rotavirus infection. Antigenemia was significantly higher among children with rotavirus diarrhea (50.4%) than among children with non-rotaviral diarrhea (16%) or asymptomatic infections (2.3%) (P < .001). Low copies of rotavirus were detected by RT-PCR in all 7 children with EIA-negative stool specimens and antigenemia. Presence and levels of rotavirus antigen in serum specimens correlated with stool viral load. Children with antigenemia had significantly more-severe disease but not more extraintestinal presentations than did children without antigenemia.Antigenemia occurs frequently in rotavirus infection and correlates with virus replication in the gut but not with extra-intestinal presentations.
