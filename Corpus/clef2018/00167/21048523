Laboratory-based rotavirus surveillance during the introduction of a vaccination program, Brazil, 2005-2009. : Brazil introduced universal antirotavirus vaccination in March 2006. This article reports the results of rotavirus A (RV-A) surveillance from January 2005 to December 2009.: A total of 6109 fecal samples were collected in 18 Brazilian states. RV-A was detected by enzyme immunoassay and/or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and genotyped through seminested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.: RV-A was detected in 20.3% (n = 1242) of the samples. Among children less than 2 years old, regardless the antirotavirus vaccination status, the rates of RV-A detection were 33.8% in 2005, 23.7% in 2006, 16.8% in 2007, 22.9% in 2008, and 18.3% in 2009 (P < 0.001 Ï‡ test for linear trend). Among RV-A-positive samples, genotype G1P[8] or G1P[not typed(NT)] was detected in 14% in 2005, 12.3% in 2006, 9.5% in 2007, 0.7% in 2008, and 20.4% in 2009: Our data demonstrate the reemergence of RV-A genotype G2P[4] in Brazil from 2005 to 2008, and that the rate of G2P[4] detection decreased in 2009, probably reflecting natural oscillations of RV-A genotypes.
