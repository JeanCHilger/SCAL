High viral load and deregulation of the progesterone receptor signaling pathway: association with hepatitis E-related poor pregnancy outcome. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is associated with high maternal and fetal mortalities. A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the role of viral and host factors in HEV related pregnancy outcomes.The study included HEV infected pregnancy cases acute viral hepatitis (AVH), n=100 and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), n=43, and healthy pregnancy cases, n=50. HEV genotypes and viremia were studied by nucleotide sequencing and real time PCR, respectively. Progesterone receptor (PR) gene mutations (PROGINS) were studied by PCR, PR expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the placenta were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF) expression was studied by RT-PCR in blood. Serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels were assayed by ELISA.HEV viral load was significantly higher in FHF than AVH (p<0.001) and in cases with fetal mortality in AVH (p=0.001) and FHF (p=0.018). PROGINS were predominant in FHF compared to AVH (p=0.26) and showed reduced mRNA and protein expression. The risk of fetal mortality in AVH was two times higher (OR, 2.190 CI, 0.303-15.85) and maternal and fetal mortalities in FHF were 4-fold (OR, 4.0In conclusion, reduced expression of PR and PIBF, a higher IL-12/IL-10 ratio, and a high viral load results in poor pregnancy outcome in Hepatitis E.
