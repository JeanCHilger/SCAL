2009H1N1 Infection in a 1-day-old neonate. A full-term female neonate was delivered with meconium stained amniotic fluid by cesarean section by a 2009H1N1 positive 22-year-old second gravida mother, who developed symptoms 8 days prior to delivery. The neonate was completely and immediately isolated from the mother after delivery. Oseltamivir was started at birth to the neonate who had a potential possibility of 2009H1N1 infection. At 5 hours of life, the neonate developed respiratory distress. The neonate's throat swab sent for 2009H1N1 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive. The neonate required oxygen by hood for 3 days and made an uneventful recovery. The mother developed acute respiratory distress syndrome after delivery, requiring ventilatory care for 14 days and was discharged after 25 days stay in hospital. 2009H1N1 infection, although rare, needs a high index of suspicion and prompt therapy in neonates. Clinicians should be alert about the possibility of perinatal transmission of 2009H1N1.
