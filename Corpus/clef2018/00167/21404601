Annual incidence of human group A rotavirus G-serotypes detected in a Japanese University Hospital between 2003 and 2007. Group A rotavirus G-serotyping by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using university hospital subject samples in September 2003 to August 2004, September 2004 to August 2005, September 2005 to August 2006, and September 2006 to August 2007 showed the most common serotypes G1 and G3, detected in 27 and 33 subjects, compared to 4 subjects in whom serotype G4 was detected. Between 2003 and 2004, serotypes G1 accounted for 50% and G3 for 38%, contrasting with serotype G3 at 79% between 2004 and 2005, serotype G1 at 91% between 2005 and 2006, and serotype G1 and G3 at 37% and 63% between 2006 and 2007, respectively. Serotypes G2 and G9 were not detected at all during any of our time periods. No correlation was seen between subject age and G serotype, although subjects younger than two years old accounted for 73% of subjects. This infection caused combined fever, diarrhea, and vomiting in 48% of subjects but showed no correlation with G serotype. These findings under-score the importance of G-serotyping in understanding rotavirus infection epidemiology at different times and in different locales.
