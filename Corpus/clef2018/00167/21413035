Does normal fetal brain ultrasound predict normal neurodevelopmental outcome in congenital cytomegalovirus infection? We evaluated the neuropsychological outcome of children with proven congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and normal consecutive fetal neurosonographic examinations.We retrospectively reviewed laboratory and imaging findings of children with congenital CMV infection. The study group consisted of children with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in amniotic fluid and virus isolation in urine in the first week of life, and normal fetal ultrasonographic (US) examination findings, including a normal multiplanar neurosonographic evaluation. Patients with abnormal magnetic resonance (MR) findings were not excluded. The study and control groups were evaluated for cognitive, language, and motor development at one follow-up examination conducted at 11-81 months of age.Children with congenital CMV infection and normal fetal brain findings in the US examination did not differ from the control group in terms of cognitive, language, motor, emotional-behavioral, and executive functioning. There were no differences between congenitally infected children who had a normal fetal brain MR examination and children whose fetal brain MR examination raised suspicion of a possible brain insult.Normal neurosonographic examinations during pregnancy appear to predict a normal early neuropsychological outcome in fetuses with congenital CMV infection. Outcome did not correlate with suspected abnormal white matter on fetal MR imaging.
