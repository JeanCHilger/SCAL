Maternal and neonatal outcome of pregnant women infected with H1N1 influenza virus (swine flu). To investigate maternal and neonatal outcome of pregnant women infected with H1N1 influenza virus.We prospectively followed all pregnant women hospitalized with positive H1N1 influenza virus nasal polymerase chain reaction tests between September 2009 and April 2010. Maternal and neonatal complications were recorded.Twenty-four women positive for H1N1 were hospitalized. Only 2 women suffered from asthma, all others had no co-morbidities. Most women were in the third trimester (14 women, 58%). Common presenting symptoms were dyspnea (83%) and Fever (79%). Eleven women (46%) had pneumonia/Adult Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) on chest X-rays. Six women were actively delivered due to maternal or fetal distress. Gestational age at delivery for these women was significantly lower (34 weeks vs. 39 weeks, p = 0.005). Of women delivered, five were admitted to intensive care units (ICU), three needed mechanical ventilation, and one tracheostomy. Patients admitted to ICU had significantly higher white blood cell (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). The main neonatal complication was prematurity where delivery was indicated.H1N1 flu pandemic has the potential of causing serious maternal morbidity during pregnancy. ARDS, elevated WBC and CRP levels correlate with more severe cases. Prematurity is associated with severity of maternal disease.
