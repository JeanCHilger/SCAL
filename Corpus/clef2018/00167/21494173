Disseminated congenital toxoplasma infection with a type II strain. Disseminated congenital toxoplasmosis mimicking septic shock is unusual. We report a fatal case of disseminated congenital toxoplasmosis that was acquired after a third trimester maternal primary infection. The child had severe pneumonitis, purpura, and hepatitis. After 5 days of treatment, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that parasite loads in the serum and in tracheal aspirates had decreased. The child died of refractory hypoxemia. Genotyping revealed a type II strain.
