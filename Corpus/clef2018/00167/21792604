Cytomegalovirus. Pathological-anatomical manifestations and detection methods. Human cytomegalovirus, a double-stranded DNA virus, is a member of the Herpesviridae family with high rates of transmission. Primary infection is often asymptomatic and leads to life-long latency. Reactivation may induce different organ manifestations, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression. Histopathologically, the virus can be detected by light microscopy. Different cell populations in different organs are transformed into"owl's eye" cells, which are pathognomonic. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy can be applied as complementary methods. Various PCR approaches in molecular pathology including nested PCR, capture probe ELISA-PCR and real time PCR confer HCMV tests high sensitivity and specificity. The present article discusses the methods of pathological diagnostic approaches and describes organ manifestations of HCMV.
