Evaluation of vertical transmission of two species of ureaplasmas in term newborns without respiratory disorders--a preliminary study. Pregnancy promotes ureaplasma vaginal colonization. This creates the possibility of vertical transmission of these organisms to the child. These microorganisms can cause complications during pregnancy and poor condition of newborn.Objectives of this study were to analyze the vertical transmission of different species of ureaplasmas in term newborns without respiratory distress.The study included 50 mothers and 50 of their newborn children. Swabs were obtained from swabs of the cervix in women and tracheal aspirates from neonates. The presence of ureaplasmas was confirmed by culture and PCR. Ureaplasmas species identification was performed using PCR.infection of ureaplasmas was found in 21 women (42%). Predominant species was U. parvum, which was found in 18 women. In 3 patients only the presence of U. urealyticum was confirmed. Ureaplasma infection in mother and her newborn baby was confirmed in 8 (17.4%) mother-child pairs, including 6 of these cases showing the presence of U. parvum and 2 U. urealyticum. The incidence of vertical transmission of ureaplasma infection was assessed at 33% for U. parvum and 67% for U. urealyticum, and the total for both species at 38%. It should be noted that in the group of 18 women infected with U.parvum, in 12 cases there was no transmission of infection to the child. However in 3 women infected with U. urealyticum 2 cases of transmission from mother to child were observed (67%). Although the group infected with U. urealyticum accounted for only 3 women, our preliminary observations may suggest that this species is probably more likely to be transferred from mother to child.Infection with U. urealyticum may be more frequently transferred from the genital tract of mother to child.
