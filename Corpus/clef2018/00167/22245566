Production of large numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells with functional activities from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells: use of interleukin-3. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), a subset of dendritic cells characterized by a rapid and massive type-I interferon secretion through the Toll-like receptor pathway in response to viral infection, play important roles in the pathogenesis of several diseases, such as chronic viral infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus), autoimmunity (e.g., psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and cancer. As pDC represent a rare cell type in the peripheral blood, the goal of this study was to develop a new method to efficiently generate large numbers of cells from a limited number of CD34(+) cord blood progenitors to provide a tool to resolve important questions about how pDC mediate tolerance, autoimmunity, and cancer. Human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from cord blood were cultured with a combination of Flt3-ligand (Flt3L), thrombopoietin (TPO), and one of the following cytokine: interleukin (IL)-3, interferon-β(IFN-β), or prostaglandin E2(PGE(2)). Cells obtained in the different culture conditions were analyzed for their phenotype and functional characteristics. The addition of IL-3 cooperates with Flt3L and TPO in the induction of pDC from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Indeed, Flt3L/TPO alone or supplemented with prostaglandin E2 or interferon-β produced smaller amounts of pDC from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, pDC generated in Flt3L/TPO/IL-3 cultures exhibited morphological, immunohistochemical, and functional features of peripheral blood pDC. We showed that IL-3, in association with Flt3L and TPO, provides an advantageous tool for large-scale generation of pDC. This culture condition generated, starting from 2 × 10(5) CD34(+) cells, up to 2.6 × 10(6) pDC presenting features of blood pDC.
