High detection frequency and viral loads of human rhinovirus species A to C in fecal samples diagnostic and clinical implications. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) can be divided into three species HRV-A to HRV-C. Up to 148 different HRV (sero)types have been identified to date. Because of sequence similarity between 5'-NCR of HRVs and enteroviruses (EVs), it is problematic to design EV-specific RT-PCR assays. The aims of this study were to assess the rate of false-detection of different rhinoviruses by EV RT-PCR, and to evaluate the diagnostic and clinical significance of such cross-reactivity. In vitro RNA transcripts of HRV A-C created from cDNA templates were quantified spectrophotometrically. Six hundred twenty-one stool samples screened as part of routine diagnostic for EV, 17 EV-positive stool samples referred for typing, 288 stool samples submitted for gastroenteritis investigations, and 1,500 CSF samples were included in the study. EV-specific RT-PCR detected RNA transcripts of HRV-A1b, HRV-B14, and HRV-Crpat18 but with 10-1,000 reduced sensitivity compared to EV transcripts. Screening fecal samples by EV RT-PCR identified 13 positive samples identified subsequently as rhinoviruses
