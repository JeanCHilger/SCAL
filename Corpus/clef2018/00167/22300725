Prospective epidemiologic surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia in children in San José, Costa Rica. Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in children <5 years of age, globally. This surveillance determined incidence rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), clinical and chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia (CXR+Pn) and SP serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility in children in San José, Costa Rica.This was a 2-year prospective, population-based surveillance conducted in 2007-2009 in children aged 28 days to 36 months presenting to participating healthcare centers. Eligibility criteria for study inclusion were as follows: temperature ≥ 39.0°C within 24h and/or clinical suspicion of IPD or pneumonia.8801 subjects were enrolled. Median age: 14.5 months. A total of 25 children had invasive pneumococcal disease with S. pneumoniae isolated from nonduplicative cultures (22) or detected solely by PCR and a clinical picture consistent with IPD (3). Sources of positive cultures (some children had >1 positive culture) were: blood (20), pleural fluid (4), and cerebrospinal fluid (3). Of the 3 cases detected solely by PCR, 2 were from cerebrospinal fluid and 1 from pleural fluid. The overall IPD incidence rates for culture-positive only cases for children aged 28 days to <3 years was 33.7/100,000 per year for years 1 and 2 combined. Age stratification of culture-positive only subjects showed a peak during year 1 (106.8/100,000) in children 28 days to <6 months of age group, and in year 2 (45.5/100,000) in children 12 months to <24 months of age group. Most common serotypes were 14 (28.6%), followed by 3, 4, 6A, 19A, and 22F (9.5% each). Of 22 nonduplicative IPD isolates, 42.9% were penicillin- and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole nonsusceptible isolates. Consideration of PCR-positive cases increases the incidence of IPD for children aged 28 days to <3 years to 46.0/100,000. Overall incidence of clinical pneumonia and CXR+Pn was 1968/100,000 and 551/100,000, respectively.There is a considerable burden of IPD and pneumonia in children in San José. These epidemiologic data serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of the incorporation of new conjugate pneumococcal vaccines into the National Immunization Program in Costa Rican children.
