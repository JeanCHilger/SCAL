Respiratory viral infections during the first 28 days after transplantation in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Respiratory viruses (RVs) are a known cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this retrospective study, we focused on the first 28 d after transplantation in pediatric HSCT recipients and showed that a multiplex PCR assay significantly increased RV detection compared with a viral culture method. Among 176 pediatric HSCT recipients, 84 with respiratory symptoms within one yr after HSCT were tested by viral culture or multiplex PCR. Within 28 d after HSCT, nine patients were infected with RVs the incidence of a first episode of RV infection within 28 d after HSCT was 5.1%. Eight patients recovered without complications. However, one patient died of adenovirus (AdV) pneumonia with pulmonary hemorrhage
