Fetal Parvowirus B19 infection with hydrops fetalis, a case report. Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection during pregnancy is a cause of nonimmune hydrops. We report a case of hydrops fetalis with severe fetal anemia in the course of B19V infection in the third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal and fetal parvovirus B19 infection was confirmed using quantitative real time PCR detection of viral DNA. The affected fetus was treated with three intrauterine transfusions. The baby was delivered by caesarean section at 36 weeks. Up until 6 months of age no abnormalities in the development of the child were observed.
