Ophthalmological findings in congenital cytomegalovirus infection: when to screen, when to treat? Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of known congenital viral infections. Approximately 90% of congenitally infected newborns exhibit no clinical abnormalities at birth. In 5% to 15%, a wide spectrum of clinical signs is present at birth. Ophthalmological signs are seen in a large percentage of symptomatic patients but rarely in otherwise asymptomatic infants. Chorioretinitis, optic atrophy, and cortical visual impairment are the most frequent causes of visual problems in congenitally infected infants. There is no clear consensus in the literature on screening or treatment modalities concerning the ophthalmological aspects of congenital CMV. Further prospective studies are needed to set up guidelines for ophthalmological screening and treatment of infants with congenital CMV.
