Detection of human bocavirus in children with upper respiratory tract infection by polymerase chain reaction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether in children with middle ear effusions (MEE), adenoid and tonsil tissues are associated with human bocavirus (HBoV).A total of 124 patients (56 females (45.2%) and 68 males (54.8%)) with chronic adenotonsillitis and serous otitis media under the age of 15 were recruited. Two hundered four samples (113 adenoid (55.4%), 68 tonsil (33.3%), and 23 middle ear effusion (11.3%)) were analyzed for the presence of HBoV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).HBoV was detected in only 6 (4.8%) adenoid tissue samples each belonging to a different patient.Our findings are consistent with the results of other studies, reporting approximately 5 - 10% of the samples being positive for HBoV. To understand the detailed role of HBoV in the etiology of RTI in children, further studies would be needed.
