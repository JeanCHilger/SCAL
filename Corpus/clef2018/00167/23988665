Epidemiological characteristics of norovirus associated with sporadic gastroenteritis among children from the 2006/2007 to 2011/2012 season in Nara Prefecture, Japan. The present study aimed to describe the epidemiological characteristics of norovirus (NoV) associated with sporadic gastroenteritis in regional populations of Nara Prefecture, Japan, from the 2006/2007 to 2011/2012 epidemic season. Fecal specimens of sporadic gastroenteritis collected between September 2006 and August 2012 in Nara Prefecture were examined for the presence of NoV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The NoV genotype was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis. In total, 274 NoVs associated with sporadic gastroenteritis were identified. We detected 10 different NoV genotypes: GI/3, GI/4, GI/8, GII/2, GII/3, GII/4, GII/6, GII/7, GII/12, and GII/13. A high NoV detection rate of 35.9% was identified in 1-year-old children. Among the 274 NoV isolates, 142 were obtained from males and 131 were obtained from females (the source of one was unknown). The most prevalent genotype was GII/4, accounting for 117 of the 192 different NoVs identified by sequencing. More epidemiological data will be required to determine the epidemiological characteristics of NoVs in other areas of Japan.
