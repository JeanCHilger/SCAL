Toxoplasmic infections in pregnancy: about 94 cases diagnosed at the Pasteur Institute of Tunis. The objectives of this study were to estimate the risk of maternal-fetal transmission of toxoplasmosis and its consequences on the fetus and to emphasize the importance of follow-up of newborns in Tunisia.It was a retrospective study of 94 cases of pergravidic toxoplasmic seroconversion who were diagnosed and followed in the Laboratory of Parasitology of Pasteur Institute of Tunis between 2005 and 2010.In our series, amniocentesis was performed for 60 parturients. Among the amniotic fluid tested, research of toxoplasmosis DNA by PCR was positive in 12 cases (12/60, 20 %). Twenty-six cases of congenital toxoplasmosis were diagnosed with 14 postnatal cases. The rate of maternal-fetal transmission of Toxoplasma gondii was 27.6 % (26/94). This risk increases with gestational age, from 19 % at seroconversion of the 1st quarter to 29.4 % in the 2nd quarter and 44.4 % in the 3rd trimester. Monitoring of newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis showed that only 3 children were symptomatic. There were 2 cases of toxoplasmic chorioretinitis and a case of brain damage. Under serological monitoring of newborns, 21 cases were lost to follow-up and monitoring was stopped for 29 after decrease of anti-toxoplasmic IgG.The prenatal diagnosis allowed to decrease the severe forms of congenital toxoplasmosis in Tunisia. Nevertheless, it is always necessary to raise the problem of the significant number of newborn children whose follow-up is incomplete.
