Relationship between toll-like receptor 2 Arg677Trp and Arg753Gln and toll-like receptor 4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms and cytomegalovirus infection. The association among specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR2 (Arg677Trp, Arg753Gln) and TLR4 (Asp299Gln) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was studied in infants and adults.The TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms were genotyped in 151 patients with CMV infections and in 78 unrelated healthy individuals. Genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments. The viral load was measured by quantitative real-time PCR.Almost all of the patients with CMV infections were wild-type homozygotes without TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms. No significant differences in TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms were observed between infants with or without CMV infection. Compared with adults with CMV infections, heterozygosity for the TLR2 Arg677Trp and TLR4 Asp299Gly SNPs was detected more frequently in healthy individuals (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the wild-type TLR2 genotype was associated with an increased risk of CMV infection and that heterozygosity for TLR2 and TLR4 SNPs diminished the risk of CMV infection in adult patients. An association between CMV load and the TLR4 SNP was found.Our results suggest that the wild-type TLR2 genotype may be a risk factor for CMV replication in adult patients.
