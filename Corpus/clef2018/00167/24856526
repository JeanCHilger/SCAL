Pertussis: relevant species and diagnostic update. Pertussis is increasing due to multiple factors including increasing awareness by clinicians, decreased effectiveness of vaccines, and improved testing. While Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of pertussis other Bordetella species such as B. parapertussis, and B. holmesii, have been associated with pertussis-like illness. Laboratory diagnosis is made using various tests with molecular methods supplanting culture due to increased sensitivity. Serology is useful but standardized methods that are needed. The targets used for molecular detection are varied and have differing sensitivities and specificities. Laboratorians must consider if differentiation of various Bordetella species is necessary when choosing an amplified testing approach.
