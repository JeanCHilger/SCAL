Infectious involvement in a tertiary center pediatric uveitis cohort. Studies of uveitis in children have focused primarily on non-infectious causes. To date, no systematic study of infectious uveitis in children has been conducted. We investigate the prevalence of infectious causes of uveitis in children and explore the diagnostic value of analysing aqueous humour.Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary referral centre for paediatric uveitis. Medical records of 345 children with uveitis presenting from 1995 through 2010 were reviewed for infectious causes (by serology and aqueous humour analysis).A diagnosis of infectious uveitis was established in 60/345 (17%) children. The most prevalent pathogen was Toxoplasma gondii (36/60 60%), followed by viral infections (18/60An infectious cause of uveitis was identified in 17% of children with uveitis. T gondii and VZV were the most prevalent pathogens. We recommend analysing the aqueous humour of every child with vision-threatening uveitis of undetermined origin.
