Evaluation of a rapid antigen detection point-of-care test for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in a pediatric hospitalized population in the Netherlands. This pilot study evaluates the diagnostic performance of Sofia RSV Fluorescent Immunoassay Analyzer (FIA) and Sofia Influenza A + B FIA for rapid detection of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B. Sofia had a lower-than-expected sensitivity for all viruses and a high rate of false-positive results for influenza B virus.
