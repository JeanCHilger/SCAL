Polymorphism rs2239185 in vitamin D receptor gene is associated with severe community-acquired pneumonia of children in Chinese Han population: a case-control study. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a potential candidate gene for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Examining the susceptibility VDR gene for CAP is essential for early intervention, prevention of related complications, and improvement of outcome. A case-control study was performed to examine the association between rs2239185 of VDR gene and CAP among children in Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were used to genotype rs2239185 in 91 CAP children and 94 healthy children. For rs2239185, individuals with TT genotype showed a significantly higher risk of CAP than those with CC plus CT genotypes (P = 0.008). The occurrence of T allele of rs2239185 was significantly more frequent in CAP children than those in normal controls (P = 0.045).We found through stratification analysis that CAP children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), leukocyte count (WBC) >10 × 10(9)/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) >25 mg/L, procalcitonin (PCT) >2 ng/mL, and pediatric critical illness score <80 scores showed significantly higher frequency of TT genotype than those in normal controls (P = 0.0012, 0.0035, 0.0005, 0.0002, and 0.0021, respectively).TT genotype of rs2239185 in VDR gene might be one of the potential genetic risk factors for CAP, and T allele of rs2239185 might be associated with the susceptibility to CAP and the severity of CAP.
