Mechanism for human papillomavirus transmission at birth. We attempted to investigate mechanisms, in addition to sexual contact, by which human papillomaviruses associated with anogenital tract lesions could be transmitted. Samples of exfoliated cervical cells were obtained from 45 pregnant women and were assayed by Southern blot hybridization analysis for the presence of human papillomavirus nucleic acids. Twenty-five of the 45 women had cells positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. A neonatal nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained at term and analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. We documented the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the oral pharyngeal cavity of the neonates in 15 of 45 nasopharyngeal samples analyzed. Amniotic fluid was obtained from 13 patients when their membranes were artificially ruptured. These samples were assayed for the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid two of the 13 amniotic fluid samples contained human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. The detection of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the oral cavity of neonates is indicative of a perinatal mechanism of viral transmission. The detection of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the amniotic fluid may suggest an in utero mechanism of transmission. However, problems encountered in collecting the amniotic fluid samples preclude us from definitive interpretation of these data.
