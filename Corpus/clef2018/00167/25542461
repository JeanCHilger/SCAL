The emergence of enterovirus D68 in a Dutch University Medical Center and the necessity for routinely screening for respiratory viruses. Since August 2014, an increase in infections caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was reported in the USA and Canada, for the most part in children presenting with severe respiratory symptoms.To determine whether an increase in severe EV-D68 respiratory infections was observed in our region.Samples from patients with respiratory symptoms were screened for viral pathogens, including rhinovirus and enterovirus. Subsequently, samples positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus were routinely sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, an additional method was used to detect EV-D68 specifically.During the first three quarters of the year 2014, 1896 respiratory samples were analyzed 39 (2%) of them tested positive for enterovirus. Eighteen samples tested positive for EV-D68, obtained from 16 different patients admitted to our hospital. Eleven were children below the age of 18, of whom five children needed intensive care treatment. The remaining five samples were from adults, who all had an underlying diseaseWe observed an increase of EV-D68 infections in our population, both in children as well as in adult. In 2014 there have been 16 cases so far, compared to none in 2011 and 2013 and a single case in 2012. Phylogenetic analysis identified two similar clusters as shown in the USA and Canada.
