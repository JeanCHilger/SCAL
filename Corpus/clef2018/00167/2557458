DNA probe technique for diagnosis of human cytomegalovirus infection. A rapid diagnostic assay for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been developed for detecting HCMV DNA in urine samples with 32P-labelled cloned fragment, Eco RI fragment B, of DNA from HCMV strain Towne. 3.2 pg of homologous fragment from HCMV DNA could be detected by the labelled probe, and it did not hybridize DNA from other herpes viruses or human cells in dot hybridization assay. The assay correctly identified all (100%) of 7 coded urine specimen cultures positive for HCMV and 9 (90%) of 10 urine sample cultures negative for HCMV. So the hybridization assay was correct and as sensitive as the currently available tissue culture technique. The infection levels of different populations, such as organ transplantation recipients, patients with infantile hepatitis syndrome, normal infants, fetuses, have been investigated by the hybridization assay in the present study.
