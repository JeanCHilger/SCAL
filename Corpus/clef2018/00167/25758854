Risk factors for malaria and adverse birth outcomes in a prospective cohort of pregnant women resident in a high malaria transmission area of Papua New Guinea. Low birth weight (LBW), anaemia and malaria are common in Papua New Guinean women.To identify risk factors for LBW, anaemia and preterm delivery (PTD), pregnant women recruited into a cohort study in Madang, Papua New Guinea, were followed to delivery.Of 470 women enrolled, delivery data were available for 328 (69.7%). By microscopy, 34.4% (113/328) of women had malaria parasitaemia at enrolment and 12.5% (41/328) at delivery at each time point, PCR detected sub-microscopic parasitaemia in substantially more. Most infections were with Plasmodium falciparumIn coastal Papua New Guinea, malaria and anaemia are important causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
