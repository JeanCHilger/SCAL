Computerized Assessment of Wheezing in Children With Respiratory Syncytial Virus Bronchiolitis Before and After Hypertonic Saline Nebulization. Studies suggest an effect of nebulized hypertonic saline solution on air-flow limitation in subjects with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis, but results are based on subjective scores of clinical severity and are not clear. In this observational study, we used a noninvasive computerized tool to quantify wheezing before and after nebulization with hypertonic saline in children admitted for RSV infection.Twenty-seven children (â‰¤ 24 months old) admitted to the pediatric ward of the Medical Center Leeuwarden with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed RSV bronchiolitis were included. Subjects were simultaneously assessed both clinically and by computerized acoustic monitoring before and 15 min after treatment with nebulized hypertonic saline solution.Clinical assessment, defined by the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score, did not change after nebulization (n = 27, 5.0 vs 4.7, P = .17). Computerized acoustic monitoring showed no improvement in wheezing (n = 27, 3.4% vs 2.0%, P = .05) or inspiration/expiration ratio (0.85 vs 0.85, P = .93) after nebulization.Hypertonic saline nebulization does not improve air flow, as assessed by both clinical and computerized acoustic scores, in children admitted for RSV.
