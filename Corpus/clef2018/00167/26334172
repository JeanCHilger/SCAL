Usefulness of a 16S rDNA real-time PCR to monitor neonatal sepsis and to assist in medical decision to discontinue antibiotics. To monitor the bacterial load in newborns with proven infections on the day of admission, 48 h and 7 days after treatment.Real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting the 16S rDNA.The study recruited 17 newborns and the bacterial load was in general low (<50 CFU/mL). In three of four deaths, the bacterial load values increased, and in 11 of the 13 survivors the values decreased until the third evaluation.Considering the extreme sensitivity and high negative predictive value of qPCR, this test could help to monitor the treatment of neonatal sepsis and to assist in medical decision to discontinue antibiotics.
