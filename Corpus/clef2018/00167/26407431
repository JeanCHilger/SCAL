Prevalence and Seasonal Distribution of Norovirus Detection in Stools Submitted From Pediatric Patients for Enteric Pathogen Testing. The prevalence and seasonal distribution of norovirus infection in children is not well defined. In this study, stool specimens from children suspected of having gastroenteritis were evaluated for the presence of norovirus. When tested retrospectively, 17.4% of samples were positive, primarily with Genogroup GII, peaking in fall and winter.
