Usefulness of a Newly Developed Immunochromatographic Assay Kit for the Detection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus. We evaluated the usefulness of IMMUNOCATCH-RSV (Eiken chemical Co., Ltd.) (IC-A), a newly developed immunochromatographic assay kit for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). For the clinical study, 210 nasal swabs and 134 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract infections in 2013. Three immunochromatographic assay kits (IC-A, IC-B and IC-C), and the RT-PCR method were used for the detection of RSV. The detection times for IC-A, IC-B and IC-C were 8, 15 and 10 minutes, respectively. The positive rates for IC-A using nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates were 33.8% and 35.8%, respectively. For the nasal swab specimens, the total concordance rates of RT-PCR with IC-A, IC-B and IC-C were 96.2% (202/210), 89.5% (188/210), and 90.5% (143/158), respectively. As for the nasopharyngeal aspirates, the total concordance rates of RT-PCR with IC-A, IC-B and IC-C were 96.3% (129/134), 94.0% (125/133), and 97.7% (130/133), respectively. The minimum detection concentration of IC-A was 3.0 x 10(2) TCID50/mL for the RSV subgroup A strain, and 7.5 x 10 TCID50/mL for the RSV subgroup B strain. In conclusion, the current data indicate that IC-A is a useful kit for more rapid and accurate detection of RSV infection.
