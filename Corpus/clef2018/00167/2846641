DNA hybridization assay for congenital cytomegalovirus infection. An in vitro DNA hybridization assay was used to test 281 newborns for congenital infection with cytomegalovirus. The assay utilized an abbreviated method for DNA preparation and a dot blot assay that provided good sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.9%) when compared with standard tissue culture, yet substantially reduced the total time of analysis. This assay would be a useful adjunct to tissue culture to diagnose newborns with congenital infection with cytomegalovirus.
