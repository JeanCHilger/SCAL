Rapid detection of human cytomegalovirus in immunocompromised patients. The Authors have evaluated, by DNA-probe hybridization, the presence of CMV in the cellular fractions of different body fluids from immunocompromised patients. This specific methodology appear to be rapid to perform, adaptable to different clinical samples and sensitive. Even in absence of a supporting evaluation of specific antibodies, direct detection of virus, by DNA-probe, seems to be the most efficient and rapid approach to confirm the diagnosis either of active phase or reactivating of CMV infection.
