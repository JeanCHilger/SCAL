Detection of human cytomegalovirus DNA and viral antigens in tissues of different manifestations of CMV infection. Biopsy and autopsy specimens from 22 patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were investigated by means of in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect viral DNA and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to visualize viral proteins. Both methods proved to be valuable tools for histopathology. ISH sometimes recognized cells that did not show typical CMV inclusions. An antiserum against the full spectrum of viral proteins (non-infectious enveloped particles) detected most cytomegalic cells in disseminated and organ-limited infections. An antiserum against a recombinant polypeptide (XP1) was particularly useful in connatal CMV infections and organ-limited infections. We have demonstrated that IHC and ISH studies in parallel are the best approach to the detection of CMV infections in pathological specimens.
