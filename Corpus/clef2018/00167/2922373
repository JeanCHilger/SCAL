Detection of rubella virus in fetal and placental tissues and in the throats of neonates after serologically confirmed rubella in pregnancy. From 35 therapeutic abortions performed because rubella had occurred at 2-19 weeks of pregnancy, 120 fetal organs, 12 specimens of mixed products of conception, and 15 placentae were tested for rubella virus. Virus was isolated from 10 out of 11 fetuses (91 per cent) from women infected at 2-8 weeks, from 5 out of 8 (63 per cent) infected at 9-10 weeks, and from 2 out of 16 (13 per cent) infected at 11-19 weeks. Hybridization tests for viral RNA on 39 fetal organs from eight cases revealed infection in four additional fetuses. Virus was isolated from only 3 out of 15 aborted placentae, but hybridization tests on six placentae revealed infection in three additional specimens. Hybridization was superior to virus isolation for detecting rubella infection in products of conception and is therefore potentially the better method for examining chorionic villus biopsies. Rubella virus was isolated from the throats of 4 out of 9 infants (44 per cent) infected during the first 12 weeks of gestation, but from none of 13 infected after 17 weeks. Infants in the latter group are unlikely to infect susceptible contacts.
