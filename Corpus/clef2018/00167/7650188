Clinical and epidemiological investigations of Acinetobacter genomospecies 3 in a neonatal intensive care unit. A prospective study of Acinetobacter isolates from a neonatal intensive care unit was performed for 24 months. Fifty-six isolates were obtained from 21 patients, and another eight were obtained from environmental specimens. Infection due to Acinetobacter organisms was established for 16 patients, 6 with septicemia, 9 with pneumonia, and 1 with a wound infection. Further investigations were performed with 38 representative isolates. Twenty-nine isolates were identified as unnamed DNA-DNA hybridization group (genomospecies) 3, three were identified as genomospecies 2 (Acinetobacter baumannii), one was identified as genomospecies 5 (Acinetobacter junii), three were identified as genomospecies 14, and two were unclassified. Eight distinguishable protein profiles, coded I through VIII, were found by cell envelope protein electrophoresis. Profile V, a common profile, was observed for 17 isolates that had been recovered from 11 patients and 1 dust specimen. These isolates, all of which belonged to genomospecies 3, had similar antibiograms and biotypes. This study has revealed that genomospecies 3 can be associated with infection and be spread in hospitals.
