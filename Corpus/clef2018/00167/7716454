Current diagnostic aspects of toxoplasmosis. Biological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is now based more widely on combined use of serology and techniques for detection of the parasite or its constituents. Serologic methods endeavour to describe more reliably the antibodies involved in the humoral response and define their specific antigenic properties. Use of purified parasite proteins and characterization of isotypes having short-lived kinetics now make it possible to be more precise about the date of contamination in the case of first infections however, serology remains of limited interest for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in immunodepressed patients. Techniques for detection of the parasite by cell culture, or of parasite DNA by polymerase chain reaction, now represent the alternatives of choice to direct search or animal inoculation. These techniques are more specifically indicated where the immune response is abnormal or absent, particularly in immunodepressed patients and in the fetus. The results, obtained in a few days, provide a reliable diagnosis and enable specific treatment to be instituted.
