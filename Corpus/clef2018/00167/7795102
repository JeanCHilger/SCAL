Enteroviral infections of the central nervous system. Infections of the CNS with the nonpolio enteroviruses are common and important causes of morbidity in both children and adults. Studies have recently defined the short-term and long-term outcomes of aseptic meningitis due to the enteroviruses. Focal encephalitis is increasingly recognized as a complication of enterovirus infection. Patients at greatest risk for sequelae of CNS enteroviral disease include neonates and those who are immunocompromised. The clinical presentation may mimic that of bacterial or other viral CNS infections, a circumstance making laboratory diagnosis of paramount importance for reducing unnecessary hospitalization and therapy. Recent advances in PCR technology, including its adaptation to a colorimetric microwell plate format, promise to greatly facilitate diagnosis of enteroviral infections. Promising antiviral drugs for CNS disease and other serious manifestations of enteroviral infections are under development.
