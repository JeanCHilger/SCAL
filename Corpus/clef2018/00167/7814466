Transmission of the human polyomavirus JC virus occurs both within the family and outside the family. JC polyomavirus (JCV) is a ubiquitous symbiote in the human population, infecting children asymptomatically and then persisting in renal tissue. We reevaluated the urinary excretion of JCV in subjects in various age groups using PCR. The detection rate for urinary JCV DNA was 9 to 17% until the age of 20 years this rate increased dramatically to about 46% at the ages of 20 to 29 years and then increased gradually with age. Therefore, it appears that in most people excretion of JCV begins at the age of 20 to 29 years, which is earlier than suggested previously. Next, we studied the way in which JCV is spread in the human population. We selected eight Japanese families in which both parents and children excreted JCV in their urine. Their JCV subtypes were determined by PCR amplification of a JCV DNA fragment
