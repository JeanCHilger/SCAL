The child exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus. The care of the child exposed to human immunodeficiency virus extends beyond the treatment of the medical complications of the illness. It begins during the pregnancy by an individualised decision regarding the indication of a prophylactic intervention to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of the virus, includes after delivery the attempt of early diagnosis of the vertical transmission and offers, during each of these circumstances, counselling and social support. A multidisciplinary team, associating pediatricians, nurses, social workers and psychologists, a close collaboration with obstetricians and internists, as well as the access to an expert laboratory are the keys to answer the challenges of this disease.
