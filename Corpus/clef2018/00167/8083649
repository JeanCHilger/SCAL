Genomic characterization of rotavirus strains obtained from hospitalized children with diarrhoea in Bangladesh. Faecal samples were obtained from 111 children hospitalized with acute watery gastroenteritis in a children's hospital in Bangladesh from January to December, 1989. Rotavirus was detected as the aetiologic agent in 35 (32%) of these patients. The electrophoretic pattern of ds-RNA extracted from the rotaviruses showed 11 different migration patterns (six short and five long), as well as some short and long mixed profiles. All four major G serotypes were identified by amplification of a segment of the gene for VP7 using the polymerase chain reaction. A specific serotype could be assigned in 32 (91%) cases. Serotypes G1-G4 accounted for 11%, 37%, 11%, and 23% of isolates respectively. Three (9%) mixed serotypes were identified by this method and were found to be mixtures of serotypes G1 and G4, G2 and G4, and G3 and G4.
