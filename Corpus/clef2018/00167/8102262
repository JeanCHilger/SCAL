The T cell receptor V beta repertoire in HIV-1 infection and disease. Viral superantigens (SAg) were shown in mice to induce anergy and deletion of T cells bearing specific T cell receptor V beta subsets, these perturbations being mainly restricted to CD4+ T cells. In accordance with this model, a putative HIV-associated SAg could contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and AIDS. To reveal the presence of this putative molecule, three study protocols were designed that relied on the fact that similarity of the expressed V beta repertoire of a given pair of individuals is proportional to the relative likeness of their MHC background: (1) by using a quantitative PCR technique that allows simultaneous typing of 24 V beta families, the V beta repertoires of HIV-discordant monozygotic twins were compared (2) the V beta repertoire found in lymph nodes of HIV-infected subjects was contrasted to that found in peripheral blood of the same individuals
