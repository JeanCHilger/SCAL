Arbitrarily primed PCR, ribotyping, and plasmid pattern analysis applied to investigation of a nosocomial outbreak due to Enterobacter cloacae in a neonatal intensive care unit. In December 1992, Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from the oropharynx and respiratory tract of six ventilated neonates hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital. To establish the spread of the outbreak, 41 strains of E. cloacae were analyzed for genotypic markers by three methods: plasmid profile analysis, ribotyping with EcoRI or PvuII endonuclease, and arbitrarily primed (AP) PCR. The tested strains included 12 isolates from the 6 epidemic cases, 4 isolates from the respiratory tract of 4 children hospitalized in other wards during the same period, 13 isolates from 12 children hospitalized in pediatric units before or after the outbreak, and 12 epidemiologically unrelated isolates. Ribotyping and AP PCR demonstrated that each of the last 12 strains exhibited distinct genomic patterns, as did each of the strains isolated from neonates hospitalized before or after the epidemic peak. Conversely, two clones of strains were found among the isolates recovered in December, with concordant results being obtained by the three typing methods: the first clone included seven strains from five ventilated children in the ICU and two children from another ward another clone was shared by one neonate in the ICU and an infant from another ward. These results indicate that ribotyping and AP PCR-the latter applied, to our knowledge, for the first time to the genotypic analysis of E. cloacae--represent very discriminatory tools for the investigation of nosocomial outbreaks caused by this species.
