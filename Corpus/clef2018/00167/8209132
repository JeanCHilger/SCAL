The contribution of PCR to the diagnosis and follow-up of HIV infection. PCR permits diagnosis of HIV infection by the detection of proviral DNA sequences in circulating lymphocytes. It is the method of choice for diagnosing infection in children born to seropositive mothers. PCR is also a helpful tool when the result of serodiagnosis remains indeterminate of atypical. It may allow the diagnosis of HIV infection before p24 antigen and antibodies become detectable. However, its effectiveness for early diagnosis should still be investigated systematically. The routine application of PCR is problematic at the moment because this technique is highly complex and time-consuming. Future developments should aim on one hand at a simplification of the technique and on the other hand at possibilities for quantitation. By allowing measurement of viral burden (provirus frequency in lymphocytes, virus concentration in plasma), PCR will be a decisive aid for follow-up controls of seropositive patients.
