Analysis of gamma delta+ T cells in peripheral blood of children with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The present study examined CD8 antigen expression and variable (V) gene segment usage by T cell receptor (TCR)-gamma delta+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of symptomatic children with perinatal HIV infection. The relative number of gamma delta+, CD8+ T cells in most of the infected children was higher than that in uninfected children from HIV+ or HIV- mothers and correlated with the immunodeficiency status of the patients. Infected infants and children over 1 year old also showed an increased proportion of V delta 1-J delta 1+ T lymphocytes. CD8 expression on those cells was higher in infected than in uninfected infants and children. Sequence analysis of the delta gene rearrangement of the predominant V delta 1 family in peripheral blood of three HIV+ donors revealed extensive junctional diversity. These results suggest that the V delta skewing in the majority of HIV+ children reflects peripheral expansion of V delta 1-J delta 1+ T lymphocytes early in life, which might be involved in the mechanisms of HIV-induced immunodeficiency.
