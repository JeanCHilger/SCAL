PCR detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in serum as a diagnostic test for congenital cytomegalovirus infection. PCR detected cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in the serum of 18 of 18 infants with symptomatic congenital CMV infection, 1 of 2 infants with asymptomatic congenital CMV infection, and 0 of 32 controls.
