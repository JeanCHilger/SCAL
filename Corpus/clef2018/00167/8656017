Detection of group C rotavirus in infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine liver tissue from patients with cholestatic disease for the presence of group C rotavirus RNA. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genes 5 and 6 was used, and the PCR products were subjected to liquid hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe. A second amplification with nested primers was also used. Samples from 32 subjects (20 with biliary atresia or choledochal cyst and 12 controls) were tested. Ten of 20 biliary atresia patients were positive for group C rotavirus RNA no controls were positive (P < .003). Three of the positive patients were positive for both genes 5 and 6. Six of the 10 had > 1 sample that was positive. These data suggest a possible relationship between group C rotavirus and extrahepatic biliary atresia in the 10 patients in whom virus RNA was detected.
