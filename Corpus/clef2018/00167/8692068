Mother-to-baby transmission of hepatitis G virus. A mother tested positive for hepatitis G virus (HGV) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) before and at delivery. Her baby tested HGV negative by RT-PCR at birth but serum samples at four and six weeks of age were HGV positive, suggesting transmission of HGV from mother to baby.
