Detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA by polymerase chain reaction: a preliminary study in Bangkok. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR) was used to separately amplify part of gag, pol, and env genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to evaluate that primer specific to either gag (SK380/390&SK38/39), pol (JA17/18&JA19/20), or env (JA9/10&JA11/12) genes is suitable for HIV-1 PCR based diagnosis in Thailand. The positive PCR results in 70 HIV-1 infected adults are 100, 97, 89 per cent and in 75 HIV-1 infected infants are 100, 94, 74 per cent by gag, pol, env primer, respectively. The specificity of all three primer sets is 100 per cent. The unamplified samples by pol and env primers were identified as HIV-1 subtype E by PELISA method. False negative in HIV-1 PCR based diagnosis caused by high genetic variation of HIV-1 can be overcome by using several primer sets as shown in this study.
