Pertussis in primary care practice. Recent advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Pertussis continues to be an important vaccine-preventable disease. The recent multiple outbreaks of pertussis have heightened interest in its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Diagnosis remains challenging, although new diagnostic tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of sera and polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirates, offer the possibility of more rapid diagnosis. Erythromycin remains the preferred antimicrobial to reduce secondary transmission of pertussis. The recent approval of acellular pertussis vaccine for the primary series of immunizations ushers in an exciting new era of pertussis prevention.
