Early detection of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection using HIV RNA amplification and detection. New York City Perinatal HIV Transmission Collaborative Study. Early diagnosis of perinatally transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection can guide early interventions. HIV coculture and DNA polymerase chain reaction (DNA-PCR) detect few HIV-infected infants at birth and 90%-100% by age 3 months. Because extracellular HIV RNA may appear soon after infection, a plasma HIV RNA assay was compared with DNA-PCR for early detection of perinatally infected infants. Blood-draw specimens (108) obtained at the same time from 49 HIV-infected infants and 10 specimens from 8 uninfected infants were tested. HIV RNA and DNA-PCR positivity rates were 56% and 33%, respectively, in 36 specimens from 36 infants <28 days of age (binomial test, P = .001). Among 81 specimens obtained after age 14 days, 79 (98%) were positive by HIV RNA testing. No HIV-infected infant specimens were DNA-PCR-positive and HIV RNA-negative. All specimens from 8 uninfected infants were HIV RNA-negative. These results suggest that plasma HIV RNA was detectable earlier and more reliably than HIV DNA in perinatal infection.
