PCR-based detection and typing of human adenoviruses in clinical samples. Since human adenoviruses (Ad) are associated with a variety of diseases, there is need for a fast and sensitive diagnostic procedure. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been previously applied for the detection and typing of adenoviruses directly in clinical samples. So far, only Ad8, Ad31, Ad40 and Ad41 could be typed by PCR. To extend the technique of type-specific PCR to other adenovirus serotypes, type-specific primers for Ad1, Ad2, Ad4, Ad5, Ad19 and Ad37 were evaluated. In the present study, 50 stool and 68 eye swab specimens were first tested for the presence of adenoviruses using genus-specific primers. Adenoviruses could be detected in 42 stool and 47 eye swab samples. While the adenovirus-positive stool samples were subsequently typed with primers for Ad2, Ad5, Ad31, Ad40 and Ad41, the positive eye swab specimens were typed with primers for Ad4, Ad8, Ad19 and Ad37.
