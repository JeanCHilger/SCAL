Deleted HTLV-1 provirus in cord-blood samples of babies born to HTLV-1-carrier mothers. We screened 596 cord-blood samples by nested short PCRs for the gag and pX regions of HTLV-1 which are capable of detecting a single copy. The samples were derived from 449 and 147 babies born to seropositive and seronegative mothers respectively. Of these, 20 samples were positive in at least one of the PCRs: 9 (45%) were positive in both PCRs, but 10 and 1 samples in either the pX or the gag PCR respectively. These samples were tested further in nested long PCRs directed for gag-pX, gag-pol and pol-pX regions capable of detecting 8, 1 and 2 copies respectively. Of 9 dually positive samples, 7 (77%) showed the predicted 6.2-kbp band in the gag-pX PCR only 2 of them had the predicted band alone
