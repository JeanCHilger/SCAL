Congenital toxoplasma gondii infection diagnosed by PCR amplification of peripheral mononuclear blood cells from a child and mother. A case of congenital toxoplasmosis is presented, where diagnosis by PCR amplification of Toxoplasma gondii DNA from peripheral blood led to early treatment of the infant and seemingly normal brain development despite the presence of intracranial calcifications at birth. The mother, who experienced a subclinical infection during pregnancy, was PCR-positive for toxoplasma DNA in a sample of peripheral blood drawn after delivery.
