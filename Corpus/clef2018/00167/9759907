A case of congenital mumps infection complicated with persistent pulmonary hypertension. A low-birth-weight female baby was admitted with respiratory distress after birth. Her mother had been diagnosed with mumps 4 weeks and 5 days prior to delivery. Mumps IgM antibody was elevated in the neonate and mumps virus ribonucleic acid was detected in the umbilical cord blood by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The perinatal virus infection was complicated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and pulmonary hemorrhage. Successful treatment included the use of high frequency oscillation ventilation together with the administration of artificial surfactant.
