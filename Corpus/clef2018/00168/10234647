The successful containment of coxsackie B4 infection in a neonatal unit. This report describes the containment of a potential enterovirus epidemic in a neonatal intensive care unit. A case of neonatal enterovirus meningitis and myocarditis was identified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assist in appropriate cohorting of contacts. One further infant became cross-infected with Coxsackie B4. Serum PCR was accurate in detecting the infection in the early stages in this asymptomatic neonate. Neonatal enterovirus infection is relatively rare but has the potential to cause outbreaks in neonatal wards. PCR can be used to diagnose and monitor for cross infection.
