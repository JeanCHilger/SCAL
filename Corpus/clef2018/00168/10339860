Analysis of the drainage fluid after cephalic duodenopancreatectomy: a reliable clinical criterion. The authors have retrospectively analysed the drainage fluid of 39 patients undergoing Whipple's operation over a 18-year period. The aim of the study was to assess whether the volume and amylase concentration of the drainage fluid were good criteria of healing of the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis. The patients have been divided into two groups: Group I (30 patients) with no complications at the pancreatico-jejunostomy--Group II (9 patients) with a pancreatic leak. The analysis of the volume, amylase concentration and amylase index (Log of the amylase concentration x volume) showed that the groups had clearly different profiles: in group I all three criteria were rapidly decreasing, while they remained abnormally high in group II. Those criteria may help the clinician in the monitoring of individual patients they also may prove useful in prospective studies evaluating new means of prevention of this anastomosis.
