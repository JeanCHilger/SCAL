A colorimetric microtiter plate PCR system detects respiratory syncytial virus in nasal aspirates and discriminates subtypes A and B. We developed a colorimetric microtiter plate (MTP) PCR system for specific detection of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleocapsid gene and differentiation of viral subtypes A and B. Of 47 pediatric nasal aspirate specimens, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.4% (17 of 18) and 100% (15 of 15), respectively, when compared with RSV cell culture isolation in HEp-2 cells. An additional 14 specimens positive for adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, influenza, or parainfluenza viruses did not give positive reactions. PCR testing detected a mean of 0.15 (0.01 to 7.00) plaque-forming units of RSV virions. Inhibition of PCR amplification was detected in 33.3% (6/18) of undiluted specimens and could be avoided by a dilution (1:10) of extracted RNA without decreasing test sensitivity. RSV subtype, as determined by allele-specific probes, was identical to that determined by an immunofluorescence assay. These results indicate that the MTP PCR system provides a sensitive and specific test for clinical laboratory diagnosis and simultaneous subgroup classification of RSV infection.
