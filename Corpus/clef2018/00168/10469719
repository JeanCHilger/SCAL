Evidence for infection of the human embryo with adeno-associated virus in pregnancy. Previous reports have demonstrated the presence of DNA of the human helper virus-dependent adeno-associated parvovirus (AAV) in uterine tissue and curettage material from early miscarriage. To examine infection of embryonic tissue during pregnancy, amnion fluids were analysed for the presence of AAV. Using polymerase chain reaction, AAV DNA was detected in 64 out of 238 DNA samples extracted from amnion cells. DNA of helper viruses were found in 12% (papillomavirus) and 18% (cytomegalovirus) of the samples (double infections with AAV in eight and nine cases, respectively). Furthermore, infectious AAV virions were found in 13 out of 43 AAV DNA-containing samples. In mothers with AAV DNA-positive amnion fluids, premature amniorrhexis and premature labour occurred significantly more frequently (P < 0.001). Using an immunofluorescence assay, 24% of newborn sera (unrelated to the amnion fluid samples) were found to contain IgM antibodies to AAV, in most cases paralleled by IgM antibodies in the mother's sera. The data demonstrate that AAV infection can occur in utero at early and at late stages of pregnancy. The observed complications at delivery should encourage studies to clarify possible pathological consequences of AAV infection in pregnancy and a possible latent infection of the fetus.
