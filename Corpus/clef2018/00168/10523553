Evaluation of the prototype Roche DNA amplification kit incorporating the new SSK145 and SKCC1B primers in detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 DNA in Zimbabwe. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a newly developed DNA PCR kit (Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind.) that incorporates primers for all the group M viruses for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) infection in Zimbabwe. A total of 202 whole-blood samples from adults whose HIV status was known were studied. This included 100 HIV-1-positive and 102 HIV-1-negative samples selected on the basis of concordant results obtained with two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The prototype Roche DNA PCR assay had a 100% sensitivity for the detection of HIV-1 DNA and a specificity of 100%. We conclude that the new Roche DNA PCR kit is accurate for the detection of HIV DNA in Zimbabwean samples, in which HIV-1 subtype C dominates.
