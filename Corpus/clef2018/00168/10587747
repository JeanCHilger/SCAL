Enterovirus infections in children under three months of age. Enterovirus infections in childhood (echoviruses, coxsackie viruses A and B, unclassified enteroviruses) are varied, nonspecific and benign (except for poliovirus infections). However, in infants, they may lead to severe neurological or cardiac lesions. In neonates, enterovirus infections are difficult to distinguish from late-onset bacterial infection. Maternal-fetal or postnatal transmission can induce early spontaneous abortions or severe neonatal infections. Diagnosis is usually based on viral cultures and, in recent years, on PCR techniques. At the present time, no potential effective drug is available: intravenous immunoglobulins, immunization or anti-proteases may be of interest.
