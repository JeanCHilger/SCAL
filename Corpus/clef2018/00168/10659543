Somatic growth and clinical manifestation in formula fed infants born to HIV--infected mothers during the first year of life. This was a comparative study of the growth and clinical manifestation between infected and uninfected HIV infants both of whom were fed with a limited quantity of powder milk from birth until one year of age. HIV-infected pregnant women were enrolled from the second trimester or the beginning of the third trimester. After birth, infants had physical examinations, body weight and height were recorded at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 month visits. All mothers were given 7 kilograms of infant formula at each infant visit until the infant was one year old. Diagnosis for HIV infection in these infants was made by two positive concordant results of DNA PCR or RNA PCR or HIV RNA. One hundred and two infants were diagnosed for HIV status and 21.5 per cent were infected. The infected infants showed signs of malnutrition. From 2-4 months of age, the averages of their weights and heights were lower than those of non-infected infants. Abnormal clinical signs were found in most infected infants by the time they were 9-12 months old. In conclusion for the infants born to HIV- infected mothers, monitoring signs and symptoms including their weight and height from birth till 9-12 months old, is predictive of the infectious status of most infected infants. The administration and management of infant formula in a limited quantity to HIV infected mothers in upper northern provinces of Thailand is possible without causing abnormal infant growth.
