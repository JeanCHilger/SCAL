Elevated gene expression of interleukin-8 in cord blood is a sensitive marker for neonatal infection. Bacterial infection is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis is essential for a successful treatment and outcome. Cytokine plasma levels are suggested to be sensitive parameters for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The aim of this study was to assess cytokine mRNA expression in cord blood cells as a marker for neonatal infection. In a prospective study, cord blood samples of neonates with septic bacterial infection were analyzed qualitatively and semiquantitatively by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, as well as for IL-8 cord plasma levels. Results were compared to those of non-septic neonates. A method was used requiring only a microvolume (25 microl or less) of cord blood. Cord plasma levels of IL-8 were significantly elevated in septic infants (n = 9) when compared to infants with not confirmed sepsis (n = 22) and healthy infants that served as controls (n = 68) (median 1,686 vs 262.7 vs 33.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001). The presence of IL-6 and TNF-alpha gene expression was observed more frequently in septic than in non-septic patients sensitivity, however, reached only 56 and 67%, respectively. When using a semiquantitative approach for analyzing IL-8 mRNA levels, a high sensitivity (86%) and specificity (96%) for the detection of sepsis was achieved. A new method for the early diagnosis of neonatal infection is described measuring cytokine mRNA in neonatal cord blood cells. With this molecular approach only a microvolume of blood is required for analysis.
