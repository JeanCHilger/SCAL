Functional analysis of the minor subunits of S fimbrial adhesion (SfaI) in pathogenic Escherichia coli. S fimbrial adhesins I and II (SfaI and II), produced by extraintestinal Escherichia coli pathogens that cause urinary tract infections (UTI) and newborn meningitis (NBM), respectively, mediate bacterial adherence to sialic acid-containing glycoprotein receptors present on host epithelial cells and extracellular matrix. The S fimbrial adhesin complexes consist of four proteins: SfaI-A, the major subunit protein and the minor subunit proteins SfaI-G, SfaI-S and SfaI-H. Sialic acid-specific binding is mediated by the minor subunit protein SfaI-S. In order to determine whether the minor subunit proteins SfaI-G, -S and -H play a role in the modulation of adherence and the degree of fimbriation, a trans-complementation system was developed. A non-adhesive E. coli K-12 derivative, harbouring the sfaI-A gene but lacking sfaI-G, -S and -H, was transformed with sfaI-G, -S or -H. Only SfaI-S was able to increase the degree of fimbriation and to confer adhesion properties on the recombinant E. coli K-12 strains. Amino acid residues in SfaI-S that are involved in modulation of fimbriation as well as in receptor recognition were localized by random and site-directed mutagenesis.
