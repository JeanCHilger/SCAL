Evaluation of enterovirus serological tests IgM-EIA and complement fixation in patients with meningitis, confirmed by detection of enteroviral RNA by RT-PCR in cerebrospinal fluid. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of anti-enterovirus IgM antibodies was compared with complement fixation test in 43 patients with confirmed enterovirus meningitis by RT-PCR of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). In 34% of patients with enterovirus meningitis, IgM antibodies could be found, whereas complement fixation tests were positive in only 20%. The specificity was determined with sera of 105 patients with non-enterovirus meningitis. Specificity of IgM EIA and of complement fixation was 94% and 85%, respectively. In four patients with meningitis but without enterovirus detection in CSF, RT-PCR and virus isolation from stools were positive. In three of these patients, IgM antibodies were detected, giving a strong indication of an enterovirus-associated disease. Because of the high specificity of IgM EIA, diagnosis of enterovirus-associated diseases can be carried out in a single serum sample, whereas by complement fixation tests, only fourfold increases in antibody titres in paired sera indicate an acute infection. The application of IgM EIA is especially important in cases of meningitis when CSF samples are not available and for diagnosis of enterovirus diseases with other clinical symptoms such as fever, enteritis, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease.
