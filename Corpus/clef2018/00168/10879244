An evaluation of the usefulness of a culture system for the detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the endotracheal aspirates of neonates. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of a culture system used in our laboratory for the detection of Ureaplasma urealyticum in the endotracheal aspirates of neonates. Ureaplasmal broth was used to enhance the growth of U. urealyticum followed by observation of colonies on A7 agar. Of the 68 samples of endotracheal aspirates tested, 60 gave positive indication of urease activity by the broth. However, only 14 yielded U. urealyticum colonies on A7 agar medium. Polymerase chain reaction detected U. urealyticum in 21 samples. The use of Ureaplasmal broth was therefore not specific for the diagnosis of U. urealyticum. We suggest that subculture onto agar medium or PCR is essential for definite identification of U. urealyticum.
