Cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus 6, but not human papillomavirus, are present in neonatal giant cell hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia. The purpose of our study was to confirm reports of an association of human papillomavirus (HPV) with neonatal giant cell hepatitis (GCH) and biliary atresia (BA), and to expand these studies to include cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), and parvovirus B19 (PVB19). Frozen hepatic tissue was available for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in 19 cases of GCH or BA and 8 controls. Nested PCR to detect HPV types 6, 16, 18, and 33 was followed by 32P hybridization with generic probes. PCR followed by hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled probe was used for all other viruses. HPV, EBV, and PVB19 were not detected in cases or controls. Two cases of GCH and 1 case of BA were PCR positive for CMV controls were negative. HHV6 was detected in 6 cases: 2 GCH, 2 BA, and 2 controls. We conclude that HPV is not associated with GCH or BA. Detection of CMV in BA and GCH confirms other reports of this association. HHV6 requires further study to determine the significance of a positive PCR test in the livers of infants.
