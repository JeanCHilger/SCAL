Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: a retrospective diagnosis in a child with pachygyria. A 2-year, 6-month-old child with pachygyria demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months of age, psychomotor delay, and deafness who was diagnosed with congenital cytomegalovirus infection by the demonstration of cytomegalovirus DNA in blood from the stored neonatal filter paper is reported. The use of this technique provides an opportunity for the retrospective viral diagnosis in children with neurodevelopmental impairments and abnormalities, such as migration disturbances, in the brain.
