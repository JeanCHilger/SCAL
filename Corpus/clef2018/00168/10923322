Application of molecular amplification methods in the diagnosis and follow-up of HIV-1 infection in children infected by vertical transmission. To describe the vertical transmission of HIV-1 by means of molecular methods.A prospective study between 1995 and 1998 of two groups of patients, A: 107 newborn infants to HIV-1 infected mothers, and B: 11 infants with clinical suspicion of HIV infection, born to mothers who didn't know being infected. DNA and RNA PCR as well as reverse transcriptase gen mutations were tested.Eleven infected patients were identified, four from group A and seven from group B. Viral load at the moment of diagnosis was higher than 100,000 copies/ml in all patients. Genotypic mutations of the studied codons were not detected in ten patients.Molecular amplification techniques are useful for early diagnosis and follow-up of HIV infection acquired by vertical transmission.
