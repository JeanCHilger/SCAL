Detection of TT virus sequences in children with liver disease of unknown etiology. DNA sequences of TT virus (TTV) in 55 serum samples taken from 20 children with liver disease of unknown etiology (16 with acute liver disease, 2 with fulminant hepatitis, and 2 with chronic liver disease) and from 35 healthy children as controls were examined by using the hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR was carried out using the established primers (NG059, NG061, NG063) to amplify TTV DNA sequences. The sequences were detected in 6 of the 20 patients (30.0%) with liver disease and in 5 of the 35 healthy children (14.2%) by direct gel analysis. There was no significant difference between the prevalence of liver disease patients and controls. However, both patients with fulminant hepatitis and both patients with chronic hepatitis had TTV DNA sequences. Four of the six TTV isolates from liver disease patients were genotype 1a, whereas only one of the five TTV isolates from controls was genotype 1a. Although the study population was small, it is possible that genotype 1a of TTV might be more pathogenic than other genotypes in children.
