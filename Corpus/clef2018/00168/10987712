Epidemiology and host- and variety-dependent characteristics of infection due to Cryptococcus neoformans in Australia and New Zealand. Australasian Cryptococcal Study Group. A prospective population-based study was conducted in Australia and New Zealand during 1994-1997 to elucidate the epidemiology of cryptococcosis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans (CNVN) and C. neoformans var. gattii (CNVG) and to relate clinical manifestations to host immune status and cryptococcal variety. The mean annual incidence per 10(6) population was 6.6 in Australia and 2.2 in New Zealand. Of 312 episodes, CNVN caused 265 (85% 98% of the episodes in immunocompromised hosts) and CNVG caused 47 (15%
