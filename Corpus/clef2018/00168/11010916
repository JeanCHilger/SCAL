Rapid and simple determination of the Escherichia coli phylogenetic group. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that Escherichia coli is composed of four main phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, and D) and that virulent extra-intestinal strains mainly belong to groups B2 and D. Actually, phylogenetic groups can be determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis or ribotyping, both of which are complex, time-consuming techniques. We describe a simple and rapid phylogenetic grouping technique based on triplex PCR. The method, which uses a combination of two genes (chuA and yjaA) and an anonymous DNA fragment, was tested with 230 strains and showed excellent correlation with reference methods.
