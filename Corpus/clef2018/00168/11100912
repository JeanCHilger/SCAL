Perinatally cotransmitted human herpesvirus 6 is activated in children born with human immunodeficiency virus infection. To evaluate the mother-to-child transmission profile of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and to examine active replication of HHV-6 in the HIV-infected mothers and their newborns.This polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection was done using DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and milk cells from the mothers, PBMC from the newborns, and DNA derived from plasma and cell-free milk fluid from mothers and plasma of the newborns. None of the mothers received antiretroviral treatment.HIV was transmitted to 50% newborns and, of 36 total mothers, 8 had actively replicating HHV-6 detectable in their plasma and 2 also had it in the lactosera. Among the neonates. HHV-6 was found in the PBMC DNA of seven and in the plasma fractions of five, the latter five newborns were all HIV-infected at birth.Perinatally cotransmitted HHV-6 was always activated in the neonates who were born with HIV infection. Also, HHV-6 can be detected in the milk cells and the activated virus may be present in the lactosera of some of these HlV-infected mothers.
