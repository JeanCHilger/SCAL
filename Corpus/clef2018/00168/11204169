The lipophilic yeasts: state of the art and prospects. Malassezia yeasts (lipophilic yeasts), have been classified to include seven species. Although molecular methods such as sequencing of RNA and karyotyping were used to determine the species, traditional techniques are also being explored for their identification. These include studies of morphology and the utilization of individual lipids. Reports now show the predominance of individual species recovered from normal skin and from patients with diseases such as pityriasis versicolor and seborrhoeic dermatitis. The majority of systemic infections reported have been in the bloodstream of premature neonates. Clusters of cases have occurred and molecular techniques employed to study the epidemiology. With the development of discriminatory methods to determine individual species and strains present in disease and in nature, our understanding of the pathogenicity and the epidemiology of this genus can be advanced.
