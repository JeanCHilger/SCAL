Maternal plasma viral load, zidovudine and mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Africa: DITRAME ANRS 049a trial. To study the relationship between maternal plasma RNA levels and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 in African breastfed children.Nested case-control study within a randomized trial assessing the efficacy of a short maternal zidovudine (ZDV) regimen to reduce MTCT.Eligible women received either 300 mg of ZDV twice a day until labour, 600 mg at the beginning of labour and 300 mg twice a day for 7 days post-partum or a placebo. The diagnosis of paediatric HIV-1 infection was based on PCR tests at days 1--8, 45, 90 and 180 then on serology performed at 3 monthl intervals. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured at inclusion and on day 8 after delivery for all women who did transmit HIV to their children (cases) using a Chiron branched DNA assay (sensitivity 50 copies/ml) and compared with women who did not transmit (two per case) matched for phase trial, treatment allocation and site.At inclusion, mean log10 viral load was 4.6 among 55 transmitting mothers and 3.7 among 117 non transmitters (P = 0.0001). Among transmitters, the mean difference in log10 viral load between day 8 post-partum and inclusion was -0.13 in the ZDV group (n = 23) versus 0.27 in the placebo group (n = 32 P = 0.01)High maternal viral load at inclusion strongly predicts MTCT of HIV in Africa. A short ZDV treatment regimen decreases significantly maternal viral load from its pretreatment level.
