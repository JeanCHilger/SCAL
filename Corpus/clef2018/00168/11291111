Molecular detection and identification of an enterovirus during an outbreak of aseptic meningitis. Stool samples from sixteen cases of children with meningitis originating from four different and geographically isolated parts of Greece were investigated for enteroviruses. The conventional method of cell culture in four different cell lines was initially used for the isolation of enteroviruses. The results showed a cytopathic effect (CPE) in all cases after two, or even more successive passages in only one cell line (RD), although a less-than-satisfactory CPE was obtained in many cases. Seroneutralization with RIVM mixed hyperimmune antisera followed and the isolates were typed as Coxsackie B viruses. The method of RT-PCR with enterovirus-specific primers targeted to the highly conserved 5'-UTR of the genome was initially used for the detection of enteroviruses from the inoculated cell cultures. A positive RT-PCR result was obtained for all of the clinical samples rapidly and accurately and the isolates were further characterized with the aid of Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of the amplicons. The RFLP analysis showed first of all that the isolates had an identical restriction pattern with Coxsackie B5 Faulkner reference strain with 4 out of 5 restriction enzymes and secondly, both RFLP and SSCP analysis indicated the epidemiological association of the isolates. The speed of the molecular methodology that was used in comparison with the conventional methods and its possible significance for the description of virus evolution and circulation in the populations is discussed.
