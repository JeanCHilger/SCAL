Prenatal diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection. Prognostic value of markers of cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) in pregnant women for the neonatal status was assessed. Detection of such markers as antiCMV IgM and CMV DNA in cervical secretion by DNA dot-spot hybridization in women with a complicated course of pregnancy indicates a 5.7% risk of delivery of children with stable symptoms. Studies of antibodies to pre-early proteins (IE CMV) showed that antiCMV IgG to IE are more incident in pregnant women than antiCMV IgM moreover, antiCMV IgG to IE but not antiCMV IgM are detected in umbilical blood. The results of detection of antiCMV IgG and IgM to IE correlated with the clinical characteristics of newborns.
