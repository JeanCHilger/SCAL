Development and evaluation of detection systems for staphylococcal exfoliative toxin A responsible for scalded-skin syndrome. Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome is usually diagnosed clinically by its characteristic exfoliating rash. Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from the patient further supports the diagnosis. Several detection systems have been developed to determine whether the isolated strain produces exfoliative toxin, but none are routinely available in hospital laboratories. In a novel approach, we used computer models to predict the structure of the exfoliative toxins based on other serine proteases and to identify surface epitopes for the production of antibodies that specifically bound the exfoliative toxin A (ETA) serotype. Several rapid immunologically based diagnostic tests for ETA were developed with these antibodies and compared with existing systems. Our results showed that Western blot analysis using these antibodies was in complete correlation with PCR, which has been validated against the "gold standard" mouse model. On the other hand, the double-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Ouchterlony immunodiffusion assay gave unacceptably high false-positive results due to interference by staphylococcal protein A. This problem was successfully overcome by the development of a F(ab')(2) fragment ELISA, which was rapid and reproducible and was as sensitive and specific as PCR and Western blot analysis. The F(ab')(2) fragment ELISA is superior to existing diagnostic systems because it is quantitative, which may be related to the severity of the condition, and can detect amounts of exfoliative toxin in the picogram range directly from serum. This is the first detection system with the potential to confirm the diagnosis of staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome from a routine blood test within 3 h of presentation.
