Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection among pregnant women in northeastern Brazil. An evaluation of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection among 6754 pregnant women in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction assay found a rate of infection of 0.84% (57 of 6754 women). Epidemiologic and obstetric data on the HTLV-1-positive pregnant women were analyzed and compared with data on a control group of HTLV-1-negative pregnant women. The mean age of the HTLV-1-positive women was 26.2 years. All were seronegative for HIV and syphilis, and only 2 reported a past history of sexually transmitted infection and more than 10 sexual partners. Of the HTLV-1-positive women, 88.5% were breast-fed, 4% were bottle fed, and 7.5% did not know. Six women had received blood transfusions, and only 1 reported intravenous drug use. Fifty-two HTLV-1-positive women could be followed: 45 had full-term deliveries, 5 had premature deliveries, and 2 had abortions. Our results indicate that (1) the frequency of HTLV-1 infection among pregnant women is relatively high in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil (2) maternal infection was probably acquired more frequently through breast-feeding, but the sexual route was certainly the second most important means of transmission
