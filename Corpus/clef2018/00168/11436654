Detection of TORCH genom in the cardiac tissue of congenital heart disease. To explore relationships of TORCH (cytomegalovirus/CMV, toxoplasma/TOX, rubella virus/RV, herpes simplex virus-2 HSV2) infection with congenital heart disease (CHD).We conducted comparison to detection TORCH pathogenic gene in 42 cases of CHD and 38 controls by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).1. The positive rate of CMV, HSV2 and TOX in 66 cases of CHD were 26.2%, 4.7% and 16.7%, respectively, while those of 38 cases in control groups were 21.1%, 2.6% and 2.6%, respectively. The infection condition of TOX was significantly different (P = 0.0378), while those of CMV and HSV were not statistically different (P > 0.05) between CHD and control groups. 2. 7 of 30(23.3%) were positive for RV-RNA, compared with control group which were all negative, it was significantly higher (P = 0.0328).This is the first report of the presence of TORCH genes in CHD cardiac tissue by PCR. It might lay the foundation for studying the relationship of TORCH infection with CHD in molecular level.
