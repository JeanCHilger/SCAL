Rapid diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection in congenital neonates. Immunostaining was compared with PCR for diagnosis of congenital CMV infection. IgM and IgG antibody assays were also performed in parallel. Immunostaining gave sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 97% respectively. Correlations among immunostaining, PCR and the presence of IgM antibody was reported. Immunostaining can be used for early diagnosis of congenital CMV infection in parallel with detection of IgM antibody.
