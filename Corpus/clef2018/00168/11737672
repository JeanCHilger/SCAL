Bronchial Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, markers of allergic inflammation and lung function in children. A relationship between respiratory Chlamydia pneumoniae infection (RCPI) and bronchial asthma is under discussion. Our objective was to study the frequency of RCPI and whether it is associated with markers of asthma in children with recurrent or chronic bronchitis as well as pneumonia. One-hundred and forty-eight children who underwent bronchoscopy were enrolled 42 children with additional respiratory infections were excluded. Therefore, 106 children were examined, regarding a RCPI, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of tracheobronchial aspirate, eosinophilic inflammation of respiratory mucosa (cytology, eosinophilic cationic protein [ECP]), total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE for six important allergens, as well as lung function tests if possible. There was a RCPI in 55 of 106 children (51.9%)
