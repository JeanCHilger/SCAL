Transfusion transmitted virus infection in mother-to-infant transmission. To investigate the perinatal infection of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in the mother-to-infant transmission and molecular evidence.TTV was examined in serum from 104 mothers and umbilical blood of their infants by a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction technique. TTV nucleotide sequences isolated from two sets of mother/infant pairs were analyzed.The TTV detection rate was 13.46% (15/104), and it was 4.81% (5/104) in the umbilical blood of their newborns. Homology analysis was done by sequencing between positions 1,915 and 2,185 of the published TTV genome, Analysis of TTV sequences from the 2 pairs of mother and infant both infected confirmed a genetic link between the virus of the infected mother and their infected infants.There is a possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission of TTV.
