Sapporo-like viruses in sporadic gastroenteritis of unknown origin. Sapporo-like viruses (SLVs) are members of the family Caliciviridae. The etiologic role of these viruses is evident but little is known about the incidence of acute gastroenteritis caused by them. Sapporo-like viruses have not been detected in Hungary before.Between October and December 2000, 72 sporadic diarrhoeal stool samples from Baranya County, Hungary, from infants and young children (under 12 years) with acute gastroenteritis were collected. Common enteric bacterial pathogens, adeno- and rotaviruses were not found in these stool samples. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with specific primer pairs for human caliciviruses were used to detect Sapporo-like viruses.The amplicons of expected size were cloned and subsequently sequenced. Seven (9.7%) of 72 stool samples were found to be positive for Sapporo-like viruses. Comparative sequence analysis confirmed that all strains belonged to the London/92/UK cluster.This is the first molecular detection and molecular sequence analysis of Sapporo-like viruses in Hungary.
