Real-time PCR quantification of human cytomegalovirus DNA in amniotic fluid samples from mothers with primary infection. A real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA in amniotic fluid (AF) samples collected from 30 pregnant women with primary HCMV infection as detected either from HCMV-immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroconversion or by the presence of HCMV-specific IgG and IgM associated with a low IgG avidity. Clinical information available for each case included ultrasonographic examination and fetal or newborn outcome. HCMV infection of fetuses or newborns was confirmed for the 30 studied cases. AF samples were subdivided into three groups. In group A (n = 13), fetuses presented major ultrasound abnormalities, and pregnancy was terminated. In group B (n = 13), fetuses had normal ultrasound findings, the pregnancy went to term, and the newborns were asymptomatic at birth. In group C (n = 4), fetuses had no or minor ultrasonographic signs, and pregnancy was terminated. The HCMV DNA load values in AF samples were significantly higher in group A (median, 2.8 x 10(5) genome equivalents [GE]/ml) than in group B (median, 8 x 10(3) GE/ml) (P = 0.014). Our findings suggest that HCMV load level in AF samples correlates with fetal clinical outcome but might also be dependent on other factors, such as the gestational age at the time of AF sampling and the time elapsed since maternal infection.
