Plasmodium falciparum: PCR detection and genotyping of isolates from peripheral, placental, and cord blood of pregnant Malawian women and their infants. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is both a sensitive means of detecting malaria parasitaemia, and a simple tool for identifying genetic differences in parasites infecting human subjects. We compared PCR to microscopy in detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection in peripheral, placental and cord blood samples collected from 131 pregnant Malawian women and their infants in 1997-99. Infections detected by species-specific PCR were genotyped at the merozoite surface protein 1 and 2 loci, and minimum numbers of infecting genotypes determined. PCR was of similar sensitivity to microscopy in detecting peripheral and placental infection, and placental blood PCR was 100% specific compared to placental histology. Cord blood parasitaemia was more frequently detected by PCR than microscopy, 20% versus 6%. Genotype numbers in peripheral blood (mean 2.36 range 1-5), placental blood (mean 2.41
