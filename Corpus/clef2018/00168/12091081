Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections caused by herpesviruses. Herpesviruses may be associated with various types of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) has to be considered one of the most severe diseases. As effective antiviral drugs are available, rapid and reliable diagnosis has become important.To describe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serological methods for the detection of herpesvirus-induced CNS infections by the example of HSE.620 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 2400 serum samples from 2700 selected hospitalized patients with clinical suspicion of encephalitis were tested for herpes simplex virus (HSV) as well as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA and HSV-specific antibodies, respectively.HSV-1 DNA could be detected in eight and HSV-2 in three patients with focal encephalitis. In addition, HSV-2 DNA was found in two newborns with encephalitis and two adults suffered from transverse lumbar myelitis. One VZV DNA-positive patient had developed herpes zoster accompanied by meningoencephalitis, and in the other an encephalitis without cutaneous rash was diagnosed. Intrathecal antibody synthesis could be measured when CSF was cleared from viral DNA.The detection of viral DNA by PCR technique has become the "gold standard" method for laboratory diagnosis of herpesvirus infections of CNS. Serodiagnosis may be useful to confirm the diagnosis retrospectively.
