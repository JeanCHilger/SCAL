Mycoplasma genitalium is not associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy in Guinea-Bissau. To evaluate the impact of Mycoplasma genitalium on the outcome of pregnancy.Cervical samples from women who had previously participated in a case-control study (designed to assess the impact of syphilis and HIV-2 on the outcome of pregnancy in Guinea-Bissau) were processed using a PCR assay to detect the presence of M genitalium. Controls were women who had delivered a term neonate with a birth weight over 2500 g. Cases were classified into four groups of mothers according to the outcome of pregnancy: stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, premature deliveries, and small for gestational age (SGA) babies.Among the 1014 women included in this study, 6.2% were infected with M genitalium. M genitalium infection was not significantly associated with any of the adverse outcomes of pregnancy studied. Odds ratios (OR) for premature or SGA delivery in the presence of M genitalium infection were 1.37 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.60) and 0.44 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.75), respectively. For abortions and stillbirths, OR were respectively 0.61 (95% CI 0.07 to 2.51) and 1.07 (95% CI 0.42 to 2.42).M genitalium appears not to have a deleterious impact on the outcome of pregnancy.
