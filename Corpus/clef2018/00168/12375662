TT virus infection during childhood. TT virus (TTV) is widespread in the general population, however, the mode of its transmission and the mechanism of maintaining it in the general population are unclear.To determine the possible mother-to-infant route of transmission, 54 infants bom to 50 anti-HCV-positive mothers were assessed longitudinally. Nucleotide sequences amplified by seminested PCR with primers targeting the N22 variable coding region of genotypes 1 through 6 were compared in mothers and their infants.The prevalence of TTV DNA was 30 percent (15/50 95% CI, 18-45) in mothers and 44 percent (24/54These observations strongly suggest that the main factor for TTV acquisition in children involves their age-associated increase in environmental interactions with infectious materials. Genotype 1 might be involved in a weak or a limited pathologic role, which can possibly be diluted by other harmless genotypes.
