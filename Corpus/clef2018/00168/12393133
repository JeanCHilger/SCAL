Intracranial hemorrhage in herpes simplex encephalitis: an unusual presentation. We describe a 14-month-old patient with atypical presentation of herpes simplex encephalitis. She initially presented with fever, lethargy, seizures, and large hemorrhages in the right parietal lobe, and clinical findings suggestive of a hypercoagulable state. The etiology of coagulation abnormality was not identified, although it was suggested as a possible causative factor in severe bleeding along with acute neuronal lysis as a result of infection. Although large intracerebral hemorrhages are occasionally described with systemic herpes infection, this presentation is unusual beyond the infant period.
