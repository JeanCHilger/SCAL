Study on molecular epidemiology of HCMV infection in mothers and their newborns in Changsha. The detection of HCMV-IgG, IgM in plasma by ELISA and DNA in plasma and P(C) BMCs from mothers and their newborns by PCR was carried out. Positive HCMV-IgG, HCMV-IgM, P(C)BMCs HCMV DNA and plasma HCMV DNA were demonstrated in 119(95.2%), 7(5.6%), 27(21.6%) and 14(11.2%) in 125 mothers and 117(93.6%), 1(0.8%), 18(14.4%) and 7(5.6%) in their mewborns, respectively. There were significant differences among the positive rate of newborn's HCMV-IgM, plasma HCMV DNA and CBMCs HCMV DNA (P < 0.05), but the difference between HCMV-IgM and plasma HCMV DNA had no statistic significance (P > 0.05). This study suggests that HCMV-IgG and CBMCs HCMV PCR are preferable epidemiological index of HCMV infection of pregnant women and newborns respectively.
