Pseudooutbreak of Candida versatilitis fungemia in a microbiology laboratory. Candida versatilitis was isolated from 10 blood cultures that had been supplemented with olive oil to promote the growth of Malassezia spp., and from the stock olive oil bottle in the laboratory. This unusual non-pathogenic yeast isolate was readily identified by DNA sequencing methodology. This report also points out that care must be taken to ensure the sterility of supplements added to blood culture media.
