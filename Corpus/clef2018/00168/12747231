Biovar diversity of Ureaplasma urealyticum in amniotic fluid: distribution, intrauterine inflammatory response and pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of two biovars of Ureaplasma urealyticum (parvo and T960) in human amniotic fluid and to examine whether the magnitude of the intrauterine inflammatory response and pregnancy outcomes are different between patients with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity with "parvo biovar" and those with "T960 biovar".This cohort included 77 preterm singleton pregnancies (gestational age < 37 weeks) in whom U. urealyticum was detected from amniotic fluid using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Amniotic fluid was obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis. Amniotic fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as mycoplasmas. U. urealyticum was biotyped by PCR methods. Amniotic fluid inflammatory response was determined by amniotic fluid white blood cell count and interleukin-6 concentration.1) The "parvo biovar" was detected in 82% (63/77) and "T960 biovar" was in 18% (14/77) of cases 2) U. urealyticum was isolated by conventional culture method from amniotic fluid in 56% (35/63) of cases with positive for "parvo biovar" and in 50% (7/14) of cases with positive for "T960 biovar"1) The "parvo biovar" is more frequently isolated from amniotic fluid of preterm gestations than the "T960 biovar" 2) Biovar diversity of U. urealyticum in amniotic fluid was not associated with different pregnancy outcome and magnitude of the intraamniotic inflammatory response.
