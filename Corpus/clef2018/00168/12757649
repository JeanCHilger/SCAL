Study on prenatal diagnosis using fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction for congenital toxoplasmosis. To investigate prenatal diagnosis and treatment of toxoplasmosis in fetuses with fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) technique.Of the 70 pregnant women with toxoplasma (TOX) DNA positive, TOX DNA in amniotic fluid and/or fetal umbilical cord blood was detected with FQ-PCR technique to diagnose fetal infection. 48 ones were given routine treatment with spiramycin for 2 therapy periods. Ultrasound examination were undertaken in all of pregnant women to monitor fetal growth.Of the 70 cases with TOX DNA positive, TOX DNA was detected in 21 fetuses. TOX DNA positive rates were similar in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. The higher the TOX DNA, the higher fetal infectious rate. Fetal infectious rate was lower in treatment group (21%) than that in control group (50%), there was a statistically difference between two groups.Maternal TOX infection may cause fetal damage. Detection of TOX-DNA in amniotic fluid with FQ-PCR technique can diagnose fetal toxoplasmosis exactly. Treatment in pregnant period may decrease intrauterine infection rate.
