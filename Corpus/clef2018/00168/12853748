Timing of the maternal drug dose and risk of perinatal HIV transmission in the setting of intrapartum and neonatal single-dose nevirapine. Single-dose intrapartum and neonatal nevirapine (NVP) reduces perinatal HIV transmission and is in increasingly common use throughout the developing world.We studied risk factors for perinatal transmission in the setting of NVP.A prospective cohort study at two public obstetrical clinics in Lusaka, Zambia.In a volunteer sample of HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns, the women received a 200 mg oral dose of NVP at the onset of labor their infants received 2 mg/kg of NVP syrup within 24 h of birth. The main outcome measure was the infant HIV infection status at 6 weeks of life, determined by DNA polymerase chain reaction.Only 31 of 278 (11.2%) infants were infected at 6 weeks. In logistic regression, viral load exceeding the median [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.1 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-8.7] and 1 h or less elapsing between NVP ingestion and delivery (AOR, 5.0We confirmed low perinatal transmission rates with single-dose NVP. At least 1 h of pre-delivery NVP prophylaxis was a critical threshold for efficacy.
