Rhinovirus and acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children. Retrospective study 1998-2000. Rhinoviruses are the most common aetiological agents of colds, but the frequency and the severity of other locations of the infection are not well known. This study describes the clinical aspects and the severity of rhinovirus infections in hospitalised children.Isolation in culture and a RT-PCR were performed for the detection of rhinovirus in nasal aspirates from hospitalised children from September 1998 to October 2000. A group of 211 children found to be positive for rhinovirus was studied.Rhinovirus-infected children suffered from the following clinical syndromes: 60 (28.4%) upper airway infections, 81 (38.4%) bronchiolitis, 25 (11.9%) pneumonias and 12 (4.7%) acute attacks of asthma. Clinical symptoms were wheezing (32%), ronchi (37%) and 29% of children presented with acute distress respiratory syndrome 40% of the available chest X-Ray were abnormal. Eight children were hospitalised in the intensive care unit and two children died. Twenty-five children (10.9%) had a nosocomial infectionAfter eliminating cases of bacterial or viral dual infections, the clinical aspects of rhinovirus infections in children are the following: upper respiratory tract infections (25.6%), bronchiolitis ou bronchitis (25.6%), pneumonia (6.2%), acute attack of asthma (5.7%). The virological diagnosis according to culture is mainly improved by molecular techniques.
