An outbreak of candidemia due to Candida tropicalis in a neonatal intensive care unit. An outbreak of candidemia due to Candida tropicalis involving 16 neonates (gestational age 28-36 weeks) is reported. All infants had received hyperalimentation and at least one course of antibiotics. The commonest clinical manifestations included episodes of acute respiratory distress and lack of response to antibacterial antibiotic therapy. Candida tropicalis was recovered from blood in all the 16 infants and urine cultures were positive in 14 infants. Environmental sampling yielded C. tropicalis from one each of the blankets and mattresses used for neonates. Four of five urinary tract isolates and both environmental isolates genotyped by arbitrarily primed-PCR with several random primers were shown to belong to the same genotype.
