GeneScan reverse transcription-PCR assay for detection of six common respiratory viruses in young children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. A reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay based on automated fluorescent capillary electrophoresis and GeneScan software analysis was developed to detect six common respiratory viruses in clinical specimens from young children. Assays for human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, -2, and -3, respectively)
