Exclusive asymptomatic neonatal infections by human rotavirus strains having subgroup I specificity and "long" RNA electropherotype. A large number of stool specimens, of healthy newborn infants, collected from various hospitals and clinics in Bangalore City, India, have been examined for the presence of asymptomatic rotaviral excretion. Out of 370 samples analysed during a three year period from 1988 to 1991, 133 specimens (36%) were positive for rotavirus RNA. All these asymptomatic neonatal strains, without exception, showed "long" RNA pattern, but subgroup I specificity. Serotype analysis by ELISA or by hybridization with serotype-specific probes indicated that these strains probably represent a new serotype in newborn children. We find an exclusive association of human rotaviruses having "long" RNA pattern and subgroup I specificity with asymptomatic neonatal infections in contrast to the earlier observations of association of such unusual strains with acute gastroenteritis in young children.
