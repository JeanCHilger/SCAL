New methods for diagnosing infection in pregnancy. Maternal infections during pregnancy are of special relevance because of the risk of transmission to the fetus. Besides serological methods of diagnosing acute maternal infection, new approaches to assess fetal involvement have been made by invasive procedures, such as ultrasound-guided fetal blood sampling or amniocentesis. The most relevant infections in pregnancy are briefly reviewed with their incidence, consequences of fetal infection, and standard diagnostic procedures. Immunological methods are handicapped by the immaturity of the fetal immune system direct culture is complicated and time-consuming. The application of molecular biological methods to directly identify the RNA- or DNA-sequences of the infectious agent may be an alternative. Two methods, polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and in-situ hybridization (ISH) are explained. Broad clinical use is still hindered by problems in specificity and quantitative accuracy. Nevertheless, successful diagnosis of most of the relevant infections in pregnancy by these molecular biological methods, is published, and discussed in a review of the recent literature.
