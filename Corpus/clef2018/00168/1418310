Octreotide administration in the treatment of pancreatic fistulae after pancreas transplantation. Among the surgical complications of pancreas transplantation are pancreatic fistulae, which arise rather frequently. Suppression of exocrine secretion with polymers has succeeded in reducing the rate of this complication. Nevertheless, in some instances, pancreatic fistulas may occur. Thirty pancreas transplantations were performed in 27 diabetic patients. In 5 cases a pancreatic fistula occurred and was drained after the insertion of a catheter for the collection of secretions. A serous liquid was collected with a high concentration of amylases (61604 +/- 19562 IU/24 h). Fistula output was 280 +/- 87 ml/24 h. Patients were treated with octreotide, administered subcutaneously in a dose of 300-750 micrograms/day. In all patients a progressive reduction in fistula output was observed after a mean of 16 + 2 days. Fistula flow rate dropped to 24 +/- 10 ml/24 h--a reduction of 95% +/- 5% and drainage was subsequently stopped. Sonographic follow-up did not show recurrence of peripancreatic collections in these patients. All patients were insulin-independent up to 12-44 months after surgery.
