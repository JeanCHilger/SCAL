Ureaplasma in lung. 1. Localization by in situ hybridization in a mouse model. Ureaplasma urealyticum is a common inhabitant of mucosal surfaces but is also associated with a higher incidence of pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Culture and polymerase chain reaction demonstrate high isolation rates of ureaplasma in clinical specimens documenting their presence but do not associate the organism directly with the diseased tissue. In this study, lung tissue samples from newborn mice inoculated intranasally with U. urealyticum were used to develop an in situ hybridization (ISH) test for the organism. In situ hybridization allows the localization of gene expression for visualization within the context of tissue morphology. New techniques which use biotinyl-tyramide based signal amplification have been able to greatly enhance the sensitivity of ISH. Using the Dako GenPoint Catalyzed Signal Amplification system to detect a biotinylated DNA probe specific for an internal nucleotide sequence within the urease gene of U. urealyticum, the organism was detected within the infected murine lung tissues. Electron microscopy was used to verify the presence of the organisms in the positive ISH areas. The ISH procedure developed in this study can be used to analyze the presence of ureaplasma in human neonatal lung tissue with the corresponding histopathology.
