Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli serotype O126:H27, Israel. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is a newly diarrheagenic agent wherein several predominant serotypes are reported. We studied the association between those serotypes, as clonal indicators, and the trait of enteroaggregative adherence to host cells, tested by polymerase chain reaction. We also evaluated the clinical manifestations of infection in 17 hospitalized children by our most common EAEC serotype, O126:H27.
