Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms of surfactant protein B (SP-B) encoding gene? Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is usually a benign self-limiting respiratory disorder in the immediate neonatal period. The lipophilic surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B) was demonstrated to be the most relevant structural component of the surfactant system for immediate postnatal pulmonary adaptation. We hypothesized genetic variations of surfactant protein B (heterozygous 121 ins 2 mutation er intron 4 polymorphisms) to be related to TTN.We screened genomic DNA of 83 healthy term neonates (gestational age: 39 (37 - 41) completed weeks [median and range] birth weight: 3325 +/- 541 grams [mean +/- SD]) and 75 infants presenting with TTN (gestational age: 38 (37 - 41) completed wecks [median and range]In TTN-group the frequency of male infants (68.4 % versus 44.6 %, p < 0.05) and caeserian section were significantly higher (68.4 % versus 30.1 %, p < 0.05). We did not find any statistical difference in frequency of intron 4 variations between controls and TTN-group (8.4 % versus 10.7 %). None of the infants were heterozygous for the 121ins2 SP-B mutation.WC conclude polymorphisms of intron 4 and heterozygous 121 ins 2 mutation not to associated with TTN.
