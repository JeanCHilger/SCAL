Conversion of exocrine secretions from bladder to enteric drainage in recipients of whole pancreaticoduodenal transplants. Between September 1984 and August 1991, 265 whole pancreaticoduodenal transplants were done at our institution, with bladder drainage of exocrine secretions through a duodenocystostomy. Seventeen patients subsequently underwent conversion from bladder to enteric drainage at 2 to 64 months after transplant. Eight conversion procedures were done to correct chronic intractable metabolic acidosis due to bicarbonate loss from the allograft: seven to alleviate severe dysuria, presumed secondary to the action of graft enzymes on uroepithelium one to prevent recurrent allograft pancreatitis, presumed secondary to back pressure from the bladder
