Virologic diagnosis of HIV infection in children. The rate of mother-to-infant transmission of the HIV approximates 20%. Early treatment and monitoring of infected infants are feasible only if diagnosis is established promptly. Diagnosis at birth relies on techniques that demonstrate presence of the virus (viral cultures, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) antigenemia). However, beyond six months of age, detection of evidence of an immune response to the virus can also be used (anti-HIV IgA, in vitro production of antibodies: ELISPOT or in vitro antibody production (IVAP). In practice, it should be borne in mind that the sensitivity of each technique varies with age.
