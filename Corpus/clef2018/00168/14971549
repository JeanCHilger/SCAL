Spinal muscular atrophy in the neonate. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type I is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by loss of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. This severe hereditary neurodegenerative disorder is an important cause of morbidity in the neonate and the leading hereditary cause of infant mortality. The characteristic degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord leads to progressive muscular weakness and atrophy of the skeletal muscles. In SMA type I, the most severe form of SMA, death usually ensues by 2 years of age from respiratory failure or infection. Accurate diagnosis is now available through genetic testing, and progress is being made toward the development of therapy based on understanding of the disease mechanism. The neonatal nurse plays a pivotal role in identifying and caring for these medically fragile infants and in providing support and education for parents and families.
