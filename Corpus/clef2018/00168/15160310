Survey of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from neonates and the environment in the NICU. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a risk factor of nosocomial infection with compromised hosts including neonates. Currently, the prevalence of MRSA carriers among children is increasing in Japan. There are some reports of nosocomial infection caused by MRSA in a pediatric ward or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). During 6 months (from January 2001 to June 2001), 37 MRSA strains were isolated from 37 neonates who were admitted in the NICU and 52 MRSA were strains isolated from NICU environments. We performed DNA typing of MRSA using an arbitrary primed-PCR method on these isolates. Thirty-seven clinical isolates were classified into four types (A type, 14 B type, 4
