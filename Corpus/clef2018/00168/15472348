Comparison of an immunochromatography test with multiplex reverse transcription-PCR for rapid diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infections. A new commercial rapid 10-min one-step immunochromatography (IC) test, SAS RSV test, was compared to another IC test, Directigen EZ RSV, employing RT-PCR as the "gold standard" for detecting respiratory syncytial virus. Of 102 clinical samples, 79 were positive by RT-PCR, 66 (82.5%) were positive with the SAS RSV test, and 55 (69.6%) were positive with Directigen EZ RSV. The specificity of the new test was 91.3% (21 of 23), similar to that of Directigen EZ RSV (100% [23 of 23]). This test performs well enough to be used for patient care.
