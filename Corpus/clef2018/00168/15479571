Epidemiology and clinical presentation of respiratory syncytial virus infection in a Tunisian neonatal unit from 2000 to 2002. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important viral pathogen causing lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) in infants. This study describes the clinical and genetic epidemiology of RSV infection among Tunisian neonates. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 268 newborns with LRI were screened for RSV by immunofluorescence assay. Positive samples were analysed by RT-PCR-hybridisation assay for subgroup classification of RSV genomes. RSV infection was present in 23.1% of neonates, with a predominance in males. Peak incidence occurred in winter. Subgroup classification showed a higher prevalence of group B than group A strains. Nosocomially acquired RSV infection was present in 37% of neonates, 54.3% had an underlying condition predisposing to severe disease and 13% died. The average duration of hospital stay was 10 days and 87% of newborns required supplemental oxygen. As no currently effective treatment is available, preventive measures are a priority in high-risk infants.
