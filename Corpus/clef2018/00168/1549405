Reliability of polymerase chain reaction in the detection of human immunodeficiency virus infection in children. During a 3-year period we followed 128 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive children ages 6 days to 11 years clinically and with an HIV diagnostic panel consisting of antibody (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by indirect fluorescence assay or Western blot), p24 antigen detection, HIV isolation from peripheral blood culture and molecular detection of HIV nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR procedure included 30 cycles of amplification using two separate gag primer pairs (SK38/39 and SK101/145), followed by detection with probes to areas amplified (SK19 and SK102). Results of PCR were available within 48 hours and were sensitive (97%) and specific (100%). PCR should be obtained on all children exposed perinatally, and aggressive management should be undertaken for those found to be positive.
