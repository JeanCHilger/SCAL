Assessment of the diagnostic value of RT-PCR on amniotic fluid for prenatal diagnosis of congenital rubella infection. To assess the diagnostic value of RT-PCR on amniotic fluid (AF) for prenatal diagnosis of congenital rubella infection.RT-PCR on AF was compared to specific IgM antibody detection in foetuses and/or newborns in 45 pregnant women with confirmed primary infection.specificity of RT-PCR was 100% and sensitivity ranged between 83 and 95%.RT PCR may be considered as a valuable tool for prenatal diagnosis of foetal rubella infection.
