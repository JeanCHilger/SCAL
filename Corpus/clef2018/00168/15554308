Epidemiological aspects of cytomegalovirus infection in babies aged under one. Sreening data obtained on babies aged under one and selected by random (1,910 children) or target (2,658 children) choice for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection during the period of 10 years (1992-2001) were compared with mortality rate. The methods used were enzyme immunoassay, immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. The babies were divided as follows: newborn infants (group I), babies aged 1-3 months (group II), 4-6 months (group III) and 7-12 months (group IV). Specific clinical features of CMV infection in newborn infants were studied on 69 cases (37--with CMV monoinfection and 32--with mixed infection). The serological screening revealed a 2.1-fold growth of the infection rate among randomly selected newborn infants during the 10 year period. Positive correlation between the infection rate among children of this age group and the neonatal mortality rate was established. High risk factors of CMV infection were revealed as well as increased infection rate and frequency of clinical cases with the prevailing neurological pathology in group III. Early diagnosis, the exclusion of mixed infections and early adequate therapy were shown to play a decisive role in the outcome of the disease. The algorithm of epidemiological surveillance and the regional program of prophylaxis were worked out.
