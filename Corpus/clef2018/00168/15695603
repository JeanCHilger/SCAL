Relationship between antenatal inflammation and antenatal infection identified by detection of microbial genes by polymerase chain reaction. Although antenatal infection is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor and neonatal diseases, the exact mechanisms are largely unknown. We sought to clarify the relationship between antenatal infection and intrauterine and neonatal inflammation. Samples were obtained from 41 preterm infants of <33 wk gestation delivered to 36 mothers and analyzed for the presence of 16s ribosomal RNA (16s rRNA) genes using PCR and for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. In 16 (44%) mother-baby pairings, at least one sample was found to be positive for the presence of 16s rRNA genes. All but one of the positive samples were from mothers presenting with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM) or in spontaneous idiopathic preterm labor. A strong association was found between the presence of 16s rRNA genes and chorioamnionitis and with funisitis. A marked increase in IL-6 and IL-8 was noted in all tissues positive for 16s rRNA genes, including placenta, fetal membranes, cord blood serum, and, where samples were available, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and in amniotic fluid. Interestingly, gastric fluid was always positive for 16s rRNA genes if any other intrauterine or BAL sample was positive, suggesting that this sample may provide an alternative to amniotic fluid to identify antenatal infection. In conclusion, we have found that microbial genes are particularly prevalent in pPROM and spontaneous preterm labor groups and that their presence is strongly associated with a marked intrauterine inflammatory response.
