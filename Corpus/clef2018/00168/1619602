TORCH infections. Diagnosis in the molecular age. TORCH agents cause a varied spectrum of disease. Advances in ultrasound, invasive perinatal procedures and molecular diagnostics have allowed in utero evaluation. Infected fetuses, especially those which are sonographically abnormal, may be treated in utero depending upon the pathogen and attendant pathophysiology. Subclinical perinatal infections may lead to later childhood deficits. Such infected fetuses may benefit from early diagnosis and prompt initiation of rehabilitative measures.
