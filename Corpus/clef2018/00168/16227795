Is there a difference in the efficacy of peripartum antiretroviral regimens in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Africa? Peripartum antiretroviral regimens have been shown to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) in randomized clinical trials however, direct comparison of published results is impossible given methodological and population differences.To directly compare the efficacy of different antiretroviral regimens in reducing the risk of 6-week MTCT rate in African breastfeeding populations.Pooled analysis including all mother-infant pairs from any relevant trial: West African ZDV-placebo trials, Petra ZDV+3TC [two regimens A (pre/intra/post-partum) and B (intra/post-partum), placebo from Uganda and Tanzania], SAINT (NVP and Petra arm B), HIVNET012 (NVP, ultra short ZDV pp) and the Vitamin A trial (as placebo arm in South Africa). Peripartum HIV infection was any positive RNA or DNA polymerase chain reaction test < day 60. The MTCT risk was estimated at 6 weeks for each treatment arm and compared with placebo or single-dose NVP using logistic regression adjusting for maternal CD4 cell count, breastfeeding and birthweight.Overall, 4125 singleton live-births were included 3629 (88%) were assessed for HIV status at 6 weeks of age. In comparison with placebo, zidovudine + lamivudine (ZDV+3TC) arm A [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.23These results are in line with current World Health Organisation guidelines suggesting equivalence of choice between single-dose NVP and short-course ZDV, and confirm the greater efficacy of ZDV+3TC than with any single antiretroviral drug.
