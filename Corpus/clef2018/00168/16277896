Study on hepatitis B virus intrauterine infection state and its correlation factors. To investigate the correlation factors of hepatitis B virus (HBV) intrauterine infection and the influence factors of HBV infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and placentas.HBeAg and HBsAg in 151 pregnant women and their newborns were determined by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). HBV DNA in serum and PBMC of pregnant women and their newborns were determined by polymerase chain reaction. HBsAg in 151 placentas were detected by immunohistochemistry ABC. The correlation risk factors were analyzed by non-condition logistic regression model.HBV DNA positive in serum, HBV DNA positive in PBMC of pregnant women and HBsAg positive in placentas were the risk factors for HBV intrauterine infection. Their odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval were 2.25 (1.08-4.72), 2.69 (1.26-5.73) and 4.63 (1.70-12.62), respectively. The influence factors of HBV infection in placenta included antepartum injection of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) over thrice and HBV DNA positive in serum of pregnant women with OR 0.08 (0.01-0.69) and 4.24 (1.22-14.69). The risk factor for HBV DNA positive in PBMC of newborns was HBV DNA positive in PBMC of their mothers with OR 24.53 (7.92-76.01).HBV infection in placentas, HBV DNA positive in PBMC and serum of pregnant women are the risk factors for HBV intrauterine infection. Antepartum injection of HBIG over thrice can protect placentas from being infected by HBV to some extent. PBMC HBV DNA positive in pregnant women is probably the independent risk factor for PBMC HBV intrauterine infection in newborns.
