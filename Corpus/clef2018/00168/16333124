Molecular identification of adenoviruses in clinical samples by analyzing a partial hexon genomic region. Here we present a system for adenovirus detection and genotyping based on PCR amplification and phylogenetic analysis of a conserved hexon gene fragment. The system was validated using 157 sequences (86 previously typed and 71 clinical samples) and correctly identified species and serotype in 100% and 84% of sequences, respectively. Known associations between specific serotypes and clinical syndromes are verified. Possible new associations are described to allow further independent testing.
