Effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiation on operative mortality and morbidity for pancreaticoduodenectomy. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neo-CRT) is being used with increasing frequency for periampullary tumors, but how it alters the complication rate of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is unclear.A retrospective analysis was conducted of 79 patients with periampullary malignancies who received 5-fluorouracil-based neo-CRT followed by PD.There was no difference in mortality between PD after neo-CRT (3.8%) and conventional PD for either malignant (4.5%) or benign (2.2%) disease. Focusing only on patients with malignancy, the neo-CRT group had a significantly lower pancreatic leak rate than the conventional group (10% vs. 43% P < .001). Intra-abdominal abscesses were less common in the neo-CRT group (8.8% vs. 21%Neo-CRT does not increase the mortality or morbidity of PD. In contrast, neo-CRT was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of pancreatic leak, as well as leak-associated morbidity and mortality.
