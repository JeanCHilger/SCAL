Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis, follow-up, and outcome of congenital varicella syndrome. To report on a case of fetal varicella infection following the diagnosis of maternal infection at 16 weeks of gestation.Diagnosis was based on serology testing and prenatal ultrasound, confirmed by DNA detection in amniotic fluid (Lightcycler-PCR). Serial ultrasound examinations were performed.Sonographic anomalies included borderline ventriculomegaly, intracerebral, intrahepatic and myocardial calcifications, limb deformities, articular effusions, and intrauterine growth retardation (confirmed postpartally). The newborn showed a severe encephalopathy and could not be stabilized sufficiently. The child died 23 days after birth.The outcome of an affected fetus may be very serious and prenatal ultrasound is a helpful tool to recognize the severity of the infection.
