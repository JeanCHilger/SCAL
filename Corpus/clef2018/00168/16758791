Early detection of HIV-1 in infants by PCR. Infants of HIV-infected mothers are at great risk of becoming infected with HIV during childbirth. Many infants acquire HIV during labor and delivery. Others can acquire HIV through the mixing of fetal and maternal blood as the placenta separates. The duration of membrane rupture, acute chorioamnionitis and invasive delivery techniques that increase the baby's contact with the mother's blood have been associated with higher risks of MTCT during labor and delivery. HIV is present in breast milk and risk of its transmission during breastfeeding depends on several factors, including: infant age, pattern of breastfeeding, breastfeeding duration, breast health, maternal viral load and maternal immune status. Infants born to HIV infected mothers carry their mother's antibodies in their blood into the second year of life, even if the infants themselves are not infected. For this reason, standard HIV antibody tests cannot reliably confirm HIV infection in infants until after the maternal antibodies have disappeared. Tests that can diagnose pediatric HIV infection accurately during the first year of life include HIV-PCR, CD4/CD8 counts, P24 antigen tests, and viral cultures. PCR offers an effective tool to reliably diagnose HIV in a pediatric age group. Nineteen infants born by normal delivery to HIV-1 seropositive mothers were studied by PCR for the HIV1 env gene. Thirteen babies (68.5%) were negative whereas 6 babies were found to be positive (31.5%). Although PCR is one of the most useful tests for this clinical situation, it is not definitive. Therefore, PCR should be interpreted with caution and repeated at regular defined intervals, preferably lasting until the HIV antibody status of the infant is resolved.
