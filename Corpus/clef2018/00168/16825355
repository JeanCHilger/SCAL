Molecular characterization of nontypeable group B streptococcus. Traditionally, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) antigen has been used to distinguish between the nine known serotypes of group B streptococcus (GBS) by classical antibody-antigen reactions. In this study, we used PCR for all CPSs and selected protein antigens, multilocus sequencing typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to molecularly characterize 92 clinical isolates identified as nontypeable (NT) by CPS-specific antibody-antigen reactivity. The PCR and MLST were performed on blinded, randomly numbered isolates. All isolates contained the cfb gene coding for CAMP factor. While most (56.5%) contained a single CPS-specific gene, 40 isolates contained either two or three CPS-specific genes. Type V CPS-specific gene was present in 66% of the isolates, and all serotypes except types IV, VII, and VIII were represented. Most (44.5%) of the isolates contained a single protein antigen gene (bca, bac, rib, alp1, or alp3), and the remaining isolates had multiple protein antigen genes. Of the 61 isolates that had the V CPS-specific gene, 48 (78.6%) had the alp3 gene. PFGE analysis classified the isolates into 21 profile groups, while MLST analysis divided the isolates into 16 sequence types. Forty-two (69%) of 61 isolates with the V CPS-specific gene were in PFGE profile group 4 41 of these 42 were sequence type 1 by MLST. These data shed new light on the antigenic complexity of NT GBS isolates, information that can be valuable in the formulation of an effective GBS vaccine.
