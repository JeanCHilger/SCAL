Prenatal diagnostics of Toxoplasma gondii invasion by quantitative method of PCR-TaqMann. Routine serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis provides high sensitivity, but not high specificity. The high sensivity combined with high specifity offered by PCR-TaqMann as well as the degree of infection led us to investigate the presence and levels of T. gondii DNA in amniotic fluid, maternal and neonatal blood in cases of pregnancy where infection with this agent was suspected. Samples of amniotic fluid and blood were taken from pregnant women. Postnatal blood samples were also taken from their infants. Presence and levels of toxoplasma DNA was investigated using PCR-TaqMann. PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. The PCR-TaqMann test is highly sensitive, specific and useful method allowing detection of the parasite genome and assessement of its level.
