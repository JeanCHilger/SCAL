Umbilical cord blood transplantation and cytomegalovirus: Posttransplantation infection and donor screening. This study assessed the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after transplantation of cord blood (CB) from unrelated donors and evaluated strategies for screening CB donors. Posttransplantation CMV infection, reported in 23% of 1221 CB recipients, was associated with patient pretransplantation CMV serology (P < .001), but not with CMV serology in CB donors or their mothers. A total of 26 988 infant CB donors were evaluated by viral culture of saliva. Subgroups were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction in CB (CB-PCR) in 2 case-control studies. In the first study, 33 of 47 saliva culture-positive CB donors were confirmed by CB-PCR. All mothers of the 33 infants with confirmed CMV infection were CMV-total antibody positive, but only 1 of 3 had CMV-IgM antibody. The second study evaluated infants born to mothers with CMV-IgM antibody. Of these, 5 of 170 saliva culture-negative infants were positive by CB-PCR. The incidence of congenital CMV infection in CB donors was low (0.12%). Maternal serology had poor predictive value for CMV infection in their infant CB donors and bore no detected relationship to CMV infection in CB recipients. Saliva culture for CMV had both false-positive and -negative results. CB-PCR was a useful alternative for detecting CMV in CB donors.
