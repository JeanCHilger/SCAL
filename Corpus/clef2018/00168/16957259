Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii in dried infant milk formula by cationic-magnetic-bead capture. Enterobacter sakazakii has been associated with life-threatening infections in premature low-birth-weight infants. Contaminated infant milk formula (IMF) has been implicated in cases of E. sakazakii meningitis. Quick and sensitive methods to detect low-level contamination sporadically present in IMF preparations would positively contribute towards risk reduction across the infant formula food chain. Here we report on the development of a simple method, combining charged separation and growth on selective agar, to detect E. sakazakii in IMF. This protocol can reliably detect 1 to 5 CFU of E. sakazakii in 500 g of IMF in less than 24 h.
