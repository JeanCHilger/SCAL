Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic injuries. An analysis of management principles. Ninety-one pancreatic injuries, 47 from blunt trauma, were reviewed with respect to management principles stressed in qi previous reviews. The pancreatic complication rate was 25%. Blunt injury was suspected preoperatively in only 30%. Even short-term observation led to morbidity. Operations done more than 6 hours after admission had a higher complication rate (45%) than those done less than 6 hours after admission (18%). Penrose drainage without a sump was not associated with increased complications. Distal pancreatectomy was done 32 times splenectomy was done in only 18 patients. Individual duct ligation was rarely done and did not result in a high fistula rate. Pancreatic stump oversew with nonabsorbable suture was associated with a higher rate of pancreatic complications than absorbable suture (58% vs 30%). Only 56% of patients receiving distal pancreatectomy required hyperalimentation. Postoperative serum amylase values were not useful, and amylase values from drainage fluid predicted complications only when they were above 100,000 U/L. Details of pancreatic trauma management are less important than early operation in minimizing morbidity.
