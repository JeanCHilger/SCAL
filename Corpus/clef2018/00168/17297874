Etiology of pulmonary diseases in children in Khabarovsk Region. Microflora of upper respiratory tract in 658 children aged 1 month - 17 years hospitalized with acute pneumonia (AP), acute bronchitis (AB), recurrent obstructive bronchitis (ROB), malformation of lungs (ML) and broncho-alveolar dysplasia (BALD) were studied. Carriage rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (up to 95%) and Haemophilus influenzae (up to 89%) in 240 children attending daycare centers and schools were determined. Etiology of infectious process was ascertained in 40% of cases. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 45% of acute cases (AP and AB) and in 25% of chronic cases (BALD). H. influenzae was isolated in 8 - 12% of acute cases and in 32% of chronic cases. In 23 - 29% of all cases of pulmonary pathology in children persistence of Enterococcus faecium was determined. There were 13 different serotypes among isolated pneumococci. In patients with pneumonia the rate of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae DNA fragments by PCR was significantly higher compared with rate of their isolation from sputum.
