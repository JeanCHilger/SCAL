Risk factors of pancreatic fistula and delayed gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreaticogastrostomy. Pancreatic fistula (PF) and delayed gastric emptying (DGE) are, respectively, the most frightening and most frequent complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). This study was undertaken to determine which independent factors influence the development of PF and DGE after PD.Between January 1996 and December 2005, 131 consecutive patients underwent a PD with pancreaticogastrostomy. A total of 22 items, entered prospectively, were examined with univariate and multivariate analysis. PF was defined as amylase-rich fluid collected by needle aspiration from an intraabdominal collection or from the drainage placed intraoperatively from day 3. DGE was defined as the need for nasogastric decompression beyond the 10(th) postoperative day.PF occurred in 14 patients (10.7%), with a mean length of hospital stay of 40.1+/-16.6 days. DGE occurred in 41 patients (31.3%), with a mean length of hospital stay of 35.5+/-13.6 days. PF and DGE increased postoperative length of stay. Multivariate analysis identified two independent factors for PF: heart disease as a risk factor and arterial hypertension as a protective factor. According to these two predictive factors, the observed rates of PF ranged from 4.1% to 66.6%. Age and early enteral feeding with nasojejunal tube were independent risk factors for DGE. DGE was statistically more frequent when surgical complications occurred or when an intraabdominal collection was present.Heart disease was a risk factor and arterial hypertension was a protective factor of PF. Age and early enteral feeding were independent risk factors for DGE. DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative intraabdominal complications.
