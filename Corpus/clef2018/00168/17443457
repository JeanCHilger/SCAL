Viral load in blood is correlated with disease severity of neonatal coxsackievirus B3 infection: early diagnosis and predicting disease severity is possible in severe neonatal enterovirus infection. We conducted a study during an outbreak of coxsackievirus B3 infection in 2005 and found that viral RNA could be detected in patients' blood specimens soon after the onset of fever, and the level of viral RNA was positively correlated with disease severity. Timely diagnosis is possible in severe neonatal enterovirus infection.
