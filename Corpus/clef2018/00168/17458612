The Dagradi-Serio-Iacono operation central pancreatectomy. Central pancreatectomy (CP) is a segmental pancreatic resection indicated to remove benign or low-grade malignant tumors of the isthmus and proximal part of the body of the pancreas. The main advantage of this operation compared with major resections is that it permits to spare normal pancreatic parenchyma moreover, spleen and upper digestive and biliary tracts are saved. The description of the complete operation was reported for the first time by Dagradi and Serio in 1984 and subsequently spread worldwide by Iacono and Serio. In our opinion, it should be called the Dagradi-Serio-Iacono operation, by the names of the surgeons who first performed it (Dagradi and Serio), and by the names of the surgeons responsible for reporting it worldwide with precise indications (Iacono and Serio). Operation requires a midline or a bilateral subcostal incision
