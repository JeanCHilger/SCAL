Bacteriological profile of community acquired acute bacterial meningitis: a ten-year retrospective study in a tertiary neurocare centre in South India. Ten years retrospective study to evaluate the bacteriological spectrum of community acquired acute bacterial meningitis (CAABM).Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 385 clinically suspected cases of pyogenic meningitis were processed for cell counts, cytospin Gram stain, culture, antigen detection by latex agglutination (LAT) and antibiotic susceptibility test. Eighteen of these CSF samples were also subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detection of pneumococcal DNA.The etiological agent could be identified in 284 (73.8%) of the total 385 cases by culture and/or smear and /or LAT. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen accounting for 238 (61.8%) cases. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis accounted for 7 (1.8%) and 4 (1%) cases respectively. Other gram negative bacilli, Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from 19 (4.9%), 9 (2.3%) and 7 (1.8%) cases respectively.Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the major aetiological agent of CAABM both in adults and children in our set-up. No penicillin resistance was detected among the isolates. Further research should focus on preventable aspects of CAABM, especially pneumococcal vaccines, to help reduce the disease burden.
