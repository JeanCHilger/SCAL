Field evaluation of a rota- and adenovirus immunochromatographic assay using stool samples from children with acute diarrhea in Ghana. We evaluated the Rida Quick rotavirus/adenovirus Combi rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) under field conditions with Ghanaian children with acute diarrhea. Compared to PCR results, sensitivities and specificities were 75% and 95% for rotavirus and 22% and 84% for adenovirus. In resource-poor settings, ICTs may help to overcome difficulties in the diagnosis of rotavirus infection.
