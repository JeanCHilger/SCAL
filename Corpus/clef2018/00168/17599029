Rotavirus infection in the Paraguayan population from 2004 to 2005: high incidence of rotavirus strains with short electropherotype in children and adults. Rotavirus is considered the main viral cause of acute gastroenteritis in children in both developed and developing countries. The aim of the present study was to continue the surveillance of rotavirus in the Paraguayan population in anticipation of a rotavirus vaccination in children.Fecal samples from infants (< or =5 years of age) and adults with diarrhea (912 and 801 samples, respectively) were collected in Paraguay during 2004-2005. Rotavirus incidence was screened by PAGE and genotyping was performed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.Rotavirus incidence was 23.8% and 19.4% for children and adults, respectively. The rotavirus incidence was higher in the coolest and driest months of the year. Five different group A rotavirus electropherotypes were detected. Rotaviruses with a long electropherotype were the most frequently detected in children in 2004 and 2005. However, in 2005 (after six years of absence in Paraguay) rotaviruses with a short electropherotype were detected at high frequency in both children and adults. Of these, 14 samples were genotyped (11 from children and 3 from adults) and all of them showed the G2P[4] type.This study reinforces the importance of continuous survey of rotavirus infection, extended to all age groups, in order to increase our knowledge about the complexity of rotavirus epidemiology.
