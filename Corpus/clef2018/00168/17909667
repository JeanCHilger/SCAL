Dengue haemorrhagic fever complicated by eclampsia in pregnancy. A 28-year-old primigravida presented at 36 weeks of gestation with a one-week history of fever with myalgia. Diagnosis of dengue fever was made based on viral polymerase chain reaction. She progressed to dengue shock syndrome by day nine and subsequently recovered. She delivered a healthy male baby by the vaginal route, but within 24 hours of delivery, had an eclamptic seizure, which was controlled with intravenous magnesium sulphate. Mother and the baby were well at discharge and on the follow-up visit at three months.
