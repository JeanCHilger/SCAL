Relationship between susceptibility to antimicrobials and virulence factors in paediatric Escherichia coli isolates. The in vitro susceptibilities to several antibiotics of 136 Escherichia coli strains containing virulence factors isolated from children with urinary tract infection were analysed. Escherichia coli strains were analysed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for genes encoding the following virulence factors: pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap) S fimbriae (sfa)
