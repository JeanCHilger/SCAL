Expression of cytokine-associated genes in dendritic cells (DCs): comparison between adult peripheral blood- and umbilical cord blood-derived DCs by cDNA microarray. The expression of cytokine-associated genes in dendritic cells (DCs) derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB) and adult peripheral blood (APB) was comprehensively compared in order to elucidate the difference in DC function between newborns and adults.Immature DCs were obtained from UCB and APB of healthy human donors. Several cytokines were added to generate mature DCs. Gene expression was compared using cDNA microarray containing 553 cytokine-associated genes. Eleven genes with differential expression were selected and determined their expression levels in DCs by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.The expression of the Th1 response-related genes (IL-12B and IL-18) and chemokine genes (CXCL9, CXCL13, CCL18 and CCL24) was significantly lower in UCB-DCs than in APB-DC in both maturation states. On the other hand, calgranulins A and B, which are speculated to induce immune tolerance, showed higher expression in UCB-DCs. The expression of cell cycle-related genes (CDC2 and cyclin B1) was significantly higher in UCB-DCs than in APB-DCs, and immature UCB-DCs proliferated more rapidly than immature APB-DCs.The expression of genes related to immune responses was significantly different between UCB- and APB-DCs, which may cause a decreased DC-mediated immunity and an increased susceptibility to infection in newborns.
