Cytomegalovirus infection in paediatric haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. A retrospective audit of CMV infection was undertaken to determine prevalence and outcome in the national paediatric Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) unit, with particular reference to surveillance and treatment. All patients undergoing HSCT (125 allogeneic, 50 autologous) from January 1994 to December 2004 were included. Nine underwent a second transplant for graft failure or disease recurrence. Of 134 allogeneic transplants performed, 62 were unrelated. Shell vial cultures of throat swabs and urine, and blood samples for pp65 antigenemia +/- PCR were tested weekly for a mean of 147 days post transplant. CMV negative blood products and filters were used in all. 11 rec+/donor-, 12rec-/donor+ and 10rec+/donor+ transplants were performed. All received prophylactic acyclovir, IVIG was prescribed for all but CMV -/- transplants. Initial detection of CMV was urine in 5 cases, four of whom developed antigenemia. Of ten patients who developed antigenemia, nine were treated with ganciclovir +/- foscarnet and two of these patients developed CMV pneumonitis and died. The current policy of strict surveillance, matching donor and recipient CMV status, use of CMV negative blood products and filters and pre-emptive therapy appears to be effective in controlling CMV disease/infection in the peritransplant period.
