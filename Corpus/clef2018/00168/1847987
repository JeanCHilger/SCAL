Detection of cytomegalovirus by the polymerase chain reaction. A simple, rapid and sensitive non-radioactive method. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important pathogen in persons who are immunocompromised or who have received organ transplants. The rate of symptomatic CMV infection is relatively higher after liver transplantation, and CMV hepatitis may be difficult to differentiate from rejection or cholangitis without recourse to liver biopsy and tissue culture. In this study we have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and detect CMV-DNA sequences directly from the saliva and urine of liver transplant recipients. The procedure is simple, rapid and specific, and was found to be as sensitive as tissue culture for the diagnosis of CMV.
