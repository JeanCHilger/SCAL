Fatal neonatal myocarditis caused by a recombinant human enterovirus-B variant. We report a case of fatal myocarditis in a newborn infant who was infected with a human enterovirus detected by throat culture and RT-PCR for viral RNA in plasma. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed the virus to be a genomic chimera that likely arose from recombination between coxsackievirus B3 and two recently identified enteroviruses, EV 86 and EV97.
