Chromosomal integration of human herpesvirus 6 is the major mode of congenital human herpesvirus 6 infection. We examined the frequency and characteristics of chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 among congenitally infected children.Infants with and without congenital human herpesvirus 6 infection were prospectively monitored. Cord blood mononuclear cell, peripheral blood mononuclear cell, saliva, urine, and hair follicle samples were examined for human herpesvirus 6 DNA. Human herpesvirus 6 RNA, serum antibody, and chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 levels were also assessed.Among 85 infants, 43 had congenital infections and 42 had postnatal infections. Most congenital infections (86%) resulted from chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 6 infants (14%) had transplacental infections. Children with chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 had high viral loads in all sites (mean: 5-6 log(10) genomic copies per mug of cellular DNA)Human herpesvirus 6 congenital infection results primarily from chromosomally integrated virus which is passed through the germ-line. Infants with chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 had high viral loads in all specimens, produced human herpesvirus 6 antibody, and mRNA. The clinical relevance needs study as 1 of 116 newborns may have chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 blood specimens.
