Epidemiology of Chagas disease in four rural localities in Jaguaruana, State of Ceará: seroprevalence of infection, parasitemia and clinical characteristics. A cross-sectional study on Chagas disease that examined the populations of four localities (n masculine = 541 inhabitants) in the municipality of Jaguaruana, State of Ceará, showed seroprevalence of Chagas infection of 3.1%, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination and ELISA tests. The rate was higher among adults over 50 years old, without any difference in relation to sex. Positive parasitemia was found in 11.8% (2/17) of the seropositive individuals by means of indirect xenodiagnosis and in 75% (9/12) by means of the polymerase chain reaction (p < 0.05). Cardiopathy was found by means of anamnesis, physical examination and resting electrocardiogram in 41% (7/17) of the seropositive individuals and in 11.8% (2/17) of the seronegative controls (p < 0.05). Analysis of these results showed that the prevalences of positive parasitemia and chronic Chagas cardiopathy were similar to those in the Caatinga area of Piauí and greater than in the Sertão area of Paraíba, although all these areas historically presented Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata as the primary vectors responsible for Chagas infection transmission.
