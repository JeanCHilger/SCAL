A single-tube, real-time PCR assay for detection of the two newly characterized human KI and WU polyomaviruses. Three new human polyomaviruses have been recently described, and investigating their in vivo biology and pathogenicity will require sensitive and rational detection assays.To develop and evaluate a sensitive and rational assay for detection of the newly identified KI and WU polyomaviruses.A single-tube, dual-probe, real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection and discrimination of KI and WU polyomaviruses was developed.The assay had near single-molecule sensitivity for both viruses and no cross-reactivity was observed. A panel of 637 nasopharyngeal aspirates was screened, resulting in a frequency of 1.4% for KIPyV and 1.3% for WUPyV.The dual-probe assay provides a rational approach for further studies of KIPyV and WUPyV.
