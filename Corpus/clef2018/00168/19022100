Immunosuppression may be present within condyloma acuminata. Condyloma acuminatum are common lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is associated with many human cancers, and a vaccine now prevents infection with high-risk HPV. However, eradication of established disease is difficult, indicating that these lesions are capable of local immunosuppression.This study examines the immunohistochemical staining characteristics of condyloma acuminatum lesions for markers of cellular immunity, including T-lymphocyte subsets, dendritic cells, and infected keratinocytes and markers of antigen presentation in condyloma tissue.Five snap-frozen, optimal cutting temperature-embedded condyloma lesions were immunostained for T-lymphocyte markers Fox P3, CD8, CD25 and molecules involved in antigen presentation.Condylomas demonstrated hallmarks of immunosuppression, such as increased cellular interleukin-10 production, decreased expression of transporter associated with antigen presentation, CD40, and carbonic anhydrase IX, decreased dendritic cell counts, and increased T-regulatory cell infiltration.This study was performed with lesions from a single center, and control tissue from the same patients was not available because of lack of patient consent.These results demonstrate that condylomas induce a local immunosuppressive environment, with deficits in antigen presentation and enhancement of immunosuppressive T-regulatory cell populations. Strategies to block this immunosuppression are required to elicit effective immune responses to HPV infection.
