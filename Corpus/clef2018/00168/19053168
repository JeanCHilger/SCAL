Electron microscopy identifies virus in cells lifted from microscopic slides: a useful method for a unique circumstance. Electron microscopy (EM) using a "lift technique" (EM-lift) of suspect cells has been used when a question of viral infection is raised by light microscopy and is not otherwise confirmed. We demonstrate how, in this unique circumstance, EM can complement or even supersede immunohistochemistry (IHC) and culture studies. Cases with suspected viral inclusions followed by EM-lift were collected over 25 years hematoxylin and eosin, IHC, and culture findings were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry results were not available in 15 of the 30 samples found
