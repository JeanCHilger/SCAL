Patterns and predictors of CD4 T-cell counts among children born to HIV-infected women in Tanzania. We assessed age-specific CD4 T-cell counts and their determinants among Tanzanian children born to HIV-infected mothers to address a major research gap. A total of 474 HIV-uninfected and 69 HIV-infected children were followed until age of 12 months. Maternal predictors were measured during pregnancy and child predictors at birth and throughout the follow up. Child CD4 T-cell counts were evaluated at the age of 3 months and subsequent 3-month intervals they decreased linearly among HIV-infected (beta = -8 cells per week
