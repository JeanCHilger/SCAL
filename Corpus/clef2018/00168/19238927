Gynecology. GYNAECOLOGY: Treatment of cancer in young women have an impact on reproduction. It is now possible to preserve or restore fertility following therapy. Implementation of these techniques should be started before anticancer treatment. We also comment a randomised trial comparing two sequences in advanced ovarian cancer: surgery followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy followed by surgery. The results of this trial showed a similar efficacy of the two options. A new treatment of dysplasia of the vulva (imiquimod) has been shown effective. OBSTETRICS: Neonatal sepsis, despite a low incidence, is a frequent concern for perinatologists. Recommendations including identification by antenatal culture and intrapartum antibiotic treatment of women colonised by group B streptococcus are questionable in our context. Recent development of PCR-based techniques may improve the detection of women and thus the prevention of sepsis.
