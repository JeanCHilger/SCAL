Clinical evaluation of NucliSENS magnetic extraction and NucliSENS analytical specific reagents for the real-time detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in paediatric respiratory specimens. To evaluate the combination of NucliSENS magnetic extraction and NucliSENS analytical specific reagents (bioMÃ©rieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from a variety of respiratory samples.Nucleic acids (NA) from paediatric samples (n = 603) and an RSV-specific inhibition control (R-IC) were coextracted using the miniMAG and/or the easyMAG. Nucleic-acid-sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and molecular beacon detection of RSV and R-IC were performed using NucliSENS analyte-specific reagents (NRSVA) and the NucliSENS EasyQ Analyzer. NRSVA results were compared with R-Mix culture and direct fluorescent antibody detection (DFA).The NRSVA analytical specificity was 100%, and the NRSVA limit of detection was 5-20 RNA copies/reaction. The prediscordant analysis, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were, respectively, for R-Mix (64.7%, 100%, 100%, 94.5%) DFA (98.8%, 99.0%, 94.4%, 99.8%)NRSVA is sensitive and specific for RSV detection in respiratory samples. The R-IC monitored the test process, including NA extraction, target amplification and detection. The rapid detection of respiratory pathogens can foster appropriate patient management.
