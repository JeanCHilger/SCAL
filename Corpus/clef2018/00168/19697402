Detection of congenital cytomegalovirus infection using umbilical cord blood samples in a screening survey. Easy screening and accurate diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection are needed to predict and treat complications. We report the clinical course of two neonates with congenital CMV infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV DNA in umbilical cord blood. A total of 1,010 neonates born at Yonaha Clinic from July 2005 to March 2007 were investigated. Umbilical cord blood was collected at birth, and DNA was extracted to screen for CMV DNA by real-time PCR. Head MRI and a developmental test were conducted for two cases (0.2%) in which CMV DNA was detected. Neither case showed clear abnormalities at birth, and head CT conducted at 1 month after birth revealed no abnormalities. Auditory brainstem responses were normal at both 1 and 12 months after birth in both cases. Head MRI at 12 months showed abnormalities in both cases. For both cases, development tests conducted at 12 months revealed mild developmental delays, particularly in posture and movement areas, which might have been caused by congenital CMV infection.
