Detection of all four human metapneumovirus subtypes in nasopharyngeal specimens from children with respiratory disease in Uberlândia, Brazil. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a pathogen of the respiratory tract identified first in the Netherlands in 2001 and since then it has been detected worldwide. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize hMPV in samples collected from children <5 years presenting with acute respiratory disease (ARD) seen at a public hospital in Uberlândia, in Southeastern Brazil. One hundred fourteen nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples that were negative for the presence of nine other respiratory viruses were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of hMPV RNA. Fourteen out of 114 (12.3%) samples were positive for presence of hMPV RNA. PCR products, obtained by the amplification of partial nucleotide sequence of gene N, were sequenced and compared with sequences deposited in GenBank. Sequences from eight samples were obtained and all four subtypes were identified. Also, the recently proposed sublineages "a" and "b" of subtype A2 were found mean age was 21 months old
