DNA-positive, IgM-negative symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection: two case reports. The characteristics of two newborns that had clinical symptoms of congenital cytomegalovirus have been presented here, whose CMV-DNA was found to be positive by the PCR method, despite serological analysis being negative for CMV IgM. In conclusion, when congenital CMV infection is suspected in newborns, it should not be forgotten that the sensitivity of serological CMV IgM assay is 70% and other methods such as CMV-DNA analysis should be performed in case of negative test results.
