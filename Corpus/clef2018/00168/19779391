Congenital transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis in a premature infant. We report a preterm infant with congenital HIV-1, CMV, and toxoplasmosis coinfection, whose mother succumbed to probable cerebral toxoplasmosis. Despite repeated neuroimaging, retinal examinations and infant serologic tests, during the first 36 days of life, there was no evidence of congenital toxoplasmosis. However, subsequent tests showed cerebral calcifications, bilateral chorioretinitis, antitoxoplasma IgM antibody, and Toxoplasma gondii DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction.
