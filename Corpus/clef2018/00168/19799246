Legionellosis in Poland in 2007. In 2007 the 28 cases oflegionellosis were reported in Poland, the incidence rate was 0.073/100,000, while 86 cases (incidence rate 0.23/100,000) in 2006. The decrease in number and in incidence rate was due to lower number of examined specimens from patients as the financial support from Polish Committee of Research Activity has expired. All the cases were laboratory diagnosed in National Institute of Hygiene, the only place where laboratory tests are performed. Most of them were diagnosed with serological tests--determination with ELISA test the anti-legionella antibodies in IgM fraction of serum gamma globulins, as the most recent reaction for Legionella infection. Only few cases were diagnosed by detection of legionella antigen in urine. All BAL specimens from several patients were negative when examined with culture method, but some were positive with PCR only. Two outbreaks were registered: one in a family (5 patients, 0 death) and one in hospital (4 patients, 3 death cases). Fifteen cases were connected with travel: 14 foreign travel cases, one in Poland. Since 1987 to 2007 the 17 foreign tourists were registered in EU countries as probably infected in Poland.
