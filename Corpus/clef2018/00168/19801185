Retrospective diagnosis of congenital CMV infection in DBS from Guthrie cards: French experience. Systematic screening for cytomegalovirus congenital infection is not performed in France. For children with hearing loss or other neurological CMV compatible symptoms, retrospective diagnosis is possible by PCR detection of CMV DNA in dried blood spot of neonatal Guthrie cards. We report here the results obtained with this technique in the French national reference laboratory for cytomegalovirus.
