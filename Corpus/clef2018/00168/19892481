Rapid molecular genetic assay for direct identification of Bordetella from patients specimens. Biological diagnosis of whooping cough is increasingly necessary to confirm respiratory tract infection. Indeed, clinical symptoms are variable especially in adolescents and adults who contaminate newborns too young to be vaccinated. The PCR assay was proven highly sensitive for the diagnosis of pertussis. In this study, we reported the use of a new test (GenoQuick Bordetella [GQB], Hain Life Science, Germany) which permits the fast molecular genetic identification of Bordetella pertussis and parapertussis directly from patients specimens, i.e. swabs from nose or throat. The test was performed over a three months period on 40 specimens from patients (1 month to 65 years old), most of them were young children admitted in paediatric emergency with paroxysmal cough or prolonged cough.
