Detection of Coxsackie B3 virus infection in newborn care unit using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. To explore the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for detection of Coxsackie virus B3 (CoxB3) infection.RT-PCR method was used to detect CoxB3 viral RNA in peripheral blood samples of 31 sick children and their mothers (62 cases) from a single hospital.Among the 62 samples taken from 31 sick children and their mothers, the serological test showed only one positive case in anti-Coxsackie virus IgM. The CoxB3 serological positive rate was 1.61%. The results of RT-PCR method showed that among the 62 samples there were 12 positive cases and the positive rate was 19.35% both mothers and children were positive in four pairs of the samples (8 cases), suggesting vertical viral transmissionRT-PCR is a rapid, sensitive and specific method for detection of CoxB3 infection and its positive rate is superior to serological method.
