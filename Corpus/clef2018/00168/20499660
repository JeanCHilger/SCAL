Occurrence of resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from carriers and infections in pediatric wards of a Polish reference hospital. Study was carried out from June to November 2008 in the group of newborn babies hospitalized at the highly specialized hospital. Twenty-six clinical isolates of ESBL-positive rods were collected from 24 patients. Infections incidence was confirmed on the level 3.4/1000 patientdays (pds), among infection dominated blood infection (41%) and pneumonia (31%). All isolates were analyzed for the presence of genes of the resistance (bla)SHV, (bla)TEM i (bla)CTX-M by the multiplex PCR amplification. Isolates were genotyped by PFGE. All isolates were characterized by the presence of the (bla)CTX-M gene. The most of ESBL-positive strains were polyclonal. Three endemic clones of the bacteria were distinguished (among Enterobacter and Klebsiella) which could be moved between patients. Appearing of infection among hospitalized newborn babies showed no relation with the frequency isolation of strains with ESBL phenotype during the period of the study at hospital. The dissemination of ESBLs is due to clonal spread or plasmid dissemination among or between species.
