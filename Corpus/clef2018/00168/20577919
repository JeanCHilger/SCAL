Risk factors for postoperative pancreatic leakage after D(2) resection of gastric cancer. To investigate the incidence of pancreatic fistula following D(2) gastrectomy and associated risk factors.A total of 132 consecutive cases of gastric cancer underwent D(2) gastrectomy between Jul 1, 2009 and Dec 2009. Amylase concentration of the drainage fluid and serum amylase concentration were tested on day 1, 4, 7 after operation. Univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the significance of various covariates as risk factors for the pancreatic fistula-related complications.The incidence of pancreatic fistula was 17.4%. None of the following factors including age, gender, tumor location, tumor stage, N stage, range of resection, fistula output, and serum amylase were associated with pancreatic fistula.The incidence of pancreatic fistula following D(2) gastrectomy is high. Drainage tube is necessary to prevent serious complications.
