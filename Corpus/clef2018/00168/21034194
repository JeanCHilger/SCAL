Pre- and post-conjugate vaccine epidemiology of pneumococcal serotype 6C invasive disease and carriage within Navajo and White Mountain Apache communities. A second-generation 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13, was recently licensed. Although PCV13 includes serotype 6A, the usefulness of that antigen may be limited by the emergence of a new serotype, 6C, which was identified among isolates initially characterized (Quellung reaction) as serotype 6A. The epidemiology of serotype 6C prior to and after 7-valent PCV (PCV7) introduction is incompletely understood.We analyzed conventionally serotyped 6A (CS6A) pneumococci from invasive disease case patients of all ages and carriage isolates from children and adults obtained in population-based studies among Navajo and White Mountain Apache communities during 1994-2009. Samples were tested by triplex polymerase chain reaction to resolve serotypes 6C and 6A.A total of 74 invasive CS6A episodes occurred. All were retyped by polymerase chain reaction 40 (54.1%) were serotype 6C. The mean annual incidence of serotype 6C invasive disease was 0.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.9), 0.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.3), and 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.1) cases per 100,000 population in the years prior to the PCV7 efficacy trial, during the time the PCV7 trial was conducted, and following PCV7 introduction and routine use, respectively (P = .01). In the routine vaccination era, 76% of invasive CS6As were serotype 6CIn the PCV7 routine use era, virtually all serogroup 6 invasive pneumococcal disease and carriage strains among Navajo and White Mountain Apache communities are 6C. Monitoring and evaluation of this and other emerging serotypes among invasive disease and carriage isolates is warranted.
