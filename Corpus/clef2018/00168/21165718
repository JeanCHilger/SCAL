Study of viral infections in infants with biliary atresia. Viral infections may have an important role in the pathogenesis of biliary atresia, and related clinical outcomes. In this research for determination of the possible role of HBV, HCV, HCMV, adenovirus, and BK virus infections in biliary atresia related clinical complications, the molecular and antigenic prevalence of these viral agents were studied. In this retrospective study, 34 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsy and autopsy liver tissue samples of neonates with biliary atresia were evaluated. The molecular prevalence of these viral infections was assayed by different PCR and RT-PCR methods. The antigenic prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HCMV infections was also studied in these liver tissue samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. HBV, HCV, and adenovirus genomes were detected in 9%, 6%, and 6% of liver autopsy and biopsy tissues of infants with biliary atresia, respectively. HBV and HCV co-infection was confirmed in 6% of FFPE samples. The genome of other investigated viruses was not detected in FFPE liver tissues. Detection of viral infection in FFPE liver tissue samples of newborns with biliary atresia, suggests the need for complete studies for the determination of accurate role of these viral infections in pathogenesis of biliary atresia.
