Natural killer cell deficiencies in a consecutive series of children with herpetic encephalitis. Natural killer (NK) cells play a fundamental role in innate and early phases of adaptive immunity against viral infections, both in humans and in animal models. To date, NK cell deficiencies in patients with severe herpetic infections have been reported in single cases, and their role as predisposing factor is still controversial. Five children affected by herpetic encephalitis were consecutively admitted to the Anna Meyer Children's Hospital in Florence (Italy) between 2003 and 2005. We therefore investigated the presence of NK cell deficiencies in a consecutive series of children with herpetic encephalitis. Five healthy children were included in the study as controls. Differential WBC counts, main Ig and IgE class serum analysis, cytofluorimetric analysis of circulating T, B and NK cells were performed on our study population. Sequencing of a selected region of CD16A gene transcript was carried out in two patients. All patients resulted to be affected by deficiencies related to NK cells in respect to controls. One patient was also affected by lymphopenia, while no other significant deficits of immunity were detected in the study population. To date, this is the first survey that demonstrates isolated NK cell deficiencies in a cohort of consecutive patients affected by severe herpes simplex infections. These findings suggest a role for NK cell deficiencies as a predisposing factor for increased susceptibility and severe course of disease in these patients.
