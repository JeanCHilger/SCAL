Virus detection in the fetal tissue of a premature delivery with a congenital varicella syndrome. A case report. Cases of congenital varicella syndrome have been published, to date, a single case reports. Isolation attempts of Varicella-Zoster virus from fetal tissues have, thus far, been unsuccessful. This is a first report of detection of Varicella-Zoster virus in fetal tissue by means of DNA hybridization technique in a typical case of congenital varicella syndrome in a premature delivery of the 27th gestational week. The case is documented anamnestically, sonographically, pathologically and virologically. In women with primary varicella infection during pregnancy good sonographical controls are recommended. In cases with sonographically characteristical signs prenatal diagnosis with puncture of the umbilical vein cord and placentocentesis may be considered. The varicella DNA detection should be supplemented, however, by the polymerase chain reaction.
