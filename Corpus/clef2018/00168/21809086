Evaluation of third-generation ELISA and a rapid immunochromatographic assay for the detection of norovirus infection in fecal samples from inpatients of a German tertiary care hospital. The analytical accuracy of the RIDASCREEN Norovirus 3rd Generation ELISA assay and the rapid immunochromatographic RIDAQUICK Norovirus assay were determined in comparison to PCR. In a prospective study 410 consecutive samples were collected from inpatients of a tertiary care hospital in Germany. All samples were tested with the two antigen detection assays, as well as with three different real-time reverse transcription PCR methods as the reference standard. A sample was considered true-positive if at least 2 out of 3 PCR methods yielded a positive signal (137 positive samples, >99% genogroup II). Compared with the PCR-based reference the overall diagnostic sensitivities of the ELISA and the immunochromatographic assay were 77% and 69% and the diagnostic specificities were 96% and 97% respectively. Both assays allow the rapid and economic screening of large numbers of samples and thus are useful diagnostic tools for the detection of suspected norovirus infections.
