Asymptomatic infection of visceral leishmaniasis in hyperendemic areas of Vaishali district, Bihar, India: a challenge to kala-azar elimination programmes. A cohort of 91 asymptomatic individuals with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were identified during base line screening using recombinant 39-aminoacid antigen (rk-39) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conducted from December 2005 to June 2006 involving 997 individuals of two highly endemic villages of Vaishali district, Bihar. The point prevalence of asymptomatic infection was 98 per 1000 persons at baseline. There was no statistically significant difference between rk-39 and PCR positivity rate (P>0.05), even though PCR positivity alone was found significantly higher (4.2%) than rk-39 positivity alone (2.6%). The monthly follow-up of the asymptomatic cohort revealed a disease conversion rate of 23.1 per 100 persons within a year. There was a statistically significant difference in conversion of disease when individuals were positive by both tests as compared to single tests by rk-39 and PCR (P<0.01). Disease conversion rate in the subjects residing in households with a history of VL (62%, 13/21) was higher than those residing in the households without a history of VL (38%, 8/21). Most of the identified asymptomatic individuals were from low socio-economic strata similar to that of VL cases in general. Apart from rk-39, PCR may be considered for screening of asymptomatic Leishmania donovani infection in large-scale epidemiological studies. Screening of asymptomatic cases and their close follow-up to ascertain early detection and treatment of VL may be considered in addition to the existing VL control strategies.
