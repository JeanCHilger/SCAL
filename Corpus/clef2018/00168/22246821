Viral load and epidemiological profile of patients infected by pandemic influenza a (H1N1) 2009 and seasonal influenza a virus in Southern Brazil. Correlation between virologic profile and clinical features of patients infected by influenza virus provides important information for epidemiological control and clinical management of future disease outbreaks. Samples from patients in Southern Brazil, from June to December 2009, were examined and the viral load was correlated with epidemiological data. All samples were analyzed by qRT-PCR for detection of the 2009-pandemic Influenza A (H1N1). Relative viral loads were assessed based on the 2(-Î”CT) method and epidemiological data were obtained for each patient, following ethical policies. A total of 933 samples were positive for pH1N1 (2009) influenza 172 were positive for seasonal influenza A
