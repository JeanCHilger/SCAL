Increased reports of Mycoplasma pneumoniae from laboratories in Scotland in 2010 and 2011 - impact of the epidemic in infants. In common with reports from other European countries, we describe a substantial increase in the number of laboratory reports of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Scotland in 2010 and 2011. The highest number of reports came from those aged one year and younger. However, reports from young children were more likely to come from PCR testing than serological testing.
