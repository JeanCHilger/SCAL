Clinically relevant pancreas-related infectious complication after pancreaticoenteral anastomosis could be predicted by the parameters obtained on postoperative day 3. Pancreatic fistula or pancreas-related infectious complications are one of the most common surgical complications after pancreatic surgery. The aims of this study were, first, to reveal the risk factors for clinically relevant pancreas-related infectious complications and, second, to identify those risk factors that are obtainable within the first 3 postoperative days.One hundred seven consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoenteral anastomosis between October 2007 and November 2010 were enrolled.There were 36 patients with clinical pancreas-related infectious complications among 107 in this series of patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a narrow main pancreatic duct diameter (<3 mm) was an independent risk factor for clinically relevant pancreas-related infectious complication. Univariate and multivariate analyses also revealed that a body temperature of 38°C or higher on postoperative day 3 (POD3), a leukocyte count of 9.8 × 10(9)/L or greater on POD3, and a drain fluid amylase level of 3000 IU/L or higher on POD3 were significant predictive factors for clinically relevant pancreas-related infectious complication for 58 patients with a narrow main pancreatic duct.In view of the clinical variables obtained on POD3, such as amylase levels in drain effluent, body temperature, and leukocyte count, clinically relevant pancreas-related infections could be predicted well.
