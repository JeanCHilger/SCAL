Hepatitis C virus (HCV) status in newborns born to HCV positive women performing intracytoplasmic sperm injection. A low risk of HCV vertical transmission has been reported especially in those born to women with viraemia. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) being an assisted reproduction technique includes procedures that may increase risk of transmission.To determine the rate of vertical transmission of HCV to newborns born to HCV positive mothers in ICSI cycles.In a cross-sectional observational study, serum samples have were collected within the first week after birth from newborns of two groups of ICSI cycles females. Group one: 30 women HCV antibody (Ab) positive/HCV RNA negative. Group two: 30 women HCV Ab positive/HCV RNA positive. Newborn sera were subjected to HCV antibody testing, and detection of HCV viral RNA by PCR.None of the newborns born to PCR negative females undergoing ICSI cycles showed positive results neither for HCV antibody, or for HCV RNA. Only one out of the 30 newborns born to PCR positive females was positive for HCV antibody and HCV RNA.HCV vertical transmission in ICSI cycles seemed to be of low incidence in PCR positive women, while in the case of HCV PCR negative/sero-positive women, it appeared to be completely absent. This observation could have an impact on the clinicians' counseling for HCV positive females seeking ICSI.
