Detection and typing of cutaneous human papillomavirus types--a comparison of three different methods. Cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) may play a role in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. HPV copy numbers in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are very low and hence sensitive and reliable detection methods are important, particularly to examine the natural history of cutaneous HPV. In the present study, the presence of cutaneous HPV types was examined in 194 skin swabs and in a subgroup of 91 skin swabs, and compared using three different PCR based methods: (i) beta/gamma cutaneous HPV PCR reverse-line-blotting (BGC-PCR RLB), (ii) multiplex cutaneous papillomavirus genotyping (McPG) and (iii) FAP PCR. The HPV prevalence was 75% (68/91) with BGC-PCR RLB, 64% (124/194) with McPG and 72% (139/194) with FAP PCR. The agreement for the detection of HPV between the three methods in the subset of 91 samples was 73% (66/91 kappa=0.34) for BGC-PCR RLB and McPG, 75% (68/91
