Development of a novel rat model with pancreatic fistula and the prevention of this complication using tissue-engineered myoblast sheets. Pancreatic fistula (PF) is one of the most important complications of pancreatic surgery. The aims of this study were to establish a PF model in rats and to investigate the efficacy of our new method for preventing PF, which utilizes myoblast sheets made using tissue engineering techniques.To establish a PF model, the rats underwent transection of each of four pancreatic ducts: the gastric, duodenal, common, and splenic ducts, respectively. Their ascitic amylase and lipase levels were then measured. To investigate the efficacy of myoblast sheets at preventing PF, a myoblast sheet was attached to the pancreatic stump in the PF models. The levels of amylase and lipase in both serum and ascites were then measured, and surgical specimens were investigated pathologically.The new PF model established by transecting the splenic duct in rats may prove very useful. There were no significant differences in serum amylase and lipase levels between the myoblast sheet (+) group and the sheet (-) group. However, there were significant differences in ascitic amylase and lipase levels between the two groups (p < 0.05). Among the pathological findings, the number of inflammatory cells in the myoblast sheet group was smaller than that in the control group. In addition, the presence of the myoblast sheets on the surface of the pancreatic stump was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining.Our data demonstrate the efficacy of the new rat model of PF presented herein, and that it might be possible to prevent PF using myoblast sheets.
