Characterization of human rotaviruses circulating in Iraq in 2008: atypical G8 and high prevalence of P[6] strains. Fecal samples from 976 children with gastroenteritis were collected and analyzed for group A rotavirus (RVA), in three different cities in Iraq between January 2008 and December 2008. RVA antigen was detected in 394 (40%) of the samples, and 98 samples were available for further genotype analyses using multiplex RT-PCR and sequence analyses for untypeable strains. The G/P-genotype combination was determined for 69 samples, and 19, 2 and 8 samples remained P-untypeable, G-untypeable and G/P-untypeable (UT), respectively. The most prevalent genotype was G2 (40%, 39/98) most often associated with P[6]. G1 was the second most common genotype (16%, 16/98) mainly associated with P[8] and P[UT]. G3, G4 and G9 were detected at a lower prevalence (3%, 11%, 3%, respectively), mainly associated with P[6]. Surprisingly, five G8P[6], and seven G12 RVA strains in combination with P[6] and P[8] were also detected for the first time in Iraq. Overall, a striking high prevalence of 47% of the analyzed samples possessed the P[6] genotype (65% of the P-typed RVA strains). Atypical genotype combinations such as G1P[4], G1P[6], G2P[8] or strains with mixed G-types were detected sporadically. The detection of unusual G8P[6] RVA strains prompted us to further analyze the NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP5 gene segments of three selected G8P[6] strains, resulting in their designation to the N2, T2, E2 and H2 genotypes, respectively. The VP7, VP4, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 gene segments clustered closely with common human RVA strains, whereas the NSP4 gene sequences were found to cluster with animal derived RVA strains, suggesting a potential reassortment event. The high prevalence of RVA strains with the G8, G12 and P[6] genotypes in combination with a DS-1-like genotype constellation in Iraq, needs to be monitored closely as these RVA strains might challenge the effectiveness of current RVA vaccines.
