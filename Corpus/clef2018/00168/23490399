Identification of respiratory viruses with a novel point-of-care multianalyte antigen detection test in children with acute respiratory tract infection. Rapid etiological diagnosis of a respiratory virus infection may have impact on antiviral and antibiotic therapy, patient cohorting, and prediction of the clinical course. Most point-of-care tests for detection of respiratory viruses have limitations in diagnostic performance and clinical usability. A novel, multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system (mariPOC(速) ArcDia International Oy Ltd., Turku, Finland) detects eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses) from a single nasopharyngeal swab specimen by a fully automated, random-access immunoassay method.To evaluate mariPOC(速) point-of-care test system in comparison with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a pediatric emergency department setting.Prospectively collected samples from 158 children (mean age, 1.8 years) with respiratory symptoms and/or fever were analyzed both by mariPOC(速) and by multiplex RT-PCR.The sensitivities and specificities (95% confidence intervals) of the mariPOC(速) test were for influenza A (n = 7), 71% (38-100) and 100% influenza B (n = 22), 86% (72-100) and 98% (95-100)This novel point-of-care test system is a rapid, practical, and specific method for simultaneous detection of eight respiratory viruses. Compared with RT-PCR, its sensitivity is moderately high for detection of RSV and influenza viruses, and low for adenovirus.
