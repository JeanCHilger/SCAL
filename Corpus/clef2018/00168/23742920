Neonatal parechovirus infection, fever, irritability and myositis. Human parechovirus (HPeV) is associated with central nervous system infection and sepsis-like illness in newborn infants. The most frequent signs are fever, seizures, irritability, rash, and encephalitis. We report 4 cases of full-term infants with HPeV infection. They were admitted from home to the pediatric emergency unit of our hospital in October 2012. The median age at onset of symptoms was 15 days. They all developed sepsis-like illness with predominantly gastrointestinal disease and irritability. Two patients developed respiratory problems and 2 a skin rash (concerning only the extremities for one). Two patients required hospitalization in an intensive care unit. There was normal or mild inflammatory syndrome, normal white blood cell or mild leukopenia, hepatitis. We describe for the first time elevation of muscular enzymes in 3 of these patients. The diagnosis of HPeV infection was made by positive HPeV real-time PCR in cerebrospinal fluid (including the patient without pleocytosis) and/or blood. HPeV may cause severe disease in the neonatal period and patients presenting with such signs should be evaluated for HPeV. It also should be considered in sudden infant death syndrome.
