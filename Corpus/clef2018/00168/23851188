Prevalence, seasonality and severity of disease caused by pathogenic Escherichia coli in children with diarrhoea in Bolivia. The prevalence of infection caused by different categories of diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC) strains, including enteroaggregative (EAEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli, in children who suffered from diarrhoea (n = 3943) or did not have diarrhoea (n = 1026) were analysed in two areas in Bolivia over a period of 4 years. We also analysed the seasonality of DEC infections and severity of diarrhoea in children with DEC infection and compared antibiotic resistance in DEC strains isolated from children with and without diarrhoea. Stool samples were analysed for the presence of DEC by culturing followed by PCR. The most prevalent DEC categories in samples from the children were: EAEC (11.2 %) ETEC (6.6 %)
