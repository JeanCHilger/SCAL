Characteristic of virulence potential of clinical isolates of enterococci. Determination of virulence of enterococci strains isolated from clinical material from humans on pheno- and genotype levels.30 strains of enterococci isolated from wound exudate, urine, newborn skin lavage were used in the study. Strain identification was carried out by multiplex PCR. Hemolytic activity was determined by dish method, gelatinase - by dissolution of gelatin column, proteolytic--by biuret method genes coding virulence factor synthesis (gelE, sprE, cylM, cylB, cylA, cylLs, cylL1, ESP, HYL, ASA)--by using PCR.Clinical isolates of enterococci were assigned to E. faecalis and E. faecium species. Virulence factors on phenotype and genotype levels were detected in both species.Genetic determinants of virulence are more widespread among clinical isolates of E.faecalis species. Set of genes coding virulence factors in E. faecalis depends on biotope. Gene coding hyaluronidase synthesis is characteristic for E. faecium. A correlation between phenotypic manifestation of features and enterococci genotype was detected.
