Bedside immunochromatographic test for enterovirus 71 infection in children. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes frequent outbreaks worldwide, particularly in the Asia-Pacific area. Its quick spread is a critical challenge for public health and timely preventive measures and clinical management therefore rely on early detection. There is a need for a rapid, easy-to-use, and reliable method for detecting EV71 infections.The study aimed to evaluate a bedside immunochromatography (ICT) kit for diagnosing acute EV71 infection in children.Pediatric patients with herpangina or hand-foot-mouth disease were randomly and prospectively enrolled from hospitals across Taiwan. Throat or rectal swabs were collected for viral culture and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). For the ICT kit, whole blood was obtained by ear piercing, finger-sticking, or venipuncture. The results of ICT, virus isolation and RTPCR in clinical samples were compared.Of the 156 patients enrolled, 91 (58%), 64 (41%) and 72 (46%) had positive results of the ICT kit, viral culture and RTPCR, respectively. Laboratory-confirmed infection with either positive EV71 culture or RTPCR was used as the diagnostic standard. The sensitivity and specificity of the ICT kit was 84% and 77%, respectively. The viral culture and RTPCR had relatively lower sensitivity but higher specificity. The patient's age did not affect the performance of the ICT, viral culture and RTPCR. However, a low sensitivity of ICT kit was noted before the second day of disease onset.The ICT kit may serve as a simple, quick and reliable method for the bedside diagnosis of acute EV71 infection in children.
