High latency of tuberculosis manifestation in a premature extremely low birth weight infant with favorable outcome. We report a case of possible congenital tuberculosis in a 22+2 weeks, 460 g, vaginally delivered female infant born to a mother suffering from tuberculous endometritis, diagnosed soon after delivery. At 156 days of age, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected via PCR from the infant's gastric juice and was subsequently isolated. There was no evidence for horizontal transmission. Mother and child were treated successfully. This case illustrates the possibility of significant latency between infection and clinical manifestation in preterm infants and also emphasizes the need for urgent treatment of neonates in such situations.
