Neonatal group B streptococcus infection in the Children's Hospital of Gansu Province through PCR array. To study neonatal Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) infection in The Children's Hospital of Gansu Province through Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) Array.After obtaining the informed consent from parents or guardians, blood samples of 286 neonates were collected and studied in The Children's Hospital of Gansu Province from June 2011 to January 2012. DNA of the selected samples was extracted through the method of 5% Chelex-100 + 0.5% NP40 solution. Twenty-five genes were ultimately selected and then 25 pairs of primers were designed respectively through primer-BLAST tool of NCBI database.For every primer, PCR conditions were optimized through the identified GBS, and 25 pairs of primers were arrayed as to be used to study neonatal GBS infection.The results of PCR Array showed that the 14 samples were detected positive, accounting for 4.90% of all the selected specimens. As for neonatal GBS infection, the positive rate was 4.55% within 7 days after birth and 5.19% in those older than 7 days. The positive rate of 53 preterm infants was 5.66%. The follow-up survey showed that none of the cases died.In the Children's Hospital of Gansu Province neonatal GBS infection rate was 4.90%, which is similar to the previous domestic reports, but is lower than the reports from Europe and the United States.Studies have shown that the gene expression related to immune evasion has a higher frequency. The present study suggests that the strategy of GBS immune adaptation may play an important role in neonatal GBS infection.
