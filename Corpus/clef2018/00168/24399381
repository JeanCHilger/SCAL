Viral aetiology of acute lower respiratory tract illness in hospitalised paediatric patients of a tertiary hospital: one year prospective study. Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI), ranked as the second leading cause of death are the primary cause of hospitalisation in children. Viruses are the most important causative agents of ALRI.To study the viral aetiology of ALRI in children at a tertiary care hospital.One year prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital of King George's Medical University, Lucknow.Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected from children admitted with signs and symptoms of ALRI who were aged 0-14 years. Samples were transported to the laboratory at 4Â°C in viral transport media and processed for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza virus A and B, adenovirus (ADV), human Boca virus (HBoV), human metapneumo virus (hMPV) and parainfluenzavirus 1, 2, 3 and 4 using mono/multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). STATA was used for statistical analysis.In one year, 188 NPAs were screened for respiratory viruses, of which 45.7% tested positive. RSV was most commonly detected with 21.3% positivity followed by measles virus (8.5%), influenza A virus (7.4%), ADV (5.3%), influenza B virus (1.6%), hMPV (1.1%) and HBoV (0.5%). Month wise maximum positivity was seen in December and January. Positivity rate of RSV was highest in children aged < 1 year, which decreased with increase in age, while positive rate of influenza virus increased with increasing age.The occurrence of viral predominance in ALRI is highlighted.
