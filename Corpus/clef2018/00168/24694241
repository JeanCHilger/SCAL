Development of norovirus rapid detection kit "QuickNavi™-Norovirus2". We have evaluated our new Norovirus rapid detection kit "QuickNavi™-Norovirus2" (Denka Seiken Co., Ltd.). The kit is based on Immunochromatographic method using colored latex particles. In addition to simple preparations giving quick (15 min) results, our newly developed kit enables specimen collection directly from rectum and can also be used with neonatal stool samples, both of which cannot be used with the current version of the kit, "QuickNavi™-Norovirus." Clinical study (stool samples, n=172) shows sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the test compared to RT-PCR are 92.0%, 98.3%, and 94.2%, respectively. The result also showed good correlation with QuickNavi™-Norovirus. In this study, the new Norovirus rapid detection kit has shown sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Their performance, simple preparation enabling rectal swab samples, and quick results can be useful for day to day clinical practice when diagnosing Norovirus infection.
