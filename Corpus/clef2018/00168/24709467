Human enterovirus and parechovirus infections in newborns with sepsis-like illness and neurological disorders. Enterovirus (HEV) and parechovirus (HPeV) infections are common in the neonatal period, and account for a large portion of febrile illnesses during the summer season. HEV infections appear clinically and seasonally similar to HPeV infections. In this study, we present the virological and clinical data from neonates infected with HEV or HPeV and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit for sepsis-like illness or neurologic disorders. In the period January 2010 to October 2013, 54 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 10 plasma samples were obtained from 60 newborns aged <30 days. A total of 7/60 (11.6%) patients were positive for HEV infection and 3 (5.0%) were positive for HPeV infection as determined by specific real-time RT-PCR. The most common clinical signs were fever, irritability, hyporeactivity and, in a few cases, rash. All infections were observed during the summer-fall period. In conclusion, HEV and HPeV were shown to account for a significant portion of febrile illnesses in neonates requiring hospitalization.
