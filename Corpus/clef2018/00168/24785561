Clinical and laboratory characteristics of disseminated herpes simplex virus infection in neonates. Disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is the most fulminant type of neonatal HSV infection and has the highest mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient survival. We describe the clinical presentation, laboratory characteristics, and outcomes of neonates with disseminated HSV infection at our institution.A retrospective review of electronic medical records from 2006 to 2013 was performed. Only neonates with disseminated HSV infection, confirmed by using polymerase chain reaction or viral culture results, were included.Twenty-two cases were identified the age range was 1 to 14 days. The majority of patients did not have a maternal history of HSV or a history of maternal fever at delivery. Eleven of the patients were delivered by cesarean delivery, and 3 of these patients did not have prolonged rupture of membranes. Neonatal fever, the most common historical characteristic, was present in only one-half of the patients. Pneumonia and respiratory distress were present in one-half of the patients. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated in most, but not all, patients. The blood HSV polymerase chain reaction was positive in all patients tested. Of the 22 study patients, 16 survived and 6 died. The majority of the patients who died had respiratory disease and a delay in the initiation of acyclovir therapy.Disseminated HSV infection in neonates can be challenging to diagnose and is associated with high mortality. Clinicians must strongly consider this diagnosis, test the blood for HSV polymerase chain reaction, and initiate early treatment in the appropriate clinical scenarios.
