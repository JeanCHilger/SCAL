Multidisciplinary approach to congenital Toxoplasma infection: an Italian nationwide survey. Italy provides a free voluntary serological screening for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy supported by public health system, as there is an estimated congenital toxoplasmosis rate of 1-2/10,000. The aim of this study was to make an inventory of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in use in Italy in the absence of a national guideline. A semistructured questionnaire was distributed to AMCLI (Italian Association of Clinical Microbiologists) members who were asked to involve other specialists to fill in the form. Data from 26 centers show: a) a general use of the IgG avidity test to solve diagnosis in IgG/IgM positive, pregnant women b) a widespread attitude to spyramicin antenatal treatment in suspected, unconfirmed maternal infection
