Role of optic microscopy for early diagnosis of Menkes disease. We report the case of a male patient with a normal development in the first three months of life, presenting for global regression, central axial hypotonic syndrome, pyramidal syndrome, focal epileptic seizures, and a particular aspect of the hair - almost absent, short, sparse, lightly colored, at age of five months, becoming coarse, twisted (kinky hair) by the age of 21 months. Different diseases associate similar neurological and macroscopic aspect of the hair (biotinidase deficiency, argininosuccinic aciduria, aminoaciduria, giant axonal neuropathy, trichothiodistrophy and Menkes syndrome). The microscopic aspect of the patient's hair showing normal hair, silver colored hair, hair shafts twisting 1800, trichoclasis, and trichoptilosis, was highly characteristic for Menkes disease. Diagnosis was further supported by the low concentration of serum copper and ceruloplasmin and exclusion of other metabolic disorders with similar macroscopic aspect of the hair. Molecular genetic testing by multiplex PCR indicated deletion of exon 22 in the ATP7A gene situated in Xq21.1 region, consistent with the clinical and biochemical phenotype. Physicians should use microscopic evaluation of the hair more often when suspicion of Menkes disease is raised, aiming a narrow further diagnostic workup and early positive diagnosis and genetic advice for the affected families.
