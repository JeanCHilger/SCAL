Effect of somatostatin in advanced gastric cancer after D2 radical gastrectomy. To study the effect of somatostatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer who received D2 lymphadenectomy and vagina vasorum dissection.Using a prospective, single-blind, placebo-controlled design, patients with advanced gastric cancer were randomized into a study group (n = 61) and a control group (n = 59). Patients in the study group were given somatostatin for 5-7 d starting 6 h after the operation, and patients in the control group were given normal saline. Preoperative and nonoperative complications in the perioperative period, as well as different types of postoperative drainage in the two groups were compared.There was no significant difference between the study group and the control group for preoperative clinicopathological indicators. We found no significant difference between the two groups for the overall incidence of complications, but a lower percentage of peritoneal effusion was observed in the treatment group (1.6% vs 10.2%, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative pancreatic dysfunction and chylous fistula. However, there were significant differences in the amylase concentration in drainage fluid, volume and duration of drainage, volume and duration of chylous fistula and peritoneal drainage, and volume and duration of gastric tube drainage. The study group did not show any increase in mean hospitalization cost and the cost reduced when the postoperative complications occurred.Postoperative somatostatin reduces volume and duration of surgical drainage and related complications. Somatostatin may improve safety of gastric cancer surgery, reducing postoperative complications and promoting recovery.
