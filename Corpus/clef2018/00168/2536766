Human newborn natural killer cell responses to activation by monoclonal antibodies. Effect of culture with herpes simplex virus. Deficient responses by NK cells may contribute to the susceptibility of human newborns to severe HSV infections. Furthermore, HSV disseminates widely during neonatal infection and may also infect and interfere with the function of blood mononuclear cells (MNC). To determine whether the function of newborn NK cells would be affected by contact with HSV, and whether newborn NK cells might be permissive for HSV replication, newborn MNC were cultured with HSV in vitro for 3 days. Before culture, the intracellular calcium mobilization in newborn NK cells induced by mAb to CD2 and CD16 did not differ from that of adult NK cells. This result argues against immaturity of an early NK cell activation event in human newborns. After culture with HSV the Ca2+ flux response was unaffected by lysis of K562 targets by newborn NK cells and NK-dependent suppression of HSV replication in fibroblasts were preserved or increased. Incorporation of thymidine by NKH-1 cells following stimulation with PHA and IL-2 was not suppressed. NK cells recovered from these cultures did not contain infectious HSV and synthesis of HSV-specific proteins was not detected by immunoprecipitation although HSV genome was detected by DNA hybridization. Our results extend the in vitro model stimulation systems in which newborn NK cells respond positively to include triggering through the CD2 Ag, cross-linking of cell surface CD 16 Ag and response to a pathogen, HSV.
