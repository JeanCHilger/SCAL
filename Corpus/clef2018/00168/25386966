Sources of pertussis infection in young babies from SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. Household contacts are important sources of Bordetella pertussis in infants. A total of 353 household contacts of 97 index cases were evaluated for pertussis by culture and polymerase chain reaction. Twenty eight contacts were positive (8.0%). The presence of symptoms did not influence the rate of diagnosed bacteriologic pertussis in communicants. We conclude that contacts with an index case can be positive for B. pertussis independently of the presence of symptoms.
