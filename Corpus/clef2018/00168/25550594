Perioperative serum albumin correlates with postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Despite improvements in surgical techniques, instruments and perioperative management, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains a serious complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy. The aim of the present study was to characterize a high-risk group for POPF after pancreaticoduodenectomy using perioperative clinical variables of patients.This retrospective study comprised of 247 patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy between May 2000 and May 2013. Perioperative risk factors pertinent to development of POPF were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses.POPF developed in 43 out of 247 patients (17.4 %). In univariate analysis, male gender (p=0.005), higher postoperative serum amylase (p=0.025) and lower postoperative serum albumin (p=0.041) were significant risk factors for POPF. In multivariate analysis, male gender (p=0.008) and lower postoperative serum albumin (p=0.010) were found to be independent risk factors.Male gender and postoperative lower serum albumin were associated with the development of POPF after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
