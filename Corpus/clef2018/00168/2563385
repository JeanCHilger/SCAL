Examination of colonies and stool blots for detection of enteropathogens by DNA hybridization with eight DNA probes. We compared three methods for detecting enteropathogens in 416 children with diarrhea: (i) examination of 10 lactose-fermenting and all non-lactose-fermenting Escherichia coli (colony blots) (ii) examination of 300 colonies (replicate blots)
