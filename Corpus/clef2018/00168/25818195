Diagnostic sensitivity of a rapid antigen test for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: Comparison with real-time PCR. A rapid antigen kit for the detection of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae ribosomal protein L7/L12 using an immunochromatographic assay, Ribotest Mycoplasma, became available in Japan in 2013. To determine the sensitivity of Ribotest compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we prospectively performed these two tests simultaneously in adolescent and adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In addition, we retrospectively analyzed the theoretical sensitivity of Ribotest using M. pneumoniae PCR-positive specimens from previous studies. In prospective study, 118 CAP cases were enrolled, and 16 cases were diagnosed as M. pneumoniae pneumonia eight cases were PCR-positive, one case was culture positive, and all cases demonstrated a four-fold increase in antibody titer. Ribotest was positive in 15 cases
