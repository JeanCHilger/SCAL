Involvement of main diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, with emphasis on enteroaggregative E. coli, in severe non-epidemic pediatric diarrhea in a high-income country. Bacterial and viral enteric pathogens are the leading cause of diarrhea in infants and children. We aimed to identify and characterize the main human diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) in stool samples obtained from children less than 5 years of age, hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis in Israel, and to examine the hypothesis that co-infection with DEC and other enteropathogens is associated with the severity of symptoms.Stool specimens obtained from 307 patients were tested by multiplex PCR (mPCR) to identify enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Specimens were also examined for the presence of rotavirus by immunochromatography, and of Shigella, Salmonella and Campylobacter by stool culture clinical information was also obtained.Fifty nine (19%) children tested positive for DEC EAEC and atypical EPEC were most common, each detected in 27 (46%), followed by ETEC (n = 3DEC was common in this pediatric population, in a high-income country, and mixed EAEC and rotavirus infection was characterized by especially severe diarrhea.
