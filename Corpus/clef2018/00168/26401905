Association of age and gender with Torque teno virus detection in stools from diarrheic and non-diarrheic people. Torque teno virus (TTV) is a small virus belongs to Anelloviridea family. TTV is a disease orphan virus but it has often been associated with a variety of pathologies and co-infections. TTV was recently identified as an infectious agent that could potentially be involved in cases of acute enteritis.To ascertain the presence of TTV in stools from diarrheic and not diarrheic people, and to investigate an association between infection, and patient age and gender.Stool samples from people exhibiting signs of enteritis (954) and from non-diarrheic individuals (76) were collected in the former Chinook Health Region (CHR) in Southwestern Alberta, Canada from May 2008 to April 2009. Viral genetic material was extracted, and detection and quantification of TTV were carried out by real-time PCR. The presence of other viral and bacterial enteric pathogens was also investigated.More (P<0.001) diarrheic people (38.8%) tested positive for TTV DNA than non-diarrheic individuals (18.4%). Furthermore, viral load was greater (P<0.001) in stools from diarrheic (2.0×10(7)copies/g) than non-diarrheic (2.0×10(3)copies/g) people. TTV DNA was detected most often in diarrheic individuals that were 0-5 (57.3%) and greater than 81 (59.0%) years of age. Combined across age, the prevalence of TTV was higher among men than women (P=0.003). Co-infections with other enteric pathogens were observed.This study revealed a significant association between TTV prevalence and viral load, and enteritis. Also, TTV prevalence was significantly higher in the very young and elderly suggesting that immunological status is important.
