EBV-associated Burkitt lymphoma in Taiwan is not age-related. This study retrospectively investigated 54 cases of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma in Taiwan with histopathology review, immunohistochemistry, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in situ hybridization (EBER) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The great majority revealed typical immunophenotype and 89% (47/53) cases expressed myc protein. EBER was positive in 20% (11/54) of cases, more frequently with nodal presentation, but not significantly associated with age (pediatric vs. adult), abdominal vs. extra-abdominal presentation or overall survival (OS). MYC and IGH were rearranged in 94% (46/49) and 85% (41/48) of cases, respectively. The concordance rate between myc expression and MYC translocation was 83% (40/48). By univariate analysis, OS was statistically associated with age, with or without chemotherapy, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, CNS prophylaxis and leukemic transformation, but not gender, nodal vs. extranodal involvement, stage, immunohistochemistry, EBER, myc expression, MYC translocation or radiotherapy. By multivariate analysis, CNS involvement at presentation and administration of chemotherapy were statistically associated with OS.
