Risk Factors and Clinical Features of Cytomegalovirus Disease in Children Receiving Anticancer Chemotherapy. This study was conducted to identify risk factors for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and demonstrate the spectrum of CMV disease in children receiving anticancer chemotherapy without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A total of 289 children who received chemotherapy and were tested for CMV infection were included in the study. CMV antigenemia and DNAemia were determined by identifying the pp65 antigen in leukocytes and performing real-time PCR. CMV disease was diagnosed by tissue biopsy, culture, or ophthalmic examination. Of the 289 children, CMV infection was demonstrated in 46 patients (15.9%). Young age at cancer diagnosis was the risk factor for CMV infection by multivariate analysis (7 mo vs. 7 y, P<0.001). Among 46 children with CMV infection, 10 (21.7%) were diagnosed with CMV disease hepatitis (n=4), retinitis (n=3), hepatitis and pneumonia (n=2), and hepatitis and retinitis (n=1). The age of the patients with CMV disease was significantly younger than those without (3 vs. 16 mo, P=0.023). Retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma were the 2 most common underlying malignancies. There were 2 fatal cases associated with CMV disease, including 1 who died of CMV pneumonia. The findings of this study demonstrated significant morbidity of CMV infection and disease in young children during the course of chemotherapy without HSCT.
