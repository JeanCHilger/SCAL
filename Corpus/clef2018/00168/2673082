A 10-year experience with 290 pancreas transplants at a single institution. Since our report at the 1984 American Surgical Association meeting of 100 pancreas transplants from 1966 through 1983, another 190 have been performed. The current series, begun in 1978, now numbers 276 cases, and includes 133 nonuremic recipients of pancreas transplants alone (PTA), 46 simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplants (SPK), and 97 pancreas tranplants after a kidney transplant (PAK). Duct management techniques used were free intraperitoneal drainage in 44 cases, duct occlusion in 44, enteric drainage in 89, and bladder drainage in 128. The 1-year patient and graft survival rates in the entire cohort of 276 were 91% and 42%. One-year patient survival rates were 88% in the first 100, 91% in the second 100, and 92% in the last 76 cases corresponding 1-year graft survival rates were 28%, 47%, and 56% (p less than 0.05). A prospective comparison of bladder drainage (n = 82) versus enteric drainage (n = 46) in PAK/PTA cases since November 1, 1984 favored bladder drainage (1-year graft survival rates of 52% vs. 41%) because of urinary amylase monitoring. The best results were in recipients of primary SPK bladder-drained transplants (n = 39), with a 1-year pancreas graft survival rate of 75%, kidney graft survival rate of 80%, and patient survival rate of 95%. Logistic regression analysis, with 1-year graft function as the independent variable, showed significant (p less than 0.05) predictors of success (odds ratio) to be technique: bladder drainage (5.8) versus enteric drainage (2.5) versus duct injection (1.0)
