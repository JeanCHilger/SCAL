Pancreaticopericardial fistula: a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreaticopericardial fistula (PPF) is an extremely rare clinical problem encountered in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The diagnosis should be suspected if a patient presents with pericardial effusion on a background of chronic pancreatitis. Significantly raised amylase in the pericardial fluid offers an important clue for the diagnosis. CT is the initial imaging modality to look for pancreatic and pericardial changes. The therapeutic options include medical, endoscopic or surgical interventions. Medical and endoscopic therapies are the preferred modes of treatment while surgery is reserved for those who fail these measures.
