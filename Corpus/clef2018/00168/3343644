Management of pancreatic pseudocysts in children. The management of 25 children with pseudocyst of the pancreas presenting over a 30-year period is reviewed. Nearly a third could be managed nonoperatively, monitoring clinical signs, serum amylase, and in recent years the findings of ultrasound and CT scan. Persistence of symptoms, signs, and hyperamylasemia for more than 4 weeks indicated failed resolution in all but one case. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) done in those who did not improve spontaneously facilitated operative strategy. Early operation and internal drainage in selected cases was well tolerated. Individualization of treatment is emphasized.
