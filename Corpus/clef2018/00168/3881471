Biochemical identification of new species and biogroups of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical specimens. In 1972 there were only 11 genera and 26 species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Today there are 22 genera, 69 species, and 29 biogroups or Enteric Groups. This paper is a review of all of the new organisms. It has a series of differential charts to assist in identification and a large chart with the reactions of 98 different organisms for 47 tests often used in identification. A simplified version of this chart gives the most common species and tests most often used for identification. The sources of the new organisms are listed, and their role in human disease is discussed. Fourteen new groups of Enterobacteriaceae are described for the first time. These new groups are biochemically distinct from previously described species, biogroups, and Enteric Groups of Enterobacteriaceae. The new groups are Citrobacter amalonaticus biogroup 1, Klebsiella group 47 (indole positive, ornithine positive), Serratia marcescens biogroup 1, and unclassified Enteric Groups 17, 45, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 68, and 69.
