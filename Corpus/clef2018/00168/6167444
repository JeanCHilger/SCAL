Effects of intraduodenal amylase, lipase, trypsin, and bile on pancreatic enzyme secretion in the rat. The effect of duodenal infusion of trypsin, amylase, lipase and bile on pancreatic enzyme secretion was studied in conscious rats surgically prepared with bile-pancreatic fistulae. Trypsin infusion resulted in a depression of the secretory volume and protein and trypsinogen output. All these effects were reversed after additional infusion of trypsin inhibitor. Infusion of amylase or lipase in doses comparable to those of trypsin did not influence the secretory volume, protein or enzyme output. Likewise, intraduodenal bile infusion to rats with diverted bile-pancreatic juice did not change these parameters also in rats with trypsin reinfused into the duodenum, bile infusion was without effect.
