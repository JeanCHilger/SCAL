the early diagnosis of the vertical transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The evaluation of diagnostic tests. The early diagnosis of vertically transmitted human immunodeficiency virus infection cannot be based on the presence of specific serum antibodies since those of the maternal IgG class pass the placenta and may be detected in children for up to 18 months. Based on this fact, the aim of this study was to evaluate other techniques for early diagnosis of the infection applicable from birth in 306 children of infected mothers.The production of in vitro antibodies, virus culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. The sensitivity of the techniques was estimated in the 40 children diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus infection and specificity was determined in the 266 uninfected children.The sensitivity for the production of in vitro antibodies was 62.0% at 3 months and 94.7% at 6 months 90.4% and 88.2%, respectively, for the viral culture and 92.3% and 94.1%, respectively, for the PCR. The specificity of all the cases was higher than 89.4% although varied in relation to age.The combination of several diagnostic techniques provides better performance for the early diagnosis of vertical transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. Given that viral culture takes longer to provide results and is more expensive, it is less recommendable for routine use, although the form of viral replication may be useful to establish the prognosis.
