Acquired cytomegalovirus infection and blood transfusion in preterm infants. The urinary excretion of cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA, amplified by polymerase chain reaction using two pairs of primers for late antigen (LA) and major immediate-early antigen (MIE), and serum CMV IgM were examined in 85 pre-term infants (birth-weight less than 2000 g) on admission and monthly until 6 months after birth. Of these 85 infants, 27 had blood exchange transfusions (BET) and 28 had bolus blood transfusions two to nine times. Fifteen of 27 infants underwent BET with blood that had been filtered through Pall RC100 leukocyte removal filter the other 12 with unfiltered blood. Neither urinary CMV DNA nor serum CMV-specific IgM was detected at birth in any of the 85 pre-term infants
