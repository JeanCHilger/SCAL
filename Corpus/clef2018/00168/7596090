Detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in urine from newborns in NICU using a polymerase chain reaction. To investigate the natural course of viral shedding during the newborn period, the presence of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA in specimens at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of life was examined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. At the 3rd day of life, the viral DNA positive rate in the urine was 7% (4/60), at the 7th day 7% (3/46), at the 14th day 10% (2/20), at the 21st day 10% (1/10), and at the 28th day 25% (1/5). CMV was also detected in samples co-cultivated with HeLa 229 cells and this positive rate was 5% (3/60). The viral positive rate in newborns did not correlate with the gestational age, body weight, or serum IgM level. Six congenital infection cases were identified two of which were small-for-date babies (SFD) and three of which were born with premature rupture of membranes (PROM). They had no complications during the six months after birth.
