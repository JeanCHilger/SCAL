Current status of human cytomegalovirus disease. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can establish lifelong persistence after primary infection with reactivation occurring as a result of immunosuppression. There is much evidence that molecular interactions between the immune system and the HCMV are responsible for immune escape. HCMV in many cells especially in mononuclear blood cells during latency are frequently the source of transmission and spreading and results in a variety of disorders. In this review some data about acute infection in immunocompetent host (mononucleosis, hepatitis), about intrauterine HCMV infection, about infection and endogenous reinfection in bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients (pneumonitis) and about HCMV disease in AIDS patients (encephalitis, neuropathy, retinitis, colitis) are investigated. Moreover, HCMV associated vasculitis is described in patients with myocarditis, rheumatoid arthritis or polyradiculopathy. HCMV could play an important role in atherosclerosis. Several types of human malignancy have been linked to HCMV and it has been shown that HCMV ie genes upregulate expression of cellular oncogenes. The diagnosis of HCMV infection is carried out by viremia in cell culture using immediate early antigen staining, by antigenaemia which appears to be an early quantitative and predictive tool, by HCMV DNA detection using hybridization and PCR, and by IgM and IgG antibody evaluation. Two antiviral drugs are used for treatment: ganciclovir and phosphonoformic acid few resistant clinical isolates have been reported. Specific gammaglobulin activity is discussed. HCMV vaccine is not available.
