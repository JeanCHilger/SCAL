Acute, chronic and persistent enterovirus and poliovirus infections: detection of viral genome by seminested PCR amplification in culture-negative samples. Enteroviral and polioviral infections are potentially serious in humans causing a variety of acute, chronic and probably persistent infections. A seminested polymerase chain reaction is described which allows the detection of 1 fg of enterovirus and poliovirus RNA by using specific primers located both in the 5' non-coding and the VPI region. The technique is applied in a variety of important clinical situations: meningitis and encephalitis cases occurring in immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients acute cardiomyopathies
