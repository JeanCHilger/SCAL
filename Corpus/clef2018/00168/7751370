Direct detection of proviral gag segment of human immunodeficiency virus in peripheral blood lymphocytes by colorimetric PCR assay as a clinical laboratory tool applied to different at-risk populations. We used a colorimetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay in kit form to detect directly human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral gag sequences in peripheral blood cells from 68 healthy blood donors, 51 subjects at risk for HIV infection, 122 patients with HIV-1 infection, 11 patients with indeterminate Western blot (immunoblot) results, 4 blood donors HIV-1 positive by enzyme immunoassay, and 13 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers. The results obtained in the blood donors and HIV-1-infected patients demonstrated the high degree of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the PCR method. HIV-1 infection was excluded in 10 of the 11 patients with indeterminate Western blot results and in all four enzyme immunoassay-positive blood donors. A diagnosis of HIV infection was ruled out by negative PCR results in 5 of 13 children from seropositive mothers, which excluded vertical transmission of the infection in these cases these children were younger than 3 months and had positive serological results. Two at-risk patients with negative serological results had positive PCR results. All results were confirmed by conventional PCR. In conclusion, colorimetric PCR, which is commercially available in kit form, is an easy and reliable technique that can be used to detect proviral HIV-1 genomes in blood cells, and despite the limitations owing to HIV genome variability, it is useful in the clinical setting for the diagnosis of HIV infection in selected categories of patients.
