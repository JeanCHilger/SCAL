Renal function in premature infants during aminoglycoside therapy. The effect of three different aminoglycosides on renal function was evaluated in 30 premature infants of similar gestational age who were treated within 24 h of birth with either amikacin (10 infants, group A), gentamicin (10 infants, group B) or netilmicin (10 infants, group C), for a period of 7 days. Ten infection-free premature infants of similar post-conceptional age were used as controls. Serial determinations of plasma creatinine concentration (PCr), as well as the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), potassium, magnesium (FEMg), phosphate (FEP) and uric acid (FEUA), and the urinary excretion of calcium (UCa/UCr ratio) were assessed before, during and after treatment. During the treatment period a significant increase in FENa, FEMg and UCa/UCr was observed in group B (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and an increase in FENa and UCa/UCr in group C (P < 0.01) compared with controls. These disturbances were observed with trough concentrations of aminoglycosides but were accentuated at peak serum concentrations and were restored to normal 2 days after stopping therapy. In addition, a significant correlation was demonstrated between FENa, FEMg and UCa/UCr ratio in treated patients. PCr levels decreased similarly in all patient groups, but in 8 of 30 infants (27%) they remained elevated and returned to control values only 10 days after stopping therapy. Such renal functional disturbances, although transient, may result in significant electrolyte and mineral imbalance in the sick premature infant.
