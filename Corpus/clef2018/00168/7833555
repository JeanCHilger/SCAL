Mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission: quantitative assessment of viral burden as a diagnostic tool and prognostic parameter in HIV-1-infected children. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 251 infants born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers to diagnose HIV-1 infection. Assay specificity was invariably > 95%, regardless of age at testing, while sensitivity ranged from 15% in neonates (within 48 h of birth) to > 95% in infants over 1 month of age. Evaluation of viral burden in 43 infected infants by means of quantitative DNA-PCR disclosed that the number of HIV-1 proviruses ranged from 5 to 947 per 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Clinical follow-up demonstrated that a high viral burden was associated significantly with disease onset.
