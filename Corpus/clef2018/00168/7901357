Replication and tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 as predictors of disease outcome in infants with vertically acquired infection. In a series of 97 infants born to mothers who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 18 were identified as infected within the first 60 days of life on the basis of viral culture and polymerase chain reaction findings. We studied viral burden in vivo by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the in vitro replication pattern of the HIV-1 infecting strain by culturing patient cells with normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. According to the lag phase before p24 antigen detection and the level of p24 production on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 isolates from these patients were classified as rapid/high (R/H), slow/high (S/H), and slow/low (S/L). The pattern of HIV-1 replication in vitro was significantly associated with the viral burden in vivo the range of HIV-1 copies per 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 10 to 38, 44 to 314, and 360 to 947 in children with isolates of the S/L, S/H, and R/H types, respectively. Viral tropism was assessed by culturing patient cells under end-point dilution conditions with either CD4+ T-lymphocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that children with S/L isolates harbored mainly monocytotropic variants
