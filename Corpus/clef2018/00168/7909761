Detection of congenital cytomegalovirus infection by using chorionic villi of the early pregnancy and polymerase chain reaction. To detect congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of chorionic villi in early pregnancy.Extraction of DNA of chorionic villi and amplification of the gene of major immediate-early (MIE) antigen of CMV using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Sixty-eight specimens of chorionic villi and 16 specimens were positive for CMV infection by PCR. The incidence of congenital CMV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy was 23.5%.The risk of transmission of CMV from mother to fetus in early pregnancy is very high and potential CMV carriers may transmit CMV to their fetus in early pregnancy.
