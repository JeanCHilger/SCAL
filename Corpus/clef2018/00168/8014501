Transmission of human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type II by transfusion of HTLV-I-screened blood products. Blood donors have been screened for antibodies to human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I since December 1988. Screening for HTLV-II has been simultaneously done because of cross-reactivity between antibodies to the two viruses. Currently, < 1 in 10,000 US blood donors is positive for HTLV-I or -II. Lookback studies led to the identification of 6 HTLV-II-infected patients. Three received transfusions before introduction of HTLV-I screening tests, while the other 3 received blood components that tested negative for HTLV-I. The HTLV-II subtypes of each of 4 donor/recipient pairs, as determined by DNA amplification using polymerase chain reaction, were identical, supporting the view that transfusions were the source of infection. In conclusion, currently licensed blood donor screening tests for HTLV-I lack sensitivity for HTLV-II, and transfusion of blood from HTLV-II-infected donors that test negative on HTLV-I screening tests may result in infection.
