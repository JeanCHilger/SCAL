Laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy. The technique of laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy is described. This procedure was used to clear the common bile duct in 22 selected patients with documented choledocholithiasis. Indications for attempting laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy included multiple common bile duct stones, one or more common hepatic or intrahepatic stones, a dilated common bile duct requiring a drainage procedure, and suspicion of papillary stenosis. No major complications or mortality was observed. Mild hyperamylasemia was observed in two patients. However, both were asymptomatic, and serum amylase levels rapidly returned to normal. One patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit from a preoperative value of 39% to a postoperative value of 33%. Laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy added a mean of 17 min to the operative procedure. The mean postoperative stay was 1.4 days. The results of this study suggest that laparoscopic antegrade sphincterotomy may prove to be a useful modality in selected patients with complicated choledocholithiasis.
