Enterobacter cloacae cross-colonization in neonates demonstrated by ribotyping. The intestinal colonization by Enterobacter cloacae strains with a derepressed cephalosporinase was studied in a paediatric ward between February 1990 and January 1991. Environmental sampling was performed simultaneously. Fifty-two isolates were recovered from 200 neonates (stool, blood) and 14 strains were isolated from the neonatal environment. An epidemiological study based on the typing of 36 Enterobacter cloacae isolates was carried out using antibiotyping, biotyping and ribotyping methods. The isolates selected were from 21 neonates (24 isolates), the neonatal ward environment (8 isolates) and from other wards (4 isolates). Thirty-two isolates had the same antibiotic resistance pattern, corresponding to a derepressed cephalosporinase and resistance to the following aminoglycosides: kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin. No predominant biotyping pattern could be established. Ribotyping done with two endonucleases (EcoRI and BamHI) showed 28 Enterobacter cloacae isolates to have a single pattern. Ribotyping was the most discriminating method used in this study, permitting identification of cross-contamination with Enterobacter cloacae in the paediatric ward.
