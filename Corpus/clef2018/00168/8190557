A comparative study of human immunodeficiency virus culture, polymerase chain reaction and anti-human immunodeficiency virus immunoglobulin A antibody detection in the diagnosis during early infancy of vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection. The infection status of 91 infants born to mothers with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was determined. Twenty-eight (31%) infants had confirmed HIV infection and 63 (69%) had seroreverted to HIV and lack evidence of infection. During the first 6 months of life HIV culture had a sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of HIV infection of 80 and 100%, respectively. False negative HIV cultures were observed in only 7 of 35 specimens, 6 from among the 12 infected infants tested at birth. The sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of HIV were 95 and 93% respectively. A single false negative PCR test result was observed among the 19 tests performed on specimens from HIV-infected infants. False positive PCR test results were observed occasionally throughout the first 6 months of life. Detection of HIV-specific IgA antibody lacked diagnostic sensitivity positive test results were observed in only 53% of specimens obtained from infected infants. Culture and PCR detection offer excellent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of HIV infection during the first 6 months of life
