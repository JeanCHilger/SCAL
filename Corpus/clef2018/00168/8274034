Characterization and analysis of human papillomaviruses of skin warts. We analysed human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in 61 tissue specimens of skin warts of Taiwanese patients by DNA hybridization. The prevalence of HPV infection was 69% by Southern blot hybridization. The typing of HPVs was performed by dot blot hybridization under highly stringent conditions with each probe separately. The prevalence of HPV-1, 2/3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 16 and 18 in skin warts was 13, 7, 16, 2, 0, 5, 2 and 8%, respectively. Chi-squared analysis revealed that there was a correlation between HPV type and copy number. Most HPV-4-induced warts were verruca vulgaris. HPV-1 DNA was detected in verruca plantaris and verruca vulgaris. No specific histopathological features were found to be indicative of the presence or absence of HPV, or of the various types of HPV infection.
