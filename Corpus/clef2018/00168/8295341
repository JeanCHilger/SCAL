Detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral leukocytes by AMPLICOR HIV-1 test kit. AMPLICOR HIV-1 test kits, which had been developed as an HIV-1 provirus detection test by PCR method, have been evaluated for its clinical diagnostic application. Sixty-six of HIV-1 antibody positive and 67 of HIV-1 antibody negative blood samples derived from hemophiliacs, who had received blood products, have been tested by AMPLICOR HIV-1. All of the results from AMPLICOR HIV-1 were consistent with those from antibody test and clinical aspects. Thirty-nine of HIV-1 antibody positive samples have been tested by AMPLICOR HIV-1 and virus isolation (culture method). Twelve of 39 (30.8%) were positive by virus isolation, and 39 of 39 (100%) were positive by AMPLICOR HIV-1. Two of new born infants from HIV-1 sero-positive mothers were tested by AMPLICOR HIV-1, and the result suggested that the kit would be useful for diagnosis of infants from sero-positive mothers. Based on these studies, AMPLICOR HIV-1 is considered as useful clinical diagnostic for HIV-1 proviral DNA detection.
