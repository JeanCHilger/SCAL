Ganciclovir therapy for symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus infection in infants: a two-regimen experience. The efficacy of two regimens of ganciclovir therapy was evaluated in 12 infants with symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Virologic investigations included culture from urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid, detection of CMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction, and detection of CMV class-specific antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) by enzyme immunoassays. Six infants were given ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks (group 1) the other six infants were given 7.5 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks and 10 mg/kg three times weekly for 3 months (group 2). In group 1 the CMV cultures of specimens from three infants became sterile
