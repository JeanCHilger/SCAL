Serological response to rotavirus infection in newborn infants. We report the identification of rotavirus in stools of newborn infants at the "Hospital Materno Infantil de Caricuao" (HMIC) as well as the infants' serological responses to various rotavirus strains. The serological responses of another group of rotavirus-positive neonates studied previously at the "Maternidad Concepcion Palacios" (MCP) hospital was also evaluated. Fifty-four of 266 (20%) newborns examined at HMIC shed rotavirus. The infection rate was higher among infants admitted to the nursery (75%) than in those "rooming in" with their mothers (7%) (P < .01). Eleven of the 54 neonates (20%) had diarrhea seven of them experienced mild, short-lived episodes, whereas five had frequent diarrhea bouts or diarrhea lasting for over 3 days
