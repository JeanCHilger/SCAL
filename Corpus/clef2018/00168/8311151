The diagnosis of brain lesions in newborns with an intrauterine herpetic infection. Enzyme immunoassay and DNA hybridization technique were used to diagnose herpetic infection. Blood and liquor antiherpetic antibodies were detected, with anticytomegalovirus antibodies used as reference ones. Intrauterine herpetic infection was detected in 61.5% of 91 risk group newborns. We should like to emphasize that two laboratory tests should be used to diagnose an intrauterine herpetic infection in newborns. Detection of antiviral antibodies in the CSF is a valuable method for the diagnosis and differentiation of brain involvement in intrauterine herpetic infection.
