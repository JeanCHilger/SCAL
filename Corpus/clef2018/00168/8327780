rRNA gene restriction patterns as an epidemiological marker in nosocomial outbreaks of Staphylococcus aureus infections. rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotyping) were compared with phage typing, serotyping, enterotoxins and exfoliatin production in the analysis of 26 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from two different nosocomial outbreaks. Total DNA was cleaved by EcoRI restriction endonuclease. After agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern transfer, the hybridization of the membranes was done with radiolabelled 16S rRNA gene from Bacillus subtilis inserted into a plasmid vector. Six to 13 fragments were visualized. A core of common fragments was discerned for all strains tested. A full correlation between ribotyping and conventional markers was observed in only one of the outbreaks studied. In both outbreaks, ribotyping proved helpful in characterizing otherwise untypable strains.
