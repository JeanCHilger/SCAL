Comparison of arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and cell envelope protein electrophoresis for analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii and A. junii outbreaks. Two successive Acinetobacter outbreaks in a neonatal intensive care unit were studied with arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), cell envelope protein electrophoresis (protein fingerprinting) and antibiotic susceptibility testing. AP-PCR fingerprinting and protein fingerprinting yielded identical clustering of the isolates studied. Susceptibility test results were useful for rapid recognition of the outbreaks, but clustering of several isolates was different from the clustering obtained with AP-PCR fingerprinting and protein fingerprinting. Typing results indicated that the two outbreaks, which occurred at a three-month interval, were each caused by a single strain, and that both strains differed from the strains prevailing in the hospital. The strain of one outbreak was identified as A. junii, a species commonly not involved in outbreaks. A. baumannii isolates collected from different departments of this hospital during a period of four years clustered into only five different types. Moreover, strains from different departments of a second hospital belonged to the type prevailing in the first hospital, although there were no apparent connections between the two institutions. This may indicate that only a limited number of strains of the A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex are involved in nosocomial outbreaks.
