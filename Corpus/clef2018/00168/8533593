Pancreatic ascites in children. We report on three children with pancreatic ascites confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) and treated with surgery. The children presented with ascites, malnutrition and severe weight loss. Pancreatic ascites was diagnosed by elevated ascitic fluid and serum amylase levels. ERCP demonstrated a pseudocyst and the site of disruption of the pancreatic duct, but not the etiology of the pancreatitis. Following a period of nutritional support, surgery was carried out. Two of the children underwent a stented transgastric drainage of the pseudocyst a recurrent pseudocyst in one of the children required a revision cystojejunostomy. The third child was treated with a Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy. All the children are pain-free and without ascites and are doing well on long-term follow-up. We conclude that pancreatic ascites must be considered in the differential diagnosis of intractable ascites in children. An ERCP is essential in planning management and cystoenterostomy is the definitive treatment.
