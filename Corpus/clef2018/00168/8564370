Colonization factors of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) from residents of northern Egypt. Infection caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) poses a serious health problem to children in developing countries. Colonization of the small intestinal mucosa by ETEC strains is mediated by antigenically specific fimbriae, also known as colonization factor antigens (CFA). The importance of this study arises from reports that active and passive immunization with ETEC strains harboring CFAs induced protective immunity against diarrhea in animal models with preformed antibodies. In humans, ETEC containing CFA/I, II, III and IV have been identified. The aim of this study was to define CFAs of ETEC isolated in Alexandria, Egypt. One hundred and seven ETEC isolates from 132 human residents in Alexandria, Egypt were isolated during a birth cohort study. ETEC isolates were screened for heat labile (LT) and heat stable (ST) toxins using a 32P oligonucleotide hybridization probe and a GM1 ELISA. These isolates were examined using monoclonal antibodies against CFA/I, II, III, IV, and against the putative colonization antigens PCF0159 and PCF0166, CS 7 and CS 17. CFAs were found in 48% of ETEC strains. CFA/I was found in 18% of the strains, CFA/II in 10% and CFA/IV in 14%. CFA III was not found. All fifteen strains expressing CFA/IV expressed CS6 and produced ST. CFA/IV was not found in non-ST producing strains, while CFA/I was absent in ST-only producing strains.
