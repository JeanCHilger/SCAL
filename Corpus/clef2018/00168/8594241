Neonatal characteristics in rapidly progressive perinatally acquired HIV-1 disease. The French Pediatric HIV Infection Study Group. To identify clinical and laboratory parameters at birth that are associated with the rapidly progressive form of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease in children born to infected mothers.Multicenter, prospective study of infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers.A total of 62 obstetric and pediatric centers in France.Of 1386 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers at least 18 months before the cutoff date, 267 were infected.
