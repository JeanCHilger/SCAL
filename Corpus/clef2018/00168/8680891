Mother-to-child transmission of human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II) in Gabon: a prospective follow-up of 4 years. For 4 years. we determined the mode and risk of mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-I in a prospective cohort of 34 children born to seropositive mothers in Franceville, Gabon. We also determined the prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I/II in siblings born to seropositive mothers. Antibodies to HTLV-I/II were detected by Western blot, and the proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The risk of seroconversion to anti-HTLV-I for the 4 years of follow-up was 17.5 percent. Anti-HTLV-I/II and proviral DNA were only detected after age 18 months. We observed a seroprevalence rate of 15 percent among the siblings born to HTLV-I/II seropositive mothers. Furthermore, we report a case of mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-II infection in a population of HTLV-II-infected pregnant women that is emerging in Gabon. The lack of detection of HTLV-I/II proviral DNA in cord blood and amniotic fluid and, furthermore, the late seroconversion observed in the children indirectly indicate that mother-to-child transmission occurred postnatally, probably through breast milk.
