HIV-1 proviral DNA polymerase chain reaction detection in chorionic villi after exclusion of maternal contamination by variable number of tandem repeats analysis. The study of the placental HIV infection in cases of seropositive pregnant women after exclusion of maternal contamination of chorionic villi samples by variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis.We studied 30 HIV-positive women: 17 terminated their pregnancy (11 in the first trimester and six in the second) and 13 delivered at term (one was a twin gestation). We selected chorionic villi and ruled out maternal contamination by VNTR analysis. DNA from chorionic villi and cord and maternal blood were tested for HIV by PCR. All infants underwent a paediatric follow-up.All maternal blood samples tested positive for HIV-1 by polymerase chain reaction. No maternal contamination was revealed and HIV was found in six out of 11 first trimester placentas, in all second trimester samples, and in 10 out of 14 at term. Cord blood tested positive in all second trimester cases and in seven out of 14 liveborns. In no case was HIV found in cord blood without infection of the corresponding placenta conversely, three placentas tested positive but cord blood was negative. Two infants were HIV-positive, 11 were uninfected (one case was lost to follow-up).Our study indicates that HIV-1 can infect the placenta from first trimester onwards. HIV was found in two-thirds of our cord blood samples but it is possible that some viral DNA in cord blood may have come from infected placental cells. Additional studies are needed to assess the source of HIV in cord blood and the possible contribution of placental or maternal cells infected with HIV to vertical transmission of the virus.
