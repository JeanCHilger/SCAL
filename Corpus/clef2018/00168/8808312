Development of a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assay for detection of Mycoplasma hominis. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay was developed for the detection of Mycoplasma hominis. This assay generates a 152-bp PCR product which was part of an initial 471-bp M. hominis genomic DNA fragment. The 471-bp DNA fragment was shown by hybridization analysis to be unique for M. hominis. The PCR assay can amplify as few as 18 molecules of target DNA. This diagnostic assay offers potential for wide clinical application as it is rapid and can be successfully performed on crude sample preparations from a variety of media or biopsies. The use of this assay should aid in defining the aetiologic and pathologic roles played by M. hominis and thereby benefit patients.
