Thermostability of purified human pancreatic alpha-amylase is increased by the combination of Ca2+ and human serum albumin. Pancreatic fluid from a patient with a post operative pancreatic fistula was used to isolate human alpha-amylase by means of acarbose affinity chromatography. Amylase thermostability was measured in 4 solutions: (1) EDTA-dialyzed (2) dialyzed solution plus 0.15 mmol/l (1.0 g/dl) human serum albumin
