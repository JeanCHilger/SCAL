Neonatal rotavirus infection in Bangladesh: strain characterization and risk factors for nosocomial infection. Rotavirus (RV) diarrhea is an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh and is responsible for 24% of hospital admissions for diarrhea in children from 3 months to 2 years of age. However, the prevalence of neonatal RV infections and characteristics of RV strains infecting neonates have not been explored in Bangladesh.We investigated neonates at six hospitals in Bangladesh to determine the prevalence of neonatal RV infection, to identify risk factors for infection and to characterize neonatal RV strains by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Of 381 neonates screened at 6 hospitals 61 of 146 infants (42%) at 2 hospitals in Dhaka were RV-positive. Of these 62% were detected within the first 5 days of life. We found an increased risk for neonatal RV infection among infants whose mothers reported no handwashing during care of the neonate (P = 0.03). Analysis of RV strains in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-positive specimens identified P[6]G4 and P[6]G1 genotypes to be most common 7% (2 of 27) of strains were nontypable. A concurrent analysis of RV strains circulating in Bangladesh suggested that RV genotypes infecting neonates had a distinct P genotype, because most community strains were P-nontypable compared with neonatal strains, which carried the P[6] genotype.Hospitalized neonates in Dhaka have increased risk for infection with RV as early as the first week of life with strains having the unusual P[6] genotype. Our findings confirm studies in India showing that neonatal RV infection can be common and may occur with strains distinct from those circulating in the community. Neonatal RV infections could alter a child's response to the RV vaccine as well as the calculation of RV vaccine efficacy in these populations.
