Significance of placental damage in vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. The significance of physical breaches of the trophoblastic layer of the placenta in transmission of HIV from mother to infant was evaluated in 17 HIV-infected pregnant women. Samples of peripheral blood were obtained from the women during pregnancy and at delivery, at which time a small piece of placental tissue was obtained from a random site and immediately placed into fixative. Blood samples were obtained from infants at or shortly after birth and thereafter at approximately 3-month intervals, until the age of 18 months, in order to determine their HIV infection status. HIV RNA and p24 antigen were quantified in maternal plasma and CD4 cells enumerated. Paediatric diagnosis was conducted using polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation, detection of p24 antigen, and measurement of class-specific antibodies. Placental damage was quantified and evaluated using transmission electron microscopy. Maternal viral load was low, with a mean RNA copy number of 8,237 per millilitre of plasma (range 230-37,233 copies/ml). Only two women were p24-antigenaemic, and CD4 numbers ranged from 0.09 to 2.8 x 10(9)/l. There was evidence of breaks in the trophoblastic surface to the depth of the basement membrane in all 17 placentas, and perivillous fibrinoid deposits were also observed to a varying degree in all samples. However, none of the 13 infants available for follow-up had evidence of infection with HIV. Superficial damage to the trophoblastic surface of the placenta, with exposure of the basement membrane and potential exposure of CD4-expressing cells, does not appear to be a significant factor in the transmission of HIV from mother to infant during pregnancy.
