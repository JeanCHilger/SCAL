The nPCR detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis in children hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from children admitted with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, were screened for Chlamydia pneumoniae, and C. trachomatis. The nested PCR was found to be more sensitive that amplified the DNA extracts of up to two elementary bodies of the test strains. Using this technique, C. pneumoniae was detected in two (1.3%), and C. trachomatis in 26 17.1%) of the 152 samples tested. This study indicated C. pneumoniae infections to be unusual in children with bronchiolitis.
