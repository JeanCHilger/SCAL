Development of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and its use in a prospective surveillance study. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is one of several arenaviruses that are pathogenic for humans, causes encephalitis and meningitis in man. In this study, single-stage and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed that targeted the GPC and N genes of LCMV. Both assays detected < 1 TCID50 unit of LCMV. These assays were used to measure the incidence of LCMV infection by testing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples with > or = 10 leukocytes/microl collected over 1 year from patients undergoing lumbar puncture for diagnostic reasons at two Birmingham hospitals. Samples were tested for the presence of LCMV RNA by using the RT- PCR assay and for LCMV-specific IgM antibody by using an ELISA assay. None of the specimens collected from 813 patients was positive by either assay. Although no cases of acute infection were detected, 4% (11/272) of serum collected from a subset of patients was positive for LCMV-specific IgG. A significantly greater rate of seropositivity was found among subjects over 60 years of age (9.4% P < 0.025) than was found in younger subjects (2.4% at 30-59 years of age
