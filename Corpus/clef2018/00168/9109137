Role of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis in development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very low birth weight infants. To investigate the relationship between Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis colonization of the very low birth weight infant and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).Endotracheal and/or nasopharyngeal aspirates and clinical data were obtained prospectively from 108 infants with a birth weight of < 1501 g and analyzed for U. urealyticum and C. trachomatis by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).U. urealyticum was detected by culture in 40 (37%) infants and by PCR in 49 (45%) infants on at least one occasion. BPD was present at 28 days in 26 of 40 (65%) U. urealyticum culture-positive infants and 39 of 68 (57%) culture-negative infants (relative risk (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.54 P = 0.538). BPD was present at 28 days in 34 of 49 (69%) U. urealyticum PCR-positive infants and in 31 of 59 (53%) PCR-negative infants (RR 1.32, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.79C. trachomatis was found infrequently in the airways of premature very low birth weight infants. U. urealyticum was frequently detected but its presence was not significant with regard to development of BPD, duration of ventilatory support, oxygen dependency and length of hospital stay.
