Detection of respiratory syncytial virus from clinical specimens: comparison between reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and tissue culture. RT-PCR was compared with tissue culture to detect RSV from nasopharyngeal aspirates. RT-PCR was more sensitive and specific than tissue culture method. RT-PCR has sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97%, respectively. The results indicate that RT-PCR can be used for detection of RSV in clinical specimens.
