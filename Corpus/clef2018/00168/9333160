Utility of a polymerase chain reaction diagnostic system in a study of the epidemiology of shigellosis among dysentery patients, family contacts, and well controls living in a shigellosis-endemic area. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic methods have rarely been used in epidemiologic studies of Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) infections. In this study, amplification of the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene by PCR and standard culture methods was used to identify Shigella species or EIEC among 154 patients with dysentery, 154 age-matched controls, and family contacts in Thailand. The ipaH PCR system increased the detection of Shigella species and EIEC from 58% to 79% among patients with dysentery and from 6% to 22% among 527 family contacts 75% of infections in family members were asymptomatic. Detection of the ipaH gene was statistically associated with dysentery. Household contacts of patients with shigellosis diagnosed only by PCR had significantly higher rates of shigellosis than household contacts of patients who did not have Shigella or EIEC infections. Detection of the ipaH gene by PCR is far more sensitive than detection by standard culture and is highly correlated with evidence of Shigella transmission among family contacts.
