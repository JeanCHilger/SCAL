Difficulties in evaluating urinalysis following combined pancreas-kidney transplantation. Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation has been introduced in the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes and renal failure 20 years ago. By 1985 374 combined pancreas-kidney transplantations had been reported to the International Pancreas Transplant Registries. Surgical drainage of the transplanted exocrine pancreas into the urinary bladder solves most of the postoperative problems encountered with the exocrine secretions. Furthermore, monitoring of pancreatic enzyme (amylase) activity in urine has been shown to be useful in diagnosis of rejection of the pancreatic graft. However, little attention has been paid to the biochemical consequences of high activities of proteolytic pancreatic enzymes on the determination of urinary proteins. The present case illustrates the difficulties in interpreting proteinuria in patients with combined pancreas-renal transplant with pancreaticocystostomia. In the propositus, interpretation of the urinary protein electrophoresis is hampered by the presence of pancreatic juice proteins and peptides originating from digestion of proteins by activated pancreatic enzymes. Results of immunochemically determined marker proteins ([micro]albumin, transferrin, beta 2-microglobulin) are unreliable due to digestion by pancreatic enzymes.
