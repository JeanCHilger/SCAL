Pancreatic pseudocyst propagating into retroperitoneum and mediastinum. The extrahepatic pseudocysts of pancreatic origin sometimes propagate into mediastinum and retroperitoneum. A large pseudocyst of pancreatic origin propagating into the mediastinum up to the aortic arch is published. The surgical intervention has been urged by the dislocation of the heart, by the danger of autodigestion of the mediastinal aorta and by the danger of rupture. Attention is directed to the external drainage operation which is suitable for emptying of the pseudocyst not independently from the ripeness of pseudocyst wall and the characteristics of the pseudocyst content. Should the time short after the exacerbation and should the amylase content high in the cyst, the immediate result of external drainage better and reliable safe.
