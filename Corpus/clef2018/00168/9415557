Percutaneous management of a bladder-drained pancreas transplant pseudocyst by a transcystic approach. We describe a 35-year-old male type 1 diabetic who underwent a cadaveric combined kidney-bladder-drained pancreas transplant with a duodenocystostomy for exocrine drainage who developed a large pelvic pseudocyst associated with a dilated pancreatic duct and an elevated serum amylase level.Due to the risk of surgical revision and the possibility of creating a cutaneous fistula with conventional percutaneous drainage, a pseudocyst-to-bladder drainage was performed. After the procedure, the catheter was capped to allow drainage of the pancreatic secretions into the bladder.After drainage, the patient's serum amylase and lipase normalized along with resolution of the pseudocyst. The tube was removed after 19 weeks with no evidence of a recurrent pseudocyst and a normal serum amylase level.The percutaneous pseudocyst-cystostomy obviated the need for surgical revision of the exocrine gland drainage and thus eliminated the morbidity and the potential risk of graft loss associated with such surgery.
