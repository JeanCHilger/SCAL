Application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of DNA-HCMV in cerebrospinal fluid of neonates and infants with cytomegalovirus infection. The goal of the work was to prove the usefulness of PCR for detection of DNA-HCMV in cerebrospinal fluid of the infected newborns and infants and to compare our results with clinical diagnosis. The studied group consisted of 24 newborns and infants with HCMV infection (presence of DNA-HCMV in urine and blood, presence of specific IgM, IgG antibodies in serum, and clinical symptoms). Among 12 children with symptoms from central nervous system, DNA-HCMV was detected in CSF of 11 patients. Additionally DNA-HCMV was found in cerebrospinal fluid of 2 children IgM, IgG anti CMV positive but without CNS symptoms. Extraction of DNA from pellet was the most effective method of DNA preparation from CSF for PCR reaction. Final results were obtained approximately 7-8 hours after taking the samples for examination. Our results suggest that PCR technique as a highly specific method is very helpful for the detection of DNA-HCMV in CSF of children with CNS symptoms of disease.
