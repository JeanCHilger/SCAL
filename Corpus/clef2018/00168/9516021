Intrauterine adenoviral infection associated with fetal non-immune hydrops. A 27-week fetus with hydrops fetalis associated with fetal tachyarrhythmia and adenovirus infection was documented by viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The fetal tachyarrhythmia was converted to normal sinus rhythm by maternal pharmacological therapy with digoxin. Subsequently, resolution of the hydropic changes occurred and a viable normal-appearing preterm fetus at 29 weeks' gestation was delivered after preterm labour. This case demonstrates the first documented report of intrauterine adenovirus-associated fetal tachyarrhythmia and hydrops fetalis.
