Early operative intervention for urologic complications of kidney-pancreas transplantation. Bladder drainage of exocrine secretions during pancreas transplantation can be associated with significant complications. We present a proactive approach to these complications consisting of early cystoenteric conversion (CEC). Although 81 patients underwent pancreas transplant between March 1985 and May 1995 26 (32%) required CEC. Complications presented as urine leaks, other complications, and refractory metabolic acidosis. There were 13 patients who presented with a urine leak: 12 with acute abdominal pain, and 1 asymptomatic. Serum amylase and creatinine rose a mean of 823 IU and 0.61 mg/dl, respectively. The interval to CEC ranged from 2 to 45 months. One patient died of fungal sepsis. Postoperative complications included duodenojejunal anastomotic bleed (n = 1), negative relaparotomy (n = 1), myocardial infarction (n = 1), graft pancreatitis (n = 1), and wound infection (n = 1). Twelve patients presented with other complications: three women with cystitis (n = 2) or hematuria (n = 1), and nine men with urethritis (n = 6), scrotal edema (n = 2), or dysuria (n = 1), The interval to conversion ranged from 1 to 108 months. There were no deaths. One patient required relaparotomy for anastomotic bleed. One patient was converted because of refractory metabolic acidosis. Admissions and inpatient days were significantly reduced. Overall mortality was 3.8%, morbidity 23.1%, and graft salvage rate 96.1%. Leak-associated mortality was 7.7%, morbidity 38.5%, and graft salvage rate 92.3%. For other complications the mortality was 0, morbidity 7.7%, and graft salvage rate 100%. CEC is a safe, effective treatment for urologic complications of pancreas transplantation. Morbidity and mortality were acceptable
