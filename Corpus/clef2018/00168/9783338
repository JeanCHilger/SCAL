Transplacental transmission of hepatitis C virus in HIV-negative mothers. The aim of this work was to evaluate transplacental transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-negative pregnant women who were HCV-PCR-positive, and also to determine the serotypes of the virus in these cases. Therefore, 767 pregnant women were screened for anti-HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HIV antibodies. HCV PCR was performed for HCV-positive women. Those who were PCR-positive were tested for anti-HCV IgM. Neonates of PCR-positive mothers were tested for virus transmission by the PCR test. Virus serotyping was done for mothers and neonates. Anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 105 out of 767 (13.7%) pregnant women. PCR was positive in 18 out of 67 HCV-positive women (26.9%). Transplacental transmission occurred in 11.1% of HIV-negative pregnant women. HCV type 4 predominates in Egypt (83.3%). Mothers who are PCR-positive and have high aspartate aminotransferase and positive anti-HCV IgM are most likely to transmit HCV to their babies.
