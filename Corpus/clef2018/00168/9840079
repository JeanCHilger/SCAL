Long-term effects of transduodenal sphincterotomy: symptoms and hepatobiliary function. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is widely used in treating common bile duct stones, but the long-term effects of destroying the sphincter of Oddi are not known. This study investigated the long-term (15-20 years) effects of transduodenal sphincterotomy on gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatobiliary function in a retrospective controlled study.Between 1974 and 1977, choledocholithotomy was performed in 131 patients either transduodenally (60 patients) or via choledochotomy (71 patients). For the retrospective part of the study, all hospital records, death certificates and autopsy reports were reviewed. Twenty-seven patients who could be reached and volunteered to participate (12 and 15, respectively) were re-examined. In the re-examination part of the study, a standard questionnaire interview, laboratory tests, quantitative cholescintigraphy and ultrasonography were performed.The hospital mortality for the primary operations was 0.8%, 0% for the transduodenal sphinterotomies and 2% for the choledochotomies the difference was not significant. During the follow-up period, no significant differences could be seen in the death rate or in the causes of death between the study groups. During re-examination, flatulence was found to be more common in the choledochotomy subgroup (7/15 vs 2/12, p<0.05). In the laboratory tests, conjugated bilirubin and serum aspartate amino transferase levels were higher in the transduodenal subgroup than in the choledochotomy subgroup (3.3 umol/L, SD 0.4 vs 2.2 umol/L, SD 0.2, p<0.02Transduodenal sphincterotomy results in decreased flatulence and enhanced common bile duct drainage, even in the long-term period, but slightly higher serum liver funtion tests, when compared to supraduodenal choledochotomy.
