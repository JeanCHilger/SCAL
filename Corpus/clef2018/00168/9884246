Prevention and preemptive therapy of postransplant lymphoproliferative disease in pediatric liver recipients. We have previously reported a 10% incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in pediatric patients receiving first liver grafts and primarily immunosuppressed with tacrolimus. To decrease the incidence of PTLD, we developed a protocol utilizing preemptive intravenous ganciclovir in high-risk recipients (i.e., donor (D)+, recipient (R)-), combined with serial monitoring of peripheral blood for Epstein Barr virus (EBV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Consecutive pediatric recipients of a first liver graft were immunosuppressed with oral tacrolimus (both induction and maintenance), and low-dose prednisone. EBV serologies were obtained at the time of orthotopic liver transplant in recipients and donors. Recipients were divided into groups: group 1, high-risk (D+R-), and group 2, low-risk (D+R+ D-R-Forty children who had survived greater than 2 months were enrolled. There were 18 children in group 1 (high-risk mean age of 14+/-15 months and mean follow-up time of 243+/-149 days) and 22 children in group 2 (low-riskSince instituting this protocol, the overall incidence of PTLD has fallen from 10% to 5% for children receiving primary tacrolimus therapy after OLT. No high-risk pediatric liver recipient treated preemptively with intravenous ganciclovir developed PTLD. Both children with PTLD were less than 1 year at OLT and considered low-risk. However, their positive EBV antibody titers may have been maternal in origin and not have offered long-term protection. Serial monitoring of EBV-PCR after pediatric OLT is recommended to decrease the risk of PTLD by allowing early detection of EBV infection, which is then managed by decreasing immunosuppression and continuing intravenous ganciclovir.
