Distal splenorenal shunt with splenopancreatic disconnection for portal hypertension in biliary atresia. This study evaluated the long-term effects of distal splenorenal shunt with splenopancreatic disconnection (DSRS-SPD) on portal hypertension (PH) in biliary atresia (BA) patients. Five patients with BA underwent DSRS-SPD at the age of 3.3 to 8.5 years. They had been free from jaundice after hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE) however, they gradually developed gastroesophageal varices and hypersplenism. Portal venous pressure after anastomosis was 37.2 +/- 6.1 cmH2O, as high as that before anastomosis (37.8 +/- 3.3 cmH2O). Postoperatively, liver function tests became worse within 2 weeks
