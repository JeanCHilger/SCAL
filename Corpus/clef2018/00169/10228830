Evaluation of major hepatic resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study is to clarify the significance of a major hepatectomy for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Seventy-eight patients with solitary HCC measuring less than 3 cm in diameter, whose liver function was considered sufficient to tolerate a right hepatic lobectomy, were classified into 2 groups consisting of: a major group (n = 18), who underwent a major hepatectomy (2 segments or more) and, a minor group (n = 60), who underwent a hepatectomy including one segment or less. The early post-operative outcome and the long-term outcomes, comprising patient survival as well as disease-free survival, were compared. In addition, the post-operative long-term changes in liver function tests and esophageal variceal occurrence were also compared.In the post-operative mortality and morbidity, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. However, 1 patient in the major group unexpectedly died of liver failure 6 months after operation. No significant difference was observed in patient survival and disease-free survival. The platelet count in the major group tended to decline more rapidly than that in the minor group. Furthermore, 1 patient in the major group demonstrated risky esophageal varices 29 months after operation, which had to be treated by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy.Based on the above findings, a major hepatectomy is therefore not recommended for patients with solitary small HCC measuring 3 cm or less in diameter.
