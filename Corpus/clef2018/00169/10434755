A case of progressive systemic sclerosis complicated by idiopathic portal hypertension with severe anemia. A 44-year-old woman had been diagnosed with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) at the age of 39 years old and mild pancytopenia was noted at that time. At the age of 41 years symptoms of dry mouth appeared. In April 1997, anemia was in progress (Hb 5.8 g/dl) and severe esophageal varices were found by gastrointestinal fiber scope, and massive splenomegaly by abdominal CT. Serological examination was negative for hepatitis virus and for anti-mitochondrial antibody. In addition, Indocyanine Green test was normal and typical findings of liver cirrhosis were not demonstrated by CT scan. Also, the bone marrow result was normal. Therefore hypersplenism with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) was suggested and the patient was referred for splenectomy with the aim of improving the pancytopenia. The weight of the spleen was 2100 g and the pressure of the portal vein was measured at 390 mm H2O. The diagnosis of IPH was determined because pathologically there were no findings for liver cirrhosis. After splenectomy, pancytopenia was remarkably improved (Hb 9.6 g/dl). Consequently, this case was diagnosed as IPH complicated with PSS and Sj√∂gren syndrome.
