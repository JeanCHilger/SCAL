Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma with marked liver deformity and secondary Budd-Chiari syndrome: pathological and radiological correlation. A case of malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver in a 48-year-old woman with severe portal hypertension and marked deformity of the liver is presented. This woman had a history of mild liver dysfunction since the age of 30 years, and abdominal distention, esophageal varices, splenomegaly and ascites since October 1996. Imaging examinations revealed liver deformity with severe atrophy of the left lobe and the anterior segment of the right lobe. Celiac arteriography showed narrowing and upward deviation of the proper hepatic artery, and occlusion of the left and right anterior hepatic arteries. Since March 1997, hepatic venography showed stenosis in the right hepatic vein truncus. Budd-Chiari syndrome was clinically diagnosed. She died in June 1997. The autopsy disclosed massive tumor embolism in the left and right anterior portal branches, few in the hepatic artery, and occlusion of the left and right anterior hepatic arteries. The extensive tumor embolism resulted in portal hypertension, and atrophy of the left lobe. The anterior segment of the right lobe was probably caused by the occlusion of both the hepatic arteries and the portal veins. The posterior segment of the right lobe, without massive tumor embolism in its portal branch, appeared hypertrophic.
