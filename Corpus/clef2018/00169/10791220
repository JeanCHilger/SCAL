Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt versus distal splenorenal shunt--a comparative study. No general consensus exists regarding the proper surgical management of recurrent variceal bleeding due to hepatic cirrhosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and distal splenorenal shunt are increasingly being performed in the management of these patients. The present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy, complications and survival rate of these two procedures.Sixty-seven patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis of Child-Pugh's class A (n = 22) and class B (n = 45) with recurrent variceal bleeding not controlled by conservative means underwent either transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (n = 35) or a distal splenorenal shunt operation (n = 32). These patients were followed for a mean of 887 +/- 189 days. Both groups were compared with respect to the rates of survival, recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding, encephalopathy, ascitis, shunt blockade and other relevant biochemical parameters.Patients who underwent a distal splenorenal shunt operation had lower rates of recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding (6.25% vs. 25.71%), encephalopathy (18.75% vs. 42.86%) shunt blockade (6.25% vs. 68.57%) and lower mean fasting blood ammonia levels (56.70 +/- 7.10 mumol/L vs. 61.70 +/- 5.70 mumol/L). However the rate of ascitis was higher amongst these patients (40.63% vs. 11.43%). There was no significant difference in the midterm survival rates between these groups (81.25% vs. 80.00%). Both procedures were effective in controlling functional renal failure, splenomegaly and features of hypersplenism.Distal splenorenal shunt operation is a better therapeutic option than transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for control of recurrent variceal bleeding due to hepatic cirrhosis.
