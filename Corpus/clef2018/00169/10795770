Endoscopic, ultrasonographic, and US-Doppler parameters as indicators of variceal bleeding in patients with schistosomiasis. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices is a potentially deadly complication in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. The aim of this study is to establish indicators of variceal bleeding. We studied 40 patients with compensated hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and varices, analyzing four endoscopic (variceal size, red color signs, fundic varices, and congestive gastropathy), nine ultrasonographic (right and left hepatic lobe size, periportal and gallbladder wall thickness, portal and splenic veins diameter, spleen longitudinal axis and volume, and presence of collateral circulation), and five US-Doppler parameters (portal and splenic veins velocity and flow and portal vein congestion index). Patients were divided in two groups according to previous history of variceal bleeding. The group with bleeding episodes was again divided in two groups: with and without treatment, namely endoscopic sclerotherapy. All endoscopic parameters and two ultrasonographic (periportal thickness and portal vein diameter) were statistically different between the groups with and without previous bleeding. The likelihood index, adopted to determine the best parameters related to previous bleeding showed that the most important combinations are: gastropathy and red signs followed by portal vein diameter and variceal size. In conclusion, although aware of the limits of the statistical analysis due to the small number of patients, our results demonstrated that endoscopic and US parameters (isolated or combined) can identify patients with a high risk of variceal bleeding, allowing physicians to optimize prophylactic therapy.
