Endoscopic variceal ligation combined with partial splenic embolization: preliminary clinical results. Endoscopic variceal ligation combined with partial splenic embolization (EVL-PSE) was performed in a group of 13 patients with esophageal variceal bleeding and hypersplenism due to portal hypertension from January 1997 to March 1998. PSE was performed one to two weeks before or one week after initial EVL, and a range of 30% to 60% of the splenic parenchyma was embolized. Repeated EVL was performed at two week intervals until the varices were eradicated. Active bleeding in the nine patients was successfully controlled and all the varices of the 13 patients were eradicated after EVL-PSE. Eradication of the varices required two to five(mean 3.1) EVL sessions, follow-up ranging from 2 to 16 months(mean 6.9 months). In all but one case, no rebleeding occurred. All patients after PSE showed a good response on peripheral blood cell count and reduction of splenomegaly. No major complication or death related to the combination therapy was observed. Preliminary results in this study show that this combination therapy may result in more rapid eradication of the varices and reduce rebleeding after endoscopic variceal ligation. However, more data and studies may be necessary for further evaluation.
