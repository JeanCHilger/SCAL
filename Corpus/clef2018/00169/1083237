Esophageal varices in Felty's syndrome: A case report and review of the literature. A case of upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage secondary to esophageal varices in a patient with Felty's syndrome prompted a review of the pathogenesis and treatment of this condition. Six previously reported cases of this association were found. The clinical picture is that of long-standing rheumatoid arthritis with severe articular and extraarticular manifestations including splenomegaly, depression of the blood elements, mild liver function abnormalities, portal hypertension without cirrhosis or portal vein obstruction, an elevated splenic blood flow, and a reduction in portal hypertension by simple splenectomy. The presence of portal hypertension with varices may be another indication of splenectomy in patients with Felty's syndrome.
