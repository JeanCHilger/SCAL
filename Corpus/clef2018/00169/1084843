Massive splenic infarction in cirrhosis: report of a case with spontaneous disappearance of hypersplenism. A cirrhotic patient with massive splenic infarction is described. Celiac angiography showed normally opacified splenic artery and vein and a markedly enlarged spleen with large avascular zones. Splenic infarction was associated with the spontaneous disappearance of a syndrome of hypersplenism. The spleen was surgically removed. Histological examination showed multiple thromboses of the small arterial and venous vessels. The cause of this infarct remained unclear.
