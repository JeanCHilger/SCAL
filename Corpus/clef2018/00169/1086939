Subcutaneous transposition of the spleen: an experimental and clinical study (author's transl). The growing scepticism about the use of portocaval anastomosis operations to prevent renewed bleeding of esophageal varices has led to the testing of new methods. This report describes subcutaneous transposition of the resected spleen in normal experimental animals with the Vena porta constricted with Ameroid rings and liver cirrhosis induced by DMNA. The report also covers 9 patients operated on from 1972 to 1973 with subcutaneous transposition of the spleen. A 77-year-old woman died postoperatively, one patient died after 2 years 4 months, and one had slight bleeding. All the other patients are alive 2-4 years after the operation, with no signs of renewed bleeding. The advantage of subcutaneous transposition of the spleen is that it eliminates hypersplenism.
