Marked effect of octreotide acetate in a case of pancreatic pleural effusion. A pancreaticopleural effusion is a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. Fasting, a protease inhibitor, and/or a surgical intervention are generally selected for the treatment of the pancreatic effusion. We reported here the case, in which octreotide acetate was effective for resolving pancreatic effusion. A 67-year-old man was admitted with a massive pleural effusion. This effusion contained a high level of amylase. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography followed by computed tomography revealed a pancreaticopleural fistula. The pleural effusion was not improved by the treatment of the protease inhibitor with total parenteral nutrition and fasting. A pancreatic stent could not be emplaced because the major pancreatic duct was coiled. Administration of octreotide acetate, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, markedly diminished the effusion and closed the pancreaticopleural fistula. Transient eosinophilia of peripheral blood was seen on admission, but the number of eosinophils decreased after the octreotide therapy and normalised when pleural effusion disappeared. Octreotide is one of the effective options for the treatment of pancreatic pleural effusion.
