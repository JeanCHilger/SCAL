Hepatic fibrosis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in chronic hepatitis is not well known. This study evaluated the relationship between liver injury, serum thrombopoietin, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in chronic viral hepatitis. Two hundred and nine patients were enrolled, 85 with splenomegaly and 124 without. Thrombocytopenia was present in 71% and 23% of patients with or without splenomegaly respectively. In subjects with low platelet count, those with splenomegaly showed significantly lower platelet numbers than those without splenomegaly. The spleen size correlated with portal hypertension. An inverse correlation between spleen size and platelet count was observed (r = -0.54 P < 0.0001). In patients without splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia was associated with the grade of fibrosis
