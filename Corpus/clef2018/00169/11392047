Effect of portosystemic anastomosis on the degree of splenic inhibition. Secondary hypersplenism is a well-known complication of portal hypertension. Reduced platelet count is a more alarming sign for the physician than risk for the patient. Improvement of thrombocytopenia is urgent, when portal hypertension with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia presents with life-threatening haemorrhage from gastroesophageal varices. In this case, treatment aimed at stopping the bleeding may be more beneficial than any intervention on the spleen. In this study, we evaluated long-term effects of an elective distal splenorenal shunt or small diameter H-shunt on splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in 26 patients with portal hypertension operated for repeated bleeding from oesophageal varices. 25 patients had splenomegaly and 16 patients had thrombocytopenia before shunting. Surgery corrected splenomegaly in 16 patients (64%), platelet counts increased in 13 of 16 patients with thrombocytopenia (81.2%).Selective or partial portal decompression is sufficient to alleviate thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly associated with portal hypertension.
