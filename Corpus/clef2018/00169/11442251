Results of duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy for pancreaticoduodenectomy Billroth I type reconstruction in 100 consecutive patients. This study retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and pylorus-preserving PD (PPPD) with a Billroth I type reconstruction and pancreaticojejunostomy by duct-to-mucosal anastomosis using a continuous running suture.Seventy patients underwent PD and 30 patients PPPD for pancreatic cancer in 33, bile duct cancer in 28, ampullary or duodenal tumor in 22, chronic pancreatitis in 8, and other gastrointestinal cancer in 9. Postoperative pancreatic anastomotic leakage was diagnosed from skin excoriation around the drain site, and was defined as a high concentration of amylase in drainage fluid or leakage demonstrated on x-ray.The mortality rate was 2% overall (2.8% in PD, 0% in PPPD). The morbidity rate was 23% overall (12.8% in PD, 46.7% in PPPD). Pancreatic anastomotic leakage was 4.0% overall (2.8% in PD, 6.7% in PPPD).. The incidence in the ampullary or duodenal tumors was 9.1% overall (0% in PD, 14.3% in PPPD). Biliary leakage occurred in four patients, 4.0% overall (4.3% in PD, 3.3% in PPPD), intraabdominal hemorrhage in 2% (2.8% in PD, 0% in PPPD), and lethal anastomotic leakage in one patient, overall rate 1% (1.4% in PD, 0% in PPPD). Delayed gastric emptying had the highest morbidity and was seen exclusively in PPPD (39.3%).A simple continuous running suture and parachuting for duct-to-mucosal pancreaticojejunostomy makes pancreaticoduodenectomy a safe procedure, even in a Billroth I type reconstruction.
