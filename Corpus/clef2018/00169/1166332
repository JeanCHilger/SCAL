Management of pancreatic ascites. Two patients with persistent pancreatic ascites are presented. Both were managed successfully by internal drainage. A trial of nonoperative treatment with nasogastric intubation and intravenous hyperalimentation is advocated for patients with pancreatic ascites. Patients who fail to improve usually have a pancreatic duct disruption and should have internal drainage operation and/or distal pancreatic resection.
