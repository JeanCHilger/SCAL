Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. A 53-year-old man suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for 15 years presented with bleeding esophageal varices, hepatosplenomegaly and normal splenoportal venous axis. Liver biopsy revealed mild fibrosis, suggestive of non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF). There are reports of the association of idiopathic portal hypertension, a condition similar to NCPF, with progressive systemic sclerosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
