Urgent distal splenorenal shunt in low-body weight patients. The authors report two patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension and repeated massive bleeding from esophageal varices who underwent urgent distal splenorenal shunting (DSRS) after having proved refractory to medical treatment, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and ligation of esophageal varices. Their ages and weights were 18 months/10 kg, and 11 months/6.4 kg, respectively. The splenic veins were 6 and 4 mm in diameter. During follow-up of 4 and 3 years, respectively, the shunts have remained patent in both patients as demonstrated by Doppler Ultrasound. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has not recurred, splenomegaly regressed, and platelet and white blood cell counts increased gradually. Neither patient developed a significant encephalopathy, and liver function tests showed no significant changes throughout the observed period. The authors considered the shunting feasible despite the relatively narrow splenic veins. In both patients the anatomic position of the splenic vein--more caudal to the posterior wall of the pancreas--facilitated its isolation. In the smaller infant, the inferior mesenteric vein was sutured to gain a satisfactory segment of splenic vein. The successful use of a DSRS to control actively bleeding varices in a child weighing 6.4 kg has not been previously reported.
