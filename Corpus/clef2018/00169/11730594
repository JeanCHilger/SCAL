Portal vein thrombosis. Review of the disease and report of two cases. Occlusion of the portal vein in patients with normal liver is a frequent cause of hypertension in children. The natural course of the disease is characterized by recurrent bleeding during the first years of life and the development of splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Because the risk of bleeding in these patients can decrease with age, non-aggressive management is preferred whenever possible. We report two cases of portal vein thrombosis in adolescents with no previous esophageal variceal bleeding. The patients were treated conservatively and, at the present moment, remain symptom-free.
