Prediction of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. To identify predictors of esophageal varices (EV) using available clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic imaging variables.Patients with cirrhosis frequently undergo screening endoscopy for varices so that prophylactic therapy and/or follow up can be planned. It is unclear how often patients should be screened endoscopically for varices, and there are few data on the relationship of varices to nonendoscopic variables.Charts were reviewed for 247 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who underwent screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy for varices.A total of 184 patients (68 women) were studied. Ninety-four patients (51%) had varices of whom, 90 had only EV (small, n = 66The prevalence of EV in cirrhosis increases with the severity of liver disease, as expected. Thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly are independent predictors of large EV in cirrhosis. Further prospective studies might result in a discriminating algorithm to predict which patients with cirrhosis would benefit from early or regular endoscopy to detect clinically significant varices.
