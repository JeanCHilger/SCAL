Surgical treatment of schistosomal portal hypertension. Schistosomiasis mansoni is a widespread parasitic disease in the Brazilian territory that affects over 8 million individuals. Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a serious clinical presentation of this disease, associated with splenomegaly, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension, and is responsible for approximately 7% of schistosomotic patients. The surgical treatment of portal hypertension in schistosomotic patients has distinct features when compared with cirrhotic patients, mostly because hepatic function is preserved in schistosomotic liver disease. Therefore, when attempting to reduce the portal pressure, the surgeon must be aware that the surgery might interfere with hepatic perfusion, and consequently with hepatic function. The aim of this study was to report the results achieved with splenectomy, division of the left gastric vein, devascularization of great gastric curvature, and postoperative endoscopic variceal sclerosis, as a surgical option to esophageal varices in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. A total of 111 patients were studied, and the following is a list of inclusion criteria: age >16 years, history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, presence of esophageal varices on preoperative endoscopy, hematocrit >22% and prothrombin enzymatic activity >50%, negative viral hepatitis on serologic tests (anti-HBV and anti-HCV), and definition, after liver biopsy, of exclusive schistosomotic liver disease. The following list includes exclusion criteria used: presence of liver disease other than schistosomotic, history of alcohol abuse, and preoperative thrombosis of the portal vein. The rebleeding rate was 14.4% during a mean 30-month follow-up period portal vein thrombosis was 13.2%, and there was a global mortality of 5.4%. Gastric varices were present in 46.9% of the patients
