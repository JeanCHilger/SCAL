Successful partial transplant pancreatectomy with end-to-side duct-to-ureter anastomosis: salvage of a pancreatic allograft. Segmental pancreatic transplantation has been abandoned because of the high incidence of technical complications. We report the first case in the literature of the salvage of a partially ischemic pancreatic allograft. The procedure consisted of resecting the head of the pancreas and draining the residual segment to the ureter with a duct-to-ureter end-to-side anastomosis. The postoperative course was uneventful, and 15 months after surgery graft function is satisfactory with a urinary amylase level of 5000 U/h. The duct-to-ureter drainage technique should be part of every transplant surgeon's repertoire, because in emergency situations like the one described, it can be used to save a pancreatic allograft.
