Clinical predictors of large esophagogastric varices in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, especially in Asia. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of death in HCC patients. The aim of study was to determine whether clinical variables were predictive of the presence of large esophagogastric varices (EGV) before performing endoscopy. Three hundred and four HCC patients who received endoscopy were enrolled and studied retrospectively. Univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate associations between the presence of large EGV and patient characteristics. There were 248 patients with small or no EGV and 56 patients with large EGV. The optimal critical values determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve for platelet count and albumin level were 135,000/mm3 and 3.5 g/dl, respectively. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that splenomegaly [odds ratio (OR): 9.72 confidence interval (CI): 3.75-25.17], portal vein thrombosis (OR: 2.73
