Laparoscopic splenectomy for portal hypertension. Laparoscopic splenectomy is now increasingly being performed. However, controversy remains regarding the effectiveness of a laparoscopic splenectomy for patients with portal hypertension.Seventy-three patients with portal hypertension who underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy from February 1992 until October 2000 were reviewed and the effectiveness of the procedures for portal hypertension was evaluated. Forty-two patients had esophagogastric varices and twenty had a concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma. The indications for surgery were bleeding tendency due to thrombocytopenia (n = 40), difficulty in receiving treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma due to thrombocytopenia (n = 18), and sclerotherapy-resistant esophagogastric varices (n = 15).A laparoscopic splenectomy was successfully performed in all the patients. The rate of conversion to conventional open surgery was 9.6% (7/73). The mean operative time was 210.1 +/- 101.9 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 374.7 +/- 352.4 mL. There were no cases of mortality, and morbidity was encountered in 11.0% of patients. The increase in the platelet count correlated significantly to the spleen weight (P < 0.001). The platelet count had been maintained at over 10 x 10(4)/mm3 for over three years. Eighteen patients with hepatocellular carcinoma successfully underwent treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma after surgery and no recurrence of esophagogastric varices was encountered.A laparoscopic splenectomy resulted in the successful secondary treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and esophagogastric varices. Portal hypertension was not a contraindication. A laparoscopic approach is therefore the procedure of choice for a splenectomy in portal hypertension.
