Rate and associated risk factors of rebleeding after endoscopic variceal band ligation. Bleeding esophageal varices is associated with a high mortality rate. Despite advances in management, the mortality rate remains at 30-80 per cent. Endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL) is a new technique designed to manage esophageal varices with the aim of reducing the complication rate. Variceal rebleeding which occurs in 6-36 per cent of patients is common during the treatment period before variceal obliteration is achieved but related factors remain unknown. Thirty-one patients with a history of esophageal variceal bleeding and endoscopically confirmed between February 1999 and February 2001 received regular EVL until variceal disappearance and were reviewed retrospectively. There was no major complication. Rebleeding was documented in 8 patients (25.8%). Portal hypertension-related conditions, such as gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy, were the most common sources of rebleeding. Platelet count and prothrombin time were not found to be closely related to rebleeding (p-value=0.79, 0.08) but Child-Pugh's C patients had a significantly higher rebleeding rate compared with Child-Pugh's B and A respectively (p-value=0.047). Mortality was high in the rebleeding group significantly (p-value=0.006) and exsanguinations were the major cause of death. In conclusion, the authors suggest that long-term follow-up is required.
