Idiopathic portal hypertension in a systemic sclerosis patient heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation. Here we present a rare case of systemic sclerosis (SSc) with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) having factor V Leiden mutation, a well-known genetic risk factor for various venous thromboses. A 53-year-old SSc patient showing huge esophageal varices and splenomegaly without liver cirrhosis was diagnosed with IPH. As heterozygous Leiden mutation was detected, some coagulation abnormality and resultant formation of microthrombi in the branches of portal vein were suggested as a cause of IPH in this case. This is the first report showing the possible association between Leiden mutation and one of the complications of SSc.
