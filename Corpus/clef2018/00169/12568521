Correlation between serum-ascites albumin concentration gradient with gastrointestinal bleeding in patients of portal hypertension. Non-availability of endoscopic screening to detect portal hypertensive patients at a high risk of index gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage led us to examine the relationship between serum-ascitic albumin concentration gradient (SAAG) measurements and the occurrence of GI haemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension and ascites. Fifty-six consecutive patients of portal hypertension with ascites attending the GI surgery outpatients clinic were divided into two groups on the basis of history: (a) those who had no history of GI bleeding and (b) those who had an episode of GI bleeding within the past 21 days. Child-Pugh score was calculated for all patients. All the patients were assessed by ultrasonography and SAAG was estimated. Groups (a) and (b) were compared and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of using SAAG as a possible screening test for GI bleeding were calculated. SAAG values correlated significantly with bleeding and splenomegaly. For prediction of bleeding, SAAG had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 33.33%, positive predictive value of SAAG for GI bleeding was 71.4% and the negative predictive value was 100%. Estimation of SAAG is possible even in a small, modestly equipped laboratory, and could provide a new means for the identification of high-risk patients for GI bleeding and define patients more accurately for future clinical studies. The results of the present study are encouraging for clinicians working in developing countries and may help in optimizing prophylactic therapy and where available, improving the cost effectiveness of screening endoscopy.
