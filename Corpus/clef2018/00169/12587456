Partial resection of the spleen and spleno-renal shunt in the treatment of portal hypertension with splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Some of serious hepatic diseases with cirrhosis may be complicated by portal hypertension, splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Splenomegaly inhibits regenerative processes of the liver, and also intensifies sequestration of the cellular components of blood up to hypersplenism. Cytopenia caused by hypersplenism is aggravated by negative hepatic influence on bone marrow activity-hemathopoesis, and also by recurrent bleeding from oesophageal varices, and from the other site of gastrointestinal tract. This circle of pathologic conditions may be interrupted only by liver transplantation, until which patients are jeopardized by acute bleeding and chronic anemia. Partial resection of the spleen and splenorenal shunt may correct portal hypertension and hypersplenism, prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, and alleviate hepatic regenerative processes inhibition. In this study, 51 patients with partial resection of the spleen and splenorenal shunt, were analyzed.
