Pancreatic ascites: recognition and management. In a patient with chronic ascites, an abnormally raised ascitic fluid amylase concentration and a protein content above 2.5 gm/100 ml is diagnostic of pancreatic ascites. Thirty-one episodes in 26 patients treated between 1958 and 1975 have been analyzed. Twenty patients (65%) experienced abdominal pain and ten (32%) had concomitant pleural effusions roentgenographically. Although a leaking pancreatic pseudocyst was the cause of ascites in at least 21 episodes (70%), an abdominal mass could only be palpated in two of 26 patients. Roentgenographic series of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract failed to demonstrate pancreatic pseudocyst in 7 of 21 episodes (33%). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography is invaluable in delineating the pancreatic ductal system and, in conjunction with intraoperative pancreatography, makes a vital contribution to rational surgical therapy. Medical treatment or external drainage during 18 episodes resulted in death in four (22%) and recurrences of ascites or pancreatic pseudocyst in nine (64%). Since routine pancreatography followed by pancreatic resection or internal drainage has been instituted, mortality and recurrence have been reduced to zero.
