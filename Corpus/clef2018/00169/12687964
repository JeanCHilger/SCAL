Portal hypertension caused by intra-hepatic block during chronic lymphoid leukemia. Portal hypertension in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is rare. A 66 year-old man was admitted for splenomegaly, thrombopenia and cholestasis. Endoscopy showed esophageal varices. The hepatic venous pressure gradient was 15 mmHg. The liver biopsy showed dense leukemia cells in sinusoidal and portal sites. After splenectomy, the hepatic venous pressure gradient normalized, but esophageal varices and cholestasis persisted. The authors discuss the mechanisms of portal hypertension in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Previously reported cases are summarized.
