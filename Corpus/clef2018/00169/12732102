Ascites as the sole clinical manifestation in a patient with nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver is an infrequent entity that is usually diagnosed after the appearance of clinical signs of portal hypertension such as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophageal varices, which are the most frequently found clinical manifestations in NRH. Ascites is a less frequent finding and has always been described in association with other manifestations of portal hypertension. We describe a new case of NRH with atypical presentation in which ascites was the sole clinical manifestation.
