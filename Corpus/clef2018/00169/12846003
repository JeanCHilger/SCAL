Prediction of pancreatic fistula by amylase levels of drainage fluid on the first day after pancreatectomy. We investigated whether it would be useful to monitor amylase levels of drainage fluid after pancreatic surgery for prediction of pancreatic fistula.Twenty-six cases in which amylase levels of drainage fluid were determined after pancreatic surgery, were divided into 14 cases who did not develop pancreatic fistula and 12 cases who developed pancreatic fistula. Changes in amylase levels of sera and urine as well as drainage fluid were monitored.Amylase levels of drainage fluid were significantly higher in cases with pancreatic fistula than in cases without pancreatic fistula on the first postoperative day, but those levels in both groups decreased until the 7th postoperative day without significant difference. However, those levels in cases with pancreatic fistula significantly increased from the 9th postoperative day whereas the levels in cases without pancreatic fistula further decreased. There was no significant difference in amylase levels of sera or urine.Amylase levels of drainage fluid on the first postoperative day may be useful to predict development of pancreatic fistula and to plan appropriate management.
