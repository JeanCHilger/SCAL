Late morphologic and hemodynamic changes in the splenic territory of patients with mansoni's hepatosplenic schistosomiasis after distal splenorenal shunt. (Ultrasonography-Doppler study). The distal splenorenal anastomosis (Warren's operation) has been indicated for the treatment of high digestive bleeding caused by esophagic varices because it would ideally reduce the venous pressure in the cardiotuberositary territory without changing the mesenteric-portal venous flow. However, the changes it produce in the splenic territory have not been fully understood.To appraise the late morphologic and hemodynamic changes in the splenic territory produced by the distal splenorenal anastomosis in patients with portal hypertension due to mansoni's hepatosplenic schistosomiasis complicated by esophagic bleeding.Ultrasonography-Doppler study of the splenic region of 52 patients with portal hypertension due to mansoni's schistosomiasis and previous bleeding by esophagic varices. They were divided in two groups: 40 non operated upon and 12 with a distal splenorerenal anastomosis. The following parameters and indices were compared between the two groups: a) morphometric parameters (splenic artery and vein's diameter, splenic diameters (longitudinal, transversal and antero-posterior) b) velocimetric parameters of the splenic vessels (systolic peak velocity in the splenic artery, mean flow velocity in the splenic veinThe patients with distal splenorenal anastomosis showed: a) reduction in splenic indices: volumetric (non operated 903,83 +/- 452, 77 cm / distal splenorenal anastomosis 482,32 +/- 208,02 cm (46,64%)) and biometric (non operated 138,14 +/- 51,89 cm /distal splenorenal anastomosis 94,83 +/- 39,83 cm (33,35%)) b) no change: splenic artery's diameter (non operated 0,57 +/- 0,16 cm/distal splenorenal anastomosis 0,57 +/- 0,23 cm)The comparison of the ultrasonography Doppler results of the two groups of patient (non operated and distal splenorenal anastomosis) showed that in patients with distal splenorenal anastomosis there was a decrease of the volume of spleen increase in the mean flow velocity in the splenic vein
