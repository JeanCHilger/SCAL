Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in children - an experience at a paediatric gastroenterology unit. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has changed the management of upper gastrointestinal problems in children. The aim of this communication is to share our experience with 153 cases on whom upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done over a period of 24 months at a paediatric gastroenterology unit of a tertiary care hospital of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Children who attended the department with various gastrointestinal problems are the subjects of this paper. Intravenous midazolam and 10% pharyngeal xylocain were used in majority of cases for sedating the children. The ages of the children were between 15 months to 15 years (9.41+/- 3.22 years). The positive diagnostic yield was 92 out of 153 cases (60.1%). The major indication for doing endoscopy in the present series was recurrent abdominal pain (51.6%), followed by upper gastrointestinal bleeding (28.8%). Combining histopathological findings and CLO/rapid urease tests the overall positive yield of recurrent abdominal pain was 45 out of 79 (57%). The sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding could be identified in 79.5% cases. Esophageal varices indicating portal hypertension were found in 62.5% children who were endoscoped for unexplained splenomegaly with or without ascitis. Endoscopy has become a safe and valuable procedure in the management of upper gastrointestinal problems in children and gastric antral biopsy has increased the positive diagnostic yield of recurrent abdominal pain in the studied children.
