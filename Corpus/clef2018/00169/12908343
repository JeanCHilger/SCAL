Pleural fluid in chronic pancreatitis. In three patients, a 44-year-old schizophrenic woman and two men aged 54 and 42, who presented with dyspnoea, a pancreaticopleural fistula was diagnosed as a complication of pancreatitis, i.e. a fistulous tract between the pancreas and the pleural cavity. In general, these fistulas have a good prognosis however, delay in finding the correct diagnosis influences the prognosis. This is often due to unfamiliarity with the disease and the non-specific presentation of patients with pleural effusion. The initial presentation usually comprises respiratory (dyspnoea, coughing due to pleural effusion) and occasional abdominal symptoms (epigastric pain). A definitive diagnosis is made when elevated pleural effusion amylase levels are demonstrated. Surgical treatment is only indicated if conservative or endoscopic treatment fails, and consists of resection of the fistula and drainage of the pancreatic duct via a lateral pancreaticojejunostomy or resection of the part of the pancreas where the fistula originates. In the first patient, surgical drainage of the fluid accumulation was applied, but she died of aspiration pneumonia after she had removed the feeding tube and had refused further treatment. Pancreatic resection resulted in recovery in the two men.
