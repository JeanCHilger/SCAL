Percutaneous trans-splenic portal venography applications and hazards. Trans-splenic percutaneous portavenography is a useful and relatively simple roentgen examination. Although infrequent, splenic hemorrhage and delayed splenic rupture sometimes do occur after splenic puncture. Hence the procedure should be used only with provision for immediate operation in case of hemorrhage. The method is invaluable in the demonstration of intrahepatic and extrahepatic portal obstruction, gastric and esophageal varices. With it, the size of the portasplenic veins and the degree of portal hypertension can be estimated.
