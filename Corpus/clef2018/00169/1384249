Endoscopic-sonographic control of cystogastric catheter drainage of pancreatogenic fluid collections. In 1985, Hancke published a report on cystogastrostomy using a double pigtail catheter as an alternative to surgical drainage of pseudocysts. Between 1986 and 1991, with the aim of testing the technique, we carried out a prospective study in 39 patients with 40 pancreatic collections of fluid. The object of the study was to identify those collections of fluid that would be suitable for cystogastric drainage. Among the first 20 patients thus treated, permanent evacuation of the cyst was achieved in eleven. In the other nine patients, the reasons for the failure of cystogastric drainage included to immature a cyst, too small a cyst, prior cyst infection and status after a BII resection. For the patients No. 21 to 40, these conditions were adopted as exclusion criteria, with the result that we were able to increase the percentage of permanent emptying to 75%. This makes cystogastric drainage a genuine alternative to surgical and other drainage procedures. As a minimally invasive intervention, it is a first choice therapeutic procedure in suitable pancreatic pseudocysts. If cystogastric drainage is shown not to be feasible, the possibility of employing percutaneous drainage should be investigated. Surgical drainage procedures are reserved for use in such cases as cannot be treated with catheter drainage.
