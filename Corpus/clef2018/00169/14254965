PANCREATIC DISEASE IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD. SURGICAL IMPLICATIONS. Surgeons whose practice involves many infants and children should be acquainted with all abnormalities of pancreatic malformation and function. Conditions amenable to surgical treatment are few, but serious. Trauma to the pancreas in childhood is most commonly diagnosed by fever, leukocytosis, rectus spasm and elevated serum amylase. Drainage of the lesser sac and debridement of devitalized tissue may prevent the sequelae of pseudocyst formation which seems to follow the untreated injury. True congenital cysts are characterized by an epithelial lining.Mucoviscidosis complicated by meconium ileus remains a challenging disease of the newborn that requires early operation. Ten per cent of infants with cystic fibrosis may be threatened by intestinal obstruction from this cause. Some children surviving the newborn period go on to develop obstruction later. Annular malformation of pancreas may produce upper intestinal (duodenal) obstructive symptoms immediately after birth. Surgical correction by duodenojejunostomy should be postponed only long enough to correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances. Idiopathic spontaneous hypoglycemia has the most serious prognosis if convulsions are allowed to recur. Increased metabolic rates in infants increase the need for control of blood sugar levels by either administration of cortisone or pancreatic resection. If adenoma is the cause, a conservative resection of the tumor suffices. If serial frozen section fails to reveal either tumor or hypertophy of insulin-producing cells, blind pancreatectomy may be indicated, for irreversible brain damage develops early in uncontrolled hypoglycemia.
