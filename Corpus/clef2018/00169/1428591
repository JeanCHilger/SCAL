Distribution characteristics of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in adenoids. Relationship to age and disease. Forty-four adenoids and 52 palatine tonsils from 71 children and adolescents (age 3-21 years) undergoing surgery because of adenoidal hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis were examined for the presence of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC) employing an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). ISC constituted less than 2% of the mononuclear cell population. Adenoids contained IgG, IgA, and IgM ISC in significantly lower numbers than palatine tonsils. The predominant isotype of the ISC was IgG, in adenoids accounting for 62% of the ISC and in palatine tonsils for 73%. The relative numbers for IgA and IgM ISC were similar. A significant correlation existed between autologous adenoids and palatine tonsils for the numbers of IgA and IgM ISC, but not for the numbers of IgG cells. These observations suggest that, adenoid and palatine tonsils display similar immunoglobulin distribution patterns within a single individual. However, individuals with hypertrophied adenoids exhibited a numeric decrease in IgG ISC with increasing age (P less than 0.01). Both lymphoid tissues may be involved in mucosal immune defense.
