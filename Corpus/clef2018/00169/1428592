Serum immunoglobulin E levels in children with chronic tonsillitis. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were estimated by ELISA in 50 children with chronic tonsillitis before and after tonsillectomy. When compared with the control group, mean serum IgE concentration was found to be significantly higher in children with chronic tonsillitis (P less than 0.001). After tonsillectomy the levels returned to normal.
