Effect of the Warren operation on hypersplenism. The authors present their own comments on the effect of Warren shunt on hypersplenism. Hypersplenism is frequent complication in portal hypertension. The authors estimate its frequency on 64.7% of patients. Spleen size, thrombocyte count, WBC count, and esophageal endoscopy have been carried out prior to and following distal spleno-renal shunt. Surgery produced favourable effect in 70% of patients, i.e. a decrease of hypersplenism symptoms. An increase in blood platelet count may serve as a screening marker of anastomosis patency.
