Pancreatic fistula after pancreatic head resection incidence, significance and management. Anastomotic leak at the pancreatojejunostomy remains a common and dreaded complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Our aim was to determine the incidence, presentation, methods of management, and preoperative and postoperative factors that influence the clinical outcome.We reviewed our collective experience with 70 consecutive patients from 1985 to 2000 for a variety of pathologic indications. Clinical, biochemical, intraoperative and postoperative factors were reviewed in an attempt to determine prognostic factors.Nine patients (12%) developed a pancreatic anastomotic leak as determined by increased amylase in drainage fluid (70%), were clinically insignificant and were managed by simple maintenance of intraoperatively placed drains. Although octreotide was used therapeutically in 4 patients (44%), significant, objective response was noted in all patients. Of the clinical, biochemical, intraoperative and postoperative factors reviewed to determine prognostic factors, a large amount of postoperative pancreatic juice output (P = 0.02) was a significant risk factor for pancreatic fistula formation.We conclude that most anastomotic leak at pancreaticoenterostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy can be managed conservatively. Use of octreotide to aid in closure of the pancreatic leak was satisfactory.
