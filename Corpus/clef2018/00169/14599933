Reasonable choice of surgical procedures for patients with portal hypertension. To assess individualized therapeutic protocol for patients with portal hypertension on the basis of accumulated knowledge about the mechanism of portal hypertension.Patients data on shunt and other surgical procedures from Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai, China and the published papers.The direction of blood flow of the collateral vessels in the gastro-splenic region is an important factor in deciding surgical strategy because there is a close relationship between surgical risk and the classification of liver function. Clinically it is confirmed that each patient needs an individualized surgical procedure and that prophylactic operation is suitable for patients with splenomegaly, splenism associated with serious esophageal varices and hemorrhagic tendency under endoscopy but acceptable liver function. The shunt diameter (SD) (SD = 0.67 x PVD) is determined in our patients according to individualized hemodynamics. The rehemorrhagic rate after shunt being higher than that in others may be related to lesioned gastric mucosa caused by portal hypertension or bleeding and temporary melena. This finding is good for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy. The life quality and labor ability of patients will be improved because of hepatopetal flow in the portal vein. With strict indications for reoperation, selective operation is performed as soon as possible when hemorrhage is controlled conservatively and liver function improved. Once the patient with cirrhosis associated with portal hypertension is scheduled for liver transplantation, treatment of hemorrhage should aim to keep the patient in good condition and to avoid the protocol that may be disadvantageous to liver transplantation in the future.Surgical procedures for patients with portal hypertension should follow the principle of individualization. To obtain the best outcome, the choice of reasonable surgical procedure is expected.
