Hand-assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy after partial splenic embolization. The case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and thrombocytopenia secondary to liver cirrhosis who underwent successful hand-assisted laparoscopic hepatectomy after partial splenic embolization is described. A 67-year-old man with severe liver cirrhosis was admitted for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. His early phase of hepatic angiography showed two hypervascular tumors in segment 6. The patients liver function was poor, with the indocyanine green retention at 15 min of 49.5%, a total serum bilirubin concentration of 2.0 mg/dl, an albumin concentration of 2.8 g/dl, and an hyaluronic acid concentration of 649 ng/ml. The platelet count was 3.0 x 10(4)/microl secondary to hypersplenism. Partial splenic embolization decreased the splenic volume by 50% preoperatively. At 2 months later, the platelet count was 6.0 x 10(4)/microl, and hand-assisted laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed uneventfully. The patients postoperative course was unremarkable, and he was discharged on postoperative day 12.
