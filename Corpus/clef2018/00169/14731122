Fifteen-year follow up of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in children with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction. Endoscopic sclerotherapy has emerged as an effective treatment for bleeding esophageal varices both in adults and children but the long-term outcome is poorly defined in children. The authors report a 15-year follow up of sclerotherapy in children with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction.Between June 1982 and February 1992, 69 children with bleeding esophageal varices underwent sclerotherapy variceal eradication was achieved in 63 (91.3%) patients, with procedure-related morbidity of 28.9% and mortality of 1.4%. Fifty-nine patients with variceal eradication were followed for between 10.4 and 20.1 years (mean, 15.1 +/- 3.1 years).After a median period of 3 years (range, 1.2-12.8 years), seven (11.9%) patients presented with recurrent bleeding (esophageal varices, four gastric varices, twoThe authors conclude that (i) sclerotherapy is the ideal, safe and effective treatment for bleeding esophageal varices, that it prevented bleeding in 88.1% patients after variceal eradication and hence, should be included in primary management strategies (ii) follow-up endoscopy should be performed on a yearly basis for the first 4 years after variceal eradication
