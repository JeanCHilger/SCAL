Chronic lymphocytic leukemia with portal hypertension and without liver involvement: a case report underlining the roles of increased spleno-portal blood flow and "protective" sinusoidal vasoconstriction. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman with well-controlled chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and splenomegaly who developed portal hypertension with bleeding oesophageal varices in the absence of liver fibrosis or regenerative nodular hyperplasia at surgical wedge liver biopsy. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was elevated and splenectomy resulted in both its normalisation and the regression of oesophageal varices. This case shows the potential for an increased spleno-poral flow to generate severe portal hypertension likely through a "protective" sinusoidal vasoconstriction.
