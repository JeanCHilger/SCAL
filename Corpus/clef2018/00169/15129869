Etiology of chronic liver disease in children. To review the clinical spectrum and etiology of chronic liver disease in children at National Institute of Child Health, Karachi.Prospective study in children aged 1 to 14 years with suspected chronic liver disease. Complete blood count, LFT's, prothrombin time, serum albumin and ultrasound of abdomen were done in all patients. Liver biopsy was done in majority of the cases. Viral markers included HBsAg, anti HCV and ANA to determine etiology. Those who were negative for hepatitis B, C and autoimmune disease, were subjected to slit lamp examination of eyes and 24 hours urinary copper estimation for Wilson's disease. Alpha-1-antitrypsin levels were done in selected patients.A total of 55 cases were studied. The common presenting features were edema, ascites (44 patients), jaundice (27), variceal bleeding (23) and fever (22). On examination anemia was present in 52 patients, edema in 46, jaundice in 37, splenomegaly in 42 and hepatomegaly in 35 patients. Fortynine patients had hypoalbuminemia (< 2.5 gm%), 45 raised ALT (> 80 IU/L) and 49 prolonged PT (> 4 sec of control). Ultrasonography showed a dilated portal vein in 34 patients and esophageal varices were seen in 46 patients on endoscopy. Thirteen (24%) had chronic hepatitis B, 9(16%) autoimmune disease, 9 (16%) Wilson's disease and all were anti HCV negative. Etiology remained uncertain in 24 (44%) cases.Hepatitis B was the leading cause of chronic liver disease in children followed by Wilson's disease and autoimmune liver disease. None of the patients had hepatitis C in this study.
