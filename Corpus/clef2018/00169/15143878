The impact of splenectomy or splenic artery ligation on the outcome of a living donor adult liver transplantation using a left lobe graft. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of splenectomy or splenic artery ligation on the outcome in living donor adult liver transplantation (LDALT) using a left lobe graft.Forty-eight LDALT cases using a left lobe graft were enrolled in this study. The patients were classified into two groups: Group A (n=40), in which neither a splenectomy nor a splenic artery ligation was performed, and Group B (n=8), in which a splenectomy (n=6) or a splenic artery ligation (n=2) was performed. Indications for splenectomy were as follows: 1) demonstrating a hypersplenism and/or 2) having splenic aneurysms.None of the patients receiving a splenectomy or a splenic artery ligation experienced any septic complication in this series. The graft-recipient weight ratio in group B tended to be smaller than in group A. In group B, all patients were classified into Child's class C or B. The incidence of esophageal varices in group B was significantly higher than in group A. Moreover, the platelet count and the white blood cell count in group B were significantly lower than in group A. No statistical difference was found in postoperative functional cholestasis and intractable ascites. None of the participants in group B experienced both postoperative hyperbilirubinemia and intractable ascites, which were characterized as a small-for-size graft after LDALT. The patient survival rate in group B seems to be better than in group A. In a majority of the cases the portal pressure as well as the portal vein flow after a splenectomy decreased in comparison to that before the splenectomy.Splenectomy or splenic artery ligation is considered to be beneficial for improving the outcome in LDALT using a left lobe graft.
