Duplex Doppler ultrasound signs of portal hypertension: relative diagnostic value of examination of paraumbilical vein, portal vein and spleen. The sonographic parameters in portal hypertension (PHT) were examined in a consecutive population of 118 patients who had PHT diagnosed using specific endoscopic, sonographic and Doppler signs. A patent or enlarged paraumbilical vein was found in 85.6% of patients overall and 82.5% of patients with varices indicating a relatively high sensitivity. A portal vein diameter greater than or equal to 13mm was found in only 41.1% and greater than or equal to 15mm in only 20% of patients. A thrombosed portal vein and reversed portal vein flow were present in 3.4% and 5.3% of patients respectively. These signs have only been reported in the context of PHT and are felt to be specific for PHT, but both have a very low sensitivity. Portal vein velocities were highly variable suggesting that this is not a useful predictor of PHT. Splenomegaly was found in only 53.5% of patients demonstrating its poor sensitivity as a sign of PHT. Varices were found in 73.3% of patients overall, and in 100% of patients with a patent or enlarged paraumbilical vein combined with ascites. No other statistically significant correlation between varices and sonographic findings was demonstrated. We conclude that the presence of a patent or enlarged paraumbilical vein is a practical, useful and sensitive ultrasound sign to look for in the diagnosis of PHT.
