Idiopathic portal hypertension and chronic arsenic poisoning. Report of a case. We report a case of idiopathic portal hypertension which is related to chronic arsenic poisoning. Only 7 cases have been reported previously. The patient presented with bleeding esophageal varices. Splenomegaly and hyperkeratosis of palms and soles were later noted and led to the discovery of chronic arsenic poisoning. The hemodynamic studies revealed a gradient between the splenic pulp pressure and hepatic wedge pressure which is consistent with presinusoidal hypertension. The liver histology revealed only mild portal fibrosis. Arsenic poisoning is one cause of idiopathic protal hypertension.
