Computed tomography features of portal hypertensive gastropathy. The aim of this study was to detect the computed tomography features in portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG).This study included 32 patients with portal hypertension. Ten of 32 patients were diagnosed with (PHG), and the other 22 patients were not diagnosed with PHG on the basis of upper endoscopic examination. Dynamic computed tomography studies were performed in all 32 patients. Each computed tomography scan was evaluated with regard to whether the gastric inner layer was enhanced or not.Nine patients with PHG had delayed enhancement on the inner layers of gastric walls, but in 17 of 22 patients without PHG, delayed enhancement was not observed.Enhancement on the inner layer of gastric walls may reflect gastric congestion. Portal hypertensive gastropathy should be suspected when this finding is detected on computed tomography scans in patients with portal hypertension.
