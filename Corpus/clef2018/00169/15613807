A case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of liver that mimicked primary biliary cirrhosis. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver is a rare disease that is characterized by multiple regenerative nodules in the hepatic parenchyma without fibrosis. The exact pathogenesis of NRH has not been established, but it's been suggested that obliteration of portal veins may initiate the nodular transformation. It is also known that this disease is associated with autoimmune disease, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and some chemotherapy agents. The patients with NRH are usually asymptomatic, yet if they have symptoms, the most common clinical manifestations are those of portal hypertension, including splenomegaly and esophageal varices with or without bleeding. We report a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia that presented with clinical manifestations similar to those of primary biliary cirrhosis.
