Pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas revealed by rupture of esophageal and gastric varices secondary to biliary cirrhosis due to bile duct compression. Pseudo-papillary tumors of the pancreas are rare and usually occur in young women. We report a case with a very rare presentation (rupture of esogastric varices complicating biliary cirrhosis secondary to bile duct compression by a pancreatic tumor). After biological and radiological explorations, a duodenopancreatectomy was performed. Diagnosis was confirmed by conventional histology and immunohistochemistry. One year later, the patient remained asymptomatic.
