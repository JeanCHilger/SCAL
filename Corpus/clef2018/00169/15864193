Serum albumin and platelet count but not portal pressure are predictive of death in patients with Child-Pugh A hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. The presence of esophageal varices has been reported to be a prognostic factor in patients with compensated hepatitis viral C induced cirrhosis. We studied the prognostic value of hepatic venous pressure gradient in addition to epidemiological and clinical parameters in these patients.Among patients with Child-Pugh A hepatitis C induced cirrhosis, prospectively followed in two Parisian centres, 100 had measurement of occluded and free hepatic venous pressures. We evaluated hepatic venous pressures as a predictive factor of death by Cox models (survival) and Fine and Gray models (liver-deaths).Median hepatic occluded pressure and gradient were 21.5 (15-24) and 13 mm Hg (9-15), respectively. The median duration of follow-up was 85 months (range: 70-112) 38 deaths or liver transplantation were registered. Hepatic venous pressure gradient was not significantly related to survival in the studied population but as a continuous variable was predictive of death from liver disease. On multivariable analysis serum albumin <40 g/L and platelet count <90,000 /mm(3) were the only selected prognostic factors.Hepatic venous pressure gradient has a limited value for assessing the prognosis of patients with Child-Pugh A hepatitis C virus induced cirrhosis prognosis is accurately predicted by serum albumin and platelet count.
