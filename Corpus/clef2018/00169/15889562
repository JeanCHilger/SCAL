The correlation between cytopenia and esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis. This retrospective study analysed the case records of 200 patients in the Department of Gastroenterology, Singapore General Hospital from February 2000 to January 2001 who had liver cirrhosis and underwent gastroscopy for the detection of varices. The aim of this study was to determine any relationship between leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and the occurrence of esophageal varices in a cirrhotic population. Our results showed that the diagnostic yield of varices grade 2 and 3 was 6.3% if platelet count was > 150,000/mm3, 25% if platelet count was 100,000 to 150,000/mm3, 38.9% if platelet count was 50,000-99,000/mm3 and 100% if platelet count was <50,000/mm3. Similarly, the diagnostic yield of varices grade 2 and 3 was 19.4% if total white count was > 4,000/mm3, 66.7% if total white count was 3,000- 4,000/mm3 and 94.8% if total white count was < 3,000/mm5. We conclude that thrombocytopenia and leucopenia can be used to stratify risk for occurrence of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients and gastroscopy will have a high yield for varices when platelet count is < 150,000/mm3 or total white is < 4,000/mm.
