CT and angiography in chronic liver disease. Detailed correlation of CT and angiographic findings in a retrospective analysis of 25 cases of portal hypertension is presented. The largest diameters of the common and proper hepatic arteries, the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins, and perigastric veins were measured by the two methods, including a CT control series of 20 subjects. The splenic transverse diameter was also measured. Portosystemic collaterals and concomitant pathology disclosed by the two methods were compared. A ratio of nearly 1 was found between vessel diameters measured by angiography and CT, and about 1.3 for splenic size, applying uncorrected measures from angiographic films and a vernier caliper on CT studies. The diameters of hepatic arteries, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins and spleens were significantly larger than those of controls. Except for demonstrating arterial details and esophageal varices, CT was found equal or superior to angiography in mapping portosystemic collaterals, and to disclose concomitant pathology.
