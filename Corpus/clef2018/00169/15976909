Correlation between platelet blood levels and the hepatic venous pressure gradient among patients with cirrhosis. Determination of hepatic venous pressure gradient is the main method used to assess portal pressure. Recently, platelet blood levels has been indicated as a non-invasive marker of the presence of portal hypertension.To correlate platelet blood levels with the hepatic venous pressure gradient among patients with cirrhosis.A total of 83 cirrhotic patients who had undergone hepatic venous pressure gradient over the last 6 years were included. Patients were divided in groups according to Child-Pugh classification. All had upper digestive endoscopy to assess the presence of esophageal varices and platelet serum levels were recorded.Platelet serum levels range varied between 45,000/mm(3) and 389,000/mm(3) (mean: 104,099 standard deviation: 58,776). Mean hepatic venous pressure gradient was 15.2 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 6.4 mm Hg (range: 1 to 29 mm Hg). Simple linear regression analysis was applied to verify an association of hepatic venous pressure gradient and platelet serum levels, revealing a weak correlation between both variables. We observed a progressive reduction of serum platelet levels as esophageal varices diameter increased and hepatocellular function (established by Child-Pugh classification) decreased. However, these findings did not reach statistical significance.Despite the lack of a statistical significant correlation among serum platelet levels and hepatic venous pressure gradient or hepatocellular function, there was a clear tendency indicating that those variables could be involved in the pathogenesis of low platelet levels.
