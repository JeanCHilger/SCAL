Experimental study on the effects of sclerosants for esophageal varices on blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and systemic hemodynamics. The effects of five sclerosants used for treating esophageal varices on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, systemic hemodynamics, and vascular endothelial cells were studied in mongrel dogs. With each sclerosant, hemolysis and a decrease in the platelet count were observed. Changes in the blood coagulation system occurred immediately after sclerosant administration. Prolongation of the PT and APTT and decreases in fibrinogen and alpha 2-PI were seen in the thrombin (TH), sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), and ethanolamine oleate (EO) groups. Polidocanol (PO) and absolute ethanol (ET) had less pronounced effects on these systems. A transient decrease in the cardiac index (CI), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary artery resistance (PAR) was observed with the administration of the sclerosants, especially in the TH and STS groups. Excessive vascular endothelial damage was observed in the ET group, marked damage was seen in the EO and STS groups and slight damage was recorded in the PO and TH groups.
