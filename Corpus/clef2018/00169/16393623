Predictive factors for portal hypertension in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterized by progressive destruction of bile ducts, which may lead to cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The factors associated with the presence of esophageal varices (EV) and the risk of bleeding have not been well defined.To determine the factors associated with the presence of EV and risk of bleeding in a cohort of patients with PSC.We analyzed the demographic, biochemical and endoscopic characteristics, and follow-up of 32 patients with a diagnosis of PSC. All patients underwent endoscopic evaluation to determine the presence of EV at diagnosis and annually during follow-up.There were 24 men (75%) and 8 women (25%). The mean age was 40.2 years (range, 19-66). At diagnosis, none of the patients had a previous history of variceal bleeding and 4 (13%) had EV on endoscopic examination. In bivariate analysis, the factors associated with the presence of EV were: splenomegaly (4/6 vs 0/26 p < 0.001), ascites (2/4 vs 0/24There are noninvasive indicators of portal hypertension that could predict the presence of EV and risk of bleeding in patients with PSC. The presence of thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly or worsening of liver function should be detected in these patients, as they could benefit from endoscopic surveillance.
