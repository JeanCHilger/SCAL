A modified reconstruction method to prevent critical complications after pancreatoduodenectomy. A new method of reconstructing the pancreatic stump after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is necessary to improve the postoperative mortality rate. Thus, we modified the pancreatoenteric procedure to reduce anastomotic leakage from the pancreatic stump after PD, and we conducted a study to evaluate the usefulness of the new procedure on the basis of patients' postoperative condition.We compared the postoperative condition of 21 patients who underwent PD with the new separated loop (SL) reconstruction (6 men, 11 women mean age, 67.7+/-7.2 years) to that of 31 patients (12 men, 19 womenA high level of amylase in drainage fluid was noted in two (6.5%) and delayed gastric emptying in four (12.9%) of the patients in the PG group. There were no complications in the SL group. Postoperative levels of ALB on POD 14 and T-CHO on POD 28 were significantly higher than in the PG group.The SL method is safe and does not induce complications after PD. Our results indicate that this method may provide a favored outcome.
