Gallstone ileus and cholecystoduodenal fistula. Case report. We report on a patient with gallstone ileus and cholecystoduodenal fistula at the Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI (IMSS) Mexico City, Mexico.A 54-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. He had undergone an appendectomy at 34 years of age. There was no history of biliary disease. He was afebrile, with moderate abdominal distention and right upper quadrant pain, Murphy (+). His white blood cell count was 8,900/mm(3) with 40% bands. His liver function tests, amylase and lipase, were all within normal limits. Ultrasound revealed edema and thickening of the gallbladder wall with calculi. He underwent exploratory surgery, which provided the following findings: sclerotrophic gallbladder with intense surrounding inflammation. We therefore decided to perform a cholecystostomy. Two days postoperatively the patient presented abdominal distention and vomiting as well as the presence of intestinal material through the cholecystostomy catheter. Plain abdominal film showed the bowel to be dilated and an aberrantly located gallstone. Cholecystography was performed and showed a cholecystoduodenal fistula. Computed tomography was carried out and disclosed the bowel to be slightly dilated and with an intraluminal gallstone. A laparotomy with enterolithotomy was performed. Sized of the gallstone found was approximately 3 cm. Presently the patient is asymptomatic.
