Congenital hepatic fibrosis associated with von Recklinghausen's disease. Congenital hepatic fibrosis is characterized by a ductal plate malformation with duct-like structures and fibrosis. It manifests clinically with portal hypertension and may be associated with multiple congenital defects. We present the case of a 16-year-old male with splenomegaly, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, esophageal varices, and a histopathological diagnosis of congenital hepatic fibrosis. He exhibits "caf√© au lait" spots and "Lisch" nodules, with a diagnosis of von Recklinghausen s disease. Congenital hepatic fibrosis belongs to the so-called fibropolycystic diseases, in which there is a disordered interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix. Von Recklinghausen s disease affects tissues derived from the neural crest and its diagnosis is based on clinical criteria. It is associated with multiple diseases. We describe its association with congenital hepatic fibrosis for the first time.
