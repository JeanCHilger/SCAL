Significance of hemostatic molecular markers during disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with liver cirrhosis treated by endoscopic embolization for esophageal varices. We studied the quantitative changes of hemostatic molecular markers with time during the course of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by endoscopic embolization using thrombin for esophageal varices in nine patients with liver cirrhosis. The plasma levels of D-dimer, a product of plasmin degradation of cross-linked fibrin, and thrombin-antithrombin-III complex (TAT) were significantly higher in patients before treatment when compared with 60 healthy individuals. The plasma levels of TAT, D-dimer, and plasmin alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) increased significantly 5-15 min after thrombin injection into the varices, earlier than the changes of conventional coagulofibrinolytic factors, reached a maximum level after 180 min, and started to decline after 1 day. Although the plasma PIC level returned to normal after 7 days, both TAT and D-dimer were still above the pretreatment level. Although there was no change in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) increased significantly after 5 min. The plasma level of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) showed only a slight elevation after treatment. We propose that the hemostatic molecular markers TAT, D-dimer, and PIC are suitable for the early diagnosis of DIC after endoscopic embolization using thrombin in patients with liver cirrhosis and that the increase of PAI-1 is too small for the regulation of fibrinolysis due to t-PA in DIC occurring in liver cirrhosis.
