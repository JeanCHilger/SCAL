Treatment of bleeding stomal varices by balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. Although stomal varices are a rare complication, bleeding stomal varices often need to be treated owing to symptoms of hypovolemic shock, recurrence of stomal bleeding, or deterioration in the quality of life. Various treatment strategies for the management of bleeding stomal varices have thus far been reported. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with refractory recurrent bleeding from varices in a sigmoid stoma, along with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and marked splenomegaly. A physical examination revealed that the skin was discolored and bluish around the circumference of the sigmoid stoma. The venous phase of a celiac arteriogram revealed an afferent vein from the splenic vein and another from the inferior mesenteric vein, and veins draining into the left superficial epigastric vein. A balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) procedure was performed. The skin around the stoma, initially discolored bluish, improved markedly. After 10 months of follow-up, the patient has remained well without further episodes of stomal bleeding. To our knowledge, this is the first case of recurrent hemorrhage from stomal varices that was successfully treated by BRTO in a patient with portal hypertension.
