Adult "idiopathic" extrahepatic venous thrombosis. Importance of putative "latent" myeloproliferative disorders and comparison with cases with known etiology. The etiology of extrahepatic venous obstruction (EHVO) is unknown in 50% of cases. Recently the presence of a "latent" myeloproliferative disorder has been reported in adults with "idiopathic" EHVO. We evaluated the course of these patients to establish if any putative latent myeloproliferative disorder influenced the clinical course compared to those with a known cause. Among 132 EHVO patients, 78 (59%) had a known etiology, 7 (5%) with an overt myeloproliferative disorder. The "idiopathic" group had 54 patients 24 (13 men, 11 women) were diagnosed after 15 years of age, (median 38 years, range 17-70) with a median follow up of 96 months (19-372). Only 2 (8%) developed an overt myeloproliferative disorder. These 24 had a similar pattern of bleeding and onset of ascites as those with known cause. In EHVO failure to diagnose a latent myeloproliferative disorder does not influence the course of variceal bleeding, and thus has little prognostic significance.
