Roux-en-Y drainage of the pancreatic stump decreases pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatic resection. Clinically relevant fistula after distal pancreatic resection occurs in 5-30% of patients, prolonging recovery and considerably increasing in-hospital stay and costs. We tested whether routine drainage of the pancreatic stump into a Roux-en-Y limb after distal pancreatic resection decreased the incidence of fistula. From October 2001, data of all patients undergoing pancreatic distal resection were entered in a prospective database. From June 2003 after resection, the main pancreatic duct and the pancreatic stump were oversewn, and in addition, anastomosed into a jejunal Roux-en-Y limb by a single-layer suture (n = 23). A drain was placed near the anastomosis, and all patients received octreotide for 5-7 days postoperatively. The volume of the drained fluid was registered daily, and concentration of amylase was measured and recorded every other day. Patient demographics, hospital stay, pancreatic fistula incidence (> or =30 ml amylase-rich fluid/day on/after postoperative day 10), perioperative morbidity, and follow-up after discharge were compared with our initial series of patients (treated October 2001-May 2003) who underwent oversewing only (n = 20). Indications, patient demographics, blood loss, and tolerance of an oral diet were similar. There were four (20%) pancreatic fistulas in the "oversewn" group and none in the anastomosis group (p < 0.05). Nonsurgical morbidity, in-hospital stay, and follow-up were comparable in both groups.
