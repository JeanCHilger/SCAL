Is portal vein cavernous transformation a component of congenital hepatic fibrosis? Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that belongs to the family of fibropolycystic liver diseases. This family includes a spectrum of disorders which are usually found in combination with each other and are usually inherited. Clinically fibropolycystic diseases have three effects being present in different proportions, those of a space occupying lesion, of portal hypertension and of cholangitis. In most patients, the first manifestations of CHF are signs and symptoms related to portal hypertension such as splenomegaly and varices. Portal hypertension in these patients has been attributed to the hypoplasia or compression of the portal vein radicles in the fibrous bands. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV) is a relatively rare condition resulting from extrahepatic portal vein obstruction with recanalization or collateral vein formation to bypass the obstruction. It has been found that patients with CHF having an accompanying CTPV have relatively large splenomegaly and suffers more frequent episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices. We believe that CTPV is a congenital component of CHF and also one of the important causative factors of portal hypertension in these patients.
