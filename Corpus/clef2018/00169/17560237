Use of autogenous saphenous vein as a conduit for mesenterico-left portal vein bypass. The authors describe a case of extrahepatic portal vein (EHPV) thrombosis and portal hypertension treated with a variant of mesenterico-left portal vein bypass (MLPVB) or Rex shunt. In this case, a segment of autogenous greater saphenous vein was used to bridge the distance between the left gastric vein inflow and the left portal vein. Use of such nontraditional conduit in similar circumstances may expand the application of portal revascularization/decompression procedures in treating these patients.
