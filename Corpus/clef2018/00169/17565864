Laparoscopic splenectomy and pericardial devascularization for treatment of portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) and pericardial devascularization in treatment of portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis.Twenty three cases with hepatitis B and schistosoma cirrhosis and portal hypertension underwent LS and paraesophagogastric devascularization performed by one treatment team. Follow-up was conducted for 9 months.LS combined with pericardial devascularization was successfully performed on these 20 cases. Three cases were converted to open surgery due to intra-operative bleeding. The mean operative time was 235 min (180 - 350), and mean intra-operative blood loss was 520 ml (200 - 1600 ml). All patients were treated with plasma transfusion, antibiotics, and abdominal drainage post-operatively. Peristalsis of stomach and intestine recovered 24 - 72 hours after operation. The mean hospitalization time was 8.5 days (6 - 17 days). The peri-operative complication included plural effusion in 3 cases and subphrenic abscess in one case, .mild ascites in two cases, and wound dehiscence in one case. No mortality occurred. Rebleeding rare was 0%.LS combined with pericardial devascularization is relatively safe and effective in treatment of portal hypertension due to liver cirrhosis. The keys to success include experienced laparoscopic skills, use of harmonic scalpel and careful manipulation.
