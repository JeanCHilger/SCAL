Preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stenting for prophylaxis of pancreatic duct disruption during extirpation of a pancreatic head tumor. Pancreatic fistula is a major problem in minimal invasive surgery of the pancreas. To prevent the disruption of the pancreatic duct, the surgeon must recognize the site of the pancreatic duct exactly.We reviewed the cases of 7 patients who underwent preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stenting for the prophylaxis of pancreatic fistula development after enucleation of a benign pancreatic head tumor.Preoperative endoscopic pancreatic stenting was successfully performed in all 7 patients. The level of serum amylase increased to 1500 IU/L on postoperative day 1, but levels recovered to normal within 3 days. None of the patients developed a pancreatic fistula.Preoperative pancreatic duct stenting is a feasible, effective, and safe technique to prevent pancreatic duct disruption during enucleation of a benign tumor of the pancreatic head.
