Plasma fibronectin concentrations in bleeder and non bleeder patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. This study was conducted on 40 patients with schistosomal hepatosplenomegaly and oesophageal varices "O.V.". They were divided into two groups: Group A were suffering from bleeding O.V and group B were non bleeders. Ten Healthy individuals were also included in the study as control group. Plasma fibronectin concentration was estimated in each subject using quantitative single radial immuno-diffusion technique. The results of the study showed that plasma fibronectin concentrations were significantly decreased in both groups of patients, bleeders (354.5 Mg/dl +/- 109.2) and non bleeders (307 +/- 103.5) compared to the control group (514 +/- 57.9). However, there was no significant difference in fibronectin concentration between group A and group B (p greater than 0.05). There was insignificant correlation between plasma fibronectin and some haemostatic estimations (clotting time, bleeding time and platelet count) in the studied groups (p greater than 0.05). Also, there was insignificant difference in fibronectin concentration in patients with (312 Mg +/- 116.4) and without (368.6 +/- 106.9) liver cell failure.
