Risk factors, predictors and prevention of pancreatic fistula formation after pancreatoduodenectomy. Although the operative mortality and morbidity associated with pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) has been decreasing, pancreatic fistula remains a potentially fatal complication. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors and predictors of pancreatic fistula formation, and ways to prevent this in a consecutive series of PD patients in a single institution.The association between pancreatic fistula formation and various clinical parameters was investigated in 50 patients who underwent PD at Kochi Medical School from January 1991 through February 2006.The incidence of pancreatic fistula in these patients was 28%. Multivariate analysis identified three independent factors correlated with the occurrence of pancreatic fistula: (1) absence of fibrotic texture of the pancreas examined intraoperatively (relative risk [RR], 1.6 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0Soft texture of the pancreas and increased serum amylase the day after PD are both risk factors with predictive value for pancreatic fistula. The incidence of fistula formation is reduced by early postoperative enteral nutrition.
