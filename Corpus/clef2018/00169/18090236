Evaluation of pancreatic exocrine secretion using 13C-dipeptide (benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-[1-(13)C]alanine) breath test: focusing on pancreatoduodenectomy cases. We investigated whether a breath test using benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-[1-(13)C]alanine (Bz-Tyr-Ala) allows assessment of pancreatic exocrine function.Benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-[1-(13)C]alanine was orally administered, and changes in (13)CO2 were expressed as delta per thousand. The breath test was performed in chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy subjects in a preliminary study and, subsequently, in 17 pancreatoduodenectomy patients, to examine the difference between the results obtained at the times of pancreatic tube insertion and removal, the relationship between breath test results after tube removal and the volume of pancreatic juice drained, and the difference in results between the presence versus the absence of histological changes of chronic pancreatitis.The delta per thousand was lower in the chronic pancreatitis patients than in healthy subjects. In the postoperative patients, the delta per thousand was higher at tube insertion than at tube removal. The correlations of the delta per thousand with the maximum volume of pancreatic juice, its mean volume, and pancreatic juice amylase levels were 0.865, 0.757, and 0.853, respectively. The delta per thousand was lower in 11 patients with that in 6 patients without histological changes of chronic pancreatitis.These results suggest that the Bz-Tyr-Ala breath test can measure pancreatic exocrine function.
