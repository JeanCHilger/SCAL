Non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis, an uncommon cause of portal hypertension - a case report. Most cases of portal hypertension follow chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) while non cirrhotic causes are occasionally seen. A case of portal hypertension secondary to non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis is reported. The patient was managed at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital Kano, Nigeria in the year 2006. She presented with recurrent massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding and was resuscitated, followed by clinical, radiological and endoscopic evaluation. She had massive splenomegaly and grade four oesophageal varices with evidence of recent bleed. There were, however, no other stigmata of chronic liver disease or portal hypertension. Abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed portal vein thrombosis. Splenectomy and ligation of short gastric veins was performed and the patient has not had any repeat episode of haematemesis or malaena six months post surgery.
