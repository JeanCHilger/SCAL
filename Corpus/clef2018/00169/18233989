Liver cirrhosis in HIV-infected patients: prevalence, aetiology and clinical outcome. Liver disease is frequently seen in HIV+ patients as a result of coinfection with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) viruses, alcohol abuse and/or exposure to hepatotoxic drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of liver cirrhosis, its main causes and clinical presentation in HIV+ patients. Observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study of all HIV+ individuals followed at one reference HIV outpatient clinic in Madrid. Liver fibrosis was measured in all cases using transient elastometry (FibroScan). All 2168 HIV+ patients on regular follow-up (76% males, 46% injecting drug users) were successfully examined by FibroScan) between October 2004 and August 2006. Liver cirrhosis was recognized in 181 (overall prevalence, 8.3%), and the main aetiologies were HCV, 82.3% HBV, 1.6%
