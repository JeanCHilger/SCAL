Living-related liver transplantation for cavernous transformation of portal vein: a clinical study of 3 cases. To review the outcomes of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) in treating 3 cases of cavernous transformation of portal vein (CTPV) with severe portal hypertension.Three children (two boys and one girl) were presented to our hospital with recurring esophageal variceal bleeding, decompensating ascites, splenomegaly and refractory anemia. CTPV was confirmed by intravenous computed tomographic portography using a helical computed tomography scanner and 3-dimensional image reconstruction. LRLT were performed in these 3 patients from July 2006 to January 2007. The evaluation of the outcomes was made by referring to their clinical features and laboratory and imaging examination findings.Although one patient died from early graft thrombosis, the other two patients showed excellent prognoses. They lived and stayed well during a follow-up period of 12-14 months. Following the transplantations, there had been no esophageal variceal hemorrhage, the ascites disappeared and the portal hypertension vanished. Their hemoglobin, blood platelets count, and serum albumin reached normal values.LRLT is an effective procedure in treating CTPV with severe portal hypertension. The reconstruction of the portal vein is the difficult part of the LRLT procedure.
