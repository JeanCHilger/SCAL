Predictive value of ultrasonography in portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is a common pathology in childhood and one of its most common causes is cavernomatosis of the portal vein. This obstruction causes hemodynamic changes which lead to splenomegaly and collateral circulation. Esophageal varices are one of the most important sequelae, which endanger the patient's life because of a bleeding tendency. Ecosonography helps to detect the thickening of the lesser omentum vis a vis the aortic diameter, caused by the collateral circulation. We studied 15 children presenting with portal hypertension resulting from portal vein cavernomatosis we performed an upper GI endoscopy and abdominal ecosonography. The endoscopy revealed grade II esophageal varices in 20% of cases, the remaining 80% had grade III and grade IV. Ecosonography revealed an increased lesser omentum/aorta ratio in children with portal hypertension, compared to controls (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that the lesser omentum/aorta ratio has diagnostic value in pediatric portal hypertension.
