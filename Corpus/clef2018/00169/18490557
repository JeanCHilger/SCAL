Implications and management of pancreatic fistulas following pancreaticoduodenectomy: the Massachusetts General Hospital experience. To describe the management and impact of pancreatic fistulas in a high-volume center.Retrospective case series.Tertiary academic center.Five hundred eighty-one consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy from January 2001 through June 2006.Development of a pancreatic fistula (defined as > 30 mL of amylase-rich fluid from drains on or after postoperative day 7, or discharge with surgical drains in place, regardless of amount) the need for additional interventions or total parenteral nutritionSeventy-five patients (12.9%) developed a pancreatic fistula. Fistulas were managed with gradual withdrawal of surgical drains. This allowed for patient discharge and eventual closure at a mean of 18 days in 38.7% of cases these were classified as low-impact fistulas. The remaining 46 patients (61.3%) had an associated abscess, required percutaneous drainage or total parenteral nutrition, or developed bleedingMore than one-third of pancreatic fistulas are clinically insignificant (low impact). The remaining 60% of fistulas have a high clinical impact and nearly an 8-fold increase in overall mortality.
