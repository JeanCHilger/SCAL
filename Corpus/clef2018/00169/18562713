Changes of portosystemic collaterals and splenic volume on CT after liver transplantation and factors influencing those changes. The objective of our study was to investigate the changes of portosystemic collaterals and splenic volume after liver transplantation and to determine the factors influencing those changes.Ninety-nine patients underwent liver CT before immediately after (< 2 weeks)All varices except splenic and retroperitoneal varices and splenic volume were significantly decreased on CT performed within 2 weeks after liver transplantation (p < 0.05). Approximately 2 months after liver transplantation, all varices except the esophageal varices and splenic volume became stable. The type of transplantation and the presence of postoperative adverse events did not affect the degree of change of varices or change in splenic volume. However, the rate of volume reduction of the spleen in LDLT was weakly but significantly correlated with the weight of the transplanted liver (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.401 p < 0.0001).Most varices and splenomegaly significantly decrease during the early postoperative period (< 2 months) after liver transplantation. Patients with large liver transplants undergo a greater decrease in spleen volume than patients with small liver transplants.
