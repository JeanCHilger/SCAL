A simple noninvasive score predicts gastroesophageal varices in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Guidelines recommend upper endoscopic screening of cirrhotic patients for gastroesophageal varices. Cirrhosis is not always distinguishable from chronic hepatitis.To identify low-risk patients who can be spared upper endoscopy irrespective of a diagnosis of cirrhosis.We evaluated 13 nonendoscopic variables as predictors of esophagogastric varices in 254 patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease who underwent upper endoscopy.Any size varices occurred in 30.3% (77/254), and large varices in 12.2% of patients (31/254). Age >50 years [odds ratio (OR): 11.29 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.33-54.67], platelet count <150,000/mmc (OR: 4.40Patients with chronic viral hepatitis and a score <2 need not undergo upper endoscopy, as they are unlikely to have large varices. Because about 50% of our patients had this score, 50% of upper endoscopies may be safely avoided.
