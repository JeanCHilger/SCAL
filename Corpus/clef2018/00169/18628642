Investigation of Helicobacter pylori colonization in pharyngeal and palatine tonsils with rapid urease test and immunohistochemical analysis. We investigated the presence and frequency of Helicobacter pylori in palatine and pharyngeal tonsil tissues of children.The study included 20 patients (15 males, 5 females mean age 8.2 yearsRapid urease test showed H. pylori colonization in the palatine and pharyngeal tonsil specimens of one patient (5%), whereas immunohistochemical analysis showed four H. pylori-positive patients (20%), whose pharyngeal tonsil (n=2) or palatine tonsil (n=2) specimens were individually affected.The presence of H. pylori in both palatine and pharyngeal tonsil tissues of children suggests that these tissues can be a reservoir for H. pylori.
