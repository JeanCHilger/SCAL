Partial splenic embolization for hypersplenism in cirrhosis: a long-term outcome in 62 patients. Although partial splenic embolization (PSE) has been widely used for treatment of leucocytopaenia and thrombocytopaenia in cirrhosis, only few studies on the correlation between splenic infarction rate and long-term outcome of partial splenic embolization have been reported so far.To evaluate long-term results of partial splenic embolization with different infarction rates in cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism.Sixty-two consecutive patients with hypersplenism in cirrhosis received partial splenic embolization. According to the splenic infarction rate after partial splenic embolization, the patients were divided into three groups: more than 70% in group A (n=12), 50-70% in group B (n=34), and less than 50% in group C (n=16). The post-partial splenic embolization following-up time was 5 years.Before partial splenic embolization, there were no significant differences among the three groups with respect to sex, age, splenic volume, Child-Pugh class, oesophageal varices, and peripheral blood cell counts. After partial splenic embolization, the short- and long-term outcomes of leucocyte and platelet counts showed significant difference among the three groups (P<0.001). In groups A and B, the leucocyte and platelet counts after partial splenic embolization remained significantly higher than those before partial splenic embolization for 2 weeks to 5 years (P<0.05), the post-partial splenic embolization leucocyte and platelet counts was even higher in group A than in group B while in group C, leucocyte and platelet count improvement only lasted for 6 months after partial splenic embolization. No significant changes were observed concerning blood red cell counts and liver function parameters after partial splenic embolization among the three groups. Severe complications occurred in six patients (50%) in group A and three patients (8.8%) in group B (P<0.05), while in group C, no severe complications developed.In partial splenic embolization, the splenic infarction rate should be limited to 50%-70% in order to ensure the long-term efficacy in alleviating hypersplenism and reduce complications.
