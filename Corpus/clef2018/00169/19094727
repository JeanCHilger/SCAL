A clinical study on splanchnic hemodynamic changes after orthotopic liver transplantation for patients with portal hypertension. To study the regularity of splanchnic hemodynamic changes after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for patients with portal hypertension. At the same time, effect of such changes on splenomegaly, hypersplenism, collateral circulation and the postoperative liver function was discussed.Between June 2002 and October 2005, 173 liver transplantations were performed. In 38 patients with portal hypertension undergoing OLT, the following parameters were measured before surgery and subsequently at 1, 3, 5, 7 days, 1, 6 months and 1, 2, 3 years after operation by using Color Doppler sonography: portal blood flow mean velocity (PBV), portal blood flow volume (PBF), hepatic artery resistance indexes (HA-RI) and spleen size. The same parameters were measured in 8 patients with acute liver failure and 20 healthy controls. Meanwhile to observe liver function and varicose vein of esophagus.In cirrhotics, PBV and PBF increased immediately after transplantation [from (13.7 +/- 4.2) cm/s to (58.4 +/- 25.2) cm/s and from (958 +/- 445) ml/min to (3024 +/- 1207) ml/min respectively, P < 0.05]. HA-RI also augmented [from (0.65 +/- 0.11) to (0.74 +/- 0.12), P < 0.05]. PBV returned to normal values after 6 months, PBF returned to normal value after 2 years. Spleen size decreased significantly, but splenomegaly persisted after 3 years. In addition the esophagogastric varix ameliorated significantly.Abnormal splanchnic hemodynamic changes for patients with portal hypertension still will long-term exist after OLT, but does not effect recovery of hypersplenism, esophagogastric varix and liver function.
