Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver: the importance of combined macroscopic and microscopic findings. A 40-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly and mild thrombocytopenia presented with gross ascites and a history of excess alcohol consumption. Oesophageal varices were documented endoscopically. Alcoholic cirrhosis was suspected and laparoscopy revealed a macronodular liver surface. Liver biopsy disclosed subtle microscopic structural variations which together with the laparoscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of nodular regenerative hyperplasia. The importance in diagnosis of macroscopic appearance combined with histological findings is emphasised. Clinically significant portal hypertension may be present at a histologically early stage of this condition.
