Chronic hemorrhagic pleural effusion in mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst. A 48-year-old patient is presented with chronic hemorrhagic pleural effusion due to a pancreatitis-induced pseudocyst. High levels of pleural fluid amylase and demonstration of the pseudocyst by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) provided the diagnosis. After chest tube draining for about two weeks curative surgery was undertaken.
