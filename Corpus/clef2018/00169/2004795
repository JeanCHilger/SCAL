Association of esophageal cancer and esophageal varices. Of the 312 cases of esophageal cancer seen over 2 years, four patients had associated varices. Three patients gave history of alcohol abuse. All had malnutrition and splenomegaly. Endoscopic biopsies were safe in the presence of varices. External radiation did not have any untoward effect on the varices. Prophylactic sclerotherapy was not required in these patients. The association between esophageal carcinoma and varices could be secondary to alcohol consumption or merely coincidental.
