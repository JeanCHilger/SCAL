T-tube duodenocholangiostomy for the management of duodenal fistulae. The tube decompression of the duodenum through an additional point of access of the duodenal wall or occasionally via the leak site decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with duodenal fistula. The objective of this paper is to present the detailed technique and clinical benefits of simplified duodenal and biliary decompression achieved by transampullary insertion of a T-tube with one-step duodenal closure for the prevention and/or treatment of duodenal leak.The duodenocholangiostomy using T-tube with laterally perforated long duodenal limb was performed preventively in 4 patients and as a secondary procedure for septic duodenal leak in another selected 12. The mean output from the fistula, length of hospital stay, incidence of pancreatitis, as well as any postoperative septic events was recorded. The nutritional schedule during the in early postoperative period also was analyzed.The outcome was favorable for all patients. The mean length of hospital stay was 19 days. Septic events, such as wound or urinary tract infections, were observed in 30% of patients. Serum amylase and lipase activity was increased in two patients without a clinical picture of pancreatitis. Mean volume of T-tube duodenocholangiostomy drainage was approximately 500 ml per day during the first postoperative week. Enteral feeding was commenced 10-52 (mean, 21) hours after surgery and was followed by the initiation of normal diet on average 5 days postoperatively.Duodenocholangiostomy performed for duodenal decompression may be a promising alternative to classical tube duodenostomy for selected patients however, further studies should be made to evaluate fully its practical value.
