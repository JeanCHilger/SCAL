Comparative study between different schedules for sclerosing oesophageal varices. There were no significant differences between the one week and the 2 weeks interval groups with regard to total number of sclerotherapy sessions, total volume of the sclerosant used (5% ethanolamine oleate) or rate of complications such as pyrexia, stricture ulcer and/or slough formation. Neither early nor recurrent bleeding occurred in any patient in the two (2) groups. Eradication of varices in the 2-week interval group was achieved significantly earlier (P less than 0.05) than in the one week interval group.
