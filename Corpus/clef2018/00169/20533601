Post-gastrectomy spleen enlargement and esophageal varices: distal vs total gastrectomy. To study the relationship between platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio and post-gastrectomy esophageal varices (EVs) development in patients without liver cirrhosis or hepatitis.We retrospectively studied 92 patients who underwent gastrectomy. They were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the surgical treatment: the distal gastrectomy (DG) group and total gastrectomy (TG) group. The incidence of EVs was determined and postoperative platelet counts, spleen diameters, and platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratios were compared between the 2 groups.EVs were not detected during the first 6 mo after surgery in either group however, at 12 mo after surgery, EVs were detected in 2 patients (3%) in the DG group and in 1 patient (3.6%) in the TG groupEndoscopy should be performed to detect EVs when the platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio is < 2600.
