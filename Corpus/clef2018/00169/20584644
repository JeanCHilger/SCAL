Clinical features of panereatic disease-associated portal hypertension. To investigate the clinical features and management of pancreatic disease-associated portal hypertension.A retrospective analysis was carried out in patients with portal hypertension and concurrent pancreatic diseases. The medical records of these patients were reviewed including the data of demographics, etiologies, venous involvement, clinical presentations, laboratory tests, imaging studies, therapeutic modalities and outcomes.Fifty-two patients with portal hypertension resulting from pancreatic diseases were found in our hospital, accounting for 4% of all the patients with portal hypertension in 11 years. The underlying pancreatic diseases were chronic pancreatitis (21 cases, 35.6%), pancreatic carcinoma (20 cases, 33.9%), acute pancreatitis (8 cases, 13.6%), pancreatic pseudocyst (3 cases, 5.1%). Of the 40 patients whose venous involvement was identified, splenic vein obstruction occurred in 27 cases (67.5%) and portal vein obstruction in 16 cases (40.0%). Mild or moderate splenomegaly was present in 48 cases (81.4%), with leukocytopenia as the most common manifestation of the 31 cases (52.5%) with concomitant hypersplenism. Forty-five patients (76.3%) developed gastroesophageal varices (including 35 with isolated gastricvarices), and among them 22 experienced bleeding (42.3%). Conservative treatment was effective in controlling acute bleeding, but could not prevent re-bleeding. Splenectomy was performed in 18 patients mainly due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. No postoperative bleeding occurred during the follow-up ranging from 8 months to 9 years.Pancreatic diseases may compromise portal vein and its tributaries, leading to generalized or regional portal hypertension. Pharmacological therapy can effectively control acute variceal bleeding, while surgical treatment is the appropriate procedure of choice in case of hemorrhagic recurrence.
