Early versus late drain removal after standard pancreatic resections: results of a prospective randomized trial. The role of surgically placed intra-abdominal drainages after pancreatic resections has not been clearly established. In particular, their effect on morbidity rates and the optimal timing for their removal remains controversial.A total of 114 eligible patients who underwent standard pancreatic resections and at low risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula according to our institutional protocol (amylase value in drains < or =5000 U/L on postoperative day [POD] 1) were randomized on POD 3 to receive either early (POD 3) or standard drain removal (POD 5 or beyond). The primary end point of the study was the incidence of pancreatic fistula. Secondary endpoints included abdominal complications, pulmonary complications, in-hospital stay, and perioperative mortality. Cost-analysis between the 2 groups was also made.Early drain removal was associated with a decreased rate of pancreatic fistula (P = 0.0001), abdominal complications (P = 0.002), and pulmonary complications (P = 0.007). Median in-hospital stay was shorter (P = 0.018), and hospital costs decreased (P = 0.02). Mortality was nil. A significant association with pancreatic fistula was found for timing of drain removal (P < 0.001), unintentional weight decrease before surgery (P = 0.022), type of pancreas texture (P = 0.015), serum amylase levels on POD 1 (P = 0.001), and albumin levels on POD 1 (P = 0.039). Multivariate analysis showed that timing of drain removal (P = 0.0003) and unintentional weight decrease before surgery (P = 0.02) were independent risk factors of pancreatic fistula.In patients at low risk of pancreatic fistula, intra-abdominal drains can be safely removed on POD 3 after standard pancreatic resections. A prolonged period of drain insertion is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications with increased hospital stay and costs. The manuscript is a randomized trial, registered in the NLM database as NCT00931554.
