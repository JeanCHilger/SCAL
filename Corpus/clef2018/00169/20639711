Quality of life in children managed for extrahepatic portal venous obstruction. There are no studies on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO). The present study evaluated the QOL in children with EHPVO, prevariceal and postvariceal esophageal variceal eradication, and postsurgery in comparison with healthy controls.Children with EHPVO and variceal bleeding were divided into 3 groups: group A, before variceal eradication (n = 50) group B, after variceal eradication (n = 50)Compared with controls, patients with EHPVO in groups A, B, and C had lower median QOL scores in physical, emotional, social, and school functioning health domains. Esophageal variceal eradication had no significant effect on QOL (median total QOL score pre- and postvariceal eradication of 87.5 vs 86.3). Increasing size of spleen (mild 92.5, moderate 88.2, and severe 76.2 P < 0.001), presence of hypersplenism (90 vs 73.7, P = 0.001), and growth retardation (90 vs 82.5, P = 0.04) caused significant reduction of the total QOL score. On multivariate regression analysis, splenic size and growth retardation were found to be independent predictors that affect the QOL. After surgery, a trend toward improvement in physical, psychosocial, and total QOL scores was present, but it was not significant.Children with EHPVO have a poor QOL that is not affected by variceal eradication. Splenomegaly and growth retardation significantly affect the HRQOL. A trend toward improvement of QOL scores is observed in the postsurgery group.
