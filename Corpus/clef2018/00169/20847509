Idiopathic portal hypertension in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease and protein C deficiency. We report a 29-year-old woman with a 2.5 year history of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) who developed idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) and thrombocytopenia as a result of hypersplenism. She had recurrent esophagogastric variceal rupture. Hematological examination also revealed low levels of protein C activity. The liver biopsy specimen showed non-specific mild inflammation and no thrombi. However, portal vein thrombosis developed after splenectomy. This was a rare case of severe complications of IPH accompanying MCTD and protein C deficiency.
