Quantitative measurement of group B streptococcal antibodies (serotypes Ia, Ib, II and III) in human cord sera by the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cervical and vaginal carriage of group B streptococci (GBS) is normally associated with an appropriate immune response confining these organisms to a commensal state in this human habitat. A newly developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay compares the antibody responses against two antigen preparations of GBS-serotypes Ia, Ib, II and III in the cord sera of cervico-vaginal GBS-carriers and non-carriers during pregnancy. Antibody responses in GBS-positive women against both antigen preparations were found to be significantly higher than in GBS-negative women (p less than 0.005). Antibody levels towards the EDTA-antigen were markedly lower than levels for the HCl-antigen thus indicating two different antibody responses.
