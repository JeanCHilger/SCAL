Frequency and characteristic features of portal hypertensive gastropathy in patients with viral cirrhosis. To determine the frequency and specific characteristic features of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) in cirrhosis due to viral etiology.Cross-sectional descriptive study.The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from June 2006 till June 2008.Patients with hepatitis B and C cirrhosis were included who underwent screening esophago-gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for varices. Baveno III consensus statement was used for diagnosing PHG on endoscopy and divided them into two subgroups i.e. mild and severe. Data related to platelet/spleen ratio, MELD score and Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) score indicating severity of cirrhosis were recorded in all patients. Findings were compared by using independent sample t-test.Out of 360 patients who underwent screening EGD, 226 (62.8%) were males. Two hundred and eighty one (78%) had hepatitis C while 79 (22%) suffered from hepatitis B related cirrhosis. Three hundred patients (83.3%) had PHG while 71 (24%) had severe PHG. Higher proportion of esophageal varices (89.7%) was present among those who had PHG (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis lower platelet counts (117±55 vs. 167±90 p < 0.001), increased spleen size (14.1±2.9 cm vs. 12±2.4cmFrequency of PHG was 83% while severe PHG was seen in 24% cases of viral hepatic cirrhosis. MELD score > 12, CTP score ³ 8 and platelets/spleen ratio < 900 were significant factors of severe PHG.
