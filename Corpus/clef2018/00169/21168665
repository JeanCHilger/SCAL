Incidence and treatment of pancreatic fistula after simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation. Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) is associated with great postoperative morbidity, including the need for relaparotomy in up to 40% of cases. Because the pancreatic graft is known to be the major cause of the high morbidity, we examined the incidence and treatment of pancreatic fistula (PF) in this retrospective analysis.From January 2004 to July 2010, we transplanted 52 pancreas grafts, including 50 SPK, 1 pancreas after kidney, and 1 pancreas transplantation alone. There were 22 female and 30 male patients with an overall mean age of 42.4 ± 7.4 years. The mean duration of diabetes was 27.3 + 8.1 years, mean duration of dialysis was 24.2 ± 28.6 months, and 14 cases were pre-emptive transplantations. All procedures were performed using systemic venous and enteric drainage.The incidence of clinically relevant PF was 16/52 (30.8%), including 11 (68.8%) that were treated conservatively with a drain. Five patients (31.2%) needed relaparotomy: 2 due to enteric leakage, 2 due to acute abdominal pain with graft pancreatitis observed at laparotomy, and 1 due to acute hemorrhage. In 3 cases, graft pancreatectomy was necessary. Comparing the patients with (PF+) versus without (PF-) fistulas, there was no significant difference in cold ischemia time (10.9 ± 2.6 hours vs 10.4 ± 4.4 hours P = .633), donor age. We found a significantly higher peak C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the patients with pancreatic fistula (3661.4 ± 3474.8 U/L vs 821.8 ± 1293.7 U/L, P = .022). The lipase concentration measured in the drainage fluid postoperatively showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (3661.4 ± 3474.8 U/L vs 821.8 ± 1293.7 U/LThe incidence of PF after pancreas transplantation is high and seems to be associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury reflected by peak-CRP. In most cases a conservative treatment is successful. The occurrence of a PF does not significantly impair graft survival.
