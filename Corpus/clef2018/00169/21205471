Efficacy of endoscopic variceal ligation and its correlation with liver function. To analyze the efficacy of endoscopic variceal ligation and its correlation with liver function.322 patients received EVL (endoscopic variceal ligation) and 34 patients with PDP (pericardial devascularization procedure) were retrospectively analyzed and divided into groups A, B and C. These patients were then subdivided into bleeding and non-bleeding subgroups according to Child-Pugh scores of liver function and history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding rate and mortality were contrasted between EVL and PDP. Liver function, Platelet count, leucocyte count and spleen thickness of before and after ligation were contrasted in EVL.The bleeding rate and mortality were 1.7%, 3.4%, 7.0% 0%, 5.1%, 8.1% in EVL group and 9.1%, 14.3%, 100.0%The efficacy of EVL was significantly negatively correlated with liver function and prior to pericardial devascularization procedure. EVL had no effect on liver function but might increase spleen thickness and aggravate hypersplenism. EVL was recommended especially for the bleeding liver cirrhosis patients with Child B and C scores.
