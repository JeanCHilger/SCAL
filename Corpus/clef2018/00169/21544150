Evaluation of the diagnostic test of index platelet counts / size spleen, as a predictor of the presence of esophageal varices in cirrhosis. To evaluate the platelet count/spleen diameter (PC/SD) ratio as a non invasive diagnostic test to predict esophageal varices (VE) in patients with cirrhosis.Diagnostic test study, retrospective analysis. Data was collected from patients with diagnosis of liver cirrhosis at gastrointestinal unit of Hospital Nacional Daniel Alcides Carri√≥n between September 2010 and January 2011. Using a PC/SD ratio with a cut off value of 909, sensitivity, specificity, Positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculate.There were 47 patients mean age of 60,74The PC/SD ratio was not an effective diagnostic test for esophageal varices.
