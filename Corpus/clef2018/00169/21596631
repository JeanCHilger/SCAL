Non-invasive methods can predict oesophageal varices in patients with biliary atresia after a Kasai procedure. After a Kasai procedure, 70% of patients with biliary atresia develop chronic liver disease with portal hypertension and oesophageal varices.To investigate the role of new non-invasive parameters in predicting the presence of varices in patients with biliary atresia after a Kasai procedure and to identify the cut-off values of these parameters in predicting the presence of varices.31 patients with biliary atresia who had undergone a Kasai portoenterostomy were studied. Clinical, biochemical and abdominal ultrasound examination, liver stiffness measurement (LSM), LSM-spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) and upper digestive endoscopy were performed.15 (47%) patients had oesophageal varices (Group A) and 16 had no varices (Group B). Median values of LSM (kPa) and LSPS were significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (LSM: 17.0 vs. 7.5, respectively p=0.0001Non-invasive methods can predict the presence of oesophageal varices in patients with biliary atresia the sequential use of two non-invasive methods improves accuracy.
