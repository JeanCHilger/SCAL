Distal pancreatectomy with duct-to-mucosa pancreaticogastrostomy: a novel technique for preventing postoperative pancreatic fistula. Management of the pancreatic remnant after distal pancreatectomy remains a clinically relevant problem and a significant clinical challenge. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of duct-to-mucosa pancreaticogastrostomy for preventing pancreatic fistula development after distal pancreatectomy.Twenty-one patients underwent distal pancreatectomy using the duct-to-mucosa pancreaticogastrostomy and the clinical data were collected prospectively. Pancreatic fistula was defined and classified according to the international study group definition.The median surgical time was 236 minutes, with a median intraoperative blood loss of 250 mL. Morbidity was 5% and mortality was nil. The postoperative pancreatic fistula rate of clinically relevant grade B or C fistulae was 0%, although the biochemical grade A fistula rate was 29%. Delayed gastric emptying developed in only 1 patient (5%).Duct-to-mucosa pancreaticogastrostomy may be a safe and effective technique for preventing pancreatic fistula development after distal pancreatectomy when performed by experienced surgeons who are skilled in this technique.
