Prediction of esophageal varices in hepatic cirrhosis by noninvasive markers. To determine whether Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification, AST to platelet ratio index (APRI), and laboratory tests could predict the presence of esophageal varices (EV) or varices which need prophylactic therapy (medium or large size EV).Three hundred patients with cirrhosis (193 men mean age 53.1 yearsOne hundred and seventy-one patients (57%) had EV, of whom 35% (105) had varices which need prophylactic therapy (VPT). The distribution of EV according to CTP classification was as follows: A, 49% B, 75.3% and C, 80%. Independent predictors of EV were: MELD higher than 8 (P=0.02)High values on MELD are associated with EV and thrombocytopenia, with varices which need prophylactic therapy. As a result of their low sensitivity and specificity, it is suggested to maintain the recommendation of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for all patients with cirhosis.
