Indicators of complications and drain removal after pancreatoduodenectomy. Significance and timing of drain removal after pancreatic surgery remain unclear. The aim of this study was to identify optimal indicators to predict severe intra-abdominal complications and determine the appropriate timing of prophylactic drain removal after pancreatoduodenectomy.This study included 151 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. We investigated associations between postoperative intra-abdominal complications, drain amylase levels, and duration of postoperative inflammatory response.Patients who developed severe intra-abdominal complications showed re-elevation of drain amylase levels after postoperative d 3 and prolonged postoperative inflammatory response, which were most pronounced in patients with severe pancreatic fistula and intra-abdominal abscess, respectively. In contrast, patients with a steady decline in drain amylase levels and short-term postoperative inflammatory response did not develop severe complications, and safe drain removal was possible even when the drain amylase value was more than three times the upper limit of normal serum amylase.A combination of trends in the drain amylase level and duration of the inflammatory response in the postoperative period may be optimal indicators for early detection of severe intra-abdominal complications and appropriate timing of drain removal.
