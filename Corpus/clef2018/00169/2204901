Throat culture or rapid strep test? Clearly, rapid tests for streptococci identification are here to stay, and development of the technology is likely to continue. The most rational use of these tests is to identify streptococcal pharyngitis when patients have severe symptoms or when special situations warrant early detection. Throat culture alone is sufficient for most other patients, and all negative rapid tests should be confirmed by throat culture. Specific antistreptococcal therapy should be initiated if either the rapid test or culture is positive. If the physician decides on the basis of clinical criteria to treat pharyngitis with an antibiotic that covers group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, a rapid test is not necessary. If confirmation of the infection is warranted in these cases, throat culture alone should suffice. No rapid strep test kit clearly outperforms others. With any test, good results depend on the quality of the specimen.
