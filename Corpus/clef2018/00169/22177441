Binding pancreatic duct to mucosa anastomosis. To study the feasibility of binding pancreatic duct to mucosa anastomosis (BDM)-a complementary procedure to both binding pancreaticojejunostomy and binding pancreaticogastrostomy.(1) Animal experimental study:gastrostomy and jejunostomy were performed on six adult New Zealand rabbits. The gastrostomy and jejunostomy shared a same stent (rubber urethral catheter, silicone tube or plastic infusion tube). Both ends of the stent were placed in gastric and enteric cavity. Purse-string suture was performed around the stent before the jejunum and the stomach were brought together for fixation by few stitches. And to observe whether the purse-string suture around a plastic tube, rubber tube or silicon tube inserted into jejunum and/or stomach can prevent leaking out of the jejunal or gastric content to cause peritonitis. (2) Clinically 7 patients were performed with BDM anastomosis. The procedure was consisted of five steps: preparation of the pancreatic stumppreparation of the jejunumAnimal experiment did not show any leakage around the plastic tube or silicon tube inserted into jejunum and(or) stomach. There was no anastomotic leak in all the patients. There was transient increase of amylase in two cases, but the volume of drainage did not exceed 50 ml/d and the recovery of the patients was not affected.BDM is a simple, safe and easy procedure to perform. It provides to the surgeons with a new option in different situations to achieve the most ideal surgical result.
