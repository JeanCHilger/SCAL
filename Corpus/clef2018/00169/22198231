Endoscopic findings and clinical significance of portal hypertensive colopathy. The endoscopic findings and clinical relevance of portal hypertensive colopathy are not well described in Korea. We aimed to do a retrospective study of mucosal changes in the colon of patients with liver cirrhosis and to find their association with clinical characteristics.We reviewed the clinical data and endoscopic findings of 48 patients with liver cirrhosis and 48 patients, matched for age and sex, with irritable bowel disease (IBS) who underwent colonoscopy over a 5 year span.Patients with liver cirrhosis were more likely to have colitis-like lesions and vascular abnormalities than IBS patients. Low platelet count (p=0.005) and severe esophageal varices (p=0.011) were associated with portal hypertensive colopathy, whereas the etiologies and severity of cirrhosis were not associated with these findings.Portal hypertensive colopathy can be defined with colitis-like lesions or vascular lesions. These lesions are more frequently present in patients with more severe esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia.
