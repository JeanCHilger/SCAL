Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio for non-invasive diagnosis of oesophageal varices: is it useful in compensated cirrhosis? To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio for identification of oesophageal varices and/or hypertensive gastropathy in patients with compensated cirrhosis.Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio was calculated in 87 consecutive patients with compensated cirrhosis. A new cut-off with the highest sensitivity and specificity for the presence/absence of oesophageal varices and/or hypertensive gastropathy was identified. Performance of the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio considering previously reported cut-off values were then tested in our population.A platelet count/spleen diameter ratio <936.4 had the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of oesophageal varices and for all endoscopic findings of portal hypertension. A value lower than 936.4 allowed identification of 64.5% of patients with oesophageal varices and 66.7% of patients with any sign of portal hypertension a value higher than 936.4 excluded oesophageal varices in 64.3% of patients and any sign of portal hypertension in 68.6% of patients.In patients with compensated cirrhosis, the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio is not a useful parameter to avoid unnecessary upper endoscopy, independently of the cut-off.
