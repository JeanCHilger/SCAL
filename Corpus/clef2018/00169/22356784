Risk factors for in-hospital mortality in cirrhotic patients with oesophageal variceal bleeding. Oesophageal variceal bleeding (OVB) is a high mortality rate complication in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for in-hospital mortality (IHM) in cirrhotic patients with OVB.The study cohort included 102 patients (average age, 55.4 Â± 12.6 years, 71.6% men) consecutively admitted to our hospital with OVB. All the patients underwent upper endoscopy within 12 h and octeotride or terlipressin therapy was started at admission and continued for 5 days. To calculate Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores, laboratory test data from blood samples taken within 6 h of admission were used.The IHM was 18.6% [19 patients confidence interval (95% CI): 11.1-26.2%]. In the univariate analysis, transfusion with 2 or more units of packed red blood cells [PRBCCirrhotic patients with OVB and MELD of 18 or more, platelets of 100/ml or less and requiring transfusion of 2 or more units of PRBC were at an increased risk of IHM. Overall, the logistic regression model correctly predicts 82.2% of IHM patients.
