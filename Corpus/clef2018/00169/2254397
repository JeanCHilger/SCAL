Caroli's disease associated with liver cirrhosis. An autopsy case. Caroli's disease is one of the rare congenital conditions associated with the cystic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts. This is a case report of a 41-year-old Japanese male who complained of jaundice and general fatigue at the age of 34 for the first time. He was clinically diagnosed as having Caroli's disease by physical examination and image analyses study. The patient died after seven years and three months from the onset of the disease on account of renal function impairment. An autopsy was performed, revealing cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct, associated with a cirrhotic liver and also evidence of portal hypertension, substantiated by esophageal varices and splenomegaly. The liver weighed approximately 2,200 g. A histological investigation revealed typical morphological evidence of cirrhotic glomerulopathy and tubular degeneration with the presence of calcium casts in the dilated tubuli. The lung revealed diffuse alveolar damage with partial organization associated with remarkable polymorphonuclear and macrophagic infiltration. In this paper, the pathogenesis of the cirrhotic change, biliary duct abnormality and potential malignant transformation in the liver are discussed in relation to Caroli's disease.
