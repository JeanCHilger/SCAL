Pancreatico-pleural fistula. Clinical aspects and therapy of a rare disease entity. We report of 2 patients with pancreatic-pleural fistulas in chronic pancreatitis. In both cases abdominal symptoms were missed, the primary clinical manifestation was a recurrent pleural effusion with a high content of amylase. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography is necessary for a precise evaluation of the fistula and is indispensable to the surgical therapy. Computed tomography and ultrasonography showed in both cases a pancreatic pseudocyst. Our recommendation is surgical therapy when the fistula is not closed spontaneously within 2 weeks. Both patients were successfully treated by a left pancreatectomy.
