Totally laparoscopic stapled distal pancreatectomy. To evaluate the outcomes of totally laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP).A prospective database of patients treated within a single institution was studied retrospectively. Between March 2003 and January 2010, 15 patients underwent pancreatic transection with the use of a stapler, followed by sealing of the pancreatic stump with fibrin-coated collagen fleece (TachoComb) in LDP.LDP was completed successfully in all 15 patients. The median operating time and blood loss were 168 min (range 105-213 min) and 36 ml (range 12-89 ml), respectively. The median drain amylase level peaked at 969 IU/l (93-3077 IU/l) on postoperative day (POD) 1, and then dropped to 165 IU/l (30-846 IU/l) on POD 3. The median hospital stay was 7 days (range 4-15 days). Biochemical pancreatic leaks developed in three patients (20 %), but there was no clinical pancreatic fistula or postoperative hemorrhage.Our study shows that the combined use of a stapler and TachoComb decreased the incidence of pancreatic fistulas after LDP. This procedure offers more efficient and consistent results than those achieved by closing the pancreatic stump by stapling alone.
