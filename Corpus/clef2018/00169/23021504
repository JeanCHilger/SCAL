Less-invasive MR indices of clinically evident esophageal variceal bleeding in biliary atresia patients. Esophageal variceal hemorrhaging is potentially life threatening for long-term survivors of biliary atresia. We evaluated the feasibility of less-invasive parameters for predicting the presence of clinically significant esophageal variceal bleeding in biliary atresia patients.A total of 30 patients aged 108-5314 days (median = 285 days) with biliary atresia underwent a magnetic resonance examination with fast spin-echo T2-weighted imaging and spin-echo, T1-weighted images with fat saturation after use of a contrast medium on a 1.5-tesla scanner. The splenic length-platelet ratio was divided by the each patient's body height (m) to produce the corrected splenic length-platelet ratios. In addition, the splenic volume index-to-platelet count ratio was divided by the patient's body weight (kg) to produce a corrected ratio.The corrected splenic length-platelet ratio was more significantly increased in 21 patients with esophageal variceal bleeding (Group A) than in nine patients without variceal bleeding [(Group B) 0.98 ± 0.64 vs. 0.44 ± 0.18, p < 0.01]. The splenic volume index-to-platelet count ratio corrected by body weight was significantly larger in Group A (510.7 ± 536.2) than in Group B (148.1 ± 88.9, p < 0.01).Less-invasive indices, including the corrected splenic length platelet ratio and the splenic volume index-to-platelet count ratio, may be valuable predictors of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with biliary atresia.
