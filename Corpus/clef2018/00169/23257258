Natural course of splenic artery aneurysm with associated spontaneous splenorenal shunt in non-cirrhotic liver: an 18-year observational follow-up and review of literature. Through a review of the literature, a splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) with associated spontaneous splenorenal shunt (SSRS) was only reported in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, a natural course of a SAA with associated SSRS was found in a non-cirrhotic male patient during an 8-year observational follow-up, and thus reported. Initially, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia were noted SSRS was observed later with a tortuous dilated splenic artery, and a SAA was then progressively formed and found. The patient received splenectomy with aneurysm resection and SSRS was preserved. Post-operative follow-up revealed that the size of the SSRS was reduced. Through the course, no abnormalities of liver enzymes, portal hypertension, or esophageal-gastric varicose were found in the patient. No positive association was demonstrated between the formation of SSRS and the severity of liver cirrhosis in patients, implying some other factors, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mentioned in the literature, might be involved.
