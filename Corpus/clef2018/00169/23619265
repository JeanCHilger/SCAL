Association of amino acid imbalance with the severity of liver fibrosis and esophageal varices. The relationships between the metabolic parameters and the endoscopic findings of esophageal varices have been poorly investigated. We investigated the association of the branched-chain amino acids to tyrosine ratio (BTR) with the severity of liver fibrosis and esophageal varices.We studied hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive chronic liver disease patients who had undergone liver biopsy (n = 149). The relationship between the BTR values and the liver fibrotic stage was investigated. We also studied whether the BTR value was associated with the presence and bleeding risk of varices in patients with HCV-related compensated cirrhosis.The mean values of the BTR decreased with the progression of the fibrosis (METAVIR score: F0-1: 6.40 ± 1.19 F2: 5.85 ± 1.33A decreased BTR value was found to be associated with the progression of liver fibrosis and severity of varices.
