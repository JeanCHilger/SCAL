Natural history of intra-abdominal fluid collections following pancreatic surgery. Little data are available for non-abscess abdominal fluid collections (AFCs) after pancreatic surgery and their clinical implications. We sought to analyze the natural history of such collections in a population of patients subject to routine postoperative imaging.From 1995 to 2011, 709 patients underwent pancreatic resections and routine postoperative monitoring with abdominal ultrasound according to a unit protocol. AFCs were classified as asymptomatic (no interventional treatment), symptomatic (need for percutaneous drainage of sterile, amylase-poor fluid), and pancreatic fistula (drainage of amylase-rich fluid).Ninety-seven of 149 AFCs (65 %) were asymptomatic and resolved spontaneously after a median follow-up of 22 days (interquartile range, 9-52 days). Among 52 (35 %) AFCs requiring percutaneous drainage, there were 20 pancreatic fistulas and 32 symptomatic collections. A stepwise logistic regression model identified three factors associated with the need for interventional treatment, i.e., body mass index â‰¥25 (odds ratio, 3.23 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.32 to 7.91), pancreatic fistula (odds ratio, 2.93One fourth of patients develop various types of non-abscess AFCs after pancreatic surgery. Around half of them are asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously.
