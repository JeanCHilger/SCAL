Intraperitoneal drainage after pancreatic resection: a review of the evidence. Despite a growing body of literature supporting the limited use of prophylactic intra-abdominal drainage for many procedures, drain placement after pancreatic resection remains commonplace and highly controversial.Literature available in the PubMed was systematically reviewed by searching using combinations of keywords and citations in review articles regarding prophylactic drainage after pancreatic resection, early removal of intraoperatively placed drains after pancreatic resections, and risk factors and predictive tools for pancreatic fistula.Prospective randomized studies on prophylactic drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy have not shown any benefit in decreasing pancreatic fistula, total complications, length of hospital stay, or readmission rates. Frequency of complications was significantly higher in patients receiving routine drainage. This was recently supported by retrospective studies however, patients with risk factors for pancreatic fistula (soft pancreatic texture, prolonged operative times, and increased blood loss) were more likely to have prophylactic intra-abdominal drainage. Alternatively, if a drain is placed, prospective randomized studies demonstrate that early removal is safe in patients with postoperative day 1 drain amylase values <5000 U/L and associated with a lower rate of fistula.The current literature supports a strategy of selective drainage and early drain removal after pancreatic resection in low-risk patients.
