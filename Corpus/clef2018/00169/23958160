The effect of drainage in cavities on preventing from grade B and C of the pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. To explore the effect of drainage in cavities on preventing from grade B and C of the pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).From June 2008 to June 2010, the medical team had performed the operations of digestive tract reconstruction by the same way in 68 cases with PD. There were 43 male and 25 female patients, with a mean age of (64 ± 3) years. The patients were simply randomly divided into drainage in cavities group (DC, n = 32) and conventional drainage group (CD, n = 36) according to the different drainage way. The methods of drainage in cavities were composed of three aspects which include drainage in main pancreatic duct, drainage around cholecystojejunostomy anastomosis and peripancreatic drainage. The clinical parameters of the two groups were collected. The characteristics of the drainage juice which include color, volume and amylase value in the two groups were compared. The incidence and severity grading of pancreatic fistula between the two groups were evaluated.The average of amylase value and the peripancreatic drainage flow were (1401 ± 8) U/L and (49 ± 5) ml in the DC group. Their average in the CD group were (2160 ± 13) U/L and (76 ± 4) ml. There was significant statistical difference in the peripancreatic drainage flow between the two groups (t = 2.597, P = 0.031). The amylase values of the drainage juice between the two groups were of no statistical difference (P > 0.05). According to the definition of pancreatic fistula by an international study group, the incidence of pancreatic fistula in the DC group was 25.0% (8/32) and the CD group 30.5% (11/36) (P > 0.05). The proportion of grades B and C of pancreatic fistula in the DC group had statistical difference compared with one of the CD group (χ(2) = 4.797, P = 0.029).Drainage in cavities could significantly decrease and the occurring ratio of grade B and C of pancreatic fistula after PD.
