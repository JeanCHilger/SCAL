Therapeutic efficacy of endoscopic variceal ligation to treat gastric varices: a study of 63 consecutive cases. To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) for treating various types of gastric varices (GV) by reviewing patient cases in order to identify the influencing factors of EVL-related recurrence and rebleeding.The medical records of 101 GV cases treated by EVL in our department between January 2008 and October 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were grouped according to GV type: type 1 (GOV1, n = 63), type 2 (GOV2, n = 18), GOV1 coexisting with GOV2 (n = 11), isolated GOV1 (IGV1, n = 9), and GOV2 (IGV2, n = 0). Data from follow-up examinations (range: 1.5 - 48.0 months, average: 14.9 +/- 9.1 months) were extracted for analysis and included early (less than 72 h after EVL) and late (72 h to 6 weeks after EVL) rebleeding and recurrence. In addition, data from computed tomography (CT) or CT angiography (CTA), performed in 32 of the patients, were extracted to determine the influence of supplying veins, gastrorenal or splenorenal shunts, and portal vein and/or splenic vein diameters on GV recurrence. Data analysis was carried out by ANOVA, Chi-square, Fisher's exact or rank-sum tests, as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the time of first recurrent bleeding, and the log-rank test was used to compare between-group differences.GOV2 and IGV1 varices were more severe than the varices of GOV1 (GOV2 and GOV1: u = -2.960 IGV1 and GOV1: u = -2.871EVL can effectively control bleeding and prevent rebleeding for GV although, the best therapeutic efficacy and lowest rate of recurrence was achieved in GOV1 cases. The presence of gastrorenal or splenorenal shunts increases the risk of GV recurrence.
