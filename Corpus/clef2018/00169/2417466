Pancreatic cutaneous fistula as a complication of left nephrectomy. Intimate anatomical relationship of the pancreas to the left kidney may lead to pancreatic cutaneous fistula as a complication of left nephrectomy. We report 2 cases of pancreatic cutaneous fistulas that developed as a result of surgical trauma to the pancreas during left nephrectomy. The diagnosis was confirmed when amylase in the drainage was increased. Fistulas closed spontaneously by adequate drainage in 55 and 33 days postoperatively.
