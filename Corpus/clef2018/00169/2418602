Long-term prognosis of portal hypertension in childhood. In Europe more than 70 per cent of children with portal hypertension suffer from a prehepatic block. Most of them underwent an umbilical vein catheter treatment in postnatal anamnesis. Constructing a selective distal splenorenal shunt (Warren-shunt) is a definitive therapy. This operation is possible for children having a patent splenic vein with a diameter of at least 7 mm measured by splenoportoseriography. Sclerosing of the oesophageal wall is a good palliative treatment for small children with a diameter of the splenic vein of less than 7 mm. Children with prehepatic block and patent Warren-shunt have a good prognosis.
