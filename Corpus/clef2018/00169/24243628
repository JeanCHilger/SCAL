Association of splenic MR elastographic findings with gastroesophageal varices in patients with chronic liver disease. To identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based parameters associated with gastroesophageal varices (GEVs) in patients with chronic liver disease.Ninety-three patients were divided into three groups based on endoscopic findings: group 1 with no GEVs (n = 49), group 2 with mild GEVs (n = 30), and group 3 with severe GEVs (n = 14). We used a multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess liver stiffness, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, spleen stiffness and volume, portal vein velocity, cross-sectional area, and flow volumes potential independent associators of any (mild and severe) GEVs or severe GEVs.The analysis showed that spleen and liver stiffness and spleen volume were independently associated with any GEVs (spleen stiffness, odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.25 [1.04-1.68], P = 0.018 liver stiffness, 1.52 [1.13-2.17], P = 0.006Liver and spleen stiffness and spleen volume are associated with GEVs in patients with chronic liver disease. Compared with liver stiffness and spleen volume, spleen stiffness is more strongly associated with severe GEVs.
