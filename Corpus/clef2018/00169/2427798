Urinary amylase monitoring for early diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection in dogs. The diagnosis of pancreas allograft rejection is usually made on the basis of blood glucose concentration, a late indicator of rejection. We performed segmental pancreas transplants in totally pancreatectomized dogs with the exocrine secretions drained into the bladder (ductocystostomy). We directly measured exocrine pancreatic secretions (urinary amylase), in an attempt to find a sensitive indicator for early rejection. Five groups were studied: (I) autografts (II) autografts immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CsA), azathioprine and prednisone
