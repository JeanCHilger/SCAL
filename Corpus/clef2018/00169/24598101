A case of hepatic sarcoidosis presenting with cirrhotic symptoms. A man in 40s with skin sarcoidosis presented with signs and symptoms of liver injury and thrombocytopenia. Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed cholecystolithiasis, hepatic deformation, and giant splenomegaly. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed esophageal varices. Cholecystectomy, splenectomy, and wedge biopsy of the liver were performed. Histopathology of the liver revealed many granulomas and severe periportal fibrosis without lobular reconstruction. These findings were compatible with hepatic sarcoidosis, but not liver cirrhosis. Here we report a rare case of hepatic sarcoidosis presenting with cirrhotic symptoms.
