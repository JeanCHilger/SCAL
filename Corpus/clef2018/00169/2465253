Increased proportion of giant platelets and platelet distribution width are better indicators of altered platelet homeostasis than mean platelet volume in liver cirrhosis. Platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV), giant platelet percentage, expressed by us as megathrombocytic index (MTI) and platelet distribution width (PDW) have been evaluated in 32 control subjects and in 27 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis (LC) and thrombocytopenia. MTI and PDW were linearly and inversely correlated to platelet count both in controls and patients. MTI and PDW were markedly increased in LC as compared to controls, while MPV was not significantly different. It is concluded that MTI and PDW are good indices of thrombopoietic stimulus both in controls and in CL and better indicators of altered platelet homeostasis than MPV in LC.
