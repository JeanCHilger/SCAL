Feasibility of pegylated interferon and ribavirin in hepatitis C-related cirrhosis with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. To investigate the feasibility of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment in cirrhotic patients who presented with, or developed while on-treatment, platelet counts ≤ 80,000/μL and/or neutrophil counts ≤ 1,500/μL.A retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data on 123 cirrhotic patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Adverse effects and haematological changes were monitored: bleeding and infectious events were registered and related to platelet and absolute neutrophil counts.Among the 58 patients (47.2%) with nadir platelets ≤ 50,000/μL during therapy, 6 (10.3%) experienced a bleeding episode of the remaining 65 patients with platelets constantly >50,000/μL, 3 (4.6%) bled. Of the 11 bleedings, 3 manifested during an infection, while patients had platelets >50,000/μL. Nadir neutrophils ≤ 750/μL occurred in 45 patients (38.2%) during treatment, and 14 of them (29.8%) had an infectious event. Infections were also documented in 18 of the 76 patients (23.7%) with neutrophils constantly >750/μL.The study reveals the feasibility of treating cirrhotic patients with cytopenia with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, as bleeding or infectious events under therapy were unrelated to platelet and neutrophil counts. Withdrawal of therapy or variations in the pre-assigned dosages of either pegylated interferon or ribavirin owing to abnormally low haematological parameters seems to no longer be tenable.
