Surgical treatment of ascites and pleural effusion in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Pleural effusion and ascites are now recognized as possible complications of chronic pancreatitis. Diagnosis of these conditions can be made by the finding of high amylase levels in the pleural or ascite fluid. Out of 31 of our patients with this complications 19 had ascites, 10 pleural effusions and two both pleural effusion and ascites. In 19 patients, presenting poor clinical conditions, the treatment was external drainage. Remaining patients were treated by internal drainage or resection. Eight out of the 19 patients treated by external drainage and one of the 13 patients with internal drainage had to be reoperated. There was no mortality. Though external drainage is followed by high incidence of reoperations this technique should be used in patients with poor conditions.
