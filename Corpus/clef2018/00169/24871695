Evaluation of portal hypertension and varices by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging of the liver compared to transient elastography and AST to platelet ratio index. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) is a new method of liver stiffness measurement (LSM). The aim was to compare ARFI, transient elastography (TE) and AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) for the noninvasive diagnosis of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH, hepatic venous pressure gradient HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg) and esophageal varices (EV).LSM via ARFI and TE was performed in 88 consecutive patients with cirrhosis prior to HVPG measurement. The mean liver stiffness for ARFI was calculated out of 5 measurements for each lobe.LSM by TE and ARFI was not successful in 22 (25%) patients and 1 (1 %) patient, respectively, due to ascites or obesity. Both TE (r = 0.765 p < 0.001) and ARFI (r = 0.646ARFI shows a higher applicability particularly in obese and ascitic patients. All three investigated methods show a high diagnostic accuracy for CSPH. Notably, APRI performed not significantly different compared to ARFI for the diagnosis of CSPH.
