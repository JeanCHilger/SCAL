Esophageal varix predictive performance of lower esophageal Doppler signals during the swallowing process. The objective of this study was to assess whether the swallowing action can improve the display of lower esophageal Doppler signals (LEDS) during transabdominal ultrasound (TUS). Eighty-four patients with cirrhosis underwent both TUS and endoscopic examination for esophageal varices (EVs). LEDS were assessed under the esophageal resting state and during the swallowing process. Univariate analysis indicated that spleen diameter, spleen vein diameter, portal vein diameter, LEDS and left gastric vein hepatofugal flow were significantly associated with the presence of EVs. No LEDS were detected in patients without EVs at rest or during swallowing. Of the 69 patients with EVs, LEDS could be detected in 21 cases (30.4%) in the esophageal resting state and in 58 cases (84.1%) during the swallowing process. Compared with the esophageal resting state, the swallowing action can significantly improve display of LEDS during TUS (p = 0.000), which may be beneficial for TUS detection of EVs.
