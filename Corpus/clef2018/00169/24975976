A splenic arteriovenous fistula. Splenic arteriovenous fistula is a rare entity which can present as portal hypertension and related symptoms.A 60-year-old female attended the emergency department with haematemesis. She had microcytic anaemia and was admitted to the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department. Gastroduodenoscopy revealed three grade II-III varices in the distal oesophagus. The ultrasound image was suggestive of liver cirrhosis and showed signs of portal hypertension such as ascites, splenomegaly and dilated vessels near the splenic hilum. CT angiography showed an enlarged splenic vein in the arterial phase suggestive of arteriovenous fistula. This was confirmed by selective angiography of the splenic artery. The splenic arteriovenous fistula was treated with percutaneous transarterial embolization.Patients with an arteriovenous fistula in the spleen are generally treated by splenectomy. However, in our patient embolization treatment was effective.
