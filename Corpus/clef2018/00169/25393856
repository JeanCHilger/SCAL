Acute kidney injury in schistosomiasis: a retrospective cohort of 60 patients in Brazil. The aim of this study is to investigate renal involvement in schistosomiasis. This is a retrospective cohort of 60 consecutive patients with schistosomiasis admitted to a university hospital in Maceió, Brazil. The patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the RIFLE criteria. We compared the groups for differences in clinical manifestations and laboratory tests. Patients' mean age was 58 ± 16 yr, and 56.7% were female. The average length of hospital stay was 16.4 ± 12.1 days. Patients with hypertension and diabetes were 35% and 21.7% respectively. The main clinical symptoms and signs presented were ascites (86.7%), splenomegaly (80%), and hepatomegaly (63.3%). Current or previous history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was found in 45% of patients, esophageal varices on endoscopy were present in 92%, and periportal fibrosis on ultrasound examination in 81% of patients. AKI incidence was 43.3% during hospital stay. Mean age and length of hospitalization were higher in the AKI group. Diuretic use, such as furosemide and spironolactone, ascites, and AST levels were also associated with AKI. Death occurred in 5 cases (8.5%), 4 of them in the AKI group. The classifications Child-Pugh score (CHILD) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), used to assess the severity and prognosis of chronic liver disease, presented higher scores among patients with AKI (CHILD: 9.5 ± 1.5 vs. 8.4 ± 1.7, P = 0.02 MELD: 19 ± 5.8 vs. 13 ± 3.9, P < 0.001). Renal dysfunction is an important feature of schistosomiasis, which is associated with significant morbidity and possible increased mortality. Further studies are necessary to establish the mechanisms through which schistosomiasis can lead to renal dysfunction.
