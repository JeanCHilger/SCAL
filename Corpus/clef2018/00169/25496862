Preoperative risk factors of portal venous thrombosis after splenectomy and gastric pericardial devascularization for portal hypertension. To investigate the preoperative risk factors of portal venous thrombosis (PVT) after splenectomy and gastric pericardial devascularization in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.Clinical data was collected for 127 patients who underwent splenectomy and gastric pericardial devascularization for portal hypertension at our hospital between January 2010 and December 2012.The patient data were analyzed retrospectively according to patient status of presence or absence of PVT postoperatively.The preoperative risk factors of PVT were statistically analyzed.There were no significant differences between the postoperative PVT-positive and-negative groups in regards to sex, age, receipt of emergency surgery, presence of ascites, admission to hospital for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, grade of esophageal-gastric varices, Child-Pugh classification, spleen vein diameter, liver function (as determined by levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, globulin, cholinesterase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase), renal function (as determined by creatinine level), and coagulation function (as determined by prothrombin time, prothrombin activity degree, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, thrombin time, and antithrombin III).However, there were significant differences between the groups for the parameters of postoperative PVT presence, upper gastric bleeding history, aspartate aminotransferase level, and blood urea nitrogen level (all P less than 0.05).Portal vein diameter and history of upper gastric bleeding were both identified as independent risk factors for PVT (P less than 0.05).Incidence of postoperative PVT was higher in patients who had portal vein diameter > 13.15 mm (cutoff value of 13.75 mm) and in patients who had a history of upper gastric bleeding.Portal vein diameter and history of upper gastric bleeding were independent risk factors for PVT occurrence after splenectomy and gastric pericardial devascularization in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
