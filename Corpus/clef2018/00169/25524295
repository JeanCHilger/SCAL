Sinistral portal hypertension after pancreaticoduodenectomy with splenic vein ligation. Splenic vein ligation may result in sinistral (left-sided) portal hypertension and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The aim of this study was to analyse the pathogenesis of sinistral portal hypertension following splenic vein ligation in pancreaticoduodenectomy.Patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer between January 2005 and December 2012 were included in this retrospective study. The venous flow pattern from the spleen and splenic hypertrophy were examined after surgery.Of 103 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection, 43 had splenic vein ligation. There were two predominant venous flow patterns from the spleen. In the varicose route (27 patients), flow from the spleen passed to colonic varices and/or other varicose veins. In the non-varicose route, flow from the spleen passed through a splenocolonic collateral (14 patients) or a spontaneous splenorenal shunt (2 patients). The varicose route was associated with significantly greater splenic hypertrophy than the non-varicose route (median splenic hypertrophy ratio 1·52 versus 0·94 P < 0·001). All patients with the varicose route had colonic varices, and none had a right colic marginal vein at the hepatic flexure.Pancreaticoduodenectomy with splenic vein ligation may lead to sinistral portal hypertension. To avoid the development of varices, it is important to preserve the right colic marginal vein. Reconstruction of the splenic vein should be considered if the right colic marginal vein is divided.
