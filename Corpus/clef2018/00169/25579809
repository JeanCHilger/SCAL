Negative predictive value of drain amylase concentration for development of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is the major source of morbidity following pancreaticoduodenectomy. A predictive indicator would be highly advantageous. One potential marker is drain amylase concentration (DAC). However, its predictive value has not been fully established.405 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy at our centre over a 10 year period were reviewed to determine the value of DAC as a predictive indicator for the development of POPF.POPF developed in 58 patients (14%). These patients suffered greater morbidity. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.5%. Male gender (OR: 5.1 p = 0.0082) and age > 70 (OR 2Our data suggest that post-operative DAC below the determined optimal threshold values on day 1 and 2 following pancreaticoduodenectomy carries high negative predictive value for POPF development and identifies patients in whom early drain removal, and enhanced recovery may be considered, with simultaneous assessment of operative and clinical factors.
