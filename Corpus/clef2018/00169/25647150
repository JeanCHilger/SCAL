Duodenal leaks after pancreas transplantation with enteric drainage - characteristics and risk factors. Pancreas-kidney transplantation with enteric drainage has become a standard treatment in diabetic patients with renal failure. Leaks of the graft duodenum (DL) remain a significant complication after transplantation. We studied incidence and predisposing factors of DLs in both simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) and pancreas after kidney (PAK) transplantation. Between January 2002 and April 2013, 284 pancreas transplantations were performed including 191 SPK (67.3%) and 93 PAK (32.7%). Patient data were analyzed for occurrence of DLs, risk factors, leak etiology, and graft survival. Of 18 DLs (incidence 6.3%), 12 (67%) occurred within the first 100 days after transplantation. Six grafts (33%) were rescued by duodenal segment resection. Risk factors for a DL were PAK transplantation sequence (odds ratio 3.526, P = 0.008) and preoperative immunosuppression (odds ratio 3.328, P = 0.012). In the SPK subgroup, postoperative peak amylase as marker of preservation/reperfusion injury and recipient pretransplantation cardiovascular interventions as marker of atherosclerosis severity were associated with an increased incidence of DLs. CMV-mismatch constellations showed an increased incidence in the SPK subgroup, however without significance probability. Long-term immunosuppression in PAK transplantation is a major risk factor for DLs. Early surgical revision offers the chance of graft rescue.
