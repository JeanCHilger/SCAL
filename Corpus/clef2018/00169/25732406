Prediction of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients with apparent diffusion coefficient of the spleen. To predict esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the spleen and to correlate the ADC with clinical and laboratory biomarkers of esophageal varices.This study was conducted upon 40 patients (28 male, 12 female age ranged 19-45 yearsThe mean ADC value of the spleen in cirrhotic patients (1.34 ± 0.05 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly different (P = 0.001) from that of volunteers (0.87 ± 0.04 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s). The ADC of the spleen in cirrhotic patients with varices (1.49 ± 0.05 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly different (P = 0.001) from that of patients without varices (1.11 ± 0.06 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s). The cut-off ADC value of the spleen used for prediction of cirrhosis and varices was 1.15 and 1.29 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with areas under the curve were 0.872 and 0.889, respectively. The ADC value of the spleen was correlated with the splenic volume (r = 0.862 P = 0.001), Child score (r = 0.742The ADC value of the spleen can predict esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients and is well correlated with the clinical and laboratory biomarkers of esophageal varices.
