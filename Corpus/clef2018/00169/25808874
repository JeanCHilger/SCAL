A rare case of splenic lymphoma in a patient with polymyositis manifesting as gastric variceal bleeding. We report an unusual case of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to isolated gastric variceal bleeding in a patient with splenomegaly who was subsequently diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of polymyositis who presented to the emergency room with complaints of lightheadedness and melena for 2 days. On initial presentation, the patient had positive orthostatic vital signs. He was found to be anemic with presenting hemoglobin of 5.8 g/dl (compared with 13.4 g/dl 4 months prior to presentation). The patient was aggressively resuscitated with intravenous fluid and blood transfusions. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which showed isolated gastric varices in the fundus of the stomach, with no active bleeding or high-risk stigmata. Abdominal computed tomography revealed focal splenic vein thrombosis and splenomegaly with ill-defined hypodensities. Portal and superior mesenteric veins were patent. Mild edema was seen surrounding the spleen and non-specific abdominal lymphadenopathy was also reported. A surgical consultation recommended an urgent splenectomy. Pathology of the removed spleen revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed lymphomatous disease in the thorax, abdomen, pelvis and bone marrow. The patient was subsequently started on chemotherapy.
