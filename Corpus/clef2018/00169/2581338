Acinar structure and function in canine pancreatic autografts with duct drainage into the urinary bladder. Autotransplants of pancreas in 8 dogs, with exocrine drainage into the urinary bladder, were stimulated in vivo with cholecystokinin-pancreozymin (CCK-PZ). Transplant biopsies, when compared with 6 normal pancreases, showed normal acinar structure by light and electron microscopy 13-18 months after initial surgery 2 transplants with sutures unintentionally transecting ducts were fibrosed and had duct obstruction. After in vivo stimulation, the normal-appearing transplants produced a 7-fold increase in urinary amylase, and quantitative electron microscopy showed a 50% reduction in mature zymogen granules
