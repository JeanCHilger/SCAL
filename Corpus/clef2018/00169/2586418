Late complications after successful Kasai's operation for biliary atresia. The late complications in 25 patients more than 3 years after successful Kasai's operation for biliary atresia were presented. Nine (36%) of these 25 patients had episodes of variceal hemorrhage with portal hypertension, and biliary reobstruction in 3 (12%), bleeding from duodenal ulcer in 2, bleeding from gastric erosion in one, and diffuse pulmonary arterio-venous shunt in one were observed. Recently esophageal varices have been well controlled by endoscopic sclerotherapy, and the surgical treatment may be indicated in older children complicated with severe hypersplenism and marked splenomegaly, which are resistant for sclerotherapy. As a surgical procedure, splenectomy with periesophago-gastric devascularization (Hassab's operation) seems to be very useful for portal hypertension by biliary cirrhosis. The reoperation, hepaticoenterostomy, was performed in 3 patients with biliary reobstruction. All three patients are alive and well, and two of them are at 19 years (university student) and 24 years (married life) of age. Hepatic Rehepaticoenterostomy is well indicated rather than liver transplantation, if biliary reobstruction is incurable with conservative therapy. Many of the patients with complications were able to carry on an almost normal life, if suitable treatments for complications were taken.
