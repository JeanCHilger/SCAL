Abdominal injuries involving bicycle handlebars in 219 children: results of 8-year follow-up. Handlebar injuries are one of the most common causes of abdominal injuries in children. We aim to investigate the epidemiology of bicycle handlebar injuries and to emphasize the severity of the injuries.A retrospective analysis of children admitted to our hospital with abdominal injury related to bicycle handlebars was performed.A total of 219 children (187 males and 32 females) younger than 17 years were hospitalized for abdominal handlebar injuries between 2005 and 2013. The age range of the patients was 4-17 (mean 10.93 ± 3.68) years. Most patients had an imprint of the handlebar edge on their abdomen. The most common abdominal organ injury was liver laceration. 33 patients had pancreas injury and 13 patients had hollow organ injury. Most patients were treated conservatively. Surgery was performed in 24 patients. Hospital stay was 4-60 (mean 9.63 ± 13.37) days.Trend of bicycle handlebar trauma over this time period was related to the local floating population and economy. The most common abdominal organ injury was liver. Hollow organ injury required emergency exploratory laparotomy and the Roux-y anastomosis applied well in cases whose gastrointestinal tract damaged seriously. Pancreatic injury usually led to secondary pseudocyst. The percutaneous ultrasound-guided drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst was really an effective way. The trend in the amylase and lipase levels could reflect the pancreatic injury condition and predict prognosis. Early diagnosis and optimal care without delay may help to reduce the morbidity of injuries to the internal organs. Children with abdominal handlebar injuries should be treated with great care.
