Can the measurement of amylase in drain after distal pancreatectomy predict post-operative pancreatic fistula? The most frequent reason for performing a distal pancreatectomy is the presence of cystic or neuroendocrine tumors, in which the distal pancreatic stump is often soft and non fibrotic. This parenchymal consistence represents the main risk factor for post-operative pancreatic fistula. In order to identify the fistula and assessing its severity postoperative monitoring of amylase from intraperitoneal drains is important.From a retrospective multicentric database analysis were included 33 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic neoplastic disease.Postoperative pancreatic fistula occurred in four cases. One patient had a ductal adenocarcinoma, two presented with pancreatic endocrine neoplasms and the last one had an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia. Two patients underwent open, the other two laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.Postoperative pancreatic fistulas after distal pancreatectomy worsen the quality of life, prolong the post-operative stay and delay further adjuvant therapy. In patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy literature exposed some advantages deriving from the placement of abdominal drainages only in selected cases and from their early removal. Patients presenting a high risk of pancreatic fistula had higher amylase levels of drainage fluid in the first postoperative day.POPF is the most frequently complication after pancreatectomy. In our analysis DFA1>5000 can be considered as a predictive factor for pancreatic fistula. For this reason, the systematic measurement of amylase in drain fluid in first-postoperative day can be considered a good clinical practice.
