Efficacy of splenic artery trunk embolization with detachable balloon for portal hypertension and hypersplenism. To investigate the efficacy of detachable balloon for splenic artery trunk embolization in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension and hypersplenism.Eight patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension received splenic artery trunk disconnection using detachable balloons under the guidance of digital subtraction angiography. The diameter and blood flow of the portal vein, the superior mesenteric vein, the splenic vein and the hepatic artery were measured by color Doppler ultrasound. Markers of liver function and blood coagulation, and routine blood parameters were assessed. Gastroscopy was used to evaluate to the degree of gastroesophageal varices. All complications experienced during the perioperative period were recorded.The portal vein diameter decreased from 1.55±0.38 cm to 1.55±0.38 cm, and the splenic artery diameter decreased from 1.45±0.10 cm to 1.41±0.09 cm (P < 0.05). The portal vein blood flow was reduced from 971.52±174.77 ml/min to 785.86±100.17 ml/min, and the splenic vein blood flow decreased from 938.01±208.86 ml/min to 644.02±188.15 ml/min, while the hepatic artery blood flow increased from 261.25±65.47 ml/min to 449.32±84.05 ml/min (P < 0.05). The symptoms of splenism were improved effectively, with platelet counts rising from 37.75±10.61*109/L to 138.63±28.22*109/L after the procedure (P < 0.05). There were no episodes of severe complications or death in the perioperative period, and all patients showed remarkable improvement in markers of liver function and coagulation function, and improvement of esophagogastric varices.The interventional disconnection technique of the splenic artery trunk using detachable balloon for the treatment of portal hypertension and hypersplenism is safe and effective.
