Risk factors of portal vein thrombosis after surgery for advanced schistosomiasis portal hypertension. To explore the risk factors of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization for advanced schistosomiasis portal hypertension.The clinical data were collected retrospectively from 211 advanced schistosomiasis portal hypertension patients after splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization from August, 2004 to March 2014, and all the data were analyzed statistically for the risk factors of PVT after the surgery by single factor analysis and Logistic regression analysis.Totally 59 patients were found with PVT and the incidence was 27.96% (59/211). The single factor analysis showed that 8 factors were related to PVT after surgery, including the history of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the diameter of portal vein, the diameter of splenic vein, esophageal varices, ascites, portal hypertension gastropathy, gastric varices , and blood ammonia level. The Logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors of PVT were broadening of the diameter of portal vein (OR = 1.763 , P = 0.000) and portal hypertension gastropathy (OR = 1.089, P = 0.037).The incidence of PVT after surgery for advanced schistosomiasis is high, and the independent risk factors are broadening of diameter of portal vein and portal hypertension gastropathy.
