DETERMINING THE DEGREE OF DISRUPTION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE LIVER AND THE SEVERITY OF PORTAL HYPERTENSION IN CHILDREN. To develop a system to define the degree of liver disruption and severity of portal hypertension in children based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).Studied the results of laboratory and instrumental methods 382 children: 267 patients with various liver diseases, including 49 patients who underwent liver transplantation, and 115 children without liver disease.Based on analysis of statistical data obtained were identified 10 indicators, a set of changes which can be used to assess the degree of disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension: indicators that reflect the severity of fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver (METAVIR score on a scale at fibroelastometrii, scores are Desmet at morphological study of the liver) and indicators that reflect the severity of portal hypertension (the diameter of the portal vein, splenic vein diameter, the length of the spleen, recanalization of the umbilical vein, esophageal varices, ascites, hydropericardium, hydrothorax). Each of the indicators was assessed on a 5-point system. Number of points reflects the sum of the changes of these parameters. Decrease the number of points on 0-4% (38-40 points) is regarded as a lack of structural failure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension by 5-24% (30-37 points)--minor violations on 25-49% (20-29 points) -moderation disorders, 50-95% (3-12 points)--severe handicaps, 96-100% (0-2 points)--absolute violation. Studied the dynamics of children with autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease and chronic hepatitis C.The proposed scoring system for assessing the degree of disruption of the structure of the liver and the severity of portal hypertension can be used as an objective criterion of the severity of the pathological process, to estimate the dynamics of defeat against the background of the therapy, determining the prognosis of the disease and as a criterion of the indications for liver transplantation.
