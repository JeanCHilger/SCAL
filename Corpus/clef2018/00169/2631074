Alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis as a cause of portal hypertension. Basic data on pathomorphology and symptomatology of the alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis accompanied by portal hypertension are discussed. Respective data were compared with the group of cirrhotic patients not abusing alcohol. A high percentage of encephalopathic disorders and nearly 50% of the patients suffering from the hemorrhage from esophageal varices were the first sign of the cirrhosis in both groups. Despite hemorrhage from esophageal varices a few patients obtained surgical help preventing recurrence of the hemorrhage. Liver functional reserve, incidence of encephalopathies and the degree of liver involvement are in favour for non-alcohol cirrhosis. Inflammatory process in the liver, splenomegaly and hypersplenism were more frequent in the liver cirrhosis of non-alcohol origin.
