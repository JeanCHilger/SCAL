Polycythemia Vera Diagnosed after Esophageal Variceal Rupture. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm that leads to hyperviscosity and the risk of thrombosis. We encountered the case of a young male Filipino patient diagnosed with PV after the rupture of esophageal varices. The complete blood cell count showed a slight increase in white blood cells. An abdominal computed tomography scan disclosed splenomegaly and occlusion of the portal vein and collateral vessels. A blood examination demonstrated an increase in all three blood cell lines within three months. Based on the presence of severe hypercellularity of the bone marrow and positivity for the JAK2V617F mutation, we finally diagnosed the patient with PV.
