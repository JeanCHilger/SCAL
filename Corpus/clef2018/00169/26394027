Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy Using the Modified Prolonged Prefiring Compression Technique Reduces Pancreatic Fistula. Pancreatic fistula (PF) is a common postoperative complication following distal pancreatectomy. The prolonged prefiring compression (PFC) technique to reduce PF has been described by Nakamura and colleagues in Japan. The present study assessed if this technique can be applied to the United Kingdom patient population in a tertiary referral center and replicate the low incidence of PF after the laparoscopic approach to distal pancreatectomy (Lap-DP).This is a retrospective study of all patients who underwent Lap-DP using the modified PFC technique by the senior author between June 2011 and July 2014. The modified PFC technique involved compression of the pancreatic parenchyma with an endo-stapler for a 3-minute period prior to firing and further 1-minute compression after firing prior to removal of the stapler, which is a small variant to the original technique of maintaining a 2-minute compression post firing.Twenty patients (15 females median age, 66 [range, 25-77] years) underwent Lap-DP using the PFC technique during the study period. Six patients had splenic-preserving Lap-DP. Median operating time was 240 minutes (range, 150-420 minutes) with a median length of hospital stay of 6 days (range, 3-22 days). Six patients (30%) developed Type A (biochemically noted as high drain fluid amylase) PF, and none of the patients had Type B/C PF. In the splenic preservation group, 1 patient had complete splenic infarction requiring laparoscopic splenectomy on Day 3, and 1 patient had partial infarction requiring prolonged hospital stay for pain relief. One patient required prolonged respiratory support due to severe preexisting lung disease. Overall mortality was zero.Our data confirm that the PFC technique is safe, feasible, and effective in reducing clinically significant PF post-Lap-DP in the United Kingdom patient population.
