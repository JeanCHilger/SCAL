Ultrasonic evaluation of the state of the abdominal vessels in cholelithiasis and chronic acalculous cholecystitis. Ultrasound investigation of the abdominal vessels (the celiac artery and its branches, the hepatic veins and the portal veins) was performed in 30 patients with cholelithiasis, 20 patients with chronic acalculous cholecystitis and 100 healthy controls. Statistically significant increases in the calibers of the hepatic arteries and portal veins were detected in the patients with cholelithiasis. The diameters of these vessels in the patients with chronic acalculous cholecystitis did not differ considerably from those of the controls. Ascites, splenomegaly, vascular collaterals, varicosis of the esophageal or gastric veins were unobserved in the patients with cholelithiasis, neither was observed an increase in the calibers of the portal veins during the Valsalva test in this group as compared to the control group. It was assumed that an increase in the calibers of the hepatic vessels in cholelithiasis was caused by change in the hepatic blood flow rather than by the development of portal hypertension.
