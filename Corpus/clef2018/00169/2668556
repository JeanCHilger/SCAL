Ultrasonographic diagnosis of portal vein cavernous transformation in children. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of ultrasonographic findings in the diagnosis of portal vein cavernous transformation and secondary splanchnic hypertension in children. Twenty patients with esophageal varices on endoscopic sclerotherapy, with ages ranging from 1 to 15 years (mean of 7.5), were compared with 20 age-matched normal asymptomatic controls. In 17 cases, diagnosis was confirmed by splenoportography. Ultrasonographic portal vein features, respiratory variations in splenic and superior mesenteric veins, lesser omentum to aorta diameter ratio and spleen size, as well as the presence of vessels in the lesser omentum and of spontaneous anastomoses, were analyzed in both groups. The efficiency of ultrasonography to establish a diagnosis of portal vein cavernous transformation reached 100%. Splenic and superior mesenteric vein respiratory variation was negligible in patients and inspiration versus expiration diameter differences ranged from 1 to 4 mm (mean of 2.4) in controls (p less than .001). Mean lesser omentum to aorta ratio was 2.07 in patients versus .9 in controls (p less than .001). Splenomegaly was found in all but two cases lesser omentum vessels were visualized in nine cases
