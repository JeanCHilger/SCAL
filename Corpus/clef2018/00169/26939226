PLATELET COUNT TO SPLEEN DIAMETER RATIO AND TO SPLEEN AREA RATIO AS PREDICTORS FOR ESOPHA-GEAL VARICES IN CHRONIC HEPATITIS C PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS. Endoscopic detection of esophageal varices (EV) especially the high risk esophageal varices (HREV) is recommended in cirrhotic patients. There are several studies about non-invasive markers to predict the presence of EV. The aim of this study was to evaluate platelet count to spleen diameter (P/D) ratio and platelet count to spleen area (P/A) ratio as predictors for EV and HREV in patients with liver cirrhosis. This prospective study included 100 cirrhotic patients without previous variceal hemorrhage or endoscopic intervesion. Biochemical, imaging and endoscopic findings were collected in all patients. Several parameters including P/D and P/A ratio were measured and their association with the presence of EV and HREV was tested. The results showed that only P/D and P/A ratios were found to be independent predictors for the presence of EV and HREV in multivariant analysis. For prediction of the EV formation in cirrhotic patients, P/D ratio at value < or =979.9 and P/A ratio of < or =20.6 had area under the curve (AUC) 0.922 and 0.975 respectively with sensitivity 100%, specificity 30% for P/D ratio and sensitivity 100%, specificity 75% for P/A ratio. For prediction of the HREV formation, P/D ratio at value < or = 587.9 and P/A ratio of 513.7 had AUC 0.867 and 0.991 respectively with sensitivity 100%, specificity 50% for P/D ratio and sensitivity 100%, specificity 88% for P/A ratio.
