Splenic vein occlusion due to pancreatic disease: regional portal hypertension from hemodynamic points of view. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinicopathophysiology of splenic vein occlusion due to pancreatic disease from hemodynamic points of view. We reviewed the angiographic findings and medical records of 82 patients who had pancreatitis, pancreatic cyst or pancreatic cancer in the pancreatic body and tail. According to the site of occlusion in 16 patients with complete splenic vein occlusion, this entity may be divided into two categories: Type A, an occlusion close to the spleen in which short-gastric system seems to be major collateral, and Type B, an occlusion distant from splenic hilum in which gastroepiploic system becomes prominent as collateral. As compared to 7 patients with incomplete splenic vein occlusion, gastric varices and splenomegaly were frequently observed with the patients having complete occlusion. Among these 16 patients, splenic arterial occlusion was superimposed in 3 patients with pancreatic cancer in whom gastric varices were not detected. Thus, clinical features of this entity must be carefully assessed according to the nature of the underlying disease. Based on these observations, three consecutive phases: Phase 1 Insiduous or latent phase, Phase 2 Collateral developing phase, Phase 3 Vanishing phase may be distinguished for splenic vein occlusion secondary to pancreatic disease.
