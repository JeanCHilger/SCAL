Budd-Chiari syndrome and thrombosis of other abdominal vessels in the chronic myeloproliferative diseases. Of 501 patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases (c-MPD) 18 developed thrombosis of major abdominal vessels including 6 with hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome). The complication was seen in 14 of 140 (10%) patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 3 of 23 (13%) patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 1 of 106 (1%) patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and none of 232 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Leading symptoms and signs were abdominal pain, progressive splenomegaly, widening abdominal girth, ascites, venous collaterals, and nausea and vomiting. The diagnostic modalities with highest specificity were angiography and explorative laparotomy. A causal relationship between the thrombotic event and hematocrit, thrombocyte count, or hemostatic abnormalities at the time of diagnosis could not be established. Detailed laboratory tests of platelet function and coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters of 5 surviving patients did not show any specific defect. Despite medical and surgical intervention, 39% of the patients died within 2 months after diagnosis of the thrombosis. The majority of the survivors developed further complications like liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and esophageal varices or the short bowel syndrome after extensive bowel resection for mesenterial infarction.
