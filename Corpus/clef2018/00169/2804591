Platelet aggregability after endoscopic intravariceal injection of 5 per cent ethanolamine oleate into oesophageal varices. Platelet aggregability and the coagulative and fibrinolytic systems were examined in 45 patients who underwent endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices. Five per cent ethanolamine oleate, the sclerosant used, was injected into the oesophageal varices. There were significant increases in the concentrations of fibrinopeptide A, fibrinopeptide B-beta-15-42 and fibrin degradation products-E after the sclero-therapy. At 1 h after the sclerotherapy the mean(s.e.m.) platelet aggregation was significantly suppressed to 71.9(4.2) per cent of that before the treatment (P less than 0.01). There was a gradual recovery within 1 week to the same level seen before the sclerotherapy. Thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, both stable products of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin respectively, showed significant temporary increases after the sclerotherapy (P less than 0.01). The peak increase in the level of thromboxane B2 was noted within 1 h after the sclerotherapy and earlier than that for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. This increased ratio of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 may be related to the marked limitation in platelet aggregation.
