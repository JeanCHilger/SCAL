Idiopathic portal hypertension associated with Hashimoto's disease: report of three cases. Three cases of idiopathic portal hypertension associated with Hashimoto's disease are described. All of the cases were middle-aged Japanese women showing splenomegaly, esophageal varices and pancytopenia in the absence of extrahepatic portal obstruction, and cirrhosis of the liver. Two patients were euthyroid with goiter, one of which revealed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration, obliteration of thyroid follicles, and fibrosis on histological examination of the thyroid the third suffered from myxedema without goiter. Antithyroid microsomal antibody was positive in all patients and antithyroglobulin antibody was positive in none. These findings might imply an immunological role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic portal hypertension.
