Results of a modified distal spleno-renal shunt for portal hypertension. Twenty-five patients were treated with a distal spleno-renal shunt modified after that of Warren. The operative mortality was 4/25. One patient had an early thrombosis. All post-operative angiography otherwise showed patent shunts. After a median observation time of 43 months, 10/20 patients included in the followup were dead. The chief cause of death was liver failure. Encephalopathy has been common although generally of minor degree. Hypersplenism, judged by thrombocyte count, was not significantly affected by the operation. Six of 21 patients have had gastrointestinal hemorrhage after the operation but no hemorrhage proved fatal. Postoperatively esophageal varices size was considerably diminished in most cases as judged by contrast x-ray. Ascites has not been a problem in this series. Postoperative angiography showed a marked and rapid reduction of portal blood flow to the liver with progressively more blood deviated through the coronary vein towards the shunt. This reduction in portal flow is a possible explanation of the high frequency of postoperative liver failure. This version of the distal spleno-renal shunt has probably no advantages over the portacaval shunt.
