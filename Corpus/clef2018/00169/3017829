Transcatheter partial splenic arterial embolization in patients with hypersplenism: a clinical evaluation as supporting therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. Eleven cases with hypersplenism, one with liver cirrhosis and ten with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with liver cirrhosis, underwent transcatheter partial splenic arterial embolization. In four of ten HCC cases, the spleen was accidentally infarcted during the procedure of transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization (TAE). The mean infarcted area of the spleen was 55.7%. An increase in the peripheral platelet count was particularly remarkable and continued over one year after the embolization. High fever and abdominal pain were observed in all cases. The fever was seen for 18.0 days and pain was noted for an average of 12.8 days after the embolization. Other adverse effects such as pleural effusion and ascites were transitorily observed. Splenic embolization is an effective supporting therapy for hypersplenism in patients with cirrhosis or HCC.
