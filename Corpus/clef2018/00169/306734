Correlation between percutaneous transhepatic portography and clinical findings in 56 patients with portal hypertension. 56 consecutive patients with portal hypertension were studied with percutaneous transhepatic portography and the results were correlated to clinical findings and the number of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhages and the size of the individual bleeding. An abundance of collateral paths was noted in most patients. No regularity in development of these collaterals was found. It was not correlated to liver disease etiology, sex or liver function parameters. Portal pressure was not correlated to the size or amount of collaterals. In four patients with liver cirrhosis hepato-fugal flow in one segment of the liver was noted proving that portal flow through the liver is not uniform in this disease. The size of the haemorrhages was only correlated to presence of hepato-fugal flow in the main stem of the portal vein. It was not correlated to the estimated size of the oesophageal varices or to portal pressure. Percutaneous transhepatic portography seems to be of little help in selecting "high risk bleeders" in portal hypertension. Other factors may be of greater help in this task as indicated by the findings in this investigation that patients with alcohol cirrhosis had larger haemorrhages than those with cirrhosis of another etiology and that patients with none or few bleeding episodes had higher thrombocyte count than those with several haemorrhages.
