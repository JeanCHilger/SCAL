Gelfoam and autologous clot embolization: effect on coagulation. An episode of disseminated intravascular coagulation following therapeutic gelfoam embolization to control bleeding from esophageal varices in a patient with liver disease is presented. We have since followed 13 patients prospectively (six control and seven gelfoam/autologous clot) to determine the effect of this procedure on clotting. We were unable to show significant differences between the two groups as measured by the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen and platelet count. However, fibrin (ogen) degradation products were significantly elevated (p less than .01) in the gelfoam/autologous clot group. We suspect this occurred secondary to clot lysis at the site of embolization. No subsequent bleeding diathesis attributable to this abnormality occurred in any of the patients.
