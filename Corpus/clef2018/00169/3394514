Partial splenic embolization in hypersplenism. Four patients with portal hypertension, oesophageal varices and severe hypersplenism were treated by partial splenic embolization. All showed improvement of blood and platelet counts early in the postoperative period. Three months after embolization IgA and C3 levels increased significantly. All patients had a decrease in the incidence of variceal bleeding and this procedure provides an acceptable alternative to splenectomy.
