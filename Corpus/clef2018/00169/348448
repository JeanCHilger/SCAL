Comparative clinicopathological and bacteriological studies in schistosomiasis mansoni. FIFTY MALE Egyptian inpatients with active colonic mansoniasis were studied clinicopathologically, endoscopically, radiologically and bacteriologically. This was done to find out the pattern of colonic and urinary enterobacteria and serum antisalmonella agglutinins in various stages of mansoniasis. Cases are divided into three groups (A, B and C) according to the stage of their hepato-splenomegally. Their clinical presentations were dysentery, rectal bleeding, abdominal distension, anaemia, endocrinal changes and general weakness. Oesophageal varices were diagnosed in 19.8% of group C patients. Distal colonic polyps were noticed in 25% and 4% of group A and B cases respectively, while colonic ulcers were found in 20% of patients of either group. The total number of bilharzia ova per gram of fresh colonic biopsy was highest in group A and lowest in group C subjects. Mucosal and submucosal bilharzial granulation tissue formation together with mucosal hypertrophy were conspicuous among group A and B patients. Hematoxylin and eosin stain was of good diagnostic value and the rest of the stains used did not show any fungi or fibrinoid deposits.
