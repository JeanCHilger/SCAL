Noncirrhotic portal hypertension due to lymphoma. Reversal following splenectomy. We report a case of bleeding esophageal varices associated with lymphoma. Splenectomy alone reversed the patient's portal hypertension as assessed hemodynamically and clinically. Mechanisms leading to portal hypertension in the setting of splenomegaly from hematologic disorders are discussed. An approach to operative management of these patients, based on preoperative hemodynamic measurements, is suggested for future consideration.
