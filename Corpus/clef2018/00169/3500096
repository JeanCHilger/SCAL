Spontaneous (natural) splenoadrenorenal shunts in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction: a series of 20 cases. Large spontaneous (natural) splenoadrenorenal shunt on splenoportovenography was seen in 20 (9.4%) of the 213 patients with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction. Significantly less number of patients had a bleed and oesophageal varices in this group compared with patients having no spontaneous shunt. There was, however, no significant difference in the age, splenic size, splenic pulp pressure, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia between the two groups.
