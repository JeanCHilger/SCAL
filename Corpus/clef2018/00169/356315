Portal hypertension following renal transplantation. Portal hypertension and variceal hemorrhage may be found in the renal transplant patient with chronic liver disease. The development of portal hypertension was found to occur after long-term graft survival without significant rejection. The development of positive cytomegalic virus and negative hepatitis-associated antigen appeared to be common. Splenomegaly and prominent venous collateral were the most frequent physical findings, while ascites and hepatomegaly were less frequent. Portasystemic decompression can be performed successfully, however, the mortality and morbidity appear to be higher for this group than for other cirrhotic patients with comparable hepatic reserve.
