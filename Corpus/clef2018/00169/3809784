HB virus infection and delta surinfection in Sahelian Africa. 78 hospitalized patients were selected when presenting with at least one of these signs: hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, oesophageal varices, abdominal venous pattern, splenomegaly. All had radioimmunoassays for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antidelta antibody (78/78). Acute or chronic hepatic disease was diagnosed in 56 patients: 7 acute viral hepatitis, 13 chronic hepatitis, 23 non alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis, and 13 hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-two patients with other diagnoses served as controls. Serum antidelta was present in each group: acute viral hepatitis (2/7), chronic hepatitis (2/13), non alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis (9/23), hepatocellular carcinoma (3/13), controls (2/22). Every patient with acute or chronic hepatic disease and positive serum anti-delta was positive for serum HBsAg. Amony controls, 2 patients with positive serum antidelta were negative for serum HBsAg but positive for antiHBs. Delta superinfection is present in the sahelian region Patients with acute viral hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, non alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are electively infected. Patients with acute or chronic hepatitis and positive serum antidelta have hepatitis B virus evolutive infection (positive serum HBsAg).
