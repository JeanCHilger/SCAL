Myelofibrosis, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension. A patient with chronic myelofibrosis and massive splenomegaly developed portal hypertension with haematemesis occurring from radiologically proven oesophageal varices. Transjugular liver biopsy showed only myeloid metaplasia, and radiological evaluation of the portal vascular system was undertaken to establish a diagnosis of hyperkinetic portal hypertension as a basis for therapeutic splenectomy. The alternative and rare situation of splenic and portal vein occlusion was demonstrated and therefore removal of the spleen was not an appropriate procedure for relief of portal hypertension. The variceal bleeding was successfully controlled with injection sclerotherapy.
