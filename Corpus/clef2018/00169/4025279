Superior mesenteric venous aneurysm. A patient presented with recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Celiac and superior mesenteric angiography showed a superior mesenteric venous aneurysm, a normal-sized liver, an enlarged spleen, and esophageal varices. The patient gave no history of hepatitis or alcoholism. It is concluded that the portal hypertension was secondary to aneurysm of the superior mesenteric vein. Aneurysms of the portal venous system can cause chronic portal hypertension due to alteration of blood flow. We believe this to be the second case reported in the English literature of a superior mesenteric venous aneurysm.
