Splenic haemodynamics and portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis and spleen enlargement. The relationships between portal hypertension and spleen enlargement, in patients with liver cirrhosis, are not clearly defined as well as those between splenic haemodynamics and portal hypertension. In 25 cirrhotics with spleen enlargement and portal hypertension and in seven controls, the following parameters were determined: estimated splenic volume (ESV) from the radiographic view of the spleen, according to Blendis, Williams and Kreel (1969), specific splenic blood-flow (SSBF), total splenic blood-flow (TSBF), porto-hepatic gradient (PHG), specific splenic resistance (SSR) and total splenic resistance (TSR). Moreover, the size and extension of oesophageal varices, at oesophagoscopy, were classified according to Dagradi (1973). PHG, ESV and TSBF were increased in all subjects, SSBF was increased in two cases, SSR was increased in two cases and decreased in two cases, TSR was decreased in all cases and ESV was not correlated to the level of portal hypertension. Neither TSBF nor TSR were found to be correlated to the level of portal hypertension, as estimated by PHG or by oesophageal varices. It is concluded that, in patients with liver cirrhosis and spleen enlargement, splenomegaly is likely to be the consequence of pulp hyperplasia and not of passive congestion, and that increases in splenic blood-flow do not contribute significantly to portal hypertension.
