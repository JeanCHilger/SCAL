Nodular, non-cirrhotic liver associated with portal hypertension in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. A patient with rheumatoid arthritis developed portal hypertension and died from bleeding oesophageal varices. The liver was small and showed a nodular, non-cirrhotic pattern similar to that described by Blendis et al (1970 and 1974) in association with Felty's syndrome. This appears to be the first report of a patient with this liver lesion associated with rheumatoid arthritis in the absence of Felty's syndrome. The liver lesions described here are compared with partial nodular transformation and nodular regenerative hyperplasia in spite of some differences it is not proven that these are distinct entities and further study is required to settle this question.
