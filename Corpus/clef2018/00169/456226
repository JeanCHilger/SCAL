Pancreatic duct arteriovenous fistula and the metastatic fat necrosis syndrome. This report summarizes the course of a patient with asymptomatic chronic pancreatitis associated with hemorrhage into the pancreatic duct and metastatic fat necrosis. Retrograde cannulation of the pancreatic duct and superior mesenteric arteriography established the presence of a pseudocyst with a pancreatic duct-arteriovenous (DAV) fistula as the cause of the syndrome. Ligation of feeder vessels with external drainage of the cyst as the initial surgical procedure stopped the bleeding but failed to prevent recurrence of the pancreatic duct-venous fistula. A pancreaticoduodenectomy with resection of the cyst and fistula was required to arrest destruction of distant tissues. Although serum and urine amylase concentrations were markedly elevated, serum lipase levels were normal throughout the patient's course. Elevation of serum lipase does not seem to be a necessary condition for the development of the metastatic fat necrosis syndrome.
