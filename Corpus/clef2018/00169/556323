The diagnostic value of wedged hepatic vein pressure in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (author's transl). In 38 patients with chronic hepatitis and 53 patients with liver cirrhosis the portal vein pressure was determined by wedged hepatic vein pressure (WHVP). There were significant differences among chronic persistent, chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. The wedged hepatic vein pressure increased in chronic active hepatitis according to the rate of hepatic connective tissue. The platelet count and the thromboplastin time were correlated to the values of wedged hepatic vein pressure not only in chronic active hepatitis but in liver cirrhosis as well. The correlation among serum albumin level, bromsulphalein retention and systolic blood pressure after Riva-Rocci and wedged hepatic vein pressure was significant in liver cirrhosis exclusively. Even if the determination of wedged hepatic vein pressure does not permit an absolute statement on the risk of hemorrhage of esophageal varicosis it is nevertheless suited for follow-up controls in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and renders possible an outlook on the progress of the disease.
