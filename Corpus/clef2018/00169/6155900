Massive pancreatic serous effusions. The condition of massive pancreatic serous effusion is being increasingly recognized as a specific complication of pancreatitis. It occurs as a result of leakage of pancreatic juice into the pleural or peritoneal cavity after disruption of the duct system. Five such cases are described. The difficulties in making the diagnosis are mainly due to the absence of symptoms of pancreatitis, and most patients present because of the effects of the effusion. Once suspected, the diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of a grossly elevated amylase level in the fluid. A rational surgical approach is usually successful, and depends on the demonstration of a leak from a pseudocyst or disruption of the pancreatic duct system.
