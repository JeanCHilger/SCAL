Splenic repercussions after Warren's distal spleno -renal shunt. Volume and function of the spleen were checked in 14 patients 6 months to 7.5 years (average: 2.5 years) after Warren distal spleno-renal shunt. In addition to the shunt, the splenic artery was ligated proximally in 5 cases. Splenomegaly decreased in half of the patients. In 8 out of the 13 patients with preoperative hypersplenism, the latter improved or disappeared after operation. Increased splenomegaly or hypersplenism was never found postoperatively. Splenic effects of the distal spleno-renal shunt are related to the improvement of the venous stasis. Efficiency of the splenic artery ligation is so doubtful that we do not recommend such a procedure.
