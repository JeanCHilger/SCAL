Computer tomographic findings in portal hypertension caused by liver cirrhosis. 1. Morphologic changes--qualitative and quantifiable parameters. The CT findings in 80 patients with confirmed portal hypertension due to intrahepatic block were analysed retrospectively. The findings included ascites, hypo-dense areas in the liver, nodular or irregular liver contour, the inability to define intrahepatic portal vessels with narrow window settings, the so-called "kissing" sign and evidence of hepato-fugal collaterals and thickening of the wall of the oesophagus. Electronic measurements of various organs (liver, spleen) and vessel diameters (portal vein, superior mesenteric vein) provide parameters which permit classification of patients into the cirrhotic group, as compared with a control group. The statistical significance of this classification was checked by the Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff test.
