Selective variceal decompression in portal vein thrombosis. Thirty-two patients with congenital portal vein thrombosis have been managed for bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices. Fifteen had splenectomy and/or other therapy before referral: nine were managed by endoscopic sclerosis, four by devascularization and two by total shunt six rebled. Seventeen had their spleen 'in situ' at referral and were evaluated for selective shunt: thirteen had distal splenorenal shunts (DSRS)--one transiently rebled despite a patent shunt and one had shunt thrombosis
