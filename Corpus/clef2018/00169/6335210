Portal perfusion following Warren shunt. Report on 15 controlled patients with open Warren-Shunt. The pre- and postoperative percentage of portal liver perfusion was determined by the sequential liver perfusion scintigraphy. The portal liver perfusion was significantly reduced after Warren-Shunt, presumably because the perfusion of the spleen is derived from portal perfusion. The preoperative size of the spleen may be correlated to the reduction of portal perfusion. Therefore, spleen perfusion and its percentage of portal perfusion should be measured preoperatively.
