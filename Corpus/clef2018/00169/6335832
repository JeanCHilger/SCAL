Curative treatment of bleeding esophageal varices secondary to a splenic arterio-venous fistula. A 59 year old female, who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and ascites, developed major bleeding from esophageal varices. Celiac angiography demonstrated a splenic arterio-venous fistula with early filling of an enlarged splenic vein and esophageal varices (pre-sinusoidal extra hepatic portal hypertension). The patient underwent splenectomy and resection of the fistula with resultant disappearance of the varices and presenting symptoms.
