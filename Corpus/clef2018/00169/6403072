Extraction of nontype-specific antigens of group A Streptococcus by potassium thiocyanate. A method for extraction of nontype-specific antigens of the group A streptococcus cellular wall from whole microbial cells is described. Potassium thiocyanate was used as an extracting agent. Nontype-specific antigens of the thiocyanate extract purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation were examined by immunodiffusion in agar gel. The thiocyanate extracts were found to contain several nontype-specific protein antigens part of which were absent from the HCl-extracts. No group A streptococcal polysaccharide was found in the thiocyanate extracts.
