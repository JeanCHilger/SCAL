Laparoscopy and radioisotope imaging in the investigation of suspected liver disease. We have reviewed the clinical and investigative details of 141 patients who underwent laparoscopy in order to determine how best this technique can be used. The clinical history and biochemical investigations usually only indicated some form of hepatobiliary disease, but all patients with spider telangiectasia, splenomegaly, or esophagogastric varices had diffuse parenchymal liver disease, and further investigation was only required to detect its cause. Laparoscopy succeeded in 129 patients (91%), and serious complications occurred in six (4%). The appearance of the liver did not accurately reflect the underlying pathology, indicating the need for biopsy in all cases. Laparoscopy and 99mTc-sulfur colloid liver imaging each failed to detect a few hepatic malignancies, but none were missed by both investigations combined, and similar results were obtained for parenchymal liver disease. Scanning and laparoscopy proved a highly accurate diagnostic combination.
