Portal obstruction in children. I. Clinical investigation and hemorrhage risk. We examined 108 children with obstruction of the portal vein. Symptoms included splenomegaly and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage. Obstruction was secondary to portal vein injury in 44 children and was combined with congenital malformations in 17 others. Ultrasonography provided the correct diagnosis in 36 of the 37 children in whom it was performed. Angiography, performed in 101 children, showed that the obstruction extended to the superior mesenteric vein in 14 children and to the entire portal venous system in seven intrahepatic branches were involved in half the cases. Natural splenorenal shunts were visible in 19 children but were not clearly associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal tract bleeding
