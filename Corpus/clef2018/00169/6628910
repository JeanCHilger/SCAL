Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. Study of 15 cases and review of the literature. The authors report 15 cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver observed in 10 women and 5 men during a 9 year period. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured esophageal varices revealed the liver disease in 11 cases. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were noted in 9 cases and ascites in 7. Anicteric cholestasis was demonstrated in 10 cases. Another disease, e. g. myelofibrosis and monoclonal gammapathy, was present in 11 patients. In 10 patients, portal diversion was performed outcome being favorable with a follow-up of one to six years. The analysis of these cases and of the 113 previously published reports calls for the following comments: 1) In most cases, NRH is characterized by small-sized hepatocytic nodules scattered throughout the entire liver with no surrounding fibrosis
