Effects of intravenous fat emulsion administration on exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. A study was made of alterations in exocrine and endocrine function of the pancreas following infusion of a 10% fat emulsion preparation (Intralipid) into 5 patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy and in 5 dogs with a chronic pancreatic fistula. Pancreatic exocrine secretion was significantly increased by 18.3% in the volume, 27.5% in the output of bicarbonate in humans and 8.9% in the volume, 26.1% in the output of amylase, 7.6% in the output of bicarbonate in dogs, by intravenous administration of the fat emulsion. The administration of the fat emulsion was followed by slight to minimal changes in blood sugar, amylase and IRI. The blood IRG level was significantly elevated but showed small fluctuations. The increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion induced by the fat emulsion was considered not to be mediated by intrinsic hormones but rather to be due to other humoral mechanisms.
