Portal hypertension associated with systemic mastocytosis and splenomegaly. An unusual case of systemic mastocytosis with splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and bleeding esophageal varices is presented. Arteriograms and liver biopsy suggested the mechanism of the portal hypertension was due to increased blood flow in the splenic vein, although splenic arteriovenous shunting secondary to histamine release and increased intrahepatic resistance secondary to mast cell infiltration might have played a role. The portal hypertension was relieved by splenectomy.
