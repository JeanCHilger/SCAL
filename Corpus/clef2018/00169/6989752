Mitogenic and antigenic properties of group A streptococcal M protein preparations. The separation of a mitogenic substance in M protein preparations of Streptococcus pyogenes, type 1 and type 12, is described. The isolation was achieved by gel chromatography on Biogel A 0.5 m, and by immunochromatography on immobilized type specific antibodies. In the delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity test the immunochromatography purified M 1 protein caused erythema but no unspecific mitogenicity could be found by lymphocyte transformation test. In neutralization experiments the mitogenic activity of M protein preparations was specifically inhibited by anti-erythrogenic toxin antisera.
