Antibody levels in mothers colonised with group B streptococci during pregnancy and in their newborn infants, as measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure serum antibodies to group B streptococci in 20 healthy pregnant women before delivery and in their newborn infants. The sera from 10 of these women who were colonised with group B streptococci and umbilical cord sera from their infants, had higher levels of type-specific IgG antibody than the 10 non-colonised controls and their neonates. All the babies remained well. The results demonstrate that infants from colonised mothers receive type-specific antibody. The possibility that this antibody may provide some degree of protection at birth against this potentially lethal organism warrants investigation.
