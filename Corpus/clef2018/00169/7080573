Liver cirrhosis in autopsy material within 48 years. II. Causes of death, liver cell carcinoma, weights of liver and spleen (author's transl). Post mortems of 2289 patients with liver cirrhosis revealed that 37% died of causes related directly to cirrhosis i.e. liver failure or hemorrhage from oesophageal varices. Patients who died of ruptured oesophageal varices in 82% have splenomegaly and most frequently hepatomegaly. Livercell carcinomas were recognized in 7,5% of cirrhotic livers, increasing to 10% in 1976-1978. This rise particularly is conspicuous in women. Liver carcinoma is 4,5 times more frequent in postnecrotic than in portal cirrhosis.
