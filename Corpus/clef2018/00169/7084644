Absence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices. Esophageal varices were injected with 5% sodium morrhuate and a solution containing thrombin, concentrated dextrose, and cephalothin sodium using the flexible gastroscope with balloon cuff modification. Hematologic and coagulating parameters were checked before and after the procedure to look for evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. No effect was noted on hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, haptoglobin, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrin split products, factor V, or factor VIII. Injection sclerotherapy with currently available solutions appears to have no effect on the systemic coagulation system.
