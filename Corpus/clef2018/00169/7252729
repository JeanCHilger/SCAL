Hepatoportal sclerosis in childhood: a mimic of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction. In the absence of cirrhosis, most children with portal hypertension and bleeding esophageal varices have extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In the past 2 yr this clinical picture has been mimicked by two children with hepatoportal sclerosis causing their variceal hemorrhage. Hepatoportal sclerosis has been well described in adults. It is manifested by splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and variable ascites and hepatomegaly. Liver histology is initially normal but subsequently shows periportal fibrosis without cirrhosis. Hepatic manometrics indicate a presinusoidal block, but angiography demonstrates a patient portal vein. Typically there is abrupt narrowing of the intrahepatic portal branches, giving a "withered tree" appearance. These findings are illustrated by two children who presented with esophageal variceal bleeding at 21 and 20 mo of age, respectively. They are the youngest reported cases of hepatoportal sclerosis. The etiology of hepatoportal sclerosis is uncertain, but the disease appears to be only slowly progressive. Control of variceal bleeding by central portosystemic shunts in this condition is associated with a 50% incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore alternate methods of therapy need be considered. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy successfully controlled variceal bleeding in one child reported here. Hepatoportal sclerosis is a distinct entity and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of portal hypertension in infants and children.
