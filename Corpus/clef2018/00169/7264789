Congenital hepatic fibrosis in children. Twenty-seven children with congenital hepatic fibrosis were followed for three months to 12 years. Hepatosplenomegaly, normal liver function tests, and kidney abnormalities were present in most patients, indicating that a correct diagnosis of congenital hepatic fibrosis could be made using simple clinical, biologic, and radiologic criteria. Esophageal endoscopy showed varices in 21 patients. Sixteen children underwent portal-systemic shunt surgery. Follow-up examinations did not show any impairment of liver function or any sign of hepatic encephalopathy. Cholangitis was present in only three children.
