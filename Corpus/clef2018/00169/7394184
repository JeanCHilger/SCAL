CT of the liver in cirrhosis (author's transl). Of the diseases causing diffuse hepatic parenchyma alterations, CT will demonstrate most typically fatty replacement and hemochromatosis. Cirrhosis of the liver will be detected by CT in only a minority of the patients by virtue of changes in size and contour. Changes in attenuation coefficient in cirrhotic livers are described by some authors but not confirmed on a large scale until now. CT is useful for demonstrating associated anomalies such as signs of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, venous collaterals and ascites) and for studying the permeability of the portal vein.
