Unusual thoracoabdominal duplication associated with pancreaticopleural fistula. The clinical case is presented of a 16-yr-old patient with thoracoabdominal duplication that communicated with the main pancreatic duct and the right pleural cavity and resulted in pancreaticopleural fistula. Although abdominal duplications communicating with the pancreas have been described before, to our knowledge, such an anomaly with intrathoracic extension has never been reported. Pleural effusions of high amylase content and surgical management of  thoracoabdominal duplications are discussed.
