Disseminated intravascular coagulation in endemic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Thrombin and plasmin generation were assessed in patients with endemic hepatosplenic schistomiasis (15 hepatosplenomegalic, 15 splenomegalic, 15 with advanced hepatic fibrosis and ascites and 15 hepatosplenic patients with hematemesis). Prolongation of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, a decrease in antithrombin III and protein C and S levels and elevation in fibrinopeptide A, D-dimer and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were detected in all groups. The deficit in hemostatic parameters was more pronounced with the advancement of the disease and was maximal in the hematemesis group. Our data demonstrate an increase in both thrombin and plasmin generation and indicate that low grade disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur in association with endemic Egyptian hepatosplenic schistosomiasis even in the steady state without overt bleeding.
