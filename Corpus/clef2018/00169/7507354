Post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocyst: non-operative conservative management--report on 3 cases. The authors report on 3 cases of post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children. Complete healing occurred with non-operative conservative treatment and total parenteral nutrition. Daily follow-up with clinical evaluation, abdominal ultrasound and lab exams are detailed under definite criteria of selection and follow-up. This mode of treatment might be considered as an alternative to exploratory laparotomy and external drainage.
