Tropical splenomegaly syndrome: who gets oesophageal varices? Of sixty eight patients with tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), 12 had asymptomatic oesophageal varices (OV). All 12 had massive splenomegaly (Hackett's stage 4 or 5). Eight of the 12 were multiparous females, mainly of Rwandese origin. Endoscopic appearance of the varices suggested that TSS varices were not likely to bleed. None of the patients with the varices had abdominal collaterals belonging to the portal system.
