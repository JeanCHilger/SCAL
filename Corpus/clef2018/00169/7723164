Study of the changes in portal hemodynamics after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy with reference to the variceal recurrence. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) combined with percutaneous transhepatic obliteration was performed in 63 cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices. In all patients, esophageal varices were completely disappeared after EIS. To investigate risk factors for recurrence of esophageal varices after EIS, hemodynamic changes in the portal system before and after EIS were studied by portal vein catheterization and ultrasonography. In patients in whom portal pressure rose after EIS, recurrence of varices was observed in high incidence (p < 0.05). Furthermore, variceal recurrence appeared frequently in patients with progressive splenomegaly after EIS (p < 0.05). During post-EIS course, new appearance or increase in size of non-variceal portosystemic collaterals was detected by ultrasonography in 22% of the patients. In these patients, variceal recurrence rate was low (p = 0.09). In patients with shunts around the splenic hilum, variceal recurrence rate was lower compared with the patients with paraumbilical vein (p < 0.05). Prognostic factors for variceal recurrence were analysed using multiple regression model. It was suggested that the absence of non-variceal portosystemic collaterals was the most risky factor. In conclusion, observation of portal hemodynamics is considered to be useful for the long-term management of patients with esophageal varices treated with EIS.
