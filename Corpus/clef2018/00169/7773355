Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal variceal hemorrhage in myeloproliferative disorder: case report. A 70-year-old woman with myeloproliferative disorder and massive splenomegaly presented with hematemesis. Emergency endoscopy demonstrated bleeding from esophageal varices. Management of variceal hemorrhage by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy, using 5% ethanolamine oleate, was successful. Following the control of variceal bleeding, she was treated with hydroxyurea, a myelosuppressive agent. The spleen size markedly decreased and she was discharged 3 months later. Variceal hemorrhage in myeloproliferative disorder has been reported to be fatal on many occasions, despite different therapeutic approaches, including surgery. In this report, we demonstrated that endoscopic injection sclerotherapy followed by treatment with a myelosuppressive agent was effective in a patient with myeloproliferative disorder and variceal hemorrhage.
