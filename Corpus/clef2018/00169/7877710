Recurrent hepatic pre-coma resulting from a spontaneous porto-spleno-renal shunt (PSRS). A 64-year-old Turkish male is described with recurrent hepatitic (pre-)coma resulting from a spontaneous porto-spleno-renal shunt, portal hypertension and hepatic insufficiency. In cases of chronic encephalopathy resulting from hepatic insufficiency that may be due to liver cirrhosis, the presence of a spontaneous porto-spleno-renal shunt should be considered as a distinct possibility, not only in the absence of apparent oesophageal varices and splenomegaly, but also when there is hepatopetal flow in the portal vein.
