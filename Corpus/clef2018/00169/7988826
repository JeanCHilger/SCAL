Gastric mucosal bleeding time in cirrhosis. Gastric mucosal bleeding time was measured prospectively in 25 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension undergoing routine sclerotherapy. Age and sex-matched controls without liver disease were also studied. Correlations were sought between gastric mucosal bleeding time and age, platelet count, prothrombin time, skin bleeding time, Child-Pugh score, variceal size before sclerotherapy, and degree of portal hypertensive gastropathy. Gastric bleeding time was prolonged in 12% of the patients with cirrhosis (mean, 3.24 minutes SEM, 0.476) and in none of the controls (mean, 3.0
