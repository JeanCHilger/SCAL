Fibrinolytic parameters during acute haematemesis in endemic hepatosplenomegaly. Fibrinogen (Fg), plasminogen (Plg), alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2-AP), plasminogen activator (PA), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), D-dimer (DD) and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP) were studied in 60 subjects: 40 patients with endemic hepatosplenomegaly (20 during acute haematemesis from ruptured oesophageal varices, 20 with endemic hepatosplenomegaly assigned to the same grade of oesophageal varices but with no history of haematemesis) and 20 normal controls. All parameters were markedly altered in the disease groups. Reduced levels of Fg, Plg, alpha 2-AP and PAI were associated with increasing levels of PA, t-PA, DD and FDP. Alterations were most marked in the group complicated by acute bleeding. It was concluded that these patients have an enhanced fibrinolytic state. This was probably aggravated in the haematemesis group by an acute haemostatic imbalance that superimposed the low grade chronic DIC reported in cases of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.
