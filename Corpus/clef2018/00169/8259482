Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis: case report and clinical review. Although seen rarely in Switzerland, schistosomiasis is a parasitosis affecting 200 to 250 million people round the world, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Central and South America. Depending on the parasitic species, the ureters and the bladder (S. haematobium) or the intestine and the liver (S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi) are primarily involved. Other organs may be affected (lung, kidneys and central nervous system). Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis represents a special form of chronic infection by S. mansoni, S. japonicum or S. mekongi predominantly occurring in adolescents heavily and repeatedly infected during childhood, together with an additional genetic predisposition for the disease. Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis on a worldwide scale is one of the most prevalent causes of portal hypertension in man. We describe a 33-year-old Portuguese female with mansonian hepatosplenic schistosomiasis 12 years after leaving Africa, who had hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, esophageal varices and hypersplenism. Splenomegaly and slight anemia had been known for years without prompting further work-up. Two months before diagnosis she had been delivered of a normal child after pregnancy without portal-hypertensive complications, namely esophageal hemorrhage. Because of placenta accreta, however, erythrocyte transfusion had been performed after delivery and was possibly responsible for hepatitis C found later on. Pathophysiology, clinical findings and therapy of the disease are discussed.
