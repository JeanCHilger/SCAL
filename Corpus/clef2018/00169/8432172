Bleeding varices due to portal hypertension in sarcoidosis. Favorable effect of propranolol and prednisone. A 58-year-old white man had bleeding varices in the gastric fundus due to portal hypertension attributable to histologically proven hepatic sarcoid involvement with a giant splenomegaly and with an angiographically demonstrated significant flow toward the liver. Treatment with corticosteroids and beta-blockade (30 mg propranolol daily) resulted in no rebleeding for over one year follow-up.
