Asymptomatic extrahepatic portal obstruction without portal hypertensive findings detected in ultrasonic mass screening. We report three adult cases of extrahepatic portal obstruction (EHPO) detected by ultrasonic (US) mass screening.All these cases were asymptomatic with no abnormalities on hematological or biochemical tests. Only indocynanine green clearance test revealed a slight abnormality. By imaging modalities, the portal trunk could not be visualized and cavernous transformation could be visualized.There were no findings of portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, esophageal varices and hepatofugal collaterals, in any of these cases.As many EHPOs without symptoms can be detected on US mass survey, US is considered to be the best modality for screening for this disease.
