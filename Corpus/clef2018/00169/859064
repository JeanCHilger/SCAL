Cholesterol ester storage disease: clinical, biochemical, and pathological studies. Of three siblings affected with cholesterol ester storage disease, two died at ages 7 and 9 years, respectively, with hepatic scarring and portal hypertension. Lipid storage was documented in both patients, as were esophageal varices and aortic plaques in the older child. The third affected sibling, followed to 13 years of age, has hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, short stature, adrenal calcification, and acid lipase deficiency. Leukocyte extracts demonstrated deficiency of acid lipase in this patient. This autosomal recessive condition may be allelic with Wolman disease with a more malignant course in this family than in most reported cases.
