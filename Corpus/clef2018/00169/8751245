Surgical treatment of pancreatic ascites and pancreatic pleural effusions. Massive ascites and pleural effusions are uncommon but well-documented complications of chronic pancreatitis. The present study reviews the results of surgical management of pancreatic ascites and pleural effusions of pancreatic origin.From forty-nine patients with chronic pancreatitis presenting with ascites and/or pleural effusion of pancreatic origin, 31 were surgically treated.Nineteen had ascites only, ten pleural effusions and two presented with both conditions. Diagnosis of the internal pancreatic fistula was based on the findings of high amylase levels and elevated albumin content of the peritoneal and pleural exudates. Failure of medical therapy was the indication of surgical treatment in all patients. Thirteen were submitted to internal pancreatic drainage, 17 to external drainage and one to distal pancreatic resection. Eight of 17 externally drained patients were reoperated for intraperitoneal abscesses (2), infected pseudocyst (1), pain recurrence (3) and pancreatic fistula (2) whereas reoperation occurred in only one of the 13 patients submitted to internal drainage (p < 0.05).Internal pancreatic drainage was the ideal surgical treatment for patients with pancreatic ascites and/or pleural effusion that did not respond to medical treatment. When this was not feasible external drainage was successfully used as an alternative to pancreatic resection.
