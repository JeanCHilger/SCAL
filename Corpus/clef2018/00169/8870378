Rapid liver failure related to chronic C hepatitis in an HIV seropositive hemophilic patient with severe immunodepression. We report the case of a young HIV seropositive patient with severe hemophilia A who presented rapid liver failure related to his chronic C hepatitis. The patient had been receiving factor VIII:C clotting factor concentrates (mean 60,000 U/year) since 1975. In 1984 alanine aminotransferase presented abnormal levels. The CD4 lymphocyte count in 1991 was normal and ultrasonographic scan showed normal liver morphology. In 1991 the patient were found to be seropositive for HCV antibodies as detected by the ELISA method and confirmed by the RIBA method. One year later, a progressive increase in policlonal gamma-globulin and a decrease in the CD4+ lymphocyte count to below 500/muL were detected in concomitance with ultrasonographic evidence of a progressive increase in the longitudinal diameters of the liver and spleen and signs of liver inhomogeneity. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the increase in the longitudinal diameter of the liver and the decline in albumin levels, and between the increase in the longitudinal diameter of the liver and the drop in platelet count. Elevated levels of ammonemia, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and IgA were detected. Moreover, decreased levels of the C4 and C3 complement fractions were documented. At this time (1994), esophagogram and esophagogastroscopy evidenced varicosities in the lower esophageal section (stage F1). The patient died in 1995 March at the age of 29 years of sudden septic shock related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
