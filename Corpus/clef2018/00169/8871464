Pancreaticopleural fistula: a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreaticopleural fistula is an uncommon sequelae of pancreatitis. The condition is often elusive, as respiratory rather than abdominal symptoms usually predominate and the fistula can be difficult to demonstrate radiologically. Confirmation is by demonstrating a high amylase content in the pleural aspirate relative to the serum. About half the fistulae will close with conservative treatment but persistent or recurrent effusions, often associated with stenosis or disruption of the main pancreatic duct, are an indication for surgery. The long-term outcome is good in 80-95% of cases. We report five patients with pleural effusion of pancreatic origin due to pancreaticopleural fistula.
