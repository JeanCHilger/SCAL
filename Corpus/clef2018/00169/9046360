Effect of glucagon and somatostatin on pancreatic secretion in dogs. The authors investigated the effects of glucagon and a somatostatin preparation (Stilamin) on the secretion volume and on the secreted and absorbed enzyme levels of the pancreas. Four groups of dogs with an artificial pancreatic fistula were given a single intravenous injection of glucagon (group I, n = 8), intravenous drip-infusion of glucagon (group II, n = 8), intravenous drip-infusion of somatostatin (group III, n = 10) and intravenous drip-infusion of the carrier fluid, physiological sodium-chloride (control, group IV, n = 5), respectively. Pancreatic juices were collected and volume, pH, bicarbonate, amilase, lipase, trypsin and protein contents were determined. Serum amilase and lipase levels before and at the termination of the experiment were also measured. Intravenous drip-infusion of both Glucagon and Stilamin decreased pancreatic secretion, Stilamin being more effective than Glucagon. On the other hand, a single i.v. injection of Glucagon resulted in an increased secretion. The authors suggest that based on the observed inhibitory effect on pancreatic secretion, both glucagon and somatostatin could be used to reduce postoperative complications of pancreatic operations in the clinical practice.
