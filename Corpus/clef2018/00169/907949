Portal hypertension complicating myelofibrosis: reversal following splenectomy. Portal hypertension occurs in approximately 10% of patients with myelofibrosis. Increased portal blood flow secondary to splenomegaly has been proposed to explain its development. In a 60-year-old woman with proven myelofibrosis of 10 years' duration and gross splenomegaly, portal hypertension developed with esophageal varices and ascites. There was no demonstrable obstruction to portal blood flow. Following splenectomy the ascites and esophageal varices disappeared. Despite the presence of splenic myeloid metaplasia, splenectomy did not impair the patient's hematologic status. Portal hypertension complicating myelofibrosis has a poor prognosis, so careful attention should be given to its detection. Splenectomy may be preferable to portal-systemic shunting in the management of this complication.
