A case of idiopathic portal hypertension complicated with narrowing of intrahepatic bile ducts. A 37-year-old woman who had portal hypertension followed by splenomegaly, developed collateral blood flow of spleno-renal shunt and paraesophageal veins, esophageal varices and further with narrowing of intrahepatic bile ducts shown by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was described. Liver function was almost normal except the slight elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels. However, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed the narrowing of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The histological examination of biopsied specimen showed no prominent change in portal tracts and bile ducts without cell infiltration or fibrosis in the portal area. This case will be considered as idiopathic portal hypertension complicated by narrowing of the intrahepatic bile ducts.
