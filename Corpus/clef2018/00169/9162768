Results of use of sandostatin in pancreatoduodenal resections. From February 1995 to July 1996 pancreato-duodenal resection has been performed in 12 patients in RCS (7 men and 5 women, mean age 53.6 years). The operation was indicated in malignant tumors of the pancreatic head, big duodenal papilla, distal part of common bile tract (9 patients) benign diseases of pancreas (3 patients). Sandostatin (0.3 mg/day for 4-7 days) was used in all cases to prevent postoperative pancreatitis and pancreato-jejuno-anastomosis incompetence. The levels of alphfa-amylase, blood glucose, leucocytes were monitored, as well as the duration of pancreato-jejuno-anastomosis drainage use, rate and seriousness of postoperative complications and duration of in-patient treatment. The results were compared to a control group, consisting of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 53.8 years) with malignant tumours of big duodenal papilla, head of the pancreas, common bile tract. The use of Sandostatin has decreased the level of alphfa-amylase in the first postoperative day to 292.8 +/- 152.2 u/l vs. 594.9 +/- 368.79 in a control group (p > 0.05), duration of the drainage use: 6.1 +/- 1.5 days vs. 12.9 +/- 7.2 days (p < 0.05). The number and rate of severity of postoperative complications were significantly less: 58.3% vs. 100%. The frequency of pancreato-jejuno-anastomosis incompetence has decreased 3 times
