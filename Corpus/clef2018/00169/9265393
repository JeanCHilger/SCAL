Liver transplantation and splenectomy in idiopathic portal hypertension. Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) was diagnosed in a 30-year-old man. Clinical signs were splenomegaly, leucothrombocytopenia, and esophageal varices of fourth degree. The histology of the liver biopsy showed portal fibrosis with no evidence of cirrhosis. No causing agent or known disease could be found for the histopathological and clinical features. Due to a severe deterioration of general condition and a decline of synthetic liver function, liver transplantation and splenectomy were performed. The histological examination of the explanted liver revealed features of IPH, demonstrating portal fibrosis and dilated vessels adjacent to portal tracts no cirrhosis was found. The postoperative recovery was without any severe complications. The duration of hospitalization was 28 days. Following liver transplantation, the esophageal varices disappeared and leucocytes, platelets as well as parameters of hepatic synthesis reached normal values. Initially, the immunosuppression was composed of prednisolon, tacrolimus, and antibodies against IL-2 receptors (BT 563) and was later continued with prednisolon and tacrolimus. Within the follow-up observation of 26 months, there was no evidence for graft rejection, severe infection, or occurrence of portal hypertension. Up till now the patient is in good condition with normal graft function. Liver transplantation may be a curative therapy for patients with advanced disease of IPH but the long-term follow-up after transplantation has to show whether IPH can reoccur.
