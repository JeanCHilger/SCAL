Portal vein thrombosis and multiple liver abscesses in Crohn's disease--an example for successful conservative treatment. We report about a 27-year-old patient with Crohn's disease presenting with two complications Portal vein thrombosis and multiple liver abscesses. Conservative treatment with antibiotics and percutaneous catheter drainage was successful, the liver abscesses disappeared. 18 months later the patient presented in best condition. Ultrasound showed cavernous transformation of the portal vein system and splenomegaly, discrete esophageal varices were seen by esophagogastroscopy. This is an example for an excellent course under conservative therapy of liver abscesses, on the other hand it is the first reported case of a patient with a combination of portal vein thrombosis and multiple liver abscesses in Crohn's disease.
