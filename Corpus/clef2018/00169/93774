Effects of intestinal amylase and trypsin on pancreatic secretion in the pig. Pigs were surgically prepared with external pancreatic fistulae and duodenal cannulae in order to elucidate whether the proposed intestinal feedback control of pancreatic secretion in the pig--as in rat and man--is exerted by trypsin. Furthermore, the effect of intraluminal amylase on pancreatic secretion was studied. Reintroduction of pancreatic juice into the duodenum or infusion of trypsin into the duodenum depressed the volume of the pancreatic flow and the protein output markedly. Introduction of amylase into the duodenum did not significantly affect the pancreatic secretion. Thus, it seemed as it trypsin but not amylase was involved in the suppression exerted by pancreatic juice on exocrine pancreatic secretion in the pig.
