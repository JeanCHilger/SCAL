Diagnosis and management of pancreatic trauma. The diagnosis and management of 76 patients with pancreatic trauma is reviewed. There was an overall mortality rate of 5 per cent. A preoperative serum amylase determination was a valuable parameter when assessing blunt trauma. Operative management required debridement and external drainage in approximately three-fourths of all injuries. Pancreatic resection was reserved for ductal disruption. Interruption of ductal integrity accounted for 47 per cent of all complications. Only one-third required reoperative therapy. Associated major vascular injuries accounted for all deaths.
