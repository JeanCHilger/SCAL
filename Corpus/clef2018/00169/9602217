Restricted usage of the T-cell receptor V beta repertoire in tonsillitis in association with palmoplantar pustulosis. Focal infections such as chronic tonsillitis or dental caries occasionally play a role in the induction or exacerbation of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Arthro-osteitis is sometimes a complication in severe cases of PPP. To study the effects of bacterial infection on the exacerbation of cutaneous lesions and arthralgia, we investigated the T-cell receptor V beta repertoire in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tonsil tissue after tonsillectomy in 4 cases, who had chronic tonsillitis and a history of exacerbation of cutaneous lesions following a sore throat. First, serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were measured before and after tonsillectomy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Second, 3H-TdR incorporation was used to examine the effects of the culture supernatant on the PBMC of the autologous patients, other PPP patients without tonsillitis and normal controls. T-cell receptor V beta repertoire was examined by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Results showed that IL-8 was significantly high in the serum and abundantly released from tonsillar lymphocytes, which may play a role in the accumulation of neutrophils in lesional skin. T-cell receptors V beta 6 and 12 were preferentially expressed on tonsillar lymphocytes, and V beta 4, 7, 9, 17 and 18 were detected relatively frequently. These data suggest that restricted usage of T-cell receptor V beta subsets may play a crucial role in the induction of tonsillitis associated with PPP.
