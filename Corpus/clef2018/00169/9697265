A prospective analysis of the factors influencing pancreaticojejunostomy performed using a single method, in 100 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies. The factors influencing the healing process of pancreaticojejunostomy (P-J) following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) are still ill defined, allowing the recommendation of various anastomotic methods. We conducted a prospective study to determine the risk factors influencing the protracted healing of P-J, examining 100 consecutive patients who underwent PD followed by P-J, performed as an end-to-side "mucosa-to-mucosa" anastomosis using vertical mattress sutures (VMS method). Protracted healing of P-J was classified as either peripancreatic sepsis (PPS), defined as prolonged suppurative discharge of less than 50 ml a day from the drain beneath the P-J for more than 1 week or a pancreatic fistula (PF), defined as prolonged discharge of more than 50 ml a day with a high amylase content (> 1000 IU) for more than 1 week. There were 80 patients with a malignant neoplasm, and 20 with benign disease. The overall incidence of healing problems following P-J was 9%, which included 6 patients (6%) with PPS and 3 (3%) with PF. Apart from an advanced age of more than 70 years, none of the patients' characteristics or postoperative complications influenced the healing of P-J. The type of reconstruction, an anastomotic stent, the duct size, and a "soft" pancreas were not risk factors either. In conclusion, no factors, apart from the age or any special problem of an individual patient, influenced the dehiscence of P-J when the VMS method was used after PD.
