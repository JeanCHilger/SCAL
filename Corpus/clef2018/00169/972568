Catheterization of the umbilical vein, diagnostic and therapeutic relevance (author's transl). Catheterization of the umbilical vein does allow direct access to the portal system, thus yielding information about the pathophysiology of the hepatic and splanchnic vessel system. Mesurement of the portal vein pressure in conditions of portal hypertension can be performed in the portal vein. A special, three-compartment ballon catheter is available for mesurement of intrahepatic wedge pressure. Angiography of the umbilical vein allows earlier diagnosis of metastases within the liver than other diagnostic procedures. Intraportal application of cytostatic drugs using a long term indwelling umbilical vein catheter is feasible as well. Own experiences are as yet rather limited. Three patients have been treated up to now this way evaluation of the therapeutic results is not yet possible, because of the short duration of therapy and because of the low number of patients. The technique of umbilical vein catheterization does not seem to present any problems. Complications are rare and did not occur in our series.
