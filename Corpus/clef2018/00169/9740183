Laparoscopic gastric devascularization and splenectomy for sclerotherapy-resistant esophagogastric varices with hypersplenism. The combination of sclerotherapy with surgical salvage for sclerotherapy-resistant esophagogastric varices has recently received much attention, however, the longterm results after such an operation have yet to be reported. This is a preliminary report of a laparoscopic adaptation of a previously described surgical procedure for the treatment of refractory esophagogastric varices.Laparoscopic gastric devascularization and splenectomy (Hassab's operation) was successfully performed to treat recurrent sclerotherapy-resistant giant esophageal varices (n=4) and recurrent rebleeding gastric varices (n=6). The patients included 8 men and 2 women who ranged in age from 35 to 67 years (average, 54.2 years). The procedure and clinical results were evaluated from various viewpoints.The duration of the operation ranged from 200 to 400 minutes (mean+/-standard deviation 287.5+/-66.0 minutes) and blood loss from 10 to 1,500 mL (average, 515.5+/-507.9 mL). The weight of the spleen ranged from 500 to 850 g (average 608.0+/-126.6 g). Conversion to minimal open operation with a gasless lifting method was done in 1 patient because of uncontrolled bleeding from the splenic vein. There were no other major complications either intraoperatively or postoperatively. All patients had hypersplenismThe combination of laparoscopic gastric devascularization and splenectomy for sclerotherapy-resistant esophagogastric varices is considered a feasible and relatively safe surgical method for patients with hypersplenism.
