Recognition of splenic vein occlusion. Radiologic findings and medical records of 27 patients with angiographic documentation of splenic vein occlusion were reviewed. The most common causes were pancreatic carcinoma, pancreatitis, and malignant lymphoma. Radiographic findings which suggest splenic vein occlusion are gastric varices without esophageal varices and collateral veins in the left upper abdomen during the vascular phase of rapid sequence pyelography. Additional features may be associated with the underlying disease, such as pancreatic calcification and upper abdominal mass lesions. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by high dose celiac or splenic angiography. Examination of the stomach with barium for the detection of gastric varices is more sensitive than has been previusly recognized features which suggest them are described. Isolated gastric varices may be a clue to isolated splenic vein occlusion and its underlying causes.
