Hyporesponsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to streptococcal superantigens in patients with guttate psoriasis: evidence for systemic stimulation of T cells with superantigens released from focally infecting Streptococcus pyogenes. Throat infection with Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important trigger for acute guttate psoriasis. We examined the in vitro responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to streptococcal superantigens, SPEA and SPEC, and staphylococcal superantigens, SEB and TSST-1, in patients with guttate psoriasis, in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, and in healthy subjects. PBMC from patients with guttate psoriasis responded poorly to SPEA and SPEC at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 ng/ml as compared with those from patients with plaque psoriasis, but showed high responses to SEB and TSST-1. The hyporesponsiveness recovered after improvement of the skin eruption. There was no significant difference between guttate and chronic types of psoriasis in the percentage of circulating T-cell receptor BV2 or BV8-bearing T cells, responsive to streptococcal superantigens, indicating that T-cell clonal anergy was a mechanism underlying the hyporesponsiveness. Our results suggest that superantigens released from focally infecting S. pyogenes induce a transient activation of relevant T cells, leading to the development of skin eruption and, subsequently, temporary T-cell anergy to these toxins.
