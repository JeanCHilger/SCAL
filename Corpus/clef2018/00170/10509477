PCR identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and direct detection in clinical samples from cystic fibrosis patients. This report describes a PCR primer pair that targets the algD GDP mannose gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and produces a specific 520-bp PCR product useful for P. aeruginosa identification. This PCR assay was tested with 182 isolates of P. aeruginosa and 20 isolates of other bacterial species, and demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. The test was also able to detect P. aeruginosa directly in clinical samples such as sputum or throat swabs obtained from cystic fibrosis patients. The combination of this primer with a universal bacterial primer, acting as a control to assess DNA quality in the sample, resulted in a robust PCR method that can be used for rapid P. aeruginosa detection.
