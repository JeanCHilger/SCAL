Comparison of four clinical specimen types for detection of influenza A and B viruses by optical immunoassay (FLU OIA test) and cell culture methods. Although laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses has been widely studied, there is a relative insufficiency of literature examining the impact of specimen type on the laboratory diagnosis of influenza A and B. In a clinical study comparing the FLU OIA test with 14-day cell culture, clinical specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, nasal aspirates, and sputum were obtained from patients experiencing influenza-like symptoms. A total of 404 clinical specimens were collected from 184 patients. Patients were defined as influenza positive if the viral culture of a specimen from any sample site was positive. Patients were defined as influenza negative if the viral cultures of specimens from all sample sites were negative. By this gold standard, culture and FLU OIA test results for each sample type were compared. For each of the four specimen types, the viral culture and FLU OIA test demonstrated equal abilities to detect the presence of influenza A or B virus or viral antigen. Sputum and nasal aspirate samples were the most predictive of influenza virus infection. Throat swabs were the least predictive of influenza virus infection, with both tests failing to detect influenza virus in nearly 50% of the throat samples studied.
