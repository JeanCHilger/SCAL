Distribution and antigenicity of fibronectin binding proteins (SfbI and SfbII) of Streptococcus pyogenes clinical isolates from the northern territory, Australia. Fibronectin binding proteins play an important role in the adherence and invasion of group A streptococci (GAS). Genotypically distinct GAS isolates were screened for the presence and expression of two streptococcal fibronectin binding protein genes, sfbI and sfbII. Of the tested strains, 64 and 36% were shown to harbor and express the sfbI and sfbII genes, respectively. All sfbII-positive strains tested were also positive for sfbI, but only 28% of the sfbII-negative strains were positive for sfbI. High levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies to both SfbI and SfbII were found in sera from 80 subjects with defined streptococcal infections.
