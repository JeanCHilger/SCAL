Two-year survey of Alberta laboratories processing of antenatal group B streptococcal (GBS) screening specimens: implications for GBS screening programs. We evaluated specimen types received and methods used by laboratories to process screening GBS specimens from pregnant women. Surveys during 1995 and 1997 of all laboratories in the province of Alberta, Canada that culture GBS from screening genital specimens were completed. Between surveys, there was dissemination of information about appropriate culture techniques. Survey completion rates were 100% in both years (38/38 in 1995 and 20/20 in 1997). During 1995 as compared to 1997, laboratories were less likely to a) have a specific written protocol for identification of genital GBS screening specimens (1995: 78.2% versus 1997: 100%, p = 0.08) b) be receiving combined vaginal-anorectal swabs (1995: 18% of all swabs received versus 1997: 60.4%, p < 0.001), and c) be using selective GBS culture media (1995: 45.5% versus 1997: 86.7%, p = 0.01). Regions using screening based approaches for GBS prevention need to ensure that their laboratories are using adequate techniques for GBS detection.
