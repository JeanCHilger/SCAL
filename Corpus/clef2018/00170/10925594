Ludwig's angina. Ludwig's angina is a rare infectious condition originating in the oropharyngeal region, most commonly from the teeth. The principal symptoms consist of cervical pain, dyspnea, dysphagia, symmetrical neck swelling and fever. Serious complications include respiratory collapses, mediastinitis, pleural empyema, pericarditis and pericardial tamponade, and may result in the death of the patient. The most useful investigations in patients with suspected Ludwig's angina are clinical assessment, a cervico-thoracic CT-scan to determine the extent of the lesions, microbiological examination and panoramic radiography to detect possible dental focuses of infection. Treatment consists of ensuring adequate ventilation by securing the upper airways, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, eradication of the source of infection, and often early surgical decompression may be necessary. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment can reduce the mortality rate to 10%.
