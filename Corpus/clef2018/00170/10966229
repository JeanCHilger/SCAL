Haemolysin-deficient variants of Streptococcus pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis may be overlooked as aetiological agents of pharyngitis. Variants of large colony beta-haemolytic Lancefield group A, C and G streptococci that are non-haemolytic or alpha-haemolytic on sheep blood agar have been detected in clinical specimens due to their enhanced haemolytic activity when grown on a new selective and differential blood agar medium containing colistin, nalidixic acid and pH 7.5-adjusted PIPES buffer (CNA-P). The large colony Lancefield group C and G isolates were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by API 20 Strep classification and 16S rDNA profiling. The haemolytic activity of these variants on various blood agar media, including CNA-P, was closely similar to that of known streptolysin S-defective mutants of S. pyogenes and was blocked by addition of cholesterol, a specific inhibitor of the streptolysin O family of haemolysins. As haemolysin variants could be detected in large numbers in cultures from patients with clinical symptoms of pharyngitis it is suggested that they may function as primary pathogens in such infections. The high frequency with which haemolysin variants were isolated from clinical specimens during a 3-month trial (3%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of group A, C and G streptococcal isolates) indicated that a substantial proportion of streptococcal infections may go undetected if only conventional sheep blood agar media are used in clinical laboratories for the detection of beta-haemolytic streptococci. As haemolysin variants have been implicated in the development of serious streptococcal sequelae, further investigation of the full extent of their contribution to streptococcal disease is indicated.
