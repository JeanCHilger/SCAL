Induction of Th1-type cytokines by lipoteichoic acid-related preparation isolated from OK-432, a penicillin-killed streptococcal agent. We have isolated the lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-related molecule (OK-PSA) from OK-432, a streptococcal preparation, by an affinity chromatography on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B-bound TS-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that neutralizes interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducing activity of OK-432. In in vitro experiments using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), OK-PSA induced IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF-beta that are generally called "Th1-type cytokines" both in protein and in mRNA levels. Furthermore, the neutralizing test using cytokine-specific antibodies demonstrated that IL-18 plays a most significant role for IFN-gamma- and killer cell-inducing ability of OK-PSA among the other cytokines tested. These findings clearly indicated that OK-PSA, an LTA-related molecule, is a main effective component of OK-432, and is a potent inducer of Th1-type cytokines by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation mediated by monocytes-derived IL-18, and that it may be a useful immunotherapeutic agent for the patients with malignancies better than original OK-432.
