Comparison of cefdinir and penicillin V in the treatment of pediatric streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis continues to be a prevalent pediatric infectious disease that requires prompt treatment for relief of symptoms and to prevent complications.To compare the efficacy/tolerability of cefdinir and penicillin V in the treatment of pediatric GABHS tonsillopharyngitis as demonstrated in two clinical trials of similar design.Multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded trials.Children < or =12 years of age with sore throat, pharyngeal erythema and positive rapid streptococcal antigen test results.In Study A patients took cefdinir 7 mg/kg twice daily or 14 mg/kg once daily or penicillin V 10 mg/kg 4 times daily (all regimens for 10 days). In Study B patients took cefdinir 7 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days or penicillin V 10 mg/kg 4 times daily for 10 days.Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were conducted at multiple times during and after therapy.Of 1274 patients 1122 were evaluable (679 patients received cefdinir 443 received penicillin V). Clinical cure and microbiologic eradication rates were superior in the combined cefdinir treatment groups (94.9 and 92.7%, respectively), whether given once or twice daily for 10 days or twice daily for 5 days, compared with the penicillin treatment group (88.5 and 70.9%, respectivelyCefdinir is a reliable and well-tolerated drug for the management of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children.
