Salivary and serum antibody response to Streptococcus mutans antigens in humans. Humoral immunity against Streptococcus mutans infection was analyzed in caries-active and caries-free young adults by immunoblotting. All volunteers from both groups had detectable salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG antibodies, with similar profiles. They could be classified on the basis of relative intensity of the immunoblot bands into categories of high or low responders. Common protein antigens with molecular weight ranging from approximately 45 to 190 kDa could be found either extracellularly or associated with the cell wall of S. mutans cultured in vitro. The predominant reactive antigens recognized by both IgA and IgG were of proteins around 63 and 60 kDa. Detection of IgA antibodies to the various antigens of S. mutans in individual saliva samples did not always correlate with serum IgG antibody profiles. In addition, distinct bands, which reacted preferentially with either IgA or IgG, could be detected by antibodies from specific subjects. Differential reactivities of salivary IgA and serum IgG antibodies to two, cell-wall associated protein antigens around 33 and 36 kDa were found in caries-active and caries-free young adults 30.8% of caries-free subjects and 12% of caries-active subjects (P < 0.01) exhibited detectable antibody response to these antigens. This difference was not attributable to variations in antibody levels, since antibody response to these proteins were still detectable in some caries-free but not caries-active individuals whose levels of antibodies to other antigens were low. Thus, a new antibody profile which correlates with dental caries disease activity has been identified in a selected population. Differences in mucosal and systemic immune responses to S. mutans seem to be both antigen and host dependent.
