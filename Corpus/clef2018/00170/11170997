Characterization of consecutive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from patients with pharyngitis and bacteriological treatment failure: special reference to prtF1 and sic / drs. To analyze bacteriological treatment failure in streptococcal pharyngitis, 40 consecutive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from 18 patients were characterized. For 17 patients, isolates were indistinguishable with respect to emm type, random amplified polymorphic DNA pattern, and presence of prtF1 encoding the fibronectin-binding protein F1. prtF1 was detected only in the 11 isolates (4 patients) with emm12 and in the single isolate with emm6. Further analysis by vir(mga) regulon typing, sequencing of sic encoding the streptococcal inhibitor of complement from 19 isolates with emm1 (9 patients), and sequencing of drs (distantly related sic) from 11 isolates with emm12 revealed distinct sic alleles with insertions and/or deletions in sic that corresponded to differences in restriction patterns of the vir(mga) regulon only for paired isolates of 2 patients. Among isolates with emm12, 2 novel drs alleles were found. Analysis of these data suggests that neither the presence of prtF1 nor the diversification of sic / drs is required for the persistence of S. pyogenes in pharyngitis.
