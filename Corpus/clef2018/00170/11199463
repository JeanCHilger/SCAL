Diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck region. Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck is a rare occurrence. It spreads rapidly along fascial planes causing extensive necrosis it often results in gangrene of the overlying skin. Mostly involved are immunodeficient patients with banal infections of the upper aerodigestive tract, small traumas, but also after surgical procedures. The "Federal Health Agency" of the Federal Republic of Germany estimates a number of 40 cases a year in Germany for all regions of the body. The mortality is about 20%-50% dependent on the localisation of this soft tissue infection.Four cases of necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck region, which were treated at the ENT-Department of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg since 1995, were described.Despite aggressive surgical debridement and intensive care medicine two patients died because of streptococcus-associated-toxic-shock-syndrome. In all patients we found a diabetes mellitus as a known risk factor for this necrotizing soft tissue disease. In two of four patients with cervical involvement mediastinitis was diagnosed as a complication. The CT-scan showed this mediastinal spread only in one case.Only rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment with radical debridement can influence the disease positively. Thoracal CT-scan is necessary in all cases of cervical necrotizing fasciitis because of the high risk of mediastinal involvement. A strong complication is a streptococcus-associated-toxic-shock-syndrome, which should be prevented because it is often associated with a lethal outcome. Penicillin G and clindamycin are advocated for antibiotic treatment.
