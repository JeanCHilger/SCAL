Clinical features of influenza in the aged. Influenza is a serious disease for the elderly. Influenza causes high fever in the elderly, similar as in healthy adults. Cough lasts longer, but frequency and degree of sore throat and coryza is lower in the elderly. Rapid diagnosis kits based on enzyme-linked immunoassay contribute to quick diagnosis, improving treatment of the elderly. Amantadine can mitigate various symptoms and hastens recovery. Other newly developed neuraminidase inhibitors are also hopeful for treatment. The poor prognosis of influenza in the elderly is associated with a high frequency of pneumonia complications. Decreased serum albumin level is a risk factor for post-influenza pneumonia. To reduce excess influenza death in the elderly, prophylaxis and management of the general health condition of elderly patients may be most important.
