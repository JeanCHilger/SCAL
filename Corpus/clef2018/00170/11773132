Molecular characterization of group A Streptococcus strains isolated during a scarlet fever outbreak. Forty group A streptococcus (GAS) isolates, recovered during a scarlet fever outbreak, were grouped based on their DdeI restriction profiles from emm amplicons. Twenty-seven isolates were identified by sequencing as emm2. The emm2 isolates showed the speA1, speB1, and speC1 alleles. Isolation of this GAS type from scarlet fever outbreaks is uncommon.
