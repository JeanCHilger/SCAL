Phenotypic characterization of some anginosus group isolates from oral and maxillofacial infections. The aim of this study was to briefly characterize serologically, biochemically and from the cultural point of view some anginosus group isolates found in pus samples collected from patients with oral and maxillofacial infections. Cultural characterization was done by studying the culture odor, the colony size and aspect, and hemolysis type on Columbia bood agar (BA). Lancefield grouping was made on cards using the rapid latex-agglutination test (Slidex Strepto-Kit, Bio Mérieux, France). The biochemical characterization was performed at the same time with the speciation by the Rapid ID 32 Strep system (Bio Mérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The anginosus group isolates were phenotypically heterogenic. Based on phenotypic description, nonidentical anginosus group isolates were found in the same patient sample.
