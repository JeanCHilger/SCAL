Evaluation of the diagnostic reagents which detect group A Streptococcus with the immunochromatographical method. Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A was evaluated for this sensitivity and specificity. Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A had a capacity to detect Group A Streptococcus in 1.5x10(5) cfu/swab. The sensitivity of Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A was 4 times higher than the sensitivity of the latex agglutination test (Serodirect 'Eiken' Strep A) and was almost the same as the immunochromatography test (TESTPACK Plus STREP A, CLEARVIEW STREP A and ImmunoCard STAT! STREP A TEST). No cross reaction was observed among 27 strains of 25 species microorganisms with Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A. Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A was compared with TESTPACK Plus STREP A among throat swabs from 50 patients with pharyngitis. Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A had a sensitivity of 92.9%, a specificity of 90.5% and an agreement of 91.8%. Dipstick 'Eiken' Strep A is found to be useful diagnostic assay in the clinical laboratories.
