A link between parotid salivary Ig level and recurrent respiratory infections in young Down's syndrome patients. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the correlation between recurrent respiratory infections and the levels of salivary Ig in a group of young Down's syndrome (DS) individuals. Twenty-three DS and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included. DS individuals who had experienced three or more upper respiratory tract infections (n = 10) in the previous 12 months were compared to DS individuals who had not experienced recurrent respiratory infections (n = 13) and to healthy controls (n = 10). A statistically significant reduction in the Ig salivary secretion rate was recorded in the subgroup with recurrent respiratory infections. No significant differences were seen between the subgroup without recurrent respiratory infections and controls. It is suggested that the secretory immune system provides local immune protection against pathogens in the respiratory tract. Detection of salivary Ig levels may serve as a predictor of the susceptibility of DS individuals to recurrent respiratory tract infections.
