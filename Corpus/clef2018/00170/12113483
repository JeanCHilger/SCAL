Distribution of emm genotypes and superantigen genes of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in Japan, 1994-9. The purpose of this study was to examine characteristic profiles of Streptococcus pyogenes clinical isolates isolated in Japan during 1994-9. Genotyping of the M protein (emm typing) revealed that emm types 12 and 28 were the most common among 316 isolates. Most of the emm12 isolates were isolated from mucosa, while emm58 and emm89 were from skin. Moreover, the emm3 isolates were dominant in invasive infections. The distribution of 6 superantigen genes showed that all isolates harboured the mf gene and many had the speG gene. Invasive isolates were shown to have the ssa gene at a higher rate (76%) than noninvasive (37%). The distribution of superantigens was significantly different between emm types, but not between isolation sites. These results suggest that the distribution of emm types is related to isolation site, whereas superantigen distribution is related to clinical features of S. pyogenes infections.
