Epstein-Barr virus-associated acute interstitial nephritis: infection or immunologic phenomenon? Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in renal tissue in acute interstitial nephritis (IN) has not been previously reported. An 18-year-old male presented with a sore throat, fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and oliguric renal failure. The rapid slide test for heterophile antibodies associated with infectious mononucleosis was positive, and a renal biopsy showed an acute interstitial nephritis. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay identified EBV DNA in the renal biopsy. In situ hybridization (ISH) for EBV RNA and immunohistochemistry for latent membrane protein 1 of EBV were negative. Hemodialysis and prednisone 60 mg PO OD were administered and the s-creatinine dropped from 1,224 to 75 micromol/l over 9 days. The identification of EBV DNA in the kidney raises the possibility that direct infection plays a role in acute IN associated with EBV.
