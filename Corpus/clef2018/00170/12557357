Analysis of virulence-related proteins of Streptococcus suis type 2 from swine Streptococcus isolated in China. Virulence-related proteins, muraminidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular factor (EF) of Streptococcus suis type 2, were extracted from Jiangsu Isolate HA9801 and were used as antigens for preparation of antibodies. Bacterium cell envelope proteins and extracellular proteins of swine Streptococcus strains including 17 Chinese isolates, 1 German strain and 1 human isolate of Streptococcus suis type 2, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the above antibodies, 11 strains produced MRP and 10 strains possessed EF or EF. They exist four phenotypes: MRP+ EF+ (8/19), MRP+ EF (1/19), MRP+ EF- (1/19), MRP- EF- (10/19).
