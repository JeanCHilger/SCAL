Post-streptococcal immunity in the child in acute articular rheumatism (R.A.A.) or recurrent sore throats. It concerns comparative studies between two children groups: One group who had previous RAA. A second group who had anginas only. This work shows the interest to associate two streptococcal serologic tests (ASLO, ASD) in order to increase the number of recent diagnostic streptococcal infectious. The remaining immunity is missing in children less than 5 years old more than 50% of above 10 years an antistreptococcal answer although they have not streptococcus infections presently.
