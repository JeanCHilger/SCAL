Laboratory study and clinical evaluation of ABC-ELISA for detection of mycoplasma pneumoniae antigens. Using anti-M. pneumoniae IgG obtained by immunizing rabbits with whole cell antigen of M. pneumoniae strain FH, we established an ABC-ELISA for detection of M. pneumoniae in simulated positive specimens, ABC-ELISA had a detection limit of 10(4) cfu/ml of specimen. There were no cross-reaction with 4 other species of human mycoplasmas and 12 common species of bacteria in respiratory tract. In 47 patients suspected of being M. pneumoniae infection, we compared the results of ABC-ELISA with the combined results from serodiagnostic methods and M. pneumoniae culture. The coincident rate between them was 80.9%.
