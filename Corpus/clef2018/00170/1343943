Evaluation of indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of coxsackieviruses in clinical samples and its comparison with dot-immunobinding assay. Indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied for the direct detection of coxsackieviruses in clinical samples viz. rectal swabs (RS) and throat swabs (TS) collected from patients admitted to various nursing homes and local hospitals. Results indicate the presence of different CVA types in 65 (62.5%) out of 104 RS, and 18 (52.9%) out of 34 TS samples. Dot-immunobinding assay was also standardized for the identification of CVA types employing 52 RS samples and the results compared with indirect ELISA. Dot-immunobinding detected more CVA types in a relatively larger number of specimens than indirect ELISA.
