Clinical characteristics of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in children. From January 1988 to September 1989, seven patients (4 girls and 3 boys, aged 3-12 years) with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were hospitalised at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. In four patients the disease appeared as a family outbreak, the others were sporadic cases. In six patients the clinical presentation was suggestive of HFRS, as they had fever with headache, myalgia, sore throat and gastrointestinal illness followed by renal abnormalities. However, severe haemorrhagic syndrome with petechia, haematoma, haematemesis and melaena was present in one patient only. Renal disease presented as nephritic syndrome and/or acute renal failure. Five patients recovered after 2-3 weeks without sequellae, one patient had decreased renal function 17 months after the start of the disease and the remaining patient died. In six patients the diagnosis of HFRS was confirmed serologically by a significant rise in antibody titres against hantaviruses, while in the patient with the fetal and fulminant course of the disease, the diagnosis was established on the basis of epidemiological and autopsy findings. We suggest that children living in endemic areas who develop an ill-defined, febrile and gastrointestinal disease with renal dysfunction should be evaluated for HFRS.
