The characteristics of a Russian-made kit for the serological identification of streptococci groups A, B and C. The first Soviet kits for the serological identification of streptococci, groups A, B, and C, on the basis of the coagglutination test were developed. Each kit was intended for 35-40 determinations. The optimum concentration of streptococci during their identification by means of the reagents making up the kit was about 1.6 x 10(9) cells/ml. The specificity of the reagents in comparison with the results of the identification of streptococci by reference methods was 97.3 +/- 0.9%. The reagents making up the kits can be presumably used for solving a number of practical problems in the epidemiological surveillance of streptococcal infection.
