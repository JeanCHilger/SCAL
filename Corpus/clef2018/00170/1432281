Limitations in the usefulness of urine latex particle agglutination tests and hematologic measurements in diagnosing neonatal sepsis during the first week of life. We present findings regarding the usefulness of urine latex particle agglutination (LPA) testing for group B streptococcus (GBS) antigen, as well as hematologic values, in diagnosing sepsis during the 1st week of life. Of 475 inborn neonates evaluated, 27 (5.7%) had confirmed sepsis, 47 (9.9%) had indeterminate findings precluding further classification, and 401 (84.4%) were not septic. We examined the following: (1) total white blood cell count (WBC) (2) total polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)
