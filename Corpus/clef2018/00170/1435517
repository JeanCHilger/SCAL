The group A streptococcal M-type 3 protein gene exhibits a C terminus typical for class I M proteins. The M protein gene (emm gene) from a reference group A streptococcal strain of serotype M3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and partially sequenced. Hybridization assays using an oligonucleotide probe derived from the N-terminal sequence revealed that this gene segment is highly homologous among M-type 3 isolates. Of note, analysis of the nucleotide sequence data from the C terminus of the gene confirmed that the emm 3 gene exhibited all the features characteristic for group A streptococcal M-class I molecules. Recently published sequence data that were assigned to emm 3 resulted from a strain confusion and were shown to be the first one derived from an emm gene of an M-untypable isolate.
