Molecular characterization of a strain of group a streptococcus isolated from a patient with a psoas abscess. We report the first case of a primary group A streptococcus (GAS) psoas abscess in a 31-year-old woman. The psoas abscess was preceded by an episode of acute pharyngitis. The M-protein gene (emm) and streptolysin S structural gene (sagA) were present in the isolate, with no significant amino acid differences from previously described sequences of M1 GAS isolates. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that the isolate belonged to MLST sequence type (MLST-ST) 28, the predominant MLST-ST associated with invasive disease caused by M1 isolates.
