Lipid core peptide technology and group A streptococcal vaccine delivery. The antiphagocytic surface M protein of group A streptococcus has been widely studied as the major candidate antigen for a vaccine to prevent group A streptococcus infection. Approaches that have proven to be effective in animal models include the use of multi-epitope vaccines incorporating highly variable amino terminal serotypic determinants, those based on the carboxy terminal conserved region and combination vaccines incorporating both serotypic and conserved region determinants of the M protein. The use of lipid core peptide technology is at the forefront of this research in the quest to develop a broad-strain protective vaccine that can be delivered via the mucosal route, stimulating mucosal and systemic immunity. This review aims to cover the various strategies and technologies that have been investigated with regard to group A streptococcus vaccine design and development.
