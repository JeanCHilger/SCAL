Streptococcal pharyngitis in a primary care clinic. A study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Directogen Group A Streptococcal Test was carried out in a primary care clinic in University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur. The study also looked at the prevalence of streptococcal pharyngitis in the clinic. We found that the rapid test has a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 90.7%. Viral pharyngitis is the commonest form (63%) of pharyngitis followed by Group A Beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (14.2%). The presence of exudates, tonsillar enlargement and the presence of tender cervical lymph nodes have a significantly higher association with streptococcal pharyngitis.
