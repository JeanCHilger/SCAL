Infections by Streptococcus pyogenes: new aspects of diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical practice, and therapy. Essential procedures for the cultural and serological laboratory diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes are described. A reliable and rapid species identification is achieved by serologic or biochemical tests. Direct antigen detection tests from throat swabs have broadened the diagnostic possibilities however, they are often not satisfactory in terms of sensitivity. Typing of strains (either by classic serologic techniques or by molecular methods) is of high value for the study of clinical and therapeutic questions. In recent years, the epidemiology of the prevalent group A streptococcal strains has changed in Europe as well as in the U.S.: an increase of those M protein serotypes that are associated with higher virulence is being recognized. There is good evidence that the unexpected resurgence of rheumatic fever in the U.S. and the emerging number of life-threatening invasive and toxic manifestations of disease (including the toxic shock syndrome) in the U.S. and in Europe are related to the changing epidemiology. The existence of strains with rheumatogenic and nephritogenic potency has been established, but genetic host factors are a prerequisite for the sequelae as well. Although, based on experimental data, there are a lot of hypotheses concerning the nonsuppurative sequelae and the toxic shock syndrome, the exact pathogenesis of these diseases remains to be clarified. A thorough knowledge of the various clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal infections is necessary in order to apply the therapeutic and preventive measures in a rational and sophisticated manner. For most infections penicillins are considered the drug of choice, although no final conclusions regarding optimal dosages or the reasons for treatment failures can be made.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
