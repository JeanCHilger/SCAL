Sensitivity of a rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococci in a private pediatric office setting: answering the Red Book's request for validation. In the office laboratory of our private practice, the sensitivity of a single rapid antigen detection (RAD) test for group A streptococci (compared with backup throat culture) was examined over 3 winter periods. When cultures were held only 24 hours, the sensitivity was 92% in the second period, when cultures were held to 48 hours, the sensitivity declined significantly to 86%
