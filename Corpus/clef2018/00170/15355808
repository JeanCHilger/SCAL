Fast diagnostic tests in the management of group A beta-heamolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Routine clinical diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes in pharyngitis is not always easy. The use in common practice of rapid diagnosis test (RDT), might offer a best control of the antibiotic treatments. The aim of this study is to present seven rapid diagnosis tests, to assess their feasibility and finally to determine the bacteriological correlation.We propose to compare the results obtained with seven RDT, and to assess their interest in medical diagnosis for group A streptococcus pharyngitis. A prospective study was conducted for three months, a RDT was performed for children (n=75) between eight and fourteen years old presenting acute pharyngitis. Several throat sampling were performed to order cultures.The group A streptococcus was isolated in 33% (n=25) of throat sampling. Comparing cultures results, and for all studied tests, we obtained comparable performances with manufacturer data, specificity upper than 94% and sensitivity upper than 88%.All assessed RDT may offer to physicians a decision-making tool for rapid diagnosis. However, because of its complexity, the agglutination test can be used only in pathology laboratories.
