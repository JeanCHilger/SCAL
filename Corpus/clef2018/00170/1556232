Differentiation of species in human beta-haemolytic group G streptococci using immunoglobulin Fc fragment receptor. To assess the ability of human immunoglobulin Fc fragment binding activity to differentiate human biotype large colony group G streptococci from the group G "Streptococcus milleri group".Fifty two isolates of large colony group G streptococci and 30 group G "S milleri group" strains were tested for their ability to bind fluorescein conjugated human IgG Fc fragments after acetone fixation. Immunoblotting with peroxidase labelled human Fc fragments after resolution of bacterial polypeptides by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed for six large colony strains.All large colony group G streptococci showed positive Fc fragment binding whereas all "S milleri group" bacteria failed to bind Fc fragments when viewed by fluorescence microscopy. All six large colony strains showed similar immunoblot binding patterns.Immunoglobulin Fc fragment receptor content distinguishes the large colony group G streptococci from the group G "S milleri group" and mayhave a role in the rapid laboratory diagnosis of pharyngeal pathogens.
