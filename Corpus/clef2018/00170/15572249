Actions of the functional upstream domain of protein F1 of Streptococcus pyogenes on the conformation of fibronectin. Fibronectin (Fn), discovered by Harvard's Plasma Protein Program as plasma "cold-insoluble globulin" in the 1940s, has attracted much interest over the past three decades. One of the most interesting features of Fn is its ability to change shape in response to various environmental conditions and interactions with other substances found in the extra-cellular space. Here we examine the potential of the functional upstream domain (FUD) of Streptococcus pyogenes protein F1 to bring about changes in structure of Fn. In particular, we investigate the accessibility of Fn's 10th type III module that contains the integrin binding RGD motif. By use of monoclonal antibodies in a competitive ELISA assay, we found that FUD interacts with the amino-terminal type I modules of Fn to unveil the cell-binding region of Fn. This conformational change was achieved at sub-equimolar ratios of FUD/Fn monomer. We discuss the functional relevance of the interaction for both Fn and S. pyogenes and correlate the results with a conformational model of Fn that arose out of a collaboration between our laboratory and that of John Ferry.
