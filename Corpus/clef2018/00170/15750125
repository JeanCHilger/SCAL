Survey of emm-like gene sequences from pharyngeal isolates of group C and group G streptococci collected in Spain. We conducted a nationwide surveillance of the variable 5' emm-like (M-like protein gene) sequences from 214 pharyngeal group C and group G streptococci. Almost 75% of the isolates exhibited emm or emm-like sequences previously described. We identified six new 5' emm-like regions, and almost 23% of the isolates were nontypeable. Five emm-like sequences accounted for more than 50% of the isolates in group C and group G, suggesting horizontal gene transfer between strains of different species.
