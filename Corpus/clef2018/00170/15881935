Genotypic emm-typing of streptococcal cultures, group A, isolated from patients with different clinical manifestations of streptococcal infection in Moscow. The results of the intraspecific typing of group A streptococci (SGA), isolated from patients with different manifestations of group A streptococcal infection, carried out in Russia for the first time, are presented. The genotypic method of emm-typing, based on sequencing the DNA area coding the variable part of the molecule of SGA M-protein was used. The data obtained in this study made it possible to follow changes in the pattern of SGA M-types in Moscow and the specific features of SGA in comparison with the analogous data on other territories. New emm-types of SGA circulating on the territory of Russia were detected and described.
