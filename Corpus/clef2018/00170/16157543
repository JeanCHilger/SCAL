Association of group A streptococcal emm types with virulence traits and macrolide-resistance genes is independent of the source of isolation. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci GAS) recovered from paediatric pharyngitis (101 isolates) and asymptomatic children (79 isolates) in the same geographical area and period, as well as isolates collected during an enhanced national surveillance programme for GAS invasive diseases (79 isolates), were screened for the incidence of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe) genes speA and speC, as well as the macrolide-resistance genes erm(B), erm(A) subclass erm(TR) and mef(A), and typed by emm sequencing. The speA gene was detected with comparable incidence among throat isolates (13.9 % of asymptomatic children and 16.8 % of pharyngitis isolates) and in 25 % of invasive cases
