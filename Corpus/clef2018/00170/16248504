Investigate the early impairment of renal function caused by chronic tonsillitis. To investigate whether the chronic tonsillitis have early impairment of renal function or not.Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the urinary microalbumin of 77 samples of chronic tonsillitis (group A: course of diseases is 1 to 3 years group B: course of diseases is 3 to 5 years(1) group A: the urinary microalbumin is (9.8 +/- 1.6)mg/L group B: the urinary microalbumin is (12.3 2.2) mg/LThe urinary microalbumin of chronic tonsillitis was uptrend according to its course of diseases. The detection of the urinary microalbumin could be one of the diagnostic message for the early impairment of renal function which has been caused by chronic tonsillitis. The detection of the urinary microalbumin is important to evaluate the surgical treatment of chronic tonsillitis.
