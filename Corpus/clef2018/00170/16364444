Invasive group A streptococcal infection with pancarditis caused by a new emm-type 12 allele of Streptococcus pyogenes. Throughout the 1980s, a progressive increase in the incidence of Streptococcus pyogenes-related invasive infections has occurred. It has been suggested that a host-related immunogenetic background, as well as bacterial virulence factors may play an important role in the outcome of streptococcal infections. Here, we present the first case of pancarditis in the literature caused by direct bacterial invasion due to a new emm-type 12 allele of S. pyogenes in an immunocompetent patient. The pathogenesis of this invasive infection, as well as predictors of poor prognosis are discussed.
