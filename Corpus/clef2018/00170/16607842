The impact of a sore throat score on clinical management of streptococcal angina. To establish the validity and the role of a clinical sore throat score in clinical management of streptococcal angina on a first visit to a primary care provider.This study included 168 patients. The sore throat score had 5 criteria: age, fever, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar swelling or exudate. The score range is -1 to 5.Of the 168 patients, 53 (31.5%) had a positive culture result for beta hemolytic streptococci. Compared with throat culture a score = 3 has a sensitivity of 62.,26% (95%CI: 47.9%-75.2%), a specificity of 78.26% (95%CI: 69.6%-85.4%). Efficiency of this score is 73.21%.The clinical sore throat score may assist the primary care providers in estimating that a patient has streptococcal angina without replacing rapid antigenic testing or culture.
