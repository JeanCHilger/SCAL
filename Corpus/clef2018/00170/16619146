High diversity of group A streptococcal emm types among healthy schoolchildren in Ethiopia. Although the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in Ethiopia is one of the highest in the world, the epidemiology of group A streptococci (GAS) in this country is little known. GAS typing is a hallmark of both the epidemiology and understanding of diseases caused by these organisms. We have therefore conducted this study to investigate the emm (M-protein gene) type distribution of GAS carriers among Ethiopian schoolchildren.In the present study, we performed emm typing of 82 GAS isolates collected from the throats of healthy schoolchildren (6-14 years of age) residing in 3 different urban sites in Ethiopia: Addis Ababa, Gondar, and Dire Dawa.We report high diversity of GAS isolates recovered from healthy schoolchildren. Eighty-two isolates represented 43 different sequence types. Thirteen newly described subtypes were detected in this study. Of the emm types prevalent in the study communities, 46% were not included in the 26-valent GAS vaccine.The high diversity of emm types encountered within 3 months of collection suggest that production of a vaccine candidate based on the M-protein amino termini appears to be impractical for this population. We suggest that investigations of other vaccine candidates, including the C5a peptidase, GAS carbohydrate, and fibronectin-binding proteins, as well as conserved M-protein region vaccines, should be intensified to address the needs of this population.
