Clinical effect of ceftriaxone and cefditoren administration against oral and genital gonococcal infection. The clinical findings of genococcal infection (oral and genital) and the clinical effect of ceftiaxone (CTRX) and cefditoren (CDTR) administration were studied in Commercial Sex Workers (CSW). The gonococci were detected by DNA probe method (mouth), PCR method (genitals) and ELISA method (chlamydial antibody detection). 1) In the oral infection group (n = 20), chlamydial infection (65%), herpes infection (25%), and genital gonococcal infection (35%) were noted. Pharyngeal pain was observed in 9 out of 9 patients with tonsillitis and 4 out of 11 patients with pharyngitis. High fever and cervical lymphadenopathy were observed in 3 out of 9 patients with tonsillitis. 40% (8/20) of the partners had infections. Both CTRX administration (1 - 2 g/day x 3 days) (n = 11) and consecutive administration of CDTR (300 mg/day x 3 - 7 days) following CTRX administration (1 - 2 g/days x 1 - 3 days) (n = 9) were effective in all patients. 2) In the genital infection group (n = 35), chlamydial infection (65.7%), herpes infection (25.7%) and oral gonococcal infection (17.1%) were observed in 3 out of 6 patients with tonsillitis and 3 out of 6 patients with pharyngitis. The treatment was effective in all patients in the CTRX (1 - 2 g/day x 2 - 3 days) group (n = 14), CDTR (300 mg/day x 5 - 7 days) group (n = 5) and consecutive administration of CDTR (300 mg/day x 3 - 7 days) after CTRX (1 - 2 g/day x 1 - 3 days) and (n = 14). In pelvic peritonitis (n = 2), CTRX administration (2 - 4 g/day x 3 - 7 days) were effective.
