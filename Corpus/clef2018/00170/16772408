Streptococcus agalactiae Cbeta protein gene (bac) sequence types, based on the repeated region of the cell-wall-spanning domain: relationship to virulence and a proposed standardized nomenclature. The Cbeta protein (Bac) of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus GBS) is an IgA binding protein encoded by bac, of which at least 39 sequence types have been described, based on polymorphisms in the repeated region of the cell-wall-spanning domain ('bac sequence types'). Cbeta is usually found in serotype Ib, less commonly in serotype II, and rarely in other serotypes. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, variety and distribution, among GBS serotypes and between invasive and superficial isolates, of bac sequence types. A total of 1101 GBS isolates were tested, from 10 countries, with a bac-specific PCR, and amplicons from all 255 (23 %) with positive results were sequenced. Ninety-seven percent (184/190) of serotype Ib and 37 % of serotype II isolates were bac positive. The Calpha protein gene (bca) was present in 98 % (251/255), and insertion sequences IS1381 and IS861 in 94 % (239/255), of bac-positive isolates. The authors identified 59 bac sequence types belonging to 19 groups, based on length, from 496 to 946 bp, with up to six sequence variants (a-f) in each group. The median bac sequence length of invasive isolates was significantly shorter than that of superficial isolates overall (640 versus 586 bp
