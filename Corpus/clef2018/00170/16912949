Different preparations of intravenous immunoglobulin vary in their efficacy to neutralize streptococcal superantigens: implications for treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Eight different batches of intravenous immunoglobulin from 3 different manufacturers were tested for neutralizing activities against all currently known streptococcal superantigens. Statistically significant variation among different intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (P<.0001) and between individual streptococcal superantigens (P<.0001) was observed. These results might be helpful for optimizing the type and dose of intravenous immunoglobulin used in adjunctive therapy for severe invasive streptococcal disease.
