Ribosomal therapy in the prophylaxis of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis in children. Although much has been written on how to manage recurrent pharyngotonsillitis, it remains a controversial topic. The composition of normal commensal oropharynx bacteria may be disrupted by frequently using antimicrobials, by inhibiting sensitive organisms and by allowing resistant organisms to overgrowth. This may cause the recurrence of acute episodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ribosomal immunotherapy in the prophylaxis of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis.A total of 160 children aged between 5 and 14 years with recurrent pharyngotonsillitis were ramdomized to receive either ribosomal immunotherapy (group A one tablet a day, 8 days a month for 3 months) or a placebo (group B same dosage for the same period).At the end of the study, each patient treated with Immucytal presented a subjective decrease of symptoms. Compared with group B, group A experienced a significant improvement of some clinical parameters.The results show that ribosomal immunotherapy causes a significant improvement of both specific and non-specific immunity and may be effective in the prophylaxis of recurrent pharyngotonsillitis and in preventing recurrences without entailing side effects or bacterial resistance.
