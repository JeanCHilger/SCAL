Streptococcal DRS (distantly related to SIC) and SIC inhibit antimicrobial peptides, components of mucosal innate immunity: a comparison of their activities. "Streptococcal inhibitor of complement" (SIC) and "distantly related to SIC" (DRS) are related virulence factors secreted by M1 and M12 strains of GAS, respectively. The human mucosal innate immune system, important components of which are beta-defensins, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) and lysozyme, provides the first line of defence against microorganisms. We report the interaction between DRS and these proteins further investigations into the interaction of SIC with the beta-defensins
