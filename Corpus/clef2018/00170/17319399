Diagnosis and management of pharyngitis. Although most pharyngitis are caused by viruses, up to 75% of patients visiting for a sore throat receive an antibiotic. As the performance of clinical features is poor a throat swab may help to differentiate a pharyngitis caused by a Group A beta3-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) from other causes. A recent study tested and validated a new strategy combining a rapid test detecting GABHS and a clinical score with 2 or more of the four criteria (fever more than 38 degrees, tender cervical nodes, no cough and tonsillar exsudate). This strategy is cost-effective and limits antibiotic prescription to patients with GABHS. If the score is below two, a symptomatic treatment without antibiotic is recommended.
