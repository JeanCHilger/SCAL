Immunoassay-based diagnostic point-of-care technology for oral specimen. We have outlined our progress in developing a novel point-of-care platform to quantify micro-organisms causing dental infections and/or inflammatory markers reflecting an oral disease status. This system is based on a sandwich immunoassay technology known as ABICAP (Antibody Immuno Column for Analytical Processes) using poly-horseradish peroxidase conjugates. This assay enabled us to quantify 500 colony-forming units of Streptococcus sobrinus per milliliter of saliva. The platform allows rapid and convenient performance chairside of such tests by a dentist or dental hygienist within 20 minutes at the dental office.
