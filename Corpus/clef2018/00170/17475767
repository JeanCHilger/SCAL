Age-specific salivary immunoglobulin A response to Streptococcus mutans GbpB. In a follow-up study of children infected with Streptococcus mutans at an early age (children previously shown to respond poorly to S. mutans GbpB), there was a delay in their immune response, rather than a complete inability to respond to this antigen. Epitopes in the N-terminal third of GbpB were identified as targets for naturally induced immunoglobulin A antibody in children at an early age.
