Etiology of a nephrotic form of primary chronic glomerulonephritis in children. As many as 91 children with the nephrotic and hematuric forms of primary chronic glomerulonephritis were examined for the presence of streptococcal infection and allergic diseases. It has been shown that as compared to patients with the hematuric form of chronic glomerulonephritis, those with the nephrotic form manifest a higher occurrence of A3, a dramatic rise of serum IgE and its dependence on the activity of glomerulonephritis. The data obtained may attest to the etiological role played by allergy in the development of the nephrotic form of glomerulonephritis. Frequently occurring colonization of hemolytic streptococcus in the fauces and the rise of the ASL-O titer in the blood serum seen in patients with the hematuric form of glomerulonephritis, its dependence on the disease activity suggest the streptococcal etiology in patients with that form in contrast to those with the nephrotic form.
