Vertebral osteomyelitis in a healthy young adult. A 39-year-old African American man with no significant past medical history presented to our hospital with right hand weakness and pain in both arms. He had no fever, neck pain, headache, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness in his lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine showed extensive abnormal enhancement of the C7-T1 vertebral bodies as well as the prevertebral and epidural spaces. Open biopsy of the lesion showed inflammatory changes consistent with osteomyelitis. Culture of the biopsy specimen grew Group B Streptococcus (GBS). HIV ELISA and blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin for 6 weeks with complete resolution of symptoms. GBS classically affects newborns and pregnant females. However, the incidence of infection from this pathogen in nonpregnant adults is increasing. Vertebral osteomyelitis due to GBS in nonpregnant adults is exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of GBS cervical vertebral osteomyelitis in an adult without risk factors for invasive GBS infection. This case illustrates that GBS should be included in the differential diagnosis of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, irrespective of immune status and predisposing factors.
