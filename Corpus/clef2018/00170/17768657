Characterization of group a streptococcal M23 protein and comparison of the M3 and M23 protein's ligand-binding domains. The present study concerns the properties for binding of human plasma and extracellular matrix proteins and the relationship between M3 and M23 molecules. Here, it is demonstrated that M23 protein shows a multiple binding to fibrinogen (FG), fibronectin (FN), human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), kininogen, and collagen type I (CI) in Western blot analysis. Some sets of truncated-recombinant M3 or M23 protein fragments were assayed for their capacity to bind FN, FG, IgG, HSA, and CI. The HSA binding activity resided in the C-repeat region of M3 protein, whereas fibrinogen-binding activity resided in the A-repeat region. The FG, FN, and IgG binding sites were mapped to the N-terminal portion of M23 protein, whereas HSA binding was localized in the B-repeat domain, which has homology with C-repeat domain in M3 molecule. Therefore, it is concluded that the FN, FG, and IgG binding regions in the M3 and M23 proteins are quite dissimilar at the amino acid sequence level, whereas HSA binding is localized to the conserved C-repeat domain in the M3 and M23 proteins.
