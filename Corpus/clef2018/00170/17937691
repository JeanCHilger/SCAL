C-reactive protein in the periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome. To evaluate levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) during febrile episodes in children with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis syndrome (PFAPA).All CRP values during typical episodes of fever in children diagnosed with PFAPA during a 3 years period were retrospectively registered.In 16 children with PFAPA, a total of 87 CRP values were registered during 38 episodes of fever. The mean of the maximum CRP during each episode was 185 mg/L (SD: 69.4, range: 45-322). Values of CRP were elevated throughout the whole period of fever, with higher values on days 2-4 compared to day 1.Levels of CRP are substantially increased during febrile episodes in children with PFAPA. High levels of CRP may suggest a role for immunological mechanisms in PFAPA, and may raise the suspicion of PFAPA when measured in children with periodic fever of unknown origin.
