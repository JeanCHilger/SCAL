Selective isolation of bacterial DNA from human clinical specimens. We evaluated two DNA preparation strategies (MolYsis, Molzym GmbH & Co. KG, Bremen, Germany) and Pureprove, SIRS-Lab GmbH, Jena, Germany) to selectively extract bacterial DNA from human clinical samples. By testing 16 oral samples we found that human DNA could be largely eliminated while detectable levels of bacterial DNA were obtained with all samples. Both approaches hold great potential for microbial diagnostic systems.
