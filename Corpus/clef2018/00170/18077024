Evaluation of the NucliSens miniMAG RNA extraction and real-time NASBA applications for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in throat swabs. Nucleic acids were extracted from 215 throat swabs from patients with community-acquired pneumonia by the manual Boom extraction, the NucliSens miniMAG and the Qiagen DNA blood kit and amplified respectively by in-house real-time NASBA, NucliSens EasyQ reagents, and real-time PCR for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Five out of 215 throat swabs were found to be C. pneumoniae positive by all techniques used. A total of 11 out of 215 throat swabs were positive for M. pneumoniae 10/215 by Qiagen extraction and PCR amplification and 9/215 by NucliSens miniMAG and NucliSens EasyQ amplification. The NucliSens miniMAG and NucliSens EasyQ applications were successfully coupled to detect both organisms in throat swabs.
