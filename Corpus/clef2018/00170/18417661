Sequence type and emm type diversity in Streptococcus pyogenes isolates causing invasive disease in Norway between 1988 and 2003. The incidence of invasive group A streptococcal disease has increased in Norway since the 1980s. Analysis of 100 isolates recovered from 1988 to 2003 showed an increased genotypic diversity over time, while the prevalence of the strain that dominated in 1988, sequence type (ST)-28/emm-1, decreased. Necrotizing fasciitis was often associated with ST-15/emm-3.
