The role of adrenomedullin and brain natriuretic peptide levels in acute rheumatic fever in adults. Rheumatic fever, a multisystem disease following infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, is common among young (5-15 years) but can occur in adults as well. Recently, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been validated as a marker of cardiac function and prognosis. Plasma adrenomedullin (ADM) levels are elevated in various pathological states including cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. We aim to assess the relationship between ADM and BNP levels in adult patients with acute and convalescent rheumatic fever (ARF).This case -controlled prospective study included 45 patients with ARF (mean age 21.04+/-1.91 years) and 30 age/gender-matched control subjects. Brain natriuretic peptide and adrenomedullin levels were studied in the acute and convalescent phase of ARF. Adrenomedullin was detected by enzyme immunoassay kit of peptides, while brain natriuretic peptide was measured by a commercially available instrument. The study was carried out between May 2006 and October 2006 in Atat√ºrk University Medical Faculty Hospital. Statistical analysis was performed using Shapiro-Wilk, Mann Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed rank, Chi-square tests and Pearson correlation analysis.Plasma ADM and plasma BNP levels were significantly higher (p<0.05) in adults with ARF, regardless of whether they were in acute or convalescent phase of disease. Plasma ADM levels were 74.43+/-3.4 pmol/mL in acute phases, 59.35+/-1.45 pmol/mL in the convalescent phase, and 44.79+/-13.12 pmol/mL in control group. Plasma BNP levels were 197.51+/-47.41 pg/mL in the acute phase, 145.25+/-51.25 pg/mL in the convalescent phase, and 33.45+/-10.42 pg/mL in control group. The differences were statistically significant for all (p<0.05). Plasma ADM and BNP levels in the acute phase of disease showed significant negative correlation with the left ventricular ejection fraction (r=-0.56, p<0.05 and r=-0.61, p<0.05, respectively).In patients with acute and convalescent rheumatic fever, BNP and ADM levels were high compared to those of healthy subjects and this could be used as a complementary tool in the treatment and prognosis of ARF.
