Use of POCT (point of care tests) in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. POCT have a great potential in ambulatory infectious diseases diagnosis, due to their impact on antibiotic administration and on communicable diseases prevention. Some are in use for long (S. pyogenes antigen, HIV antibodies) or short time (S. pneumoniae antigen, P. falciparum). The additional major indications will be community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections, infectious diarrhoea in children (rotavirus, enterotoxigenic E. coli), and hopefully sexually transmitted infections. Easy to use, these tests based on antigen-antibody reaction allow a rapid diagnosis in less than one hour the new generation of POCT relying on nucleic acid detection are just introduced in practice (detection of GBS in pregnant women, carriage of MRSA), and will be extended to many pathogens.
