Does Helicobacter pylori play a role in the development of chronic adenotonsillitis? Evaluation of the possible relationship between chronic adenotonsillitis and Helicobacter pylori (HP).The study was performed prospectively on 91 pediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy due to chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoiditis. The adenotonsillectomy specimens were examined for HP colonization by rapid urease test (RUT) and immunohistochemical evaluation. Before surgery, anti-HP IgG and IgA antibody titers were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test in venous blood samples of the patients.The RUT was positive in only two of the adenoidectomy specimens (2.2%) and in none of the tonsillectomy specimens. A positive result was not detected in any tonsillectomy specimens using immunohistochemical examination. Serum IgG antibody was positive in 21 (23%) patients, IgA antibody was detected in 7 (7.69%) patients and both tests were positive only in 3 (3.29%) patients.The results of this study suggested that HP would not colonize in tonsil tissue of patients with chronic tonsillitis.
