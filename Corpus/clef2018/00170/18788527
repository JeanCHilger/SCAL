Immunoproteomic assay of secretive proteins from Streptococcus suis type 2 strain SC84. To identify antigenic proteins secreted by Streptococcus suis (S. suis) type 2 strain SC84.Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), western-blot assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis were performed to search and identify antigenic proteins secreted by S. suis strain SC84, which triggered an outbreak of the disease in Sichuan province,China, in 2005.A total number of 14 western blot spots were found on PVDF membrane. 11 spots which could be found the existence of matching protein on coomassie G-250-stained 2-DE gel were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The 11 proteins, all located at extra-cellular or cell wall, were classified into 8 kinds of proteins. Among of them, muramidase-released protein (MRP), suilysin (Sly) and extra-cellular factor (EF) were the known antigenic proteins, but several proteins such as putative 5'-nucleotidase, ribo-nucleases G and E, and predicted metal-loendo-peptidase were newly found antigenic proteins. All the identified protein were found to have had the coding gene in genomic of S. suis strain 05ZYH33, isolated from patients in Sichuan province, China in 2005.The newly found proteins could be used as voluntary antigens for detection and vaccination of S. suis.
