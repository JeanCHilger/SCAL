Cefaclor versus penicillin V in staphylococcal infections in children. Although rheumatic fever virtually no longer occurs in France, pharyngitis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (ABHS) remains a common pediatric problem. American studies have underscored the high rate of bacteriologic treatment failures and recurrences of ABHS pharyngitis. Furthermore, several comparative studies have demonstrated that cephalosporins provide better results on these two parameters. This prospective randomized study compared the effectiveness of penicillin V (50,000 to 100,000 IU/kg/day in three divided doses) and Cefaclor (20 to 40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses), each given for ten consecutive days. From September 1989 through October 1990, 117 children (mean age 5.7 years) were entered into the study. All study subjects were seen as outpatients and found to have ABHS pharyngitis on the basis of a rapid screening test and confirmatory bacteriologic studies. Cefaclor was given to 56 patients and penicillin V to 61. Reevaluation with a repeat bacteriologic study was performed in all patients at the end of the treatment period, or earlier in the event of new clinical manifestations, and towards D40. Among patients given penicillin V, bacteriologic failure rate at completion of therapy was 19.6%, clinical failure rate on D10 was 8%, and recurrence rate on D40 was 16.5%. Cefaclor exhibited greater bacteriologic and clinical effectiveness, with 3.4% bacteriologic failures on D10 (p less than 0.01), 1.7% clinical failures on D10, 8.9% clinical recurrences between D10 and D40, and an overall 10.6% rate of failure or recurrence (p = 0.05).
