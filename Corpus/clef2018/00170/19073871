Rapid emergence of emm84 among invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections in Finland. From 2005 to 2007, in Finland, the incidence of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes disease increased sharply, partly due to the uncommon emm84 gene becoming more prevalent from 2006 onwards. The overall case fatality rate of infections caused by strains carrying emm84 was not significantly different than that of infections caused by other types (7% versus 10%, respectively P = 0.50).
