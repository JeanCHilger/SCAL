Detection of Helicobacter pylori in adenotonsiller tissue specimens by rapid urease test and polymerase chain reaction. In recent studies, there have been many arguments concerning Helicobacter pylori being reservoir in adenotonsillar tissue. In this study, our objective was to detect whether adenoid and/or tonsillar tissue of patients diagnosed with chronic adenotonsillitis was a reservoir for H. pylori. This study was performed with 47 patients with the diagnosis of chronic tonsillitits and adenoid hypertrophy. Helicobacter pylori was searched by rapid urease test (RUT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence of H. pylori glmM gene (formerly named as ureC gene) was tested using ureC and ureC2 primers. Fifty-five specimens used in the study were made up of 35 adenoid and 20 tonsil tissues. Rapid urease test was positive in three (5.5%) specimens. Helicobacter pylori was not detected in any of the patients by PCR. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible role of H. pylori in upper aerodigestive tract diseases such adenotonsillitis.
