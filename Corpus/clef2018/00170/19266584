A mixed cell culture model for assessment of proliferation in tonsillar tissues from children with obstructive sleep apnea or recurrent tonsillitis. Recurrent infective tonsillitis (RI) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are the major indications for adenotonsillectomy (T&A) in children. However, little is known on the determinants of lymphadenoid tissue proliferation in the pediatric upper airway.To develop an in vitro culture system allowing for assessment of tonsillar or adenoidal proliferation under basal or stimulated conditions.Tonsils surgically removed from pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent tonsillitis during T&A, were dissociated using standard methods. Whole cell tonsillar cultures were either maintained in normal medium or stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (25 microg/mL) and concanavalin A (10 microg/mL) for 24 hours (stimulated conditions [STIM]). Cellular proliferation was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In parallel, supernatants were collected after 48 hours, and concentration of cytokines was measured using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures.Basal proliferative rates were increased in the OSA group (305.2 +/- 40.6 cpm n = 31) compared to RI group (232.8 +/- 31.9 cpmThe proliferative rates and concentrations of inflammatory mediators in tonsillar cell cultures from children with OSA and RI suggest that lymphadenoid tissue proliferation in these two conditions may be regulated by different mechanisms. This novel method may allow for future development of specific therapeutic interventions aimed at curtailing and reversing tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy in children in a disease-specific manner.
