Rapid screen for epithelial internalization of Tn917-mutagenized Streptococcus pyogenes. Group A streptococci (GAS) cause a number of human diseases ranging from pharyngitis to necrotizing fasciitis. GAS are hypothesized to escape killing by either the immune system or beta lactam antibiotics by internalization into epithelial cells. A Tn917 library of transposon mutants was screened for capacity to invade and survive in human epithelial cells using a novel blood agar overlay method. Although the screen revealed that a majority of Tn917 insertions occurred within a 10 kb region of the genome, GAS genes identified as essential for internalization into epithelial cells included ABC transporters, and DNA maintenance proteins, and citrate metabolism enzymes, underlining the importance of adaptation to the intracellular environment.
