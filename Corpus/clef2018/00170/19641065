Comparative evaluation of the AccuProbe Group B Streptococcus Culture Test, the BD GeneOhm Strep B assay, and culture for detection of group B streptococci in pregnant women. We compared a rigorous culture method with the Gen-Probe AccuProbe Group B Streptococcus Culture Test (APGB) and the BD GeneOhm StrepB assay (GOSB) for the detection of group B streptococci (GBS) from an 18- to 24-h LIM broth. Culture (95.3%) and GOSB (95.3%) were more sensitive than APGB (86.5%) for the detection of GBS.
