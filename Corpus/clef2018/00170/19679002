Ribosome-component immune modulation of respiratory tract infections in children. More than 25% of infants in their first year of life and 18% of children aged between 1 and 4 years suffer from recurrent respiratory infections (RRIs) in Western countries. Although RRIs are self-limiting as a rule, complications may include otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchial and pulmonary infections. This study was designed to present the available data on immune modulators (defined as drugs that interact with the immune system and modulate immune function by stimulating a more rapid and effective immune response). A ribosome-component immune modulator (RCIM) designed to stimulate both specific and nonspecific immunity in children and thus prevent or alleviate RRI is also described. A narrative review of the literature was performed with a focus on clinical trials. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that an RCIM effectively prevents recurrent bronchopulmonary and ear-nose-throat infections in particular, the number, severity, and duration of infectious episodes and the numbers of antibiotic courses, concomitant medications, and days away from school (children) or the workplace (parents) were reduced. Use of a RCIM is clinically efficacious, incurs minimal risk of adverse events, and, thus, represents a consistent therapeutic approach for RRIs.
