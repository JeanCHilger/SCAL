Acute HIV-1 infection: clinical and biological study of 12 patients. We observed 12 patients with acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The clinical syndrome was characterized by fever (all cases), generalized lymphadenopathy (11), arthralgias and myalgias (9), sore throat (9), rash (7), splenomegaly (6), and other less frequent signs and symptoms. All patients had a spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within 5-30 days. Anti-HIV-1 serum antibodies, as measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) at the onset of clinical illness, were negative in every patient. HIV antigen (p24), on the contrary, was detectable in nine cases. Western blot IgM and IgG analysis was serially performed: IgMs were positive in nine cases and IgGs in three. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was low in all patients because CD8+ were remarkably increased and CD4+ slightly reduced. A laterocervical lymph nodes biopsy was performed in four patients. The morphological and immunohistological pattern of the acute HIV-1-related lymphadenopathy did not correspond to any of the typical ones. The envelope virus protein gp120/160 was found in interfollicular and follicular lymphocytes, in endothelial cells, and in interdigitating and dendritic reticulum cells. The p17 and p24 core virus proteins were mainly detected in endothelial, interdigitating, and dendritic reticulum cells, but in only a few lymphocytes. The follow-up suggests a rapid evolution to ARC and AIDS in patients showing an acute symptomatic HIV infection.
