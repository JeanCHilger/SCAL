Differences among group A streptococcus epidemiological landscapes: consequences for M protein-based vaccines? Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a bacterial pathogen responsible for a wide array of disease pathologies in humans. GAS surface M protein plays multiple key roles in pathogenesis, and serves as a target for typing and vaccine development. In this review, we have compiled GAS epidemiological studies from several countries around the world to highlight the consequences on the theoretical efficacy of two different M protein-based vaccine strategies.
