Distribution of fibronectin-binding protein genes (prtF1 and prtF2) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes (spe) among Streptococcus pyogenes in Japan. Two hundred and seventy-two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections in Japan were evaluated for the prevalence of fibronectin-binding protein genes (prtF1 and prtF2). The possible associations of the genes with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes, macrolide resistance genes, and emm types were also evaluated. Overall, about 50% of S. pyogenes isolates carried fibronectin-binding protein genes. The prevalence of the prtF1 gene was significantly higher among isolates from noninvasive infections (71.4%) than among isolates from invasive infections (30.8% P = 0.0037). Strains possessing both the prtF1 and prtF2 genes were more likely to be isolates from noninvasive infections than isolates from invasive infections (50.6% vs 15.4%
