Group A streptococcal pharyngitis and immune-mediated complications: from diagnosis to management. Group A streptococcal pharyngitis remains the most important bacterial pharyngitis because of its frequency and potential complications. Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is most common in children 5-11 years of age in winter-spring, and a rapid test or culture is necessary for accurate diagnosis. We propose a management strategy for those geographic areas with very low acute rheumatic fever rates, emphasizing selective testing that avoids testing those patients with viral-like features (e.g., rhinorrhea and cough). Acute rheumatic fever is the most important immune-mediated sequela and has become rare in most areas of the USA and Western Europe, most probably due to decreased circulation of highly rheumatogenic group A streptococcal strains.
