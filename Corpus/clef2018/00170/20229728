Performances of rapid antigen detection kits for group A Streptococcus. The group A streptococcus rapid antigen detection kits used to test throat swabs are frequently used by doctors for the screening of pharyngitis caused by bacteria. The Swiss Centre for Quality Control (CSCQ) has organised External Quality Assessment Schemes (EQAS) for these kits since 1997. From 2004 to 2008, negative, positive, and moderate positive antigen containing samples were sent to the laboratories. After analysing the samples, 7749 results obtained with more than 14 different test kits were returned to the CSCQ. The correct results ranged between 84.8 and 99.8% which shows that all the test kits gave good results during the EQAS. However, in case of a negative result with clinical suspicion of a bacterial pharyngitis, the result is to be confirmed by culture.
