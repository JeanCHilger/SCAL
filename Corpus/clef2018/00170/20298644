Techniques for early diagnosis and management of cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis. Cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis carries high rates of morbidity and mortality, and is not often initially suspected due to its rarity and misleadingly innocuous presentation. We propose an algorithm for the timely diagnosis and management of cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis.Retrospective review of seven patients ultimately diagnosed with cervicofacial necrotising fasciitis.In these seven patients, common presenting symptoms included sore throat, fever and neck pain. On initial examination and imaging, only three had obvious findings. One patient's diagnosis was facilitated via a bedside cut-down procedure. Six patients underwent surgical debridement. Four required tracheotomy, and five wounds closed via secondary intention. There were two deaths.The severity of cervical necrotising fasciitis and its rapid spread necessitate early diagnosis and timely surgical management. The presentation often appears benign. A high index of clinical suspicion should be maintained in cases of neck cellulitis with nonspecific clinical findings, especially in diabetic or otherwise immunocompromised patients. A normal computed tomography scan does not rule out necrotising fasciitis. A cut-down procedure may be critical to early diagnosis in some cases.
