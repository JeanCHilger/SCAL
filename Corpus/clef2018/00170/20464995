Mechanism of development of epidemic process of group A streptococcal infection in children collectives. To study the characteristics of group A streptococcal infection epidemic process in children aged 12 - 14 years arrived to summer camp "Orlenok" (Tuapse) from different regions of Russia.Epidemiological (retrospective analysis of incidence of acute respiratory infections, tonsillitis, and scarlet fever), microbiological (isolation and identification of group A streptococci [GAS]), and molecular biological (pulse-electrophoresis, analysis of spe and emm genes) methods were used for the study. Objects of the study were GAS strains isolated from patients and carriers.Performed genotyping showed that cases of GAS infection in newly formed children collectives were caused by 2 - 3 epidemically important clones, which were genotypically heterogenous.Performed molecular biologic studies demonstrated polyclonal structure of GAS that determines the features of development of epidemic process.
