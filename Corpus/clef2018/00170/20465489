Clinical, microbiological and molecular characteristics of six cases of group A streptococcal meningitis in western Norway. Meningitis is a rare clinical manifestation of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease. Clinical, microbiological and molecular characteristics of 6 consecutive cases of GAS meningitis treated in Haukeland University Hospital in the period 2004-2009 are described. All 6 patients had a primary upper respiratory tract infection, with subsequent mastoiditis in 5, subdural effusions in 2, and cerebral abscess in 1. Five patients needed surgical treatment (myringotomy, craniotomy or mastoidectomy). All patients were treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic in combination with rifampicin. The course was complicated in all cases, and 1 patient died. Three of the bacterial isolates were of the sequence type emm1.0 and they shared the same superantigen gene profile (speA, speG, speJ, smeZ). The remaining 3 isolates belonged to sequence types emm 3.1, emm6.4 and emm12.0. Deletions in emm genes were observed. This report describes the severe and complicated course of GAS meningitis and its management, often requiring surgical intervention.
