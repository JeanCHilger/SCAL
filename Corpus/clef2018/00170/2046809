Age influence on mononuclear phagocyte system Fc-receptor function in poststreptococcal nephritis. The Fc-receptor function of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) was examined in 41 children and adult patients, by measuring the clearance of IgG-sensitized, 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes. The Fc-receptor-mediated clearance observed in patients (mean +/- SE) was not significantly different as compared to the control group of similar age distribution. However, the immune clearance time was significantly age-correlated in both groups (acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, APSGN, r = 0.39, p less than 0.05 control r = 0.63, p less than 0.01). The magnitude of the Fc-specific immune clearance and the serum creatinine were also significantly correlated (r = 0.59
