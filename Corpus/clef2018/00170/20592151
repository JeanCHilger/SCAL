Axillary abscess complicated by venous thrombosis: identification of Streptococcus pyogenes by 16S PCR. We report a case of an axillary abscess with Streptococcus pyogenes complicated by venous thrombosis. Bacterial etiology and typing were obtained by PCR and sequencing of the 16S rRNA and M-protein genes from abscess material. The bacterium was of serotype M41, and serology indicated that it had expressed procoagulant factors.
