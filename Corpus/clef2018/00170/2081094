Differential signal requirements in T-cell activation by mitogen and superantigen. The requirement for co-stimulatory molecules in T-cell stimulation by mitogens and superantigens in the absence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) was investigated. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression on purified T-cells, but proliferation occurred only when exogenous IL-2 was added. In contrast, the proliferative response to a pepsin-extracted type 5 M-protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (pep M5), a recently identified superantigen, required signals provided by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), IL-1 and IL-6. pep M5 alone did not induce IL-2R expression however, when combined with PMA, IL-1 and IL-6, IL-2R was expressed. Differences were also observed in the response of the leukemic T-cell line, Jurkat, to PHA and pep M5. Soluble PHA, but not pep M5, induced IL-2 production by these cells in the presence of PMA. Cross-linking by its specific antibody or adsorption of pep M5 to microtiter plates was required to activate Jurkat cells. Both PHA and pep M5 induced Ca2+ mobilization in Jurkat cells
