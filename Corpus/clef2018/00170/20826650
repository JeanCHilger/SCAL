Multicenter evaluation of the BD Max GBS assay for detection of group B streptococci in prenatal vaginal and rectal screening swab specimens from pregnant women. A new integrated extraction and real-time PCR-based system for the detection of group B streptococci in antepartum screening samples enriched in Lim broth was compared to the CDC-recommended culture method. The BD Max GBS assay exhibited acceptable sensitivity (95%) and specificity (96.7%) compared to those of the culture method in this multisite evaluation.
