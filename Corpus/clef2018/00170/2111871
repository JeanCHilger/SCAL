Serogrouping of oral Streptococcus intermedius. Employing twenty fresh oral isolates of Streptococcus intermedius, studies were carried out to characterize serological relations among the isolates and also between the isolates and the strains of bacterial species closely related to S. intermedius. The Rantz-Randall extracts from the cells were used as antigens. The anti-rabbit serum raised against S. intermedius ATCC 27335T reacted with the cell extracts from only three strains of the isolates, which were designated serogroup I strains. The other isolates were classified into four serogroups, I, III, IV, and V, which specifically reacted with the cell extracts from the homologous serogroup strains. However, the serogroup II antiserum formed in immunodiffusion a common precipitin line between the extracts from the cells of serogroups II and I. The serogroups I, III, IV, and V antisera reacted with none of the extracts from the bacterial cells closely related to S. intermedius, which included Streptococcus anginosus ATCC 33397T, Streptococcus constellatus ATCC 27823T, three NCTC strains of "Streptococcus milleri," and three ATCC strains of Streptococcus MG. The precipitin line formed by the homologous reaction of the serogroup II antiserum was found to be a reaction of identity with that formed by the extract from "S. milleri" NCTC 10708. Conversely, the antiserum against NCTC 10708 strain did not react with the cell extracts of serogroup II.
