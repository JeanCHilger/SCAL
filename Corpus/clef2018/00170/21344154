Streptococcus pyogenes emm types and subtypes of isolates from paediatric asymptomatic carriers and children with pharyngitis. This study determined emm subtypes of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from asymptomatic carriers and children with pharyngitis. All strains were previously investigated for fibronectin-binding genes (prtF1 and prtF2) and antimicrobial susceptibility. The most significant differences between the two groups, which share only 5 of the 14 detected emmsubtypes, concern the presence of the two more common emmsubtypes, 12.0 (50.0% vs. 3.1%, for asymptomatic carriers and children with pharyngitis, respectively) and 1.0 (28.1% vs. 0%, for children with pharyngitis and asymptomatic carriers, respectively).
