Clinical performance of three rapid diagnostic tests for influenza virus in nasopharyngeal specimens to detect novel swine-origin influenza viruses. Influenza is an important public health problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of three rapid diagnostic tests (SEKISUI, QuickVue Influenza A + B, and SD BIOLINE) for novel swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIV) and seasonal influenza.A total of 210 nasopharyngeal swabs from unique clinical specimens were previously tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and tested again in this study.Of these, 164 (78%) were influenza A-positive and 46 (22%) were influenza A-negative by RT-PCR. From 115 positive swabs, 80 (69.6%), 66 (57.4%), and 46 (40.0%) showed S-OIV by SEKISUI, QuickVue Influenza A + B, and SD BIOLINE, respectively. Specific positive and negative predictive values of these three commercial rapid tests were all 100%. Therefore, positive rapid influenza virus diagnosis does not require an RT-PCR confirmatory test. Conversely, only negative rapid influenza virus diagnosis should be evaluated. The SEKISUI test would be a useful diagnostic tool for screening clinical samples for influenza. Concerning the various specimen types, among 25 patients with RT-PCR-proven S-OIV infection, influenza was identified in sputum (21/25 84.0%) and nasopharyngeal swab (15/25
