An Infection Control Program for a 2009 influenza A H1N1 outbreak in a university-based summer camp. Describe two 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreaks in university-based summer camps and the implementation of an infection control program.7,906 campers across 73 residential camps from May 21-August 2, 2009.Influenza-like-illness (ILI) was defined as fever with cough and/or sore throat. Influenza A was identified using PCR or rapid-antigen testing. We implemented an infection control program consisting of education, hand hygiene, disinfection, symptom screening, and ILI case management.An initial ILI cluster involved 60 cases across 3 camps from June 17-July 2. Academic Camp-1 had the most cases (n = 45, 14.9% attack rate) influenza A was identified in 84% of those tested. Despite implementation of an infection control program, a second ILI cluster began on July 12 in Academic Camp-2 (n = 47, 15.0% attack rate).ILI can spread rapidly in a university-based residential camp. Infection control is an important aspect of the medical response but is challenging to implement.
