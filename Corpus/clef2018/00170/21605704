Transmission probabilities and durations of immunity for three pathogenic group B Streptococcus serotypes. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains a major cause of neonatal sepsis and is an emerging cause of invasive bacterial infections. The 9 known serotypes vary in virulence, and there is little cross-immunity. Key parameters for planning an effective vaccination strategy, such as average length of immunity and transmission probabilities by serotype, are unknown. We simulated GBS spread in a population using a computational model with parameters derived from studies of GBS sexual transmission in a college dormitory. Here we provide estimates of the duration of immunity relative to the transmission probabilities for the 3 GBS serotypes most associated with invasive disease: Ia, III, and V. We also place upper limits on the durations of immunity for serotype Ia (570 days), III (1125 days) and V (260 days). Better transmission estimates are required to establish the epidemiological parameters of GBS infection and determine the best vaccination strategies to prevent GBS disease.
