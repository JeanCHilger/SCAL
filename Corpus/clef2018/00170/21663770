Rapid detection of "highly virulent" Group B Streptococcus ST-17 and emerging ST-1 clones by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF MS identified a 6250-Da protein specific to Sequence Type-1 (ST-1) strains and a 7625-Da protein specific to ST-17 strains when used for identification of Group B streptococci. The strains of these STs are major causes of meningitis and late-onset-disease in neonates. This rapid method of identification could thus be valuable in the evaluation of risk of neonatal diseases.
