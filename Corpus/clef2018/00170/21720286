Dynamics of immunological characteristics and investigation of apoptosis of palatal tonsillar lymphocytes in patients presenting with chronic tonsillitis and treated by conservative therapy. The enhanced amount of viable lymphocytes and the decreased number of apoptotic cells as well as the reduced levels of IgA and IgM and the elevated concentration of sIgA in lacunar secretion are considered to be the reliable criteria for the efficacy of the conservative treatment of chronic tonsillitis. Combined therapy of this condition including irrigation of the palatal tonsillar lacunae with a miramistin solution, their contact ultrasonic treatment, and application of imudon makes it possible to maintain the optimal ratio of viable to apoptotic lymphocytes during a period of up to 6-7 months.
