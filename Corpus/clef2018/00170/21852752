The M protein of group A Streptococcus is a key virulence factor and a clinically relevant strain identification marker. The M protein coats group A streptococci (GAS) and acts as the primary antigen and determinant of type-specific immunity. M is essential for GAS virulence, providing antiphagocytic functions critical to survival in human tissues and fluids. Specific regions of M protein also serve as shared antigens, and cross-reactivity between these epitopes and human proteins may be the source of autoimmune sequelae such as rheumatic heart disease. The M protein is hypervariable, and has long served as the primary target for epidemiological typing of GAS. Though other markers or genotyping methods may be necessary to increase strain resolution when clones of a given M type differ in clinically critical ways, M typing remains the most directly informative and well-documented method for tracking outbreaks of GAS, predicting clinical outcomes during those outbreaks, and measuring the general threat presented by GAS at any given time and place.
