Real-time qualitative PCR for 57 human adenovirus types from multiple specimen sources. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are ubiquitous double-stranded DNA viruses that cause a wide array of diseases in humans including pharyngitis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and keratoconjunctivitis. They also cause life-threatening opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals and are responsible for outbreaks in certain populations. Diagnosis is traditionally by cell culture or antigen detection methods. However, some HAdVs can take up to 4 weeks to isolate, and diarrheagenic types 40 and 41 will not grow in routine cell culture. Therefore, the goal of this study was to design a rapid, real-time PCR assay to detect all known 57 HAdV types from multiple different specimen sources. Primers and fluorescence resonance energy transfer hybridization probes were designed to target a 185-bp region of the penton base gene of HAdV. The analytical sensitivity was determined to be 10 copies/Î¼l for HAdV types showing exact primer/probe homology in specimen matrix. Using whole-virus strains, the analytical sensitivity for representative HAdV types ranged from 10(-1) to 10(3) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml. The assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. This real-time PCR assay provides a rapid method for the detection of all 57 known HAdV types from respiratory specimens, blood, stool, urine, and ocular swabs.
