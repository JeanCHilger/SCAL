The challenges of differential diagnosis of infections caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci. Infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes are varied and often difficult to diagnose. During the last few years the clinical manifestations of these infections and the treatment rationale have changed. New diagnostic tests have been introduced. The present article reviews the diagnostic possibilities based upon clinical findings, the doctor's own laboratory and the microbiological laboratory. Rapid immunological tests, differential leukocyte count and C-reactive protein are pointed out as potentially useful laboratory tools for the clinician.
