Rapid detection of Streptococcus pyogenes in pleural fluid samples from pediatric patients with empyema. A total of 120 pleural fluid specimens from 113 pediatric patients were tested using two rapid antigen detection assays for Streptococcus pyogenes. Results were compared to culture, Gram stain, and PCR results. Each rapid antigen assay detected 9 out of 10 (90%) PCR-positive samples, with 100% specificity. These antigen detection assays are useful to provide microbiological diagnosis of empyema caused by S. pyogenes.
