Rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis with enzyme immunoassay. From June 1988 to May 1989, 444 throat swab specimens were tested with an enzyme immunoassay kit for rapid diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The results were compared with those of throat culture method. The rapid test was positive in 37 of 42 culture-positive specimens and negative in 379 of 402 culture-negative specimens, thus yielding a total agreement of 93.7%, sensitivity 88.1%, specificity 94.7%, positive predictive value 61.7%, negative predictive value 98.7%. According to this practical application, we suggest that enzyme immunoassay test can be applied in outpatient clinics by busy pediatricians for rapid diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
