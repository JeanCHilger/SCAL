Coregulation of type 12 M protein and streptococcal C5a peptidase genes in group A streptococci: evidence for a virulence regulon controlled by the virR locus. Group A streptococci express at least two surface-associated virulence factors, the antiphagocytic M protein and the antichemotactic streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCP). Preliminary evidence suggested that the biosynthesis of these two proteins is coordinately controlled and subject to simultaneous phase variation. To explore this possibility further, a series of phase-switching and phase-locked M- variants were assayed for SCP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition and for SCP-specific mRNA by dot blot hybridization. All M- cultures produced diminished amounts of SCP antigen and specific mRNA, whereas revertants produced quantities equivalent to those of the wild-type M+ culture. A phase-locked strain that harbors a deletion in a region upstream of the M12 and SCP genes, termed the virR locus, failed to produce SCP antigen or SCP-specific transcripts. The SCP-specific transcript produced by M+ bacteria was shown by Northern (RNA) blot hybridization to be 4 kilobases in size, distinguishing it from the transcript which encodes M protein. These data demonstrate that phase switching of both SCP and M12 proteins is at the transcriptional level and that expression is under the control of the upstream virR locus. We propose that the genetic determinants of these proteins and of colony morphology comprise a virulence regulon.
