Use of immunoenzyme analysis for evaluating the specificity of the antibody recognition of the antigenic determinants of Streptococcus group A. Investigations carried out with the use of a CELIA system have revealed that antibodies in the sera of patients with primary erysipelas and antibodies in rabbit antiserum to the ribosomes of group A streptococcus specifically bind with adsorbed streptococcal ribosomes, recognizing the antigenic determinants of streptococcal ribosomes, which differ from those of individual Gram-negative prokaryotes (Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella minnesota). The modified CELIA system used in this investigation has made it possible to find out that antibodies in the sera of patients with primary erysipelas and antibodies in rabbit ribosomal antiserum bind with different antigenic determinants of the ribosomes of group A streptococcus.
