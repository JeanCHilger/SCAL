Differentiation of Gemella haemolysans (Thjøtta and Bøe 1938) Berger 1960, from Streptococcus morbillorum (Prevot 1933) Holdeman and Moore 1974. Recently, G. haemolysans and S. morbillorum were postulated to be identical organisms, so that consequently their names were synonyms. In the present paper it was demonstrated, that, in spite of many similarities, both species can be differentiated by nitrite reduction, lacking in S. morbillorum, and some further enzymatic activities as well as by antigenic specificity and certain dissimilarities in morphology, growth conditions and their ability to induce beta-hemolysis. S. morbillorum apparently represents a group of strains with divergent properties and might be assigned to the genus Gemella rather than to Streptococcus.
