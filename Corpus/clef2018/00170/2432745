Comparative biological characteristics of the L-form of Streptococcus group A and B. The comparative study of the biological and serological properties of the L-forms of streptococci, groups A and B, has been made. Their morphological similarity on the level of light microscopy has been demonstrated. The use of ring precipitation, gel diffusion, passive hemagglutination, aggregate hemagglutination, as well as the immunoferritin technique, has made it possible to establish the presence of specific antigens in the L-forms of streptococci, groups A and B. Serological cross reactions are negligible. The future development of a diagnosticum for the specific indication of these antigens is proposed. The fact of the presence of specific antigens in the L-forms of streptococci in comparison with the initial streptococcal strains has been confirmed.
