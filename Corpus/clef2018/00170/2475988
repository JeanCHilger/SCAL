Group-specific antigens of streptococci in the make-up of circulating immune complexes in rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis. The level of "A" and "B" streptococcal antigens in the circulating immune complexes, structure and the level of antibodies to the group specific streptococcal polysaccharides in the patients with minimal activity and latent course rheumatism and in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis of different duration is studied. It is shown that the concentration of the "A" group streptococcal antigens in the circulating immune complexes is higher in rheumatic patients, than in healthy subjects and tonsillitis patients. The high "B" group streptococcal antigen content is found in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A high titer of antibodies to streptococcal polysaccharides of "B" group, especially in the synovial fluid was revealed. A possibility of streptococcal antigens and their antibodies' participation in the development of pathologic process is discussed. A value of obtained indexes in the diagnosis of small activity rheumatism and early stages of rheumatoid arthritis is shown.
