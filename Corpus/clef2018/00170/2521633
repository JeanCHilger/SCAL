Serine and tyrosine protein kinase activities in Streptococcus pyogenes. Phosphorylation of native and synthetic peptides of streptococcal M proteins. Two forms of protein kinase activity were isolated from crude extracts of Streptococcus pyogenes and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. The phosphorylation activities were shown to be insensitive to cAMP, required the presence of divalent cations, and eluted from a Sephadex G-200 column with approximate molecular masses of 60 and 45 kDa, respectively. Both enzymes were capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and synthetic polypeptides in addition to endogenous and heterologous prokaryotic proteins at serine and tyrosine residues. Firm evidence for tyrosine kinase activity was obtained by the use of a tyrosine kinase-specific substrate, a 4:1 glutamate:tyrosine copolymer. Both protein kinases phosphorylated HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system isolated from S. pyogenes and Bacillus stearothermophilus, but failed to phosphorylate HPr isolated from Escherichia coli. Both also phosphorylated a native polypeptide fragment (pep M24) as well as synthetic peptide copies of M protein, the major virulence determinant of group A streptococci. These results indicate that prokaryotic protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and suggest that the protein kinases of streptococci may play an important role not only in the phosphotransferase system but also in the virulence properties of these organisms.
