Clinical experience with cytomegalovirus isolation using conventional cell cultures and early antigen detection in centrifugation-enhanced shell vial cultures. A total of 1,915 clinical samples was inoculated by low-speed centrifugation into shell vials (Bartels Immunodiagnostics, Bellvue, Wash.) containing cover slip monolayers of MRC-5 fibroblasts. At 1 and 2 days postinoculation, one cover slip was stained by an indirect immunofluorescence technique using a monoclonal antibody (Biotech Research Laboratories for Dupont, Billerica, Mass.) to cytomegalovirus (CMV) early antigen (EA). Clinical samples were also inoculated into three MRC-5 or MRHF cell cultures which were observed for 30 days for the appearance of a cytopathic effect (CPE). Of 157 CMV-positive samples, 92 (59%) were identified by centrifugation-enhanced EA (CE-EA) and 131 (83%) produced a CPE. CE-EA was less sensitive than CPE for all types of samples, although 17% of CMV-positive samples were detected by CE-EA alone. Evaluation of the CMV status of patients with CE-EA-positive-CPE-negative samples indicated that these samples likely represented true CMV-positive results. The average elapsed time between culture inoculation and identification of CMV decreased as follows when both CE-EA and CPE, rather than CPE alone, were used: urines, 15 to 7 days buffy coats, 18 to 9 days
