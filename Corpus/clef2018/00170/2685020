Investigation of apparent false-positive urine latex particle agglutination tests for the detection of group B streptococcus antigen. In our nursery, we identified neonates with positive urine latex particle agglutination (LPA) tests for group B streptococcus (GBS) antigen who did not have corroborating cultural evidence of infection. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these apparent false-positive reactions, we examined the urine LPA test in an unselected population of neonates suspected of sepsis. Urine specimens for LPA testing and culture and simultaneous perirectal cultures were obtained from 134 neonates with suspected sepsis. Six infants had positive blood cultures for GBS four of the six were positive by LPA testing. An additional 20 infants had positive LPA tests but negative blood cultures
