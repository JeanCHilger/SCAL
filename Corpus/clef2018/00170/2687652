Disseminated herpes simplex virus infection in an apparently immunocompetent woman. A young, previously healthy woman developed bilateral exudative tonsillitis that was associated with severe systemic symptoms. This was followed by evidence of multisystem disease with acute abdominal pain, raised liver enzyme levels, respiratory difficulty, increasing drowsiness and multiple vesicular skin lesions. Herpes simplex virus type-1 was isolated from skin lesions and a throat swab and herpes simplex virus type-1 antigen was detected in a liver biopsy sample. She recovered rapidly without any sequelae after treatment with intravenously administered acyclovir.
