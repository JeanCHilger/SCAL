Enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for the detection of anticarbohydrate antibodies in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Antibodies to group A streptococcal polysaccharide were estimated in the following groups of patients: (I) Patients with uncomplicated streptococcal pharyngitis: 10 patients, followed up for 3 months. (II) Patients with acute rheumatic fever: 8 patients with first attack followed up for one year. (III) Patients with reactivated rheumatic heart disease: 10 patients, followed up for one year. (IV) Patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease: followed up for one year. (V) normal controls without any history of sore throat/fever/vaccination/rheumatic disease: 10 patients followed up for one year. Group (I) patients did not show any significant elevation in anticarbohydrate antibodies by both ELISA and RIA. In the case of (III) and (IV), antibody levels were significantly higher as compared to group (V) and remained so till one year of follow up. In group (II) patients there was no significant rise in antibody levels. There was a good correlation between the ELISA and RIA used to detect the antibody levels. These findings suggest that the use of ELISA to detect anticarbohydrate antibody can be of help in diagnosing cases of rheumatic heart disease (both acute and chronic RHD).
