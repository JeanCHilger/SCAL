Comparative study between an easy coagglutination test and traditional cultures for the detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in the oropharynx. The authors make a comparative study of the conventional culture media and a commercially available coagglutination test for detection of streptococcus beta-haemolyticus. They draw attention to the simplicity and quickness of the coagglutination test and to their high value of prediction.
