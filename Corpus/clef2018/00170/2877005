Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for adherence of bacteria to animal cells. Epithelial cells scraped from human oral mucosa and from pig intestines were immobilized onto the flat bottom surfaces of microtiter plates to study the adherence of various bacterial species to host cells. Bacterial adherence was quantitated either by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with specific antibacterial serum as the first antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated second antibody or by using biotinylated bacteria and avidin-peroxidase as the detecting agent. Unlabeled Escherichia coli and purified E. coli 987P fimbriae inhibited the adherence of biotinylated E. coli to immobilized enterocytes. The adherence of a mannose-sensitive strain of E. coli to immobilized oral epithelial cells was inhibited by mannose derivatives. The adherence of fimbriated E. coli 987P to immobilized enterocytes was approximately four times higher than the adherence of a nonfimbriated variant of the same strain. The adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes to oral cells was detected in the range of 10 to 150 bacteria per cell and was inhibited by lipoteichoic acid and albumin. The data suggest that the putative receptors which bind bacteria on the immobilized cells retain a functional form similar to that of native cells in suspension. The proposed adherence assay is easy to perform, allows the detection of specific adherence of test bacteria, and provides objective quantitation of adherence with a sensitivity of 10 bacteria per cell. Most importantly, the assay allows the testing of many variables in the same day.
