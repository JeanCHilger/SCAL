Detection of cytomegalovirus infections in specimens other than urine by the shell vial assay and conventional tube cell cultures. Blood, bronchoscopy-lavage, biopsy (lung, liver, kidney), sputum, and other (cecum, bone) specimens were inoculated into shell vials and conventional cell tube cultures seeded with MRC-5 cells over a 23-month period. Of 1,472 specimens, 182 (12.4%) yielded cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive results from 81 patients. Significantly more CMV-positive specimens were detected in shell vials (n = 154 84.6%) than in conventional tube cell cultures (n = 126
