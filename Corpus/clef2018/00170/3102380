M proteins of group G streptococci isolated from bacteremic human infections. We studied seven strains of group G streptococci isolated from clinically severe bacteremic infections in six intravenous drug abusers. These group G strains multiplied luxuriantly in fresh human blood. On electron microscopy, they exhibited surface fibrillae similar to those observed in M-protein-rich group A streptococci, but they were not serologically M typable with a battery of 39 M antisera. Rabbit antisera raised against two of the group G strains (1618 and 1750) opsonized the homologous but not the heterologous isolates and exhibited type-specific Ouchterlony immunoprecipitin reactions. Moreover, antisera raised against peptic extracts of strain 1750 also promoted phagocytic killing of that strain. Anti-1750 reacted in high titer in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against peptic extracts of the homologous strain these antibodies were removed by absorption with 1750 cells but not by absorption with heterologous strains. These studies represent, to our knowledge, the first analysis of virulence factors of group G streptococci isolated from invasive human disease. The seven epidemiologically related blood isolates of group G streptococci possess distinct type-specific, antiphagocytic surface virulence factors analogous to the M proteins of group A streptococci.
