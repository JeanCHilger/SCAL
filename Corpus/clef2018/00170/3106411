Density profile of group B streptococci, type III, and its possible relation to enhanced virulence. The buoyant densities of virulent and colonizing group B streptococci, type III, were determined by centrifugation of bacteria on a linear, hypotonic density gradient. A total of 28 strains were investigated. Eleven strains were obtained from blood cultures of babies with early-onset disease, and eight strains were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of babies with late-onset septicemia and meningitis. Nine colonizing strains were genital isolates from pregnant women subsequently giving birth to healthy children. In each strain the buoyant density was determined before and after neuraminidase treatment. All strains showed an increase in the buoyant density after enzymatic removal of sialic acid, and the density differences before and after desialylation were calculated. The mean values of these differences for blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and colonizing isolates were 23.4, 25.3, and 10.6 mg/ml, respectively. The mean value for the colonizing strains differed significantly from the mean value for each group of virulent strains. All colonizing strains banded singly in the gradient, whereas five of the virulent strains divided into two density populations. Extracts of the low-density cells produced markedly more dense immunoprecipitates with type antiserum than did extracts of the high-density bacteria. One double-banding strain was positive for R protein. After separation of the two density populations, this antigen was detected only in the low-density population. The results indicate that bacterial buoyant density is inversely related to the amount of capsular polysaccharide enveloping the cell and that a determination of the density profile of the bacteria may be used for discriminating strains with an increased pathogenic potential.
