Direct detection of groups A, C and G streptococci in clinical specimens by a trivalent colour test. A simple trivalent colour test, developed for the rapid detection and identification of streptococci belonging to Lancefield groups A, C and G, was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity with cultures and when directly used with wound and throat swabs. In tests performed on cultures, all of 94 group A, 78 group C and 94 group G cultures were correctly identified. In direct tests on wound swabs, 49 of 52 group A, 17 of 19 group C and 48 of 51 group G streptococci were detected and correctly identified no false positives were observed. With throat swabs from pharyngitis patients 34 of 36 group A, 3 of 6 group C and 5 of 8 group G streptococci gave positive results. Almost 10% of these swabs gave false positive reactions with the group C component of the test system. Samples taken from uninfected individuals indicated that the false positives were probably associated with blood group A. The test system gives rapid and reliable results with streptococcal cultures, but when directly applied to clinical samples the results must be interpreted with caution, particularly if the patient's blood group is not known.
