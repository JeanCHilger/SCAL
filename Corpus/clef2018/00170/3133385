Comparison of Gen-Probe commercial kit and culture technique for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The Gen-Probe rapid diagnostic system was compared with a culture method for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical specimens. Of 116 clinical specimens, 103 (88.8%) yielded identical results. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the probe were both 89%. Rapid turnaround time and its sensitivity and specificity indicate that the probe test is a practical method for the rapid diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections.
