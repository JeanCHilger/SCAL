A pneumococcal surface protein (PspB) that exhibits the same protease sensitivity as streptococcal R antigen. A monoclonal antibody against Streptococcus pneumoniae, designated T4A49, detected a 64,000-molecular-weight protein that was immunologically unrelated to the previously described surface protein PspA. This new protein, designated PspB, was pepsin sensitive and trypsin resistant, as is the R antigen of type 28 group A streptococci.
