The rapid identification of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in the upper respiratory tract. Current status. Rapid detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal antigen on throat swabs has become more popular in the management of patients with pharyngitis. Although the specificity of these commercially available kits usually has been satisfactory, the sensitivity has varied considerably. Currently most physicians accept a positive rapid test result but frequently require culture confirmation of a negative rapid antigen detection test on a throat swab.
