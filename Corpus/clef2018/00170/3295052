Stimulation of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in human lymphocytes by streptococcal M protein. The effects of the specific antigen M5 protein of group A streptococci on AdoMet synthetase activity and AdoMet levels in peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were studied and were compared with the effects of the nonspecific polyclonal T cell mitogen PHA. M5 protein stimulated AdoMet synthetase activity, whereas PHA had a biphasic effect with an early inhibitory effect and a later stimulatory effect on AdoMet synthetase activity. S-Carbamyl-L-cysteine (SCC), an inhibitor of human lymphocyte AdoMet synthetase, reduced AdoMet levels and inhibited the blastogenic response of PB lymphocytes to both M5 protein and PHA. Inhibition of the response to M5 protein was stronger than that to PHA. However, the inhibitory effects of SCC were totally reversible by washing the cells. It is our hypothesis that such differences in the biochemical events triggered by specific antigen as opposed to a polyclonal mitogen may determine the direction of the functional differentiation of T lymphocytes.
