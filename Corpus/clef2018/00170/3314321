Influence of antibiotic treatment on the isolation rate of group A streptococci from peritonsillar abscesses. In a prospective one-year study, group A streptococci were cultured from pus specimens from 13 of 71 patients (18%) with peritonsillar abscesses. The isolation rate was significantly lower (7/57 = 12%) in patients who had received antibiotic treatment before specimen collection than in patients who had not received such treatment (6/12 = 50%). Group A streptococcus antigen detection tests on pus, using a commercially available diagnostic kit, had a low sensitivity (5/13 = 38%). It was concluded that in patients treated with antibiotics prior to collection of specimens, the absence of group A streptococcus on culture does not rule out that this organism could have been the principal etiologic agent.
