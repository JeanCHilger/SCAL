Cytotoxic effect of lymphocytes on autologous blood monocytes in the presence of streptococcal group A antigens in patients with primary erysipelas. The present work deals with a modification of the cytotoxic test for the determination of the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes in infectious diseases. This modification is based on the use of the suspension of mononuclear blood cells, simultaneously containing effector cells (sensitized lymphocytes) and target cells (autologous monocytes). The cytotoxic effect on monocytes is observed after the preliminary incubation of nonadhering cells (lymphocytes) with the antigen of microorganisms causing the infectious process. A statistically significant increase in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes was recorded in patients with primary erysipelas at the acute period of the disease. The cytotoxic effect has been found to persist at a high level for two weeks. By the end of the disease this effect drops to the level characteristic of clinically normal persons. An elevated level of the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes in the presence of streptococcal antigens of one type has been detected in 72% of patients with primary erysipelas. This indicates that type-nonspecific streptococcal antigens take part in the formation of delayed hypersensitivity, which is also confirmed by the data obtained in animal experiments.
