Localization of the streptococcal C5a peptidase to the surface of group A streptococci. Immunofluorescent staining was used to determine that the streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCP) exists as a cell surface antigen on group A streptococci. The ability of hyperimmune serum to neutralize cell-associated SCP activity provided further evidence for the location of SCP. Quantification of SCP during growth in vitro by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that approximately 90% of the measurable antigen is cell bound.
