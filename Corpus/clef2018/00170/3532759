Comparison of two rapid latex agglutination methods for detection of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Throat swabs from 404 patients with suspected pharyngitis were collected using duplicate swabs. Both swabs were used to inoculate 5% sheep blood agar plates, which were incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere for the isolation of Group A streptococci. The throat swabs were tested for the presence of Group A antigen using the Culturette Brand 10-Minute Group A Strep ID kit (Marion Scientific, Kansas City, MO), and the Direct Antigen Identification D.A.I. Strep A Test (Difco Laboratories, Inc., Detroit, MI). We found that 77 of the 404 specimens were culture positive for Group A streptococci. The Strep ID kit had a sensitivity of 83.7% and a specificity of 91.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 72% and 95.6%, respectively. The D.A.I. test had a sensitivity of 80.2% and a specificity of 100%. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 94.5%, respectively. There was not a significant difference in the sensitivity of the two kits (P less than 0.1), but there was a significant difference in the specificity (P less than 0.01).
