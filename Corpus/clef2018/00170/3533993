Effective murolytic solubilization of streptococcal-group-specific antigen. Streptococcal-group-specific antigens were solubilized with a murolytic enzyme contained in the culture supernatant of Streptomyces globisporus. This facilitated the effective serogrouping of streptococci from humans and animals.
