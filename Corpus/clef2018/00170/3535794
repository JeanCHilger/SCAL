Sequence homology of group A streptococcal Pep M5 protein with other coiled-coil proteins. Group A streptococcal Pep M5 protein, an antiphagocytic determinant of the bacteria, is an alpha-helical coiled-coil molecule, and exhibits significant sequence homology with tropomyosin and myosin, but to a lesser degree with other coiled-coil proteins. Moreover, Pep M5 is more homologous to myosin than to tropomyosin, and the homologies are more numerous between the C-terminal domain of the Pep M5 protein and the S2 fragment of myosin. The C-terminal domain of the Pep M5 protein exhibits extensive sequence identity with the C-terminal region of Pep M6 molecule, another M protein serotype. Thus, regions within two M protein serotypes are homologous to the S2 region of the myosin molecule. These observations are consistent with the immunological findings of other investigators and thus may explain some of the previously reported immunological cross-reactions between antigens of the group A streptococcus and mammalian heart tissue.
