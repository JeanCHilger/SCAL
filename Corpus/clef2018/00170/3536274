Comparative evaluation of PathoDx Strep A test and culture for the detection of group A streptococci in pharyngeal specimens. The PathoDx Strep A kit, a 10-min acid extraction and latex agglutination test, was compared with routine culture for the direct detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) in 414 pharyngeal specimens collected from children with pharyngitis. The results showed that the latex test compared favorably with culture for detecting group A BHS in pharyngeal specimens (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 97.9%, and positive and negative predictive values of 97.2% and 97.4%, respectively). The comparable number of false-positive (five) and false-negative (six) latex tests along with review of patient histories suggest that these discrepant results were attributable to sampling error during specimen procurement rather than deficiencies in the latex kit. In addition, clear-cut, agglutination reactions were obtained in over 96% of positive latex tests regardless of the amount of group A BHS that was recovered by culture. The PathoDx Strep A test is a rapid, reliable noncultural alternative for the detection of group A BHS in pharyngeal specimens.
