Clinical performance and effect on treatment rates of latex agglutination testing for streptococcal pharyngitis in an emergency department. Of 556 children with symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis in a pediatric hospital emergency department, 38.8% had positive results on either a rapid latex agglutination test or throat culture for Group A Streptococcus. Twenty-six percent of patients with negative latex agglutination test results had growth on culture of a paired specimen. Under the best assumption rapid test sensitivity was 44.9%. The treatment rate (84%) for cases detected by the rapid test was markedly higher than the rate (44%) for cases detected only by culture (P less than 0.001), presumably because the rapid test result is available sooner. We conclude that: the rapid test had a lower sensitivity in routine use in our pediatric emergency department population than in previous reports from research settings and using the rapid test in addition to culture can significantly increase treatment rates.
