Biological and immunochemical identity of M protein on group G streptococci with M protein on group A streptococci. Previous evidence for the presence of an M or M-like protein on group G streptococci has been based on the ability of these strains to survive in human blood. In addition, cross-reactions between group A and group G streptococci have been demonstrated, but they have relied either on whole bacterial cell vaccine-induced polyclonal sera or crude protein extracts of these cells. In this study two monoclonal antibodies prepared against the purified, native group A streptococcal M6 protein demonstrated a high degree of cross-reactivity with group G streptococcal clinical isolates (9 and 19 of 22 strains examined, respectively). Ten of these strains exhibited resistance to phagocytosis when rotated in human blood. In addition, immunoblot analysis of crude mutanolysin extracts of group G streptococci with one of the M6 monoclonal antibodies illustrated a remarkable similarity in the protein pattern of these extracts as compared with those of group A streptococcal M protein. The immunoblots further demonstrated a variation in the relative molecular weights of the extracted proteins from strain to strain over a range of 57,000 to 77,000. In addition, a purified, pepsin-derived fragment (Mr, 43,000) from a group G strain was capable of eliciting rabbit antibodies that were opsonic for group G cells in a bactericidal assay. These functional and immunochemical data, in concert with DNA hybridization between group G streptococcal DNA and a group A M6 gene probe (J. R. Scott, W. M. Pulliam, S. K. Hollingshead, and V. A. Fischetti, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:1822-1826, 1985), provide strong evidence for the presence of an M protein on these organisms and indicate its probable role as a virulence molecule on the surface of group G streptococci.
