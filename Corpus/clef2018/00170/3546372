Lim group B Strep Broth and coagglutination for rapid identification of group B streptococci in preterm pregnant women. A total of 147 preterm pregnant women at Orlando Regional Medical Center were screened for group B streptococci by using Lim Group B Strep Broth (GIBCO Laboratories, Madison, Wis.) and the Phadebact Strep B Test (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Piscataway, N.J.). Test results were available within 20 h of culture and, in the case of heavily colonized women, within 5 h. This procedure is useful in rapid diagnosis of preterm pregnant women for group B streptococcal colonization.
