Role of culture conditions and immunization in experimental nutritionally variant streptococcal endocarditis. The nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) are usually isolated from patients with NVS endocarditis and recently have been serotyped into three groups. In the past, studies on microbial endocarditis have not analyzed the effect of the growth medium or growth phase on the bacteria used to induce the disease in the experimental rabbit model. Therefore, in this study various bacterial growth parameters were examined, including growth in semisynthetic or complex medium to the exponential or stationary phase of growth. The 50% infective dose ranged from 3.7 X 10(5) to 8.5 X 10(6) CFU for representative strains from each of the three serotypes grown under these conditions, indicating that there was no significant difference. The role of immunization was also examined in this model using organisms grown to the exponential phase in semisynthetic medium. Rabbits were immunized with heat-killed whole cells, high titres of specific antibody were produced as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and then the rabbits were challenged with 20- to 100-fold 50% infective dose of the homologous strain. A total of 90 to 100% of the rabbits were protected from the disease process, as shown by the absence of the organisms from the heart valve 3 days after the challenge. Rabbits immunized with the amphiphile that replaces lipoteichoic acid in these organisms were not protected from challenge, demonstrating that another surface component is responsible for adherence or colonization or both. Finally NVS were incubated with radioiodinated fibronectin, fibrinogen, or laminin to determine whether these molecules aided in the adherence of the organisms to the heart valve. Only minor amounts of these components were bound to NVS as compared with controls. Therefore, NVS bind directly to the damaged heart valve or through an unknown mechanism.
