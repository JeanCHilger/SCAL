Antibodies induced by group A Streptococcus reacting with epidermis elements in patients with basalomas. Microbial mass of cultured streptococci treated with pepsin as an immunosorbent was used for isolation of an immunoglobulin factor which specifically reacted with elements of basal membrane of epidermis of basal cell cancer patients in an immunofluorescence test. The reaction took place in skin bioptates obtained both from the zone of tumor growth and distant regions. Antigens isolated from the basal membrane of skin epithelium of healthy subjects did not react with immunoglobulin factor.
