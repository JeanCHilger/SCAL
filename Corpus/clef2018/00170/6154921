Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in the evaluation of infants with group B streptococcal disease. Admission specimens of CSF, serum, and urine from 67 patients with proved group B streptococcal (GBS) bacteremia and/or meningitis were evaluated by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). Group B and type-specific antigens were detected in 81% of CSF, 63% of serum, and 96% of concentrated urine specimens by CIE. Each of 26 infants with meningitis from whom all three body fluids were available and ten with bacteremia from whom both serum and urine were collected at admission had GBS antigens detected by CIE in at least one specimen. No false positive reactions were observed. Among patients with type III, GBS meningeal infection, fatal outcome or neurologic sequelae were significantly correlated with concentration of type III antigen in admission CSF and duration of antigenuria when compared to normal survivors (P = less than .05, Mann-Whitney U tests). CIE appears to be a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool for infants with GBS infection if admission specimens from more than one source are examined and appropriately high-titered antisera are employed for testing.
