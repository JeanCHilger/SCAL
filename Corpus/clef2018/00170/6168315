Cross-reacting antigens of human thymus myoid cells and stable L-forms of group A streptococci. Indirect immunofluorescence has shown a similarity between the antigen components of group A streptococcus L-forms and human thymus myoid cells. An analogous antigen (or antigens) is present in the cytoplasmic membrane of human myocardial cell fibers. The depletion of antiserum to the streptococcal L-forms both by the culture of L-forms grown in meat or casein media and by the homogenate of the cardiac muscle leads to the inhibition of immunofluorescence. The depletion of serum by the homogenate of other tissues (liver) or by L-form culture does not virtually affect the immunofluorescence intensity. According to the authors' opinion, the similarity of antigens of group A streptococcus L-forms to the antigenic components of organ tissues is likely to be responsible for long-term persistence of the microorganisms under consideration and to favour, in some cases, the occurrence of autoantibodies. The latter circumstance might lead to pathological changes in organs containing cross-reacting antigens.
