Clinical laboratory and epidemiological investigations of a Streptococcus pyogenes cluster epidemic in a newborn nursery. Streptococcus pyogenes, nontypable with available M antisera, T type 12, and reactive in the serum opacity test, produced various lesions in 10 newborn infants during a 2-month period. All infants except one were discharged from the nursery before overt disease manifestations. Colonization studies of newborn infants showed a streptococcal carrier rate of 19% (27 of 140). Only 1 of 154 staff members yielded the same streptococcus from the throat, but it could not be implicated as the source for the outbreak. Cohorting of infants and chlorhexidine gluconate hand washing by staff members helped in terminating this cluster epidemic.
