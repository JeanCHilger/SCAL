Rapid biochemical tests for the identification of groups A, B, C, F, and G streptococci from throat cultures. A test employing three fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates and the lectin of Dolichos biflorus was developed for the identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcal colonies associated with throat cultures. This non-serological method is unique in that it permits the accurate identification of groups C, F, and G streptococci, as well as groups A and B streptococci. The method is rapid, simple, and specific and appears to be a useful means to identify groups A, B, C, F, and G streptococci.
