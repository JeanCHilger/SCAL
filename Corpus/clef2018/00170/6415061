Repeating covalent structure and protective immunogenicity of native and synthetic polypeptide fragments of type 24 streptococcal M protein. Mapping of protective and nonprotective epitopes with monoclonal antibodies. The complete amino acid sequences of three cyanogen bromide peptide fragments (CB3, CB4, and CB50 of type 24 M protein extracted from Streptococcus pyogenes by limited pepsin digestion were determined by automated Edman degradation of the uncleaved peptides and their tryptic peptides. CB3 and CB4 each contain 35 amino acid residues, whereas CB5 contains 37. The sequence of CB3 was found to be: (formula: see text) (where Hse represents homoserine). The sequence of CB4 was identical except for amino acid substitutions of arginine and glutamine at positions 23 and 24, respectively. The sequence of CB5 also was identical with that of CB3 except for substitutions of aspartic acids at positions 28 and 29 leucine, glutamic acid, and glycine at positions 33, 34, and 35, respectively
