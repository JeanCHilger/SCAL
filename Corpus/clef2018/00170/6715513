Early detection of streptococci in swabs by latex agglutination before culture. A commercial streptococcal grouping system was used to demonstrate streptococcal antigen in swabs before culture. The method detected 81% of the streptococci of groups A, B, C, and G subsequently isolated in culture. The method offers a sensitive and specific method for the early detection of beta-hemolytic streptococci.
