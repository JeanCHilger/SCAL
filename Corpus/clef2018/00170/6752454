Upper limit of normal anti-strepto-polysaccharide (ASP) level and the relationship between ASP and antibodies against extracellular antigens. Titers of anti-strepto-polysaccharide (ASP), antistreptolysin-O, antistreptokinase and antideoxyribonuclease-B were studied from the sera of 184 healthy school children. The upper limit of normal ASP titers in school children was 1:32 in this study, and titers of 1:64 or more were considered abnormal. The correlation coefficients between ASP and other antibodies against extracellular antigens were r = -0.04 to 0.06, and therefore it can be considered that ASP shows an independent value from other antibodies.
