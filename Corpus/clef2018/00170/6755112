Lymphocyte transformation test of peripheral and tonsillar lymphocytes in chronic tonsillitis. Transformation tests of tonsillar and blood lymphocytes with many streptococcal extracellular antigens and streptococcal membrane antigen in patients suffering from chronic tonsillitis were performed. The in-vitro cellular immunoresponse depends on the antigen, the age of the patient, and the origin of the lymphocytes: blood or tonsil. There is good evidence that there is a selective unresponsiveness of the blood lymphocytes in adult patients, stimulated with streptococcal membrane antigen.
