Pyogenic sacroiliac arthritis in children. Analysis and commentary apropos of 7 cases. Seven cases of pyogenic arthritis of the sacro-iliac joint in children were observed between 1968 and 1981. Their analysis is discussed with the conclusions of the too much rare publications in the recent literature. Taking in to account the anatomic particularities the necessity of very precise roentgenographic technics in order to assess the sacro-iliac joint, especially in children because of incomplete ossification, the authors replace this pathology into the osteomyelitis in children. From the clinical aspects of the disease, with its typically localized pain, and its acute clinical and biological septicemic syndrome, the authors attempt to demonstrate that the classical idea of a delayed diagnosis, is not absolute. Even in this particular localization, an early "up to date" diagnosis is possible allowing rapid treatment with efficient antibiotherapy directed towards the responsible germ after their isolation (especially staphylococcus aureus). Indubitable progress has been gained with systematic radio-nuclide bone scanning in emergency.
