Probable association of M type 57 streptococcal skin infection with acute glomerulonephritis in the Tauranga area. Evidence is presented for the probable association of streptococcal skin infection (M type 57) with six cases of acute glomerulonephritis. M type 57 streptococcus was isolated from skin infections in four of the cases and from skin sores occurring in sibling contacts of the other two. Two of the cases occurred at a time when M type 57 streptococcus predominated in skin lesions of children from the same school. A further two cases of post-streptococcal nephritis with possible involvement of M type 57 are discussed. The superiority of the anti-DNase B test over anti-streptolysin O determination in a situation when streptococcal pyoderma nephritis has occurred is shown.
