Cross-reacting antigen common to stratified squamous epithelium and Streptococcus group A in tumors of epidermal origin. A tissue-specific basal-cell antigen of stratified squamous epithelium which enters into cross reaction with group A streptococcus polysaccharide was detected in the cytoplasm of human basal- and squamous-cell tumor cells which are associated histogenetically with skin epithelium. However, it was not found in the cells of entodermal tumors (stomach and intestinal adenocarcinoma). Considering earlier reports on the detection of cross reacting antigen in experimental ectodermal tumors, these results suggest the development of an additional histogenetical method of differential diagnosis of human tumors which arise in ectodermal tegumental epithelium.
