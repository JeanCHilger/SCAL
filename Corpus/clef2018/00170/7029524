Streptococcal M protein: alpha-helical coiled-coil structure and arrangement on the cell surface. The conformation and molecular dimensions of purified type 6 streptococcal M proteins establish the close structural relationship of these molecules to tropomyosin. Ultracentrifuge studies reveal that the M molecules exist as stable dimers circular dichroism spectra indicate that the molecules contain about 70% alpha helix
