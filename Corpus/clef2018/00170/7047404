The adherence of group A streptococci to oropharyngeal cells: the lipoteichoic acid adhesin and fibronectin receptor. The attachment of group A streptococci to oropharyngeal epithelial cells is mediated by adhesive molecules (adhesins) on the surfaces of the micro-organisms that interact with receptor molecules on the epithelial cells. The evidence that the adhesin is composed of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) complexed with bacterial cell surface proteins is as follows: (a) Among the purified cell wall substances tested, only LTA was able to inhibit attachment (b) treatment of streptococci with anti LTA but not with antibody against other surface substances blocks attachment
