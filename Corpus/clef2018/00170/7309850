Extraction of group A streptococcal M protein with nitrous acid. Specific precipitating and opsonic neutralizing antigens were identified in dilute-nitrous acid extracts of group A streptococci. This was done by decreasing the temperature and time of exposure of the streptococcal cells to the nitrous acid. Ninety percent of 31 strains of group A streptococcal dilute-nitrous acid extracts formed precipitin lines of identity with conventional Lancefield extracts of the same group A streptococci.
