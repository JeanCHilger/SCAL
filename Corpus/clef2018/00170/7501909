Pharyngo-tonsillitis: Current clinical, bacteriological, serological and therapeutic aspects. The authors present the pharyngo-tonsillitis in four fields: clinical, bacteriology, serology and treatment. They insist on the danger of the beta-hemolytic Strep A, the failures of the ASLO detection and stress the execution of the rapid antigenic test at the office. They suggest the limitation of the administration of antibiotics and the prescription of a penicillin which is much better than macrolides or cephalosporins of second or third generation.
