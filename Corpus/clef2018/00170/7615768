Comparison of two rapid streptococcal antigen detection assays with culture for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. In this study, 801 pharyngeal specimens were cultured for group A streptococci and tested with the Biostar Strep A Optical Immunoassay (Strep A OIA). The respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: culture, 97.1 and 100% Strep A OIA, 91.5 and 94.8%. Of the 801 specimens, 597 were also tested with the Abbott TestPack Strep A Assay (TP-ST). For those specimens tested by all three methods, the respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: culture, 98.1 and 100%
