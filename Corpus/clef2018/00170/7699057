Evaluation of a new immunologic test kit for rapid detection of group A streptococci, the Abbott Testpack Strep A plus. We compared the Testpack Strep A plus (TPSAP) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) antigen rapid detection with blood agar culture in 454 pediatric patients with clinical pharyngitis. Of the 454 patients, 118 (25.9%) had positive oropharyngeal cultures for GAS. TPSAP sensitivity was 89.9% (106 of 118) and specificity was 95.8% (322 of 336). We conclude that the TPSAP is specific enough to indicate treatment for a patient with a positive test but that a negative test should be confirmed by culture.
