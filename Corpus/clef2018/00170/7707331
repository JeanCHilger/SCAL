Distribution of serovariants of group B streptococci in isolates from England and Norway. The distribution of capsular polysaccharide antigen (CHO) types, surface-exposed c proteins alpha (c alpha) and beta (c beta) and an R-protein antigen was examined in 334 group B streptococci (GBS) isolates from three groups of patients hospitalised in England and Wales or Norway. The isolates were from 108 carriers, 67 cases of neonatal infection and 154 cases of adult infection. Each group contained all CHO types (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and NT) type III strains predominated except in the adult infected group. Strains within each CHO type could be further subdivided by the protein markers into five subtypes by a combined typing system. The proportion of type Ib and type III strains in the neonatal infection cases and of type Ib strains in the adult infection cases significantly outnumbered isolates of these serotypes among the carrier strains. Twenty-nine different serovariants were identified
