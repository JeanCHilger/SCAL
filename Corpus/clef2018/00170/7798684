Selective depletion of V beta-bearing T cells in patients with severe invasive group A streptococcal infections and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Ontario Streptococcal Study Project. The V beta repertoire of T cells of patients with gram-positive group A streptococcal (GAS) and non-GAS infections was analyzed to seek evidence for the role of superantigens in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. No evidence of V beta overexpression but a consistent pattern of depletion of V beta 1, V beta 5.1, and V beta 12 was observed in patients with severe GAS infections. This pattern of V beta depletion was not observed in patients with nonsevere GAS infections or with severe non-GAS gram-positive infections. T cells from patients with severe GAS infections showed evidence of apoptosis no apoptosis was found when there was no evidence of V beta depletion. There was no correlation with streptococcal M or T serotype or known spe genes. The depletion of specific V beta-bearing T cells in patients with severe GAS infections supports the role of a superantigen in these infections. The in vivo pattern of V beta specificity implicates a novel superantigen(s) in this disease.
