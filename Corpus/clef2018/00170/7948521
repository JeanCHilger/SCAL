Diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia by polymerase chain reaction enzyme immunoassay. We conducted a prospective study of 385 patients who had community-acquired pneumonia with use of a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects amplified DNA by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). We used PCR-EIA to improve detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and to differentiate C. pneumoniae infection from other chlamydial infections. Cultures of throat swab specimens from four patients yielded Chlamydia species (C. pneumoniae, one patient Chlamydia species, two patients
