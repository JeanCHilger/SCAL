Identification of viridans streptococci associated with bacteraemia in neutropenic cancer patients. Twenty-three viridans streptococcal isolates from pyrexial neutropenic patients with various malignant diseases were studied in a comprehensive identification scheme. Fourteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus oralis, five as S. mitis and two as S. salivarius but the remaining two could not be identified reliably. The virulence mechanisms associated with the ability of these species to survive and grow in vivo require further investigation but may involve the production of specific glycosidase and proteolytic enzyme activities.
