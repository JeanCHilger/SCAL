Optical immunoassay for streptococcal pharyngitis: evaluation of accuracy with routine and mucoid strains associated with acute rheumatic fever outbreak in the intermountain area of the United States. The Strep A OIA (BioStar, Inc., Boulder, Colo.) rapid detection system is an intriguing technology that utilizes an immunoassay relying on changes in reflected light to directly detect group A streptococcal antigen from specimens. In this evaluation, 424 routine pediatric throat specimens and 20 simulated oropharyngeal specimens with added mucoid (M type 3, 18) strains were cultured and tested by the Strep A OIA. The respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: Strep A OIA versus enhanced broth culturing, 84.2 and 95.7% and streptococcus-SXT agar (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) culturing versus enhanced broth culturing, 82.9 and 98.6%. The Strep A OIA is an 8-min, technologist-friendly, accurate technique with an 89.4% agreement with traditional culturing.
