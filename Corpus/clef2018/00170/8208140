Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of a kit for the rapid detection of group A streptococci. A rapid immunoassay method using an Event Test Strip Strep A experimental kit (Boehringer Mannheim) was evaluated. Results obtained were compared with culture results to evaluate the accuracy of detection of group A streptococci directly from throat swabs or from artificial swabs containing various bacterial concentrations. A good diagnostic accuracy was obtained with a sensitivity of 96.9% in the assay of throat swabs which provided more than ten group A Streptococcus colonies per plate. Since a low level of micro-organisms may indicate infection, it is recommended that a culture be performed when the rapid test based on antigen detection is negative.
