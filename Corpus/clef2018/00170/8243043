Comparison of direct specimen testing utilizing TestPack strep A with testing of specimens following a two-hour broth enrichment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that a 2-h enrichment of throat swabs in broth followed by a direct fluorescent antibody test was significantly more sensitive than the Abbott TestPack Strep A for the detection of group-A streptococci. In this study, in an effort to simplify the technique, we utilized broth enrichment with an enzyme immunoassay detection method. A total of 1017 pharyngeal specimens were tested with TestPack Strep A (DTP), culture on a selective streptococcal agar, and a 2-h broth enrichment in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) followed by TestPack Strep A (ETP). Subculture of the THB was used to arbitrate discordant test results. The sensitivities and specificities respectively were as follows: DTP (69% and 99%), ETP (90% and 98%), and SSA (97% and 100%). This enrichment method offers significantly greater sensitivity than direct testing for antigen yet still allows the potential for finalized same-day reporting of results.
