Antibody titers to bacterial antigens in middle ear effusion of otitis media with effusion. Antibody titers against H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius in middle ear effusions (MEE) of 46 children (60 ears) with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) are reported. H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are predominant microorganisms in acute suppurative otitis media. S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius are major species of normal adenoid flora. Specific antibodies against the above bacterial species were detected in all samples. In the chronic group, IgG titers against H. influenzae, IgG and IgM against S. pneumoniae, IgG and IgM against S. pyogenes, and IgG against S. salivarius were statistically higher than in the acute and subacute groups. IgG, IgM and IgA titers against S. mitis and S. pneumoniae in MEE with chronic sinusitis were higher than those from sinusitis free children. Anti-S. sanguis and S. pyogenes IgG and IgA of sinusitis free patients' MEE were higher than those with chronic sinusitis. The antibody titers against H. influenzae did not differ statistically between those with and without sinusitis. The presence of anti-bacterial antibodies inhibits acute infection in MEE, and the difference in titers with sinusitis may be caused by bacterial numbers in the adenoids and the host's response to the bacteria.
