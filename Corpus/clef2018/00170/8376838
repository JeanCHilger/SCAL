Poststreptococcal anti-myosin antibody idiotype associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. Anti-myosin antibodies are found in acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a sequela of group A streptococcal infection. An antiidiotypic serum was produced that was specific for idiotopes expressed by anti-myosin antibodies in ARF (anti-My1). Studies indicated that idiotypic determinants detected with this serum were present in anti-myosin antibodies and absent from normal human immunoglobulins that lacked specificity for myosin. Anti-My1 was tested against sera from patients with other types of autoimmune diseases as well as uncomplicated streptococcal infections. Sera from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis patients demonstrated idiotypic reactivity with anti-My1. Affinity-purified anti-myosin antibodies from SLE, SS, and ARF sera also reacted strongly with anti-My1, indicating that immunoglobulins produced in these diseases share idiotypic determinants. The data demonstrated an association of the My1 idiotype with poststreptococcal sequelae and the two autoimmune diseases SLE and SS.
