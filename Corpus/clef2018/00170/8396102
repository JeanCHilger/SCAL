Multicentre evaluation of azithromycin and penicillin V in the treatment of acute streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis in children. Of 96 children (aged 2-12 years) with either acute pharyngitis or acute tonsillitis, 49 received a single daily dose of azithromycin 10 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) for three days, and 47 received penicillin V at a dose of 125 mg or 250 mg qid (depending on body weight) for ten days. Clinical assessments and laboratory safety tests were performed during and after therapy. Before enrollment, all patients were screened for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) with a rapid test, and a throat swab was taken for confirmatory culture. The presence of GABHS at baseline was confirmed in 41 azithromycin- and 44 penicillin V-treated patients. Cure or improvement was seen in 98% and 100% of azithromycin- and penicillin V-treated patients, respectively. At day 11, bacterial eradication was achieved in 39/41 (95%) azithromycin-treated patients, 38 (93%) of whom were considered clinically cured, while one patient (2%) relapsed. In the penicillin V group, 42/44 (95%) had GABHS eradicated, with 41 (93%) clinically cured and three patients (7%) improved. The remaining two patients in each group were clinically cured despite persistence of Streptococcus pyogenes. At follow-up evaluation (day 30), re-occurrence was observed in 5/37 (14%) and 3/40 (8%) of azithromycin- and penicillin V-treated patients, respectively all patients were asymptomatic. Both drugs were well-tolerated with only two patients in the azithromycin group complaining of side effects. Treatment related laboratory test abnormalities were observed in 6/47 (13%) and 4/45 (9%) azithromycin- and penicillin V-treated patients, respectively, but none was judged to be clinically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
