Optical immunoassay for rapid detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Should culture be replaced? To evaluate an optical immunoassay rapid antigen test to detect group A beta-hemolytic streptococci directly from throat swab specimens.Criterion standard with "blinded" comparison. Double-swab pharyngeal samples were obtained one swab was cultured and the other was used for the rapid antigen test.Microbiology laboratory in a primary care center at a university teaching hospital.Two hundred sixty-two outpatients with pharyngitis.The results of the optical immunoassay rapid antigen test were compared with results of standard aerobic culture.Sixty-two (24%) of 262 samples were culture-positive 48 of these 62 were positive by the optical immunoassay rapid test (sensitivity, 77%). Of the 200 culture-negative samples, seven (4%) were positive by the rapid test (specificity, 96%).The optical immunoassay performed well, but like other rapid tests, is not sensitive enough to replace standard culture for detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
