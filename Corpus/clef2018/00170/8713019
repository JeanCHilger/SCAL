Immune response to Streptococcus pyogenes and the susceptibility to psoriasis. Monoclonal antibodies directed against type 12 Group A streptococcal cell wall antigens cross-react with nuclei and cytoplasm of cells from skin and synovium from controls, uninvolved skin of psoriatics and psoriatic plaques. Patients with psoriasis had high serum titres of antibody against the M12 (C-region) streptococcal antigen compared to controls. An abnormal immune response directed against a "self' antigen after initiation by Group A streptococcal infection may play an important role in the exacerbation or development of psoriasis.
