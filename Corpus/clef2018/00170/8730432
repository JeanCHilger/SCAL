Regulation of the C3 production by gamma interferon from peripheral blood T cells in patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis. This study assessed the regulatory role of peripheral blood T cells in the C3 production in patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and branoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Peripheral blood T cells from patients at various stages of disease were cultured and the supernatants tested for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) content and the capacity to stimulate C3 production by HuH-7 cells. Supernatants from patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and from convalescent patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis significantly stimulated the C3 production the degree of stimulation correlated with the IFN-gamma content of the supernatants. Similar results were obtained using recombinant IFN-gamma. In both cases, the effect was blocked by the addition of anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody to the cultures. Interleukin 2 and interleukin 6 levels in supernatants from T cell cultures of patients and controls were essentially the same. In summary, IFN-gamma plays a regulatory role in C3 production by human hepatoma cell lines.
