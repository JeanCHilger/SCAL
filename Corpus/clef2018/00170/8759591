Rapid identification of group A streptococcus as the cause of necrotizing fasciitis. Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) causes a spectrum of highly aggressive, invasive infections. We report two cases of necrotizing fasciitis in which GAS was identified as the presumptive causative organism with the use of the standard rapid streptococcal diagnostic kit. We believe the rapid test kits may be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and treatment of this catastrophic illness and may play a role in limiting the spread of infection.
