Use of the rapid streptococcus test in extrapharyngeal sites. The rapid "strep" test is established as a valuable tool for the management of pharyngitis. Because of the recent increase in reports of serious, rapidly progressive streptococcal soft tissue infections, the test can also be useful in determining early management of skin infections. Patients with positive results can be treated immediately with specific therapy, usually with an excellent outcome. As an illustration, use of this technique in 15 patients is described.
