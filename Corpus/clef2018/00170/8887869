Mycotic aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta: the role of transesophageal echocardiography. Mycotic aneurysms of the aorta are prone to rupture. Thus rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential so that surgical repair can be undertaken. We report a case of mycotic aortic aneurysm caused by mitral valve endocarditis. The aneurysm situated at the junction of the thoracoabdominal aorta was readily detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Computed tomography and aortography were complementary to transesophageal echocardiography in establishing the diagnosis. The patient underwent successful repair and acute inflammation of the aneurysm was present at histologic examination.
