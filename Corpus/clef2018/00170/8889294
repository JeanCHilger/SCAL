Measurement of swallowing in patients with sore throats. Swallowing function was measured using a simple timed test in 20 healthy subjects with a sore throat (16 women, median age [range] 27.5 years [19.3-44.5]) and the test was repeated following recovery. All three indices from the test average volume per swallow (ml), average time per swallow (s) and swallowing capacity (mls-1) were significantly improved following recovery (P = 0.0001, 0.041 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no significant change in respiratory function between the two visits. The indices from a timed test of swallowing are sensitive enough to detect changes occurring due to a sore throat the test provides a simple bedside technique for quantifying swallowing and may be useful in measuring the rate of recovery from swallowing problems and in assessing the effect of different treatments on swallowing function.
