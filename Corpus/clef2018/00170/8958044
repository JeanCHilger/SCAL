Opsonic human antibodies from an endemic population specific for a conserved epitope on the M protein of group A streptococci. This study demonstrates the presence of epitope-specific opsonic human antibodies in a population living in an area endemic for group A streptococci (GAS) infection. Antibodies recognizing a conserved C-terminal region epitope (p145, sequence in single letter amino acids: LRRDLDASREAKKQVEKALE) of the M protein of GAS were isolated from human patients by affinity chromatography and were shown to be of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 subclasses. These antibodies could reduce the number of colonies of serotype 5 GAS in an in vitro opsonization assay by 71-92%, compared with an equal amount of IgG from control adult donors living in non-endemic areas and without antibodies to p145. Addition of the peptide, p145, completely inhibited this opsonization. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that p145-specific antibodies were capable of binding to the surface of M5 GAS whereas control IgG did not. Using chimeric peptides, which contain overlapping segments of p145, each 12 amino acids in length, inserted into a known helical peptide derived from the DNA binding protein of yeast, GCN4, we have been able to further define two minimal regions within p145, referred to as pJ2 and pJ7. These peptides, pJ2 and pJ7, were able to inhibit opsonization by p145 specific antibodies. Finally, we have observed an association between the age-related development of immunity to GAS and the acquisition of antibodies to the conserved epitope, p145, raising the possibility of using this epitope as a target in a prophylactic vaccine administered during early childhood.
