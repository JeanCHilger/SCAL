Analysis of human T cell responses to group A streptococci using fractionated Streptococcus pyogenes proteins. Cell extract and spent culture supernatant proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes Manfredo strain (type M5) were each separated to give 22 narrow range molecular weight fractions by blot-elution from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Eluted samples and unfractionated proteins were screened for T cell stimulatory activity using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adults in proliferation assays. Responses were measured in 4- and 7d cultures. Responses to a wide range of cell extract proteins were revealed by fractionation, the degree of response to each fraction varying between donors. Unfractionated culture supernatant proteins elicited proliferative responses by PBMC from all individuals examined. Responses to culture supernatant fractions containing 25-33 kDa proteins could be attributed to known superantigens. Furthermore, samples from culture supernatants containing higher molecular weight fractions (> 45 kDa) elicited responses in 50% of donors in 7d cultures, suggesting that these fractions contained common recall antigens. The efficacy of using electroeluted samples to identify T lymphocyte stimulatory proteins was confirmed by demonstrating that a known superantigen of S. pyogenes Manfredo strain, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SPEC), could be fractionated successfully using this method and its activity recovered. Our results show that human T cell responses to group A streptococci involve a remarkably wide range of both cell-associated and released streptococcal proteins.
