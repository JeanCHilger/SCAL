Strict lymphotropism of Epstein-Barr virus during acute infectious mononucleosis in nonimmunocompromised individuals. Previous investigations of exfoliated oropharyngeal cells from individuals suffering from infectious mononucleosis (IM) suggested that the oropharyngeal epithelia are the primary target and also the site of life-long persistence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This concept was widely accepted. However, the investigation of histological sections with more sensitive EBV detection techniques has drawn this concept into doubt since EBV proved to be constantly absent in normal epithelial cells. To elucidate the discrepancy, throat washings and peripheral mononuclear blood cells from 16 patients suffering from IM were investigated for EBV-DNA and EBV gene products employing highly sensitive in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction. Although all patients exhibited latently infected B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, samples of exfoliated oropharyngeal cells were constantly EBV-negative with the exception of three cases. In these cases, the patients additionally suffered from purulent ulcerating tonsillitis, EBV-infected B cells, but no EBV-infected epithelial cells were detectable. These findings support the view that recirculating lymphocytes of B-cell origin, but not epithelial cells are the initial target of EBV during primary infection and that B cells also represent the site of life-long viral persistence.
