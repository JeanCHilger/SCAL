Strategies for managing group A streptococcal pharyngitis. A survey of board-certified pediatricians. To assess the management strategies and knowledge of board-certified pediatricians regarding group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.Survey of 1000 US pediatricians in 1991, chosen randomly from the membership of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The survey included questions related to 2 clinical scenarios, respondent demographics, and knowledge of streptococcal pharyngitis.Pediatricians who treated patients with pharyngitis. Of the 690 surveys that were returned, 510 pediatricians treated patients with pharyngitis and were included in the data analysis.Data were analyzed using Chi 2 statistics for categorical data and the Student t test for continuous variables.Antigen detection tests (ADTs) were used by 64% of the pediatricians 85% used throat cultures. Strategies for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis were throat culture alone (38%), consider positive ADTs definitive and use throat culture when ADTs are negative (42%), ADT alone (13%), ADT and throat culture for all patients with pharyngitis (5%), and no tests for GABHS performed (2%). Thirty-one percent usually or always treated with antibiotics before test results were available. Only 29% of these "early treaters" always discontinued antibiotics when tests did not confirm the presence of group A streptococci. The drug of choice for treatment was penicillin (73%)Most surveyed board-certified pediatricians managed acute GABHS pharyngitis appropriately, but 15% to 20% used diagnostic or treatment strategies that are not recommended. There was lack of a consensus about the management of recurrent GABHS pharyngitis and chronic carriage of GABHS.
