Hypervariability generated by natural selection in an extracellular complement-inhibiting protein of serotype M1 strains of group A Streptococcus. In many countries, M1 strains of the human pathogenic bacterium group A Streptococcus are the most common serotype recovered from patients with invasive disease episodes. Strains of this serotype express an extracellular protein that inhibits complement [streptococcal inhibitor of complement (Sic)] and is therefore believed to be a virulence factor. Comparative sequence analysis of the 915-bp sic gene in 165 M1 organisms recovered from diverse localities and infection types identified 62 alleles. Inasmuch as multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis previously showed that most M1 organisms represent a distinct streptococcal clone, the extent of sic gene polymorphism was unexpected. The level of polymorphism greatly exceeds that recorded for all other genes examined in serotype M1 strains. All insertions and deletions are in frame, and virtually all nucleotide substitutions alter the amino acid sequence of the Sic protein. These molecular features indicate that structural change in Sic is mediated by natural selection. Study of 70 strains recovered from two temporally distinct epidemics of streptococcal infections in the former East Germany found little sharing of Sic variants among strains recovered in the different time periods. Taken together, the data indicate that sic is a uniquely variable gene and provide insight into a potential molecular mechanism contributing to fluctuations in streptococcal disease frequency and severity.
