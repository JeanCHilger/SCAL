Seroprevalence of antibodies to group B streptococcal polysaccharides in Gambian mothers and their newborns. In developing countries, little is known about the relationship between group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization in pregnant women and serum antibody levels to capsular polysaccharide antigens of these organisms. This study examined the prevalence of antibodies to two polysaccharides of GBS, Ia and III, in 124 Gambian women with known GBS colonization at delivery and their newborns. Mean antibody levels in maternal-cord serum pairs were 4.06 +/- 0.25 micrograms/mL and 2.64 +/- 0.20 micrograms/mL for type Ia GBS, and 1.1 +/- 0.52 microgram/mL and 0.78 +/- 0.43 microgram/mL for type III GBS. Women colonized with type V GBS had significantly higher antibody levels to type III GBS than did noncolonized women, but no difference was found when these groups were compared for antibody levels to type Ia GBS. Women > or = 20 years had significantly higher antibody levels to type III GBS compared with younger women and those colonized by other GBS serotypes. Maternal antibodies to types la and III GBS were transferred across the placenta to newborns. The rarity of GBS disease in Gambia and other developing countries may be due to the prevalence of maternally derived GBS antibodies, the low prevalence of colonization with serotype III strains, or other undefined factors.
