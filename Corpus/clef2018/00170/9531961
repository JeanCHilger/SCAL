Estimation of type-specific anti-streptococcal M-protein antibodies with biotinylated peptides in human sera. The design of a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the estimation of antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the M-protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is described. The ELISA employs biotinylated peptide antigens of the types 1, 4, 12 and 19 immobilized by (strept-)avidin on the surface of polystyrene microtiter wells. In rabbit hyperimmune sera and in human serum samples, antibodies against the corresponding serotype could be detected with high sensitivity and specificity.
