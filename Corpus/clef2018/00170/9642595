Diagnosis of infectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery by polymerase chain reaction. To ascertain whether the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique leads to more rapid diagnosis of infectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.University Eye Clinic Regensburg, Germany.The aqueous humor and vitreous of 16 eyes with infectious endophthalmitis (10 acute, 6 delayed) were evaluated by microscopy, diagnostic culture, and PCR to detect the infectious agent.Microscopy of the vitreous was positive in 3 eyes and the culture media results were positive in 7 eyes, all with acute endophthalmitis. Significantly fewer positive results were obtained in the aqueous humor. Using PCR, an infectious agent was detected in the aqueous humor of all 16 eyes and in the vitreous of 14. The vitreous sample was negative in 2 eyes with delayed endophthalmitis.Detection of the infectious agent was more successful using PCR than using conventional microbiological tests, especially in the diagnosis of delayed endophthalmitis where the pathogen was detected in the aqueous humor in all eyes.
