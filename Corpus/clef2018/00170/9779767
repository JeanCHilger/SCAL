Recurrent group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. To examine the epidemiology and treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) recurrent tonsillopharyngitis in private pediatric practice.This was a retrospective chart review study covering the time span 1975 to 1996 involving 2140 GABHS episodes. Diagnosis was based on acute clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmation (throat culture or positive rapid antigen detection test) of GABHS.Eighty percent (n=1721) of the episodes evaluated were treated with penicillin or amoxicillin 352 (20.5%) of these were followed by a recurrence within 30 days and 519 (30.2%) within 60 days. GABHS recurrences within 30 days after penicillin/amoxicillin treatment rose from 9% in 1975 to 1979 to 25.9% in 1980 to 1984, 24.2% in 1985 to 1989, 22.4% in 1990 to 1994 and 25.9% in 1995 to 1996 (P < 0.02)Recurrent GABHS infections occur more frequently in the 1990s than the 1970s, occur more frequently in children younger than 8 years of age than in adolescents and occur more frequently after penicillin treatment than with alternative antibiotic therapy.
