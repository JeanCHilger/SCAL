"Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome". Since the mid-1980s increasing numbers of severe group A streptococcal infections (Streptococcus pyogenes) have been reported worldwide. Younger, healthy patients after minor local trauma are most commonly afflicted. The infection is characterized by a rapid course with shock, sepsis, multiorgan failure, soft-tissue infection and a high mortality rate. This special disease has been termed "streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome". The M-proteins, especially types 1 and 3, and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (speA) might play an important role in the pathogenesis of the infection. High dose therapy with antibiotics, monitoring in the intensive care unit and early, aggressive and often multiple debridement of necrotic soft tissue are necessary to save the patient's life.
