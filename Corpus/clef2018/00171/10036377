The rapid method in microbiology using chemical method and immunochemical method. In recent years, biochemical and immunochemical procedures used for rapid diagnosis of microbiology have advanced. In particular, methods using immunochemical procedure are commonly used. Latex agglutination test, enzyme immunoassay and immunochromatographic methods having more simple and high sensitivity have also been used. These methods are routinely used to detect Helicobacter pylori, Group A Streptococcus and others. Furthermore, in routine examinations, endotoxin and (1two head right arrow3)-beta-D-glucan have been measured as markers that detect gram-negative bacteria and deep fungus. Currently, there are many infections including new and previous infections. These techniques should be applied for detecting a larger number of microbiology.
