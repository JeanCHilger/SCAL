Analysis of serum antibodies to alpha-streptococci in patients with tonsil-related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris. To determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (Str. sanguis, Str. salivarius and Str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (Str. pyogenes T12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP), we measured serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of Streptococcus (Str.) sanguis, Str. salivarius, Str. mitis or Str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serum IgG antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, Str. sanguis and Str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with PPP (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT: n = 25) and in healthy adults (n = 17). Serum antibody IgG level to Str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. The IgA antibody levels against any Streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. The IgM antibody levels to Str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with RT than in patients with PPP. In western blot analysis, the serum IgG antibodies against 25-27 kDa protein from whole cell body of Str. sanguis, Str. salivarius and Str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with PPP than in healthy adults. However, the western blot profile in Str. pyogenes was not different between PPP and healthy adults. No significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of IgM or IgM antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. These data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related PPP and the 25-27 kDa protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic abnormality.
