Group A streptococcal vaccines. The pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections, and antigens that contribute to protective immune responses are reviewed. Several approaches to vaccine development are discussed. Data are provided from preclinical studies of multivalent M protein-based vaccines that evoke protective antibodies in laboratory animals. Also discussed are future strategies for the development of broadly protective vaccines, and their potential impact on the incidence of streptococcal infections, and acute rheumatic fever.
