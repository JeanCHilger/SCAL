Evaluation of the Strep B OIA test compared to standard culture methods for detection of group B streptococci. This study evaluated the accuracy of the commercial product Strep B OIA (optical immunoassay) compared to the standard agar and broth culture methods for detecting vaginal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS).Preoperative vaginal cultures were obtained from 141 nonpregnant gynecological patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery. Major gynecologic surgery was defined as benign gynecologic, gyne-oncology, and urogynecologic procedures. The results of the Strep B OIA test were compared to the results obtained from SXT agar (selective for GBS), colistin-nalidixic acid ((CNA) agar, and Todd-Hewitt broth cultures.The prevalence of vaginal GBS colonization in this population was 20.6%. The sample sensitivity and specificity of the OIA method were 58.6% and 85.7%, respectively. These values are lower than the sensitivity and specificity of 85.4% and 91.5%, respectively, given in the OIA package insert. Although the sample negative predictive value was fairly high (88.9%), the positive predictive value was low (51.5%).Although a previous study stated that the product Strep B OIA reduces the time required to obtain results (30 minutes versus days) and can, therefore, function as a useful diagnostic tool in the management of early-onset GBS disease, the present study's finding of low sensitivity and low positive predictive value indicates that this test may have very limited clinical value.
