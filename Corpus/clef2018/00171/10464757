Laboratory diagnosis of changes in regulation of the immune system. To evaluate the body's immunity, to diagnose immunodeficiencies is a pressing problem. The paper discusses whether a complex approach can be used to evaluate immunity objectively. The data on humoral and cellular immunity in patients with varying responses to the changes occurring in the body are analyzed. The changes in cellular and humoral immunity were studied by enzyme immunoassay of hormones and antibodies in combination with immunomorphological assay of lymphocytic subpopulations.
