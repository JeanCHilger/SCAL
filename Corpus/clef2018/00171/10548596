Relative avidities of human immunoglobulin G antibodies for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and B. In this pilot study, we investigated the relative avidities for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPE-A) and SPE-B of antibodies in sera from patients with fatal streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome and from healthy individuals and in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations. We observed a great variation in the relative avidities of patient, control, and IVIG immunoglobulin G (IgG) (values estimated to be between 10(-7) and 10(-11) M), with mean values for patient IgG about 10-fold lower than those of control IgG.
