Importance of inoculum size and sampling effect in rapid antigen detection for diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Current recommendations suggest that negative rapid Streptococcus pyogenes antigen tests be backed up with a culture, reflecting evidence that culture may have a higher sensitivity and also that testing of a second swab may yield a different (i.e., a positive) result because of variation in sample size or distribution. If the latter is common, the sensitivities of current antigen detection tests might be improved by simply increasing the amount of sample tested. The present study assessed the effect of antigen testing of two swabs extracted together compared to independent testing of each swab extracted separately for children with clinical pharyngitis. S. pyogenes grew from one or both swabs for 198 (37%) of 537 children. The combined culture was significantly (P < 0.05) more sensitive than culture of either swab alone. Compared to combined culture, antigen testing of two swabs extracted and tested together was significantly more sensitive than two single swab extractions (94.1 versus 80% P = 0.03)
