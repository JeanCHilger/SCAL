Epidemiological analysis of non-M-typeable group A Streptococcus isolates from a Thai population in northern Thailand. Infection with group A streptococci (GAS) can lead to the development of severe postinfectious sequelae such as rheumatic fever (RF). In Thailand, RF and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remain important health problems. More than 80% of GAS circulating in this population are non-M antigen typeable by conventional M serotyping methods. In this study, we determine the M protein sequence types of GAS isolates found in northern Thailand. The emm genes from 53 GAS isolates, collected between 1985 and 1995 from individuals with pharyngitis, impetigo, acute RF (ARF), RHD, or meningitis as well as from individuals without infections, were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Thirteen new sequence types that did not show homology to previously published sequences were characterized. Six of these sequence types could be isolated from both skin and throat sites of impetigo and pharyngitis/ARF patients, respectively. In many cases we could not specifically differentiate skin strains or throat strains that could be associated with ARF or acute glomerulonephritis. Antigenic variations in the emm gene of the isolates investigated, compared to published M protein sequences, were predominantly due to point mutations, small deletions, and insertions in the hypervariable region. One group of isolates with homology to M44 exhibited corrected frameshift mutations. A new M type isolated from an RHD patient exhibited nucleotide sequence corresponding to the N terminus of M58 and the C terminus of M25, suggesting that recombination between the two types may have occurred. This study provided epidemiological data relating to GAS endemic to northern Thailand which could be useful for identification of vaccine candidates in a specific region of endemicity.
