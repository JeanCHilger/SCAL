The differentiation of classic Kawasaki disease, atypical Kawasaki disease, and acute adenoviral infection: use of clinical features and a rapid direct fluorescent antigen test. To compare the clinical and laboratory features of children with Kawasaki disease with those with acute adenoviral infection, which may mimic Kawasaki disease.We retrospectively compared the medical records of children with Kawasaki disease and atypical Kawasaki disease with those of children with acute adenoviral infection. All children included were initially evaluated because their primary care physicians were concerned that they might have Kawasaki disease. The utility of a rapid direct fluorescent antigen test for adenovirus was evaluated. Thirty-six children with Kawasaki disease (23 with classic and 13 with atypical presentations) and 7 patients with acute adenoviral infection were studied.A tertiary care pediatric hospital.Children with Kawasaki disease were more likely to have conjunctivitis (36 of 36 vs 4 of 7), strawberry) tongues (23 of 36 vs 1 of 7), perineal peeling (19 of 36 vs 0 of 7), and distal extremity changes (22 of 36 vs 0 of 7) than those with acute adenoviral infection. Children with acute adenoviral infection were more likely to have purulent conjunctivitis (3 of 7 vs 1 of 36) and exudative pharyngitis (3 of 7 vs 1 of 35). In addition to pyuria (13 of 26 vs 0 of 6), patients with Kawasaki disease had higher mean white blood cell counts (15.3 +/- 3.5 vs 11.5 +/- 6.0 x 10(9)/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rates (56 vs 42 mm/h), platelet counts (426 vs 259 x 10(9)/L), and levels of alanine aminotransferase (101 vs 18 U/L) than those with acute adenoviral infection. Children with Kawasaki disease had lower mean albumin levels (32 vs 36 g/L). A rapid antigen test for adenovirus had a specificity and sensitivity of 100% compared with viral culture.Kawasaki disease and acute adenoviral infection can present with many of the same clinical characteristics. A rapid direct fluorescent antigen assay for adenovirus may be a helpful adjunctive test for distinguishing acute adenoviral infection from Kawasaki disease.
