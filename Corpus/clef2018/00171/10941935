Sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of bacterial superantigens and antibodies against them in human plasma. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the quantitation of bacterial superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B and C, toxic-shock syndrome toxin-1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, were developed. The assays had sensitivity to quantitate these toxins to 1.4, 5.9, 16.3, 2.5 and 4.3 pg/ml, respectively, in a buffer including 50% human plasma. It takes only 150 min to complete the assays after plate preparation. Specificity of the assays agreed with those of reverse latex agglutination assay. We also developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect antibodies against these five superantigens. The assays are expected to be significant tools for the study of superantigens in several diseases.
