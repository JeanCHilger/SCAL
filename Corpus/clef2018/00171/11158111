Unusual occurrence of M type 77, antibiotic-resistant group A streptococci in southern Sweden. For many years group A streptococci of T type 28 (T28) have been common in southern Sweden however, since 1995 resistance to both macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics and tetracycline was observed among T28 isolates, which prompted the present studies on clonal relatedness of antibiotic-resistant T28 strains. By extended T typing, 95 of 100 examined tetracycline-resistant strains showed the combination T9-T13-T28
