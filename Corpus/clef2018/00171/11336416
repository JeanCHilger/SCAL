Are follow-up throat cultures necessary when rapid antigen detection tests are negative for group A streptococci? The frequency of obtaining false-negative Group A Streptococcal (GAS) rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests utilizing currently available kits in a private practice setting and the cost effectiveness of requiring follow-up throat cultures were studied. Laboratory records of the Elmwood Pediatric Group (EPG), Rochester, NY, were retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients with pharyngeal RAD tests for GAS performed from January 1996 through May 1999. From January 1996 through October 1997 (study period 1), EPG physicians used either a RAD test or a throat culture to identify GAS from November 1997 through May 1999 (study period 2), RAD tests were used as the primary test on all patients. Rapid antigen detection test negative results were confirmed with culture. During the 3-year study 11,427 RAD tests were performed. 8,385 (73.4%) were negative and 3,042 (26.6%) were positive. In study period 1, 3,547 (73.2%) were negative and 1,299 (26.8%) were positive
