Induction of autoimmune valvular heart disease by recombinant streptococcal m protein. Rheumatic heart disease is an autoimmune sequela of group A streptococcal infection. Previous studies have established that streptococcal M protein is structurally and immunologically similar to cardiac myosin, a well-known mediator of inflammatory heart disease. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that streptococcal M protein could produce inflammatory valvular heart lesions similar to those seen in rheumatic fever (RF). Fifty percent (3 of 6) of Lewis rats immunized with recombinant type 6 streptococcal M protein (rM6) developed valvulitis as well as focal lesions of myocarditis. Valvular lesions initiated at the valve surface endothelium spread into the valve. Anitschkow cells and verruca-like lesions were present. T cells from rM6-immunized rats proliferated in the presence of purified cardiac myosin, but not skeletal myosin. A T-cell line produced from rM6-treated rats proliferated in the presence of cardiac myosin and rM6 protein. The study demonstrates that the Lewis rat is a model of valvular heart disease and that streptococcal M protein can induce an autoimmune cell-mediated immune attack on the heart valve in an animal model. The data support the hypothesis that a bacterial antigen can break immune tolerance in vivo, an important concept in autoimmunity.
