Non-M protein(s) on the cell wall and membrane of group A streptococci induce(s) IFN-gamma production by dermal CD4+ T cells in psoriasis. Recently we have demonstrated that a disease-specific subpopulation of CD4+ T cells isolated from skin lesions of chronic plaque psoriasis produces interferon-gamma in response to group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens. To determine if these T cells recognize M or non-M protein, extracts from cell wall of type M6 GAS (M6W) and its isogenic M gene deletion mutant (M-W), M6 membrane extract (M6M) and recombinant M6 protein (rM6) were used to stimulate GAS-reactive T-cell lines from nine patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. T-cell lines were incubated with or without streptococcal extracts for 18 h in the presence of a transport inhibitor, stained for surface CD4 and intracellular cytokine expression, and analysed by flow cytometry. Variable numbers (0.2-34%) of CD4+ T cells produced interferon-gamma, in all but one of the T-cell lines tested, in response to M6W, M-W and M6M extracts. No significant difference between the response to M6W and M-W extracts was detected. In addition, rM6 protein failed to increase CD4+/interferon-gamma+ T-cell numbers in seven of nine T-cell lines compared to medium alone. For the group, there was a highly significant correlation between the responses to the three extracts (M6W vs M-W, P = 0.0005 M6W vs M6M, P = 0.0003
