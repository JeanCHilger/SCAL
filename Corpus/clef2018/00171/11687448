Antibodies against Streptococcus agalactiae proteins c(alpha) and R4 in sera from pregnant women from Norway and Zimbabwe. Group B streptococci (GBS) express strain-variable and surface-localized proteins, which are important serotype markers and targets of protective antibodies. These include the c(alpha) and R4 proteins, one or the other of which is expressed by approximately 75% of clinical GBS isolates. These proteins have been considered vaccine candidates. In this study, the c(alpha) and R4 proteins were extracted by trypsin digestion of GBS and purified by sequential precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and ammonium sulfate followed by gel filtration chromatography. The proteins were used as antigens in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the levels of c(alpha)- and R4-reactive antibodies in sera from pregnant women from Norway (n = 100) and from Zimbabwe (n = 124). Antibody levels in the Norwegian group of women were significantly higher than in the Zimbabwean group, and a higher proportion of the Norwegian women contained appreciable levels of antibodies against both proteins. The antibodies traversed the placental barrier. With individual sera, a significant correlation between the anti-c(alpha) and anti-R4 antibody levels was observed and each of the two protein antigens effectively competed for human serum antibodies both against itself and against the other antigen. Inhibition ELISA results demonstrated specificity for each of the proteins of immune antibodies raised in rabbits. These results demonstrate that (i) the majority of women of childbearing age have antibodies against c(alpha) and R4, (ii) the levels of these antibodies differ among pregnant women in different parts of the world, and (iii) the normal human serum antibodies may target a common c(alpha) and R4 protein site, whereas immune antibodies targeted a different site(s) specific for each protein.
