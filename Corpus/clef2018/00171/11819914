Inflammation and acute pharyngo-tonsillitis. 1.Despite several studies, it has been impossible to establish a correlation between bacteriological and clinical findings in erythematous pultaceous sore throat. 2.Antibiotics should be prescribed for group A streptococcal sore throat alone. 3.In acute tonsilitis, inflammation is perfectly proportional to infection 4.Their extremely important role in the pathogenesis of different inflammatory processes has been demonstrated in acute tonsilitis. 5.Based on the fact that no clinical argument can confirm or infirm the streptococcal cause, it is recommended to use a rapid diagnostic test in all adults or children with sore throat. 6.No data are available demonstrating the benefit of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs at antiinflammatory doses or of general corticosteroid treatment of acute sore throat. Nevertheless, in non-A hemolytic streptococcal where antibiotic treatment is not indicated, wouldn't it be useful to prescribe symptomatic antiinflammatory treatment?
