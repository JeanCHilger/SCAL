Chromosomal analysis of group B streptococcal clinical strains bac gene-positive strains are genetically homogenous. A collection of 45 epidemiologically unrelated Streptococcus agalactiae strains (group B Streptococcus, GBS), belonging to different serotypes, isolated from pregnant women in China and Russia was studied. Strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) employing hybridization with nine genes potentially involved in virulence. Molecular sizes of GBS genomes varied from 2030 to 2290 kb. Location of the genes under study bac, bca, glnA, scpB, cyl, hylB, lmb, scaA and cfb on the GBS genomes was found to be conserved irrelevant to the serotype. Potential virulence genes scpB, hylB, lmb were located on a 91-kb SmaI fragment that is equal to 4.5% of total genome. Ribotyping of the strains under study revealed three different HindIII, nine EcoRI and 12 PvuII ribotypes among 45 strains. A strong correlation between the PvuII ribotype and the presence of the bac gene was observed, with 21 of 22 bac-positive strains belonging to the same PvuII ribotype P1. PFGE patterns of bac-positive strains were also similar. The possibility of close genetic relatedness of all bac-positive strains is discussed.
