Superantigens of Group A Streptococcus. In this review the superantigens (SAG) of group A Streptococcus, mainly pyrogenic toxins, and the coding genes are characterized. Specific sites on the molecules of the main histocompatibility complex, class II, and T-receptors, interacting with SAG, are described. This interaction results in hyperproduction of cytokines posing a systemic influence and leading to severe consequences. The data on the state of protective immunity in SAG-associated diseases and some approaches to their treatment are given.
