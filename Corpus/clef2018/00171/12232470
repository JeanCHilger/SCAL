Effect of tonsillectomy on serum concentrations of interleukins and TNF-alpha in patients with chronic tonsillitis. We investigated serum interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in 17 children aged 5-12 years (mean 7) with chronic tonsillitis before and after tonsillectomy. Cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were significantly higher than the control levels (p < 0.05) in preoperative serum samples. Other cytokine levels were within normal limits. After tonsillectomy, IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). It is suggested that IL-1beta and IL-6 may be mediators which have a role in chronic tonsillitis disease and that tonsillectomy has a significant effect on preoperative IL-1beta and IL-6 serum levels.
