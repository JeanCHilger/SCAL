Report of 2 cases of tuberculous retoropharygeal abscess in adults. We report 2 cases of tuberculous retoropharyngeal abscess. Case 1 was a 21-year-old man with tuberculous cervical spondylitis and pulmonary tuberculosis and Case 2 was a 32-year-old woman with tuberculous lymph adenitis and military tuberculosis. Both reported sore throat and dysphagea. In case 1, throat examination showed a bulging abscess at the posterior wall of the pharynx. X-ray examination of the neck showed a massive soft tissue swelling on the lateral view. As soon as the diagnosis was established, prompt focal aspiration was done since the increasing danger of grave respiratory distress was expected. And moreover, surgical incision and drainage of retropharyngeal abscess were indicated. In case 2, intraoral midline incision through the posterior wall of the pharynx was administered because the abscess was small and limited. Though various tuberculous statics and antibiotics are available, tuberculous retropharyngeal abscess still occurs and should be considered to ensure rapid adequate attention to diagnosis and treatment.
