Streptococcus suis infection: clinical features and diagnostic pitfalls. Eight cases of Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection between 1993-1999 were retrospectively studied. There were 6 cases of meningitis and 2 cases of endocarditis. Acute meningitis with early sensorineural hearing loss was the characteristic feature and the most common presentation of S. suis infection. S. suis endocarditis is a rare presentation in Thailand. This organism was often mistaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus viridans. In this study, this was true in five cases in whom S. suis was identified later. However, the rapid diagnosis of S. suis meningitis may rely on Gram stain of the CSF in the setting of acute meningitis with hearing loss. These cases were treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin with a mean duration of 4 weeks. This treatment was very effective and there was no relapse among these patients.
