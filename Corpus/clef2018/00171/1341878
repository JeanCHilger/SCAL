Recurrent tonsillitis. The role of Chlamydia and Mycoplasma. The core tissue microflora of 40 patients who underwent tonsillectomies were examined with cultures, DNA probe tests, enzyme immunoassays, and direct immunofluorescence antibody tests for Chlamydia and Mycoplasma. We believe this is the largest and most accurate prospective study that has examined the role of Chlamydia and Mycoplasma in the core tonsil tissue of patients with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis. The data strongly indicate that, unlike acute tonsillopharyngitis, Chlamydia and Mycoplasma are not involved in recurrent or chronic tonsillitis.
