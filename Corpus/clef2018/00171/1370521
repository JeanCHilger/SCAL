Epitopes of group A streptococcal M protein that evoke cross-protective local immune responses. The present studies were undertaken to identify conserved epitopes of group A streptococcal M proteins that evoke cross-protective mucosal immune responses. Two synthetic peptides copying conserved regions of type 5 M protein, designated SM5(235-264)C and SM5(265-291)C, were covalently linked to carrier molecules and their immunogenicity was tested in laboratory animals. Rabbit antisera against both peptides cross-reacted with multiple serotypes of group A streptococci, indicating that the peptides contained broadly cross-reactive, surface exposed M protein epitopes. Serum antipeptide antibodies adsorbed to the surface of heterologous type 24 streptococci passively protected mice against intranasal challenge infections. Mice that were actively immunized intranasally with each synthetic peptide covalently linked to the B subunit of cholera toxin were protected against colonization and death after intranasal challenge infections with type 24 streptococci in the absence of serum opsonic antibodies. These data confirm and extend previous observations that conserved M protein epitopes evoke cross-protective local immunity and may serve as the basis for broadly cross-protective M protein vaccines.
