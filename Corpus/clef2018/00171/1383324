Conserved T and B cell epitopes on the M protein of group A streptococci. Induction of bactericidal antibodies. To identify conserved T and B cell epitopes on the M protein of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, overlapping synthetic peptides that span the conserved carboxyl-terminal segment of the M-5 protein were constructed and used to immunize a panel of H-2 congenic mice. Proliferative T cell epitopes were identified and, in many cases, mice immunized with these peptides produced high titer antibodies to the same peptides indicating that these proliferative epitopes could also stimulate Th cells. Peptide-specific T cells and antisera were tested for their reactivity with porcine myosin, tropomyosin, human heart myosin synthetic peptides, and extracts of human pericardial and atrial heart tissue. Although there was minimal response of M peptide-specific T cells to any of these Ag, certain M peptide-specific antisera reacted to immunoblotted porcine myosin and to an immunoblotted extract of human atrial heart tissue. However, two conserved peptides, LRRDLDASREAKKQVEKALE and KLTEKEKAELQAKLEAEAKA, stimulated peptide-specific antibodies in B10.BR and B10.D2 mice respectively, which reacted minimally if at all with human atrial heart tissue extract. Furthermore, antisera to the former peptide, in a bactericidal assay involving human monocytes, could mediate killing of streptococci (82% of bacteria). Although this level of killing is less than that produced by antisera to the highly polymorphic type-specific aminoterminus (up to 100% killing), it provides evidence that conserved epitopes can be the targets of bactericidal antibodies. These conserved epitopes may be useful in a vaccine because they also stimulate T cells, thus allowing development of immunologic memory and natural boosting of an immune response after natural exposure.
