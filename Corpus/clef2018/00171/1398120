Protein V, a novel type-II IgG receptor from Streptococcus sp.: sequence, homologies and putative Fc-binding site. We have cloned and sequenced the Fc-receptor-encoding gene, fcrV, from a group G streptococcus. Considerable similarity was revealed between the FcRV, FcRA76 and M proteins of group A streptococci in their signal sequences and 3' termini, and between the Fc-binding regions of FcRV and FcRA76. The promoter and terminator regions showed no homology with those of the fcrA76 and M protein-encoding genes. The A1-A4 domains of FcrV (protein V) exhibit a heptapeptide repeat motif which is characteristic of alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins. The sequence, Ser-Asn-Arg-Ala-Ala, in the outer position, 'f' of each domain is highly conserved and may be involved in FcR-IgG interactions.
