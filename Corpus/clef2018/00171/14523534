Reliability and general practice value of 2 rapid Streptococcus A tests. Rapid streptococcal-A-antigen detection assays have good specificity (over 90 percent) but moderate sensitivity (between 80 and 90 percent), when the tests are compared with a standard throat culture. Contradictory results have been found for one of the more recent tests, the optical immune assay Strep A OIA MAX, while for 6 years, we have been using the immune assay Strep A Plus. Results of the optical immunoassay and the conventional immune assay Strep A Plus were compared in 65 patients with acute pharyngitis. A standard culture was used as reference and confirmed by enhanced broth culturing and nucleic acid hybridization assay (Gen-Probe) when the two detection assays produced contradictory results. While both assays were equally sensitive (78.3%), Strep A OIA MAX and Strep A Plus had a similar specificity of 95.2% and 100%, respectively. Four and nine steps were required for Strep A Plus and for Strep A OIA MAX test procedures, respectively with results being available in 4-5 min and in 9-10 min, respectively. We conclude that both rapid immunoassays have a similar reliability while the handling of the Strep A Plus is much simpler than the handling of the Strep A OIA MAX. Neither rapid immunoassays are sensitive enough to eliminate the need for backup cultures.
