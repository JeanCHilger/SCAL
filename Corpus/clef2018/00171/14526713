Efficacy of extract of Pelargonium sidoides in children with acute non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical trial data suggest that antibiotics are not indicated for the treatment of acute non-group A beta hemolytic strep (non-GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis. Nevertheless patients are symptomatic and effective alternatives for its treatment are needed that have been evaluated in clinical trials.To confirm that treatment with an extract of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs 7630) is superior to placebo for the treatment of non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Six study sites in 4 pediatric and ENT primary care outpatient clinics.One hundred forty-three children aged 6-10 years with non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis present < or = 48 h, a negative rapid strep screen, a Tonsillopharyngitis Severity Score (TSS) > or = 8 points, and informed consent.EPs 7630 or placebo (20 drops tid) for 6 days.The primary outcome criterion was the decrease of the TSS from baseline (day 0) to day 4.The decrease of the TSS from baseline (day 0) to day 4 was 7.1 +/- 2.1 points under EPs 7630 (n = 73), and 2.5 +/- 3.6 points under placebo (n = 70). The covariate adjusted decrease was 7.0 +/- 2.4 points under EPs 7630, and 2.9 +/- 2.4 points under placebo. The 95% RCI for the difference between the groups was [2.7 4.9] demonstrating a significant difference in efficacy of EPs 7630 compared to placebo (P < 0.0001). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 15/143 patients (EPs 7630: 4/73 patient, placebo: 44/70) and were not related to the investigational medication.EPs 7630 was superior compared to placebo for the treatment of acute non-GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children. Treatment with EPs 7630 reduced the severity of symptoms and shortened the duration of illness by at least 2 days.
