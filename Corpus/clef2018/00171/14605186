Infections in international pregnancy study: performance of the optical immunoassay test for detection of group B streptococcus. We evaluated the Strep B optical immunoassay (OIA ThermoBiostar, Inc.) for detecting light and heavy group B streptococcus colonization in 1,306 pregnant women. The women were examined at 20 to 32 weeks gestation and were from six countries. Compared to culture, the sensitivity and specificity of OIA were 13.3 and 98.4%, respectively, for light colonization and 41.5 and 97.7%, respectively, for heavy colonization.
