Prevalence of group B streptococcal colonization in pregnant women and their newborns based on the results of examination of patients in the Obstetric and Gynecology Department of the National Research Institute of Mother and Child--a pilot study. Group B streptococcus is a main cause of perinatal infections and neonatal sepsis. In Poland there is no epidemiological data of the prevalence group B streptococcal colonization in pregnant women and the risk for their newborns.The aim of the study is to define the prevalence of streptococcal B colonization in pregnant women and their newborns.The pregnant women and their newborns from Obstetric and Gynecology Department of National Research Institute of Mother and Child were included to our study during 2001 and 2002 years. Cervical, vaginal and perianal swab were obtained. Women with positive cultures were treated with antibiotic during labor. The external swabs of their neonate were obtained.1678 pregnant women took part in our study. The GBS (streptococcus agalactiae) colonization was found in 331 women. The prevalence of pregnant women group B streptococcal colonization in the study is 19.7%. 70 of 203 neonates form mothers with positive results of our screening, had the GBS colonization confirmed. The prevalence of confirmed streptococcal colonization in neonates was 34.5%. One newborn developed early onset neonatal sepsis, during the study period.The prevalence of pregnant women group B streptococcal colonization about 20%. For the prevention of newborns intrapartum infections a major thing is the prevalence of the transmission risk to newborns from mothers with a GBS colonization and the appropriate intrapartum management.
