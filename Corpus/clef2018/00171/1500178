Group G streptococcal M protein exhibits structural features analogous to those of class I M protein of group A streptococci. We have previously studied a collection of group G streptococcal strains isolated from bacteremic human infections and demonstrated that such strains resist phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes but are type specifically opsonized by homologous antiserum. We have now performed Southern hybridization analysis on genomic DNA from eight blood isolates. All eight isolates showed DNA homology to a group A emm24 gene probe. The M-protein gene of one of the isolates, strain 1750, has now been isolated. This gene (emmG1) encodes a polypeptide of 67 kDa (MG1) which is reactive with antibodies to the partially purified M protein of the parent strain. The predicted amino acid structure of MG1 demonstrates significant identity with the carboxy terminus (C, D, and anchor domains) of M6 and M24 but only limited identity with the amino terminus (variable portion) of these group A M proteins. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA of the eight group G blood isolates with an emmG1 gene probe indicated there were at least four emm alleles associated with these strains. These studies indicate that M proteins of group G streptococci, like those of group A, are genetically heterogeneous. Moreover, MG1 appears to conform to the recently proposed class I structure of M-protein molecules and thus shares certain distinct structural features with the M proteins of well-established rheumatogenic group A streptococcal serotypes. Further comparison of the structures of group G and group A M proteins of throat and skin isolates may cast light on those configurations of the M protein molecules which are and are not critical for the expression of rheumatogenicity.
