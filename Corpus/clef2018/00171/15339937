Membrane retrieval in neutrophils during phagocytosis: inhibition by M protein-expressing S. pyogenes bacteria. During phagocytosis and phagosome maturation, complex membrane traffic events must be coordinated. We have observed, using fluorescent fluid-phase and membrane markers, that in the human neutrophil, internalization of nonopsonized, Gram-positive bacteria, but not of latex beads, is accompanied by a rapid and localized formation of pinosomal structures. This pinocytic response is calcium-dependent but insensitive to actin cytoskeleton disruption and wortmannin treatment. Contrary to what we observe, endosomal structures usually are considered to participate in phagosome formation by providing necessary membrane to forming phagosomes. Instead, our results show a coupling between neutrophil secretory and membrane-retrieval processes during phagosome maturation, and we suggest that the observed, localized pinocytic response is linked to the secretion of azurophilic granules toward nascent phagosomes. Accordingly, M and M-like protein-expressing Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, which are able to survive inside neutrophil phagosomes, inhibit both the secretion of azurophilic granules to phagosomes and pinosome formation.
