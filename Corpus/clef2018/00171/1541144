Adverse effect of chronic tonsillitis on clinical course of sarcoidosis in relation to HLA distribution. We examined the effect of chronic inflammatory foci in the upper respiratory tract and/or HLA class 2 antigens on the clinical course of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis resolved spontaneously in 6 of 27 (22 percent) patients with CTL and in 19 of 29 (66 percent) without CTL (p less than 0.01). The clinical course became favorable after TLT in 7 of 14 cases with CTL. Patients with HLA-DR9 and DRw8 showed the highest ratio of patients who had protracted clinical course those with HLA-DR2, DR5 and DR6 showed the lowest
