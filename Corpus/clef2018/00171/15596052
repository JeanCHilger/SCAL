Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. According the WHO there are about 14,000 new HIV infections a day. However, in a few cases the diagnosis will be made in the acute phase of the disease. Acute HIV infection is the period between infection with the virus and complete seroconversion, defined by a positive Western blot test. This period lasts approximately 30 days and most patients (40-90%) have mild clinical manifestations (fever, rash, pharyngitis, mucosal ulcers, among others) for 2 weeks which, because they are nonspecific, can be confused with other community-acquired infections. Microbiological diagnosis is based on the absence of serum antibodies (negative ELISA test) together with a positive HIV viral load in plasma (> 10,000 copies/ml). Diagnosis of acute HIV infection is important for several reasons: firstly, from the epidemiological point of view, this is the period with the highest rates of HIV transmission and identification of new HIV infections reveals the growth of the epidemic and the transmission rates of resistant HIV strains, which in Spain is about 10% secondly, from the immunopathological point of view, this period provides a unique opportunity to study the virological, immunological and genetic mechanisms that play a role in the transmission and pathogenesis of this disease
