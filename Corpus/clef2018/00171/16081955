Genetic diversity among type emm28 group A Streptococcus strains causing invasive infections and pharyngitis. Genome sequencing of group A Streptococcus (GAS) has revealed that prophages account for the vast majority of gene content differences between strains. Serotype M28 strains are a leading cause of pharyngitis and invasive infections, but little is known about genetic diversity present in natural populations of these organisms. To study this issue, population-based samples of 568 strains from Ontario, Canada Finland
