Close correlation of streptococcal DNase B (sdaB) alleles with emm genotypes in Streptococcus pyogenes. DNase B is a major nuclease and a possible virulence factor in Streptococcus pyogenes. The allelic diversity of streptococcal DNase B (sdaB) gene was investigated in 83 strains with 14 emm genotypes. Of the 15 alleles identified, 11 alleles carried only synonymous nucleotide substitutions. On the other hand, 4 alleles had a non-synonymous substitution other than synonymous substitutions, resulting in the substitution of a single amino acid. The distribution of each allele was generally emm genotype-specific. Only sdaB7 was found in both emm2 and emm4. The promoter region was highly conserved and DNase B protein was similarly expressed in all alleles.
