Evaluation of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus spp. The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel was evaluated for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of various streptococci. A group of 97 consecutive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 24 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 34 viridans streptococci were collected and comparisons made with routine manual methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Overall, in 162 (91%) of 178 isolates, Phoenix identification results demonstrated agreement. For AST results for the 162 isolates that demonstrated identification concordance, the overall essential agreement rate was 98.5% the category agreement was 94.9%
