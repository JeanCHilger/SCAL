Detection of rubella virus-specific polymeric immunoglobulin A by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in combination with streptococcal pretreatment of serum. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay combined with streptococcal treatment of serum was assessed for its ability to detect serum polymeric immunoglobulin A. This technique detects rubella virus-specific polymeric immunoglobulin A antibody, which appears for only a short time after infection, and it is useful for serodiagnosis of recent rubella virus infection.
