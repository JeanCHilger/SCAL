Molecular characterisation and clonal analysis of group A streptococci causing pharyngitis among paediatric patients in Palermo, Italy. Group A streptococci (n = 123), isolated consecutively from paediatric patients with pharyngitis from Palermo, Italy, were analysed. The emm and sof genes were sequenced, the presence of the speA and speC genes was investigated, and the macrolide resistance phenotypes and genotypes were determined. A limited number of emm/sof genotypes was found, and the most prevalent types were different from those found in a previous study from Rome. Macrolide resistance was found in the most prevalent clones, suggesting that the spread of mobile antibiotic resistance genes among the fittest clones in the community was the main mechanism influencing macrolide resistance rates in different emm types.
