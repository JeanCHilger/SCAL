Molecular characterization of clinical isolates of M non-typable group A streptococci from invasive disease cases. Currently there are 93 validated M serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococcus (GAS), and >130 emm genotypes. A marked increase in the number of non-typable GAS isolates (2 % in 2000, 4 % in 2001 and 9 % in 2002) from invasive disease cases referred to the authors' reference laboratory was noted during 2000-2002. A total of 217 (92 %) were from blood cultures, 14 (6 %) from deep abscesses and five (2 %) from aspirates. The clinical manifestations included bacteraemia, septicaemia, cellulitis, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis and toxic-shock syndrome. In order to establish whether this increase was due to the emergence of novel types or the unavailability of M-typing sera, these isolates were subjected to emm sequencing. A total of 144 isolates (61 %) belonged to M types for which sera were no longer available 112 (48 %) belonged to higher M types, including emm83.1 (9 %), emm94 (8 %) emm87 (6 %) and emm89 (6 %)
