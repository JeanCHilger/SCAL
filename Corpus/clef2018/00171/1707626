Intermediate filaments vimentin and desmin share epitopes with M 1 protein of group A streptococci. The cross reactivity of the murine monoclonal antibody PM II 40 against human glomeruli with streptococcal type 1 M protein was investigated. The antibody PM II 40 recognized a protective epitope on a glomerulonephritis-associated M type 1 strain. A 23 kD streptococcal surface protein extracted by limited pepsin digestion reacted with PM II 40 in the Western immunoblot. The aminoterminal sequence of this peptide was identical to the known aminoterminal amino acid sequence of type 1 M protein. Human renal podocytes carry the cross-reactive antigen of the antibody PM II 40 as could be shown by electron microscopy. The podocytes cultured from isolated human glomeruli showed a fibrillar pattern with the antibody in the immunofluorescence test. An anti-vimentin antibody and the antibody PM II 40 recognized the same proteins with molecular weights of 54, 52 and 43 kD of SDS-extracted isolated human glomeruli suggesting that vimentin is the glomerular antigen. The antibody PM II 40 not only react with vimentin but also with desmin suggesting that the recognized epitopes are distinct from that described by Kraus et al. for vimentin and type 1 M protein.
