Variations in the distribution of genes encoding virulence and extracellular proteins in group A streptococcus are largely restricted to 11 genomic loci. Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogen associated with a wide range of human diseases that vary in symptoms and clinical severity. In this report we describe the use of a targeted low density array representing genes encoding classical virulence factors, purported virulence factors and other extracellular proteins to examine differences in the genetic profiles of 68 clinical GAS isolates. Of the 226 genes on the array (encoding 217 virulence factors or putative extracellular proteins and nine positive control house-keeping proteins) 62 had distributions that were statistically associated with specific GAS M-types. While 32 of these genes were bacteriophage related, the remaining 30 have not previously been described as bacteriophage associated. We show that these 'non-bacteriophage related' genes are found in 11 loci located in five greater chromosomal regions, often near classical GAS virulence factors, and often accompanied by genes associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Many of these loci also demonstrated genetic variation within strains of the same M-type, suggesting these regions to be recombinatorial and mutational hotspots. Evidence for acquisition of genes from other species is also apparent in these loci. Our data suggests that imprecise recombination events involving MGEs not only result in acquisition of new genes, but can also result in deletion of flanking chromosomal genes. Thus MGE related events would appear to be the major contributor to variation of discrete virulence loci, which could account for the disease causing propensity of individual strains. We believe that profiling of the 11 loci could be a meaningful tool in epidemiological GAS typing studies.
