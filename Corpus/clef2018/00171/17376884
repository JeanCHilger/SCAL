Multiplex PCR assay for rapid and accurate capsular typing of group B streptococci. We developed a simple, specific, and sensitive two-multiplex-PCR assay that enabled the detection of all known group B streptococcal (GBS) capsular polysaccharides. This test is well adapted for GBS capsular polysaccharide typing in large-scale epidemiological studies.
