Antibody-producing ability of mononuclear cells from human tonsils: a consideration for immunological pathogenesis and operative indication of recurrent tonsillitis. Antibody-production of mononuclear cells from human tonsils was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in the culture system following polyclonal stimulations with pokeweed mitogen. The results were summarized and discussed as follows 1) Age-related changes were not observed. 2) Antibody-producing ability in the intermittent phase of recurrent tonsillitis was significantly impaired. 3) Antibody-production in the recrudescent phase of recurrent tonsillitis was increased and might be reactivated probably by stimuli of the recent infection in vivo. 4) It was suggested that the recurrent tonsillitis was due to the low antibody-production ability of tonsillar mononuclear cells. 5) These results gave an immunological basis on the operative indication of recurrent tonsillitis.
