Screening for glandular fever in patients with Quinsy: is it necessary? Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) is a common emergency seen in otolaryngology practice. These patients are often screened for glandular fever in addition to routine haematological tests. In our unit, we have screened 66 patients with quinsy for glandular fever over a period of 12 months. All these patients were screened for glandular fever by rapid immunoassay. Only one out of 66 patients was tested positive for glandular fever. Due to the extremely low incidence of glandular fever in quinsy patients, we do not see any relevance in screening for glandular fever in quinsy patients. Hence we recommend that routine screening for glandular fever in quinsy patients is an unnecessary invasive investigation for the patients and not cost effective for the hospital.
