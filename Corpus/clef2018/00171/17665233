Molecular characterisation of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from Hungary obtained in 2004 and 2005. Our aim was to characterise by molecular techniques group A streptococci isolated from invasive infections in Hungary in 2004-2005. Twenty-six nonduplicate invasive GAS isolates were selected and examined. The mortality rate proved high (52.3%) for those cases (n = 21) where data were available. Predominant emm types were emm1 (n = 13, 50%) and emm80 (n = 5, 19.2%), but other M types (emm4, emm28, emm66, emm81.1, emm82, emm84) were also identified. Eight different PFGE types were distinguished, and each emm type showed an individual PFGE pattern. Our results show that--similarly to results obtained in several other countries--emm type 1 strains predominate among invasive GAS isolates, and that emm 1 type strains recovered from severe streptococcal infections were associated with the presence of the speA gene. The rate for macrolide resistance proved low: only two isolates showed elevated MICs for erythromycin.
