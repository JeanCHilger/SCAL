Combined administration of serogroup B meningococcal vaccine and conjugated serogroup C meningococcal vaccine is safe and immunogenic in college students. This study evaluated the first use of a combination of the lyophilized components of the conjugated group C vaccine Menjugate reconstituted with the liquid group B outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccine MeNZB. At 6-week intervals, healthy residential students received three doses of MeNZB alone or concomitantly with one dose of Menjugate (MeNZB+MenC). Short-lasting injection-site reactions of mild or moderate intensity were frequent in both groups. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. After three doses, the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal assay (SBA) titres > or = 1:8 against the serogroup B strain NZ98/254 was 82% for MeNZB+MenC and 78% for MeNZB. All subjects in the MeNZB+MenC group achieved SBA titres > or = 1:8 against serogroup strain C11 and 67% in the MeNZB group. All SBA and ELISA responses of the combined vaccine were at least as good as for MeNZB alone. After vaccination, the pharyngeal carriage rate of any meningococcus in the vaccinated group had declined from 40% to 21%.
