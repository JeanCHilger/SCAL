Epidemiology of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections in Germany, 1996-2002: results from a voluntary laboratory surveillance system. A nationwide voluntary laboratory-based surveillance study of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus GAS) infections was conducted in Germany between 1996 and 2002. Demographical and clinical information concerning the patients was obtained from the medical files. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk-factors for fatal outcome. Invasive isolates were obtained from 475 patients, with 251 (52.8%) of the isolates cultured from blood. The most frequent emm types were emm1 (36.4%), emm28 (8.8%) and emm3 (8%). The speA, speC and ssa genes were present at variable frequencies in different emm types. The highest frequencies of speA and speC were found in emm1 (speA, 93.6%) and emm4 (speC, 94.7%), respectively. The estimated annual incidence of invasive GAS disease for 1997-2002 was 0.1 cases/100 000 individuals. This apparently low incidence rate might be explained by the voluntary nature of the surveillance system, resulting in relatively few cases being referred to the laboratory. Complete clinical information was available for 165 cases. The overall case fatality rate was 40.6%, and was highest (65.2%) in the group aged 60-69 years. Shock, an age of >or=30 years and adult respiratory distress syndrome were predictors of a fatal outcome in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Overall, 6.7% of the cases were considered to be nosocomial, and nine cases of puerperal sepsis were observed. The study underscores the importance of invasive S. pyogenes disease in Germany.
