Characterisation of invasive group B streptococci based on investigation of surface proteins and genes encoding surface proteins. The joint distributions of the six genes bca, bac, epsilon/alp1, alp2, alp3 and rib (encoding alpha-C-protein, beta-C-protein, epsilon/Alp1, Alp2, Alp3, and Rib, respectively) and the proteins alpha-C-protein, beta-C-protein and Rib were investigated in invasive isolates of group B streptococcus (GBS). In total, 297 invasive isolates (123 from neonates, 174 from adults) from south-west Sweden were collected during a 13-year period. Genes were detected using multiplex and specific PCRs, and expression of the surface proteins was demonstrated using monoclonal antibodies. The genes studied were found alone or in combinations in 294 (99%) of the invasive isolates. The most common genes were rib (n = 127 isolates, 43%), alp3 (n = 78, 26%) and epsilon/alp1 (n = 42, 14%). The bac gene was never found alone, but was found in combination with one other gene in 36 isolates. The surface proteins studied were detected alone or in combinations in 152 (51%) isolates, with the most common being Rib (n = 80, 27%), alpha-C-protein (n = 68, 23%) and beta-C-protein (n = 24, 8%). Several genes were associated significantly with particular serotypes (e.g., epsilon/alp1 with serotype Ia bca and bac with serotypes Ib and II
