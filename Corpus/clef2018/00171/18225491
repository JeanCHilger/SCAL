T-cell responsiveness to specific group A streptococcus antigens in patients with primary erysipelas. Peripheral blood leukocytic migratory activity (LMA) was studied in 63 patients with primary erysipelas. To reveal LMA, a screening cell migration test (SCMT) was used as an indicator of the cooperation of T- and B-lymphocytes and macrophages in the stimulation with polysaccharide A, surface proteins, L-antigen, hyaluronidase, streptolysin O, a complete S. pyogenes antigen complex after Grasse. The prognostic value of MAL parameters was established at week 1 after the onset of erysipelas. A rapid transition of LMA from the phase of acceleration to that of inhibition was shown to characterize the formation of an adequate response, to correspond to the good course of the disease, and to be followed by the low likelihood of recurrences. The probability of a subsequent recurrence is much higher than that when LMA tends to transit from suppression to acceleration and when LMA parameters are constant in the phase of suppression or acceleration. No transition of LMA to the phase of suppression in early convalescence suggests that the formation of an immune response to streptococcus is delayed.
