Diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome by bedside emergency department ultrasound. Oropharyngeal infections such as pharyngitis and odontogenic abscess are routinely encountered in emergency and primary care medical practice. Lemierre syndrome is a rare but serious complication of such infections. This syndrome is characterized by penetration of the primary infection into the lateral pharyngeal space, suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, and metastatic infections resulting from septic emboli. A combination of clinical suspicion, microbiologic identification of the causative organism, and diagnostic imaging may be required to make the diagnosis. We present a case of Lemierre syndrome that was rapidly diagnosed in the Emergency Department with bedside ultrasound of the internal jugular vein. This case suggests that bedside ultrasound, performed before other radiologic imaging, may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome, which historically has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
