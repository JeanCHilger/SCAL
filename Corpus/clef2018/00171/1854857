Evaluation of the Vitek system in the identification and biotyping of Streptococcus agalactiae. Using the Vitek card for identification of gram-positive agents, 244 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were studied. Twenty five out of these strains were studied during 3 consecutive days. The study also involved 25 pairs of maternal and neonatal strains. The system gave correct identification of only 52 out of 244 strains of S. agalactiae. Due to the low reproducibility of the system it is suggested that the bionumbers used in the codification of a microorganism should be avoided.
