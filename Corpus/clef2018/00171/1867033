The modification of the cell wall proteins in group A streptococci type M 29 under the influence of spermidine contained in the culture medium. The addition of spermidine into growth medium used for the cultivation of group A streptococci, type M 29, leads to changes in the amino acid composition of cell walls and surface proteins isolated by the method of E. H. Beachey et al. The separation of surface proteins into fibrinogen-binding proteins and fibrinogen receptors by affinity chromatography techniques on cellulose with covalently bound fibrinogen indicates that the proportion of these proteins in pepsin extracts obtained from different strains varies. Both spermidine and avirulent strains have similar content of fibrinogen-binding proteins, although these proteins are absent in virulent strains. Different amounts of fibrinogen receptors are extracted from all strains. As shown in the enzyme immunoassay, fibrinogen receptors contain no group-specific polysaccharide A, Fc-receptors and interact with total antiserum to group A streptococci, type M 29 [correction of 28]. Fibrinogen receptors isolated from the strains under study have been found to have similar amino acid composition. On the basis of these results we believe that neither receptor capacity to fibrinogen nor amino acid composition is indicative of the protective properties of protein M.
