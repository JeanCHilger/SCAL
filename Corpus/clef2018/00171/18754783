Superantigen gene profile diversity among clinical group A streptococcal isolates. This study examines the diversity of superantigen gene profiles between and within emm-genotypes of 92 clinical group A streptococcal isolates (30 STSS, 24 sepsis, 25 erysipelas, and 12 tonsillitis) collected in Sweden between 1986 and 2001. The emm-genotype and the distribution of smeZ, speG, speJ, speA, speC, speH, speI, speK/L, speL/M, speM, and ssa genes, and the smeZ allelic variant were determined using PCR and DNA sequencing. Forty-five emm1 isolates revealed 10 superantigen gene profiles. One profile dominated and was identified in 22 isolates collected over 14 years. The results indicate that a selective advantage maintained this genotype in circulation. The superantigen content among the emm1 isolates ranged from three to seven, with smeZ-1, speG, and speA present in all but one profile. The 47 isolates of 27 other emm-genotypes exhibited 29 superantigen gene profiles. Thus, the distribution of superantigen genes was highly variable within isolates regardless of emm-genotype. Two novel emm1 subtypes and 14 novel smeZ allelic variants were identified. The 22 smeZ alleles were generally linked to the emm-genotype. The results of the investigation show that superantigen gene profiling is useful for tracking spread of clones in the community.
