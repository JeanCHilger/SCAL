Postinfectious acute glomerulonephritis. Postinfectious acute glomerulonephritis mostly happens in children aged two to 10 years old. Typically, it follows group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus skin or upper respiratory tract infection. There is a latent period of one to three weeks before nephritic syndrome appears. Microscopic or macroscopic hematuria is always present. Proteinuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate are usually mild. By contrast, salt and water retention can be severe and complicated with hypertension, congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema. Fluid overload must be urgently treated by loop diuretics or renal replacement therapy in the most severe cases.
