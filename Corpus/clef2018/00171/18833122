Epstein-Barr virus infection as etiological and pathogenetic factor of exudative otitis media in childhood. A detailed examination of 40 children with recurrent exudative otitis media (EOM) using enzyme immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction suggested that ENT pathology in the above children (EOM, adenoiditis, tonsillopharyngitis, sinusitis) may be a complication of acute or chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBVI) because primary EBVI infection or its long-term persistence followed secondary immunodeficiency resulting in lymphoid system impairment and damage of upper airway epithelium. This causes a recurrent and persistent course of EOM. Etiotropic and pathogenetically sound treatment of children with recurrent EOM includes antiviral therapy, immunocorrection, rehabilitation with participation of pediatrician, immunologist, infection therapist.
