Distribution of emm type and antibiotic susceptibility of group A streptococci causing invasive and noninvasive disease. To determine the prevalence of macrolide antibiotic and levofloxacin resistance in infections with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus or GAS), strains were collected from 45 medical institutions in various parts of Japan between October 2003 and September 2006.
