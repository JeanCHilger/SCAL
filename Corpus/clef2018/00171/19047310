Corticosteroids suppress in vitro tonsillar proliferation in children with obstructive sleep apnoea. Intranasal corticosteroids (CS) are potentially useful interventions for children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), and may reduce lymphadenoid tissue size in the upper airway. The present authors hypothesised that CS would reduce cellular proliferation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a tonsil/adenoid mixed-cell culture system. Dissociated tonsils or adenoids harvested intra-operatively from children with polysomnographically diagnosed OSA were cultured in control medium (CO) or after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A (STIM), and incubated with dexamethasone (DEX 10(-5)-10(-7) M), fluticasone (FLU
