Evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test for group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus in general practice. to assess the efficacy of Abbott Testpack Strep A compared with throat culture for the diagnosis of group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus in general practice.one hundred and fifty-four specimens were obtained from general practices in selected regions, and were tested for group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus using both Abbott Testpack Strep A and throat culture.sensitivity of the rapid diagnostic test was 79.4%, specificity 93.3%. The negative predictive value of the test was 94.1% the positive predictive value 77.1%.maximum cost effectiveness is achieved, with respect to short term costs and benefits, by diagnosing and treating solely on the basis of Abbott Testpack Strep A results. When possible complications are taken into consideration, initial testing by Abbott Testpack Strep A, followed by confirmatory laboratory testing of negative Testpack results becomes a feasible alternative.
