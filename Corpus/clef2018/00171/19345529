Use of Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) among general practitioner teachers at the Paris Descartes University: 2005-2007. The distribution of the Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) and the National Health Insurance's information campaign should efficiently reduce the unjustified use antibiotic. However, a preliminary survey among GP trainers at the Paris Descartes University indicated that the RADT was seldom used.This study had for aim to describe the RADT use trend among trainers since 2005 and the main obstacles to its widespread use, and to assess the Mac Isaac score use and antibiotic prescriptions.Between February and May 2007, a survey was carried out among 66 GPs who were required to report their first ten patients over three years of age presenting with pharyngitis. RADT use and antibiotic prescriptions were compared with those of the 2005 survey.RADT use had decreased (52.5% [48.2-56.8] versus 57.5% [52.1-68.8], p<0.05). GPs did not use the RADT because they considered it "useless in decision making". Clinical findings were sufficient in most cases. The Mac Isaac score was not widely used by GPs (28.3%) and antibiotic prescription had increased except for macrolides which had decreased (10% vs 15%). Among patients with a negative RADT, 11.9% (vs 10.5% en 2005, p<0.001) were prescribed antibiotics.The RADT use decreased in two years among GP trainers. GPs still prescribe treatment according to clinical findings, most without using diagnostic tools.
