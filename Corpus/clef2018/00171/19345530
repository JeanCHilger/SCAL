Prior use of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs in patients hospitalized for peritonsillar abscess. The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients hospitalized for a peritonsillar abscess over a 1-year period and to evaluate the proportion of patients exposed to anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs before hospitalization.Adult patients hospitalized in the ENT department at the Nantes University Hospital were included in the study during 2006. Data related to prior use of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, microbiology and treatment was analyzed.Thirty-four patients were included in the study, 20 (59%) and 21 (62%) patients had been previously exposed to anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, respectively. Half of the patients had received antibiotics despite the negativity of the rapid screening test. All diagnoses were made on pus examination after aspiration. Tonsillectomy was performed only in two cases. A total of 21 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic and 9 aerobic) were identified. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 8 infections. The most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella.Many patients were exposed to both anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, which did not prevent the peritonsillar abscess.
