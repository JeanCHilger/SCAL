The incidence of Streptococcus Group B in 100 parturient women and the transmission of pathogens to the newborn. Perinatal infections are one of the fundamental causes of early puerperal complications in mothers and neonates. The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of Streptococcus group B (GBS) colonization in parturient women and the rate of pathogen transmission to the newborn.The study group consisted of 100 consecutive parturient women and their newborns. Smear samples for GBS identification were taken from the parturient vagina and from the newborns' nasal cavity. In patients with positive smears, both the mother and the child, a more in-depth analysis was performed, including investigation of the mode of delivery and premature rupture of membranes incidence.GBS colonization was found in 19 parturient women and in 4 newborns in the first 24 hours of their lives. In case of 4 women who gave birth to 4 colonized newborns, two cases of premature rupture of membranes, two vaginal and two caesarean deliveries and one case of symptomatic infection in the mother were found. No symptoms of infection appeared among the four colonized newborns.1. prevalence of GBS colonization appeared in one in five parturient women, 2. in GBS positive women, the risk of transmission to newborns is about 21%, 3. caesarean section and intact membranes do not prevent the transmission of GBS to a newborn.
