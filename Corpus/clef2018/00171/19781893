Use of rapid diagnostic tests of tonsillitis in medical practice. Survey conducted from November 2006 to January 2007 in Pays de la Loire (France). The use of the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and the strategy of management of pharyngitis in medical practice are little known.During the 2006-2007 winter, a survey was conducted in the Pays de la Loire Region to evaluate the use of the RDT. A focus group was also organised.Data were collected from 525 patients (patients who were consulting for a sore throat, angina or patients for whom a RDT was made). RDT were performed on 245 patients (46%). The sixty positive RDT patients systematically received an antibiotic. Twenty negative RDT patients received an antibiotic. More than 75% of GPs considered the RDT useful or very useful.The guidelines for the management of pharyngitis are known but they are partially followed by physicians. Many countries have national guidelines for the management of tonsillitis and they are also not unanimous. When patients had pharyngitis symptoms, the frequency of antibiotic prescription was lower when the RDT was used as recommended by the French Medicines Agency (AFSSAPS). The treatment must be short in order to improve the compliance of outpatients and reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics.A decrease in antibiotics prescription was recorded in the community. It was attributed to the availability of the RDT provided by the CNAMTS (French National Health Service). Moreover, the RDT are still free for practitioners and their reimbursement could be extended to hospital.
