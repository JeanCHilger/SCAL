Rapid detection of Streptococcus agalactiae from swabs by peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization. The applicability of the PNA FISH (peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization) method for detection of Streptococcus agalactiae [group B streptococci (GBS)] from swab samples was evaluated. Three swab-sample-processing protocols with different time-to-result (TTR) values were compared: (i) direct smearing of fresh swabs onto microscope slides (n=153, TTR 2.5 h), (ii) further extraction and concentration of cells from these same swabs (n=153, TTR 2.7 h), and (iii) short-term LIM broth enrichment culture incubation (7 h, 37 degrees C) of fresh swabs (n=120, TTR 9.5 h). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for GBS PNA FISH for sample processing procedures, with TTR values of 2.5, 2.7 and 9.5 h, were 68, 100, 100 and 95 % 91, 100, 100 and 98 %
