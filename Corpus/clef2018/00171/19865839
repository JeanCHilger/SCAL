Streptococcal protective antigens (Spa): a new family of type-specific proteins of group A streptococci. Previous studies in our laboratory described a new group A streptococcal protective antigen (Spa) in type 18 streptococci that was distinct from the type 18 M protein. This study was undertaken to identify additional serotypes of group A streptococci that express Spa proteins. PCR techniques were used to identify and clone a new spa gene from type 36 streptococci. The 5' sequence of spa36 was highly variable compared to spa18, while the 3' sequence was conserved. Antisera against Spa36 opsonized type 36 streptococci but not type 18 streptococci, indicating that the opsonic Spa epitopes were type-specific. Antisera against the conserved carboxy-terminal half of Spa18 were used to identify Spa or Spa-like proteins expressed on the surface of 25 of 70 different serotypes of GAS. Spa proteins may represent a new family of type-specific surface antigens that function in concert with M proteins to elicit protective immune responses.
