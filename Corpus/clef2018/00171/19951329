Methods for screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage. Screening patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage at hospital admission is widely accepted as an essential part of MRSA control programmes. It is assumed, although not proven, that rapid reporting of screening results will improve MRSA control, provided that a clear action plan for positive cases is in place and is being followed. An effective culture screening method is direct inoculation of pooled nose, throat and perineal swabs on a well-performing MRSA-selective chromogenic agar presumptive MRSA colonies can be confirmed rapidly by latex agglutination with antibodies directed against penicillin-binding protein 2a. This method will usually produce a positive result after 24 h of incubation in >95% of true-positive cases, and will be sufficient for most initial treatment and infection control decisions
