Childhood pharyngitis in Sfax (Tunisia): epidemiology and utility of a rapid streptococcal test. The authors studied the epidemiology of pharyngitis in children and evaluated the contribution of a rapid streptococcal test.This prospective study was conducted from June 2007 to May 2008 in a primary health care institution (Policlinique de la Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale) in Tunisia. Clinical findings were recorded throat swabs were performed, and a rapid streptococcal test was made.Five hundred and four children were included in this study. The mean age was 5 years and 8 months. Culture was positive for group A streptococcus in 166 cases (32.9 %). Group A streptococcus was more frequently isolated in children aged 5 to 8 years. There was no difference in clinical features between groups of streptococcal and non-streptococcal pharyngitis. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test were respectively 93.2 and 95.3 %.Pharyngitis was of bacterial origin in one third of cases among these, group A streptococcus was the most frequent bacterium. The rapid test is a quick and reliable tool for the diagnosis of pharyngitis and hence an appropriate treatment.
