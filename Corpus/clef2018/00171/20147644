Two unusual cases of severe soft tissue infection caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. We present two cases of invasive infection caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, one that showed rapidly developing necrotizing fasciitis in a previously healthy man and one that showed severe cellulitis and septic shock even though the bacterium possessed a mutated emm gene, predicted to encode a truncated M protein.
