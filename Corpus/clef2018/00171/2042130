Neonatal conjunctivitis in a nursery and a neonatal unit. After Cred√© prophylaxis was abandoned at our hospital in 1984 scrupulous clinical surveillance of all neonates for conjunctivitis, and bacterial cultures from purulent eye discharge, have become routine. During the two-year period 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1989, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (EIA-technique) was added in all infants with clinical conjunctivitis. During the period concerned there were 332 cases of conjunctivitis among 4,520 live born infants, an incidence of 7.3%. The incidence was higher for infants staying in the nursery (8.2%) than for those admitted to the neonatal unit (3.5%) (p less than 0.01). 90% of the infections were diagnosed during the first week of life. 468 isolates were identified by routine bacteriological investigation, 452 gram-positives (96.6%), and 16 gram-negatives (3.4%). The following strains were found: Staphylococcus aureus 171 (51.5% of the patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis 153 (46.1%), Streptococcus viridans 106 (31.9%), diphteroids 11 (3.3%), beta-hemolytic streptococci seven (2.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae two (0.6%), enterococci two (0.6%), Hemophilus influenzae six (1.8%), Escherichia coli five (1.5%), Proteus two (0.6%) and Branhamella catarrhalis one (0.3%). Not a single case of gonococcal ophthalmia was diagnosed. Positive tests for Chlamydia were found in 13 infants (3.9% of all infants with conjunctivitis), an incidence of 0.3% for the whole population of live born infants. Six of the chlamydia infections (46%) occurred within the first week of life. Expenses for chlamydia testing were estimated to be NOK 1,020 per positive test. Preventing conjunctivitis in our nursery and neonatal unit calls for strategies to protect newborn infants from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, especially S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
