Predicting bacteremic pneumonia in HIV-1-infected patients consulting the ED. HIV-1-infected patients have higher incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and risk of complications. Bacteremia has been associated with a higher risk of complications in such patients. We investigated factors associated with bacteremia in HIV-1-infected patients with CAP presenting at the emergency department.We included HIV-1-infected patients with CAP for 3 years (March 2005-February 2008). Only patients in whom blood cultures were performed were finally included. Clinical data (age sexWe diagnosed 129 HIV-1-infected patients with CAP. Blood cultures were performed in 118 cases (91%). Bacteremia was present in 28 (24%). Independent predictors of bacteremia were the detection of S pneumoniae antigen in urine (odds ratio, 9.0 95% confidence interval, 1.9-42.0) and the absence of current antiretroviral treatment (odds ratio, 7.1HIV-1-infected patients with CAP who are not on current antiretroviral therapy and have positive S pneumoniae antigenuria are at increased risk of having bacteremia. Bacteremic patients have a poor outcome.
