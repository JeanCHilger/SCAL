Epidemiology, outcome and emm types of invasive group A streptococcal infections in Finland. In 2006, Finnish nationwide surveillance showed an increase of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease and clinicians were alarmed by severe disease manifestations, prompting the investigation of recent trends and outcome for iGAS. A case of iGAS was defined as Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Cases during 1998-2007 and isolates during 2004-2007 were included. Case-patients' 7-day outcome was available for 2004-2007. Isolates were emm typed. A total of 1,318 cases of iGAS were identified. The average annual incidence was 2.5/100,000 population. The rate was higher in males than females in persons aged 45-64 years, but lower in persons aged 25-34 years. The annual incidence was highest in 2007 (3.9/100,000). Occasional peaks occurred during midwinter and midsummer. The most common emm types were 28 (21%), 1 (16%), 84 (10%), 75 (7%) and 89 (6%). During 2004-2007, emm1 replaced emm28 as the most predominant type. The overall case fatality was 8%. Cases with emm1 were associated with high case fatality (14% vs. 8% in other types p < 0.02)
