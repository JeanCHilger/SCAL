Distribution of emm types and genetic characterization of the mgc locus in group G Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis from a hospital in northern Taiwan. A total of 274 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates was analyzed by emm typing and by determining the organization of their mgrC loci. Three of the most frequent emm types were stG485.0 (45/274, 16.4%), stG6.1 (43/274, 15.7%), and stC839.0 (32/274, 11.7%), in decreasing order. The cpdB-positive mgrC locus appears to be predominant in some emm types.
