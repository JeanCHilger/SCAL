Diagnosis and management of acute pharyngitis in a paediatric population: a cost-effectiveness analysis. Acute pharyngitis is one of the most frequent causes of primary care physician visits however, there is no agreement about which is the best strategy to diagnose and manage acute pharyngitis in children. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the recommended strategies to diagnose and manage acute pharyngitis in a paediatric population. A decision tree analysis was performed to compare the following six strategies: "treat all", "clinical scoring", "rapid test", "culture", "rapid test + culture" and "clinical scoring + rapid test". The cost data came from the Spanish National Health Service sources. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from the payer's perspective. Effectiveness was measured as the proportion of patients cured without complications from the disease and did not have any reaction to penicillin therapy
