Recurrent sepsis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. I report that a 75-year-old man with severe atherosclerosis experienced two episodes of bacteremia with Streptococcus pyogenes of type emm87. Recurrent sepsis with S. pyogenes is extremely rare, and a foot ulcer was the suspected point of entry. The patient did not develop opsonizing antibodies to the isolate.
