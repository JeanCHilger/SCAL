A single-center prospective study of viral infection in community-acquired pneumonia in adults. From July, 2008 to March, 2009, 125 adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who were admitted to our hospital were retrospectively investigated to elucidate the characteristics of viral infection in adult CAP in Japan. Nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time polymerase chain reaction for 7 types of influenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory synctial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and enterovirus were obtained. Diagnoses of viral infections were established according to positive results in real-time polymerase chain reaction and influenza rapid diagnostic testing, and based on a fourfold increase in antibody titer of influenza virus antibody in paired sera. Overall, a pathogen was identified in 74 patients (59.8%). Of these pathogens, 47 (37.6%) were bacterial, 17 (13.6%) were viral, and 10 (8.0%) were mixed virus and bacterial infection. Influenza virus (n = 12 9.6%), rhinovirus (n = 8
