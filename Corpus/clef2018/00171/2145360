Target cell lysis and IL-2 secretion by gamma/delta T lymphocytes after activation with bacteria. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from healthy donors were stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and afterward analyzed phenotypically. Marked expansion of the gamma/delta T cell population (3- to 21-fold) was observed in 15/21 donors 7 to 10 days after stimulation. In addition to M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae (six of eight) as well as the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (two of six), group A streptococci (seven of nine), and Listeria monocytogenes (four of eight) augmented gamma/delta TCR expression in peripheral blood T cells of many donors. gamma/delta T lymphocytes expressed IL-2R and secreted IL-2 upon restimulation with M. tuberculosis. Stimulation with M. tuberculosis evoked specific cytolytic activities in gamma/delta T lymphocytes because: gamma/delta T cells lysed M. tuberculosis pulsed but not unpulsed targets high concentrations of TCR delta 1 mAb facilitated killing of unpulsed target cells
