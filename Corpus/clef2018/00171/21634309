Sentinel case of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causing constrictive pericarditis presenting as hypogammaglobulinemia. This is a unique case of a previously healthy 7-year-old boy, which highlights the importance of considering immunodeficiency when a rare infection occurs. In the following case report, the patient develops constrictive pericarditis secondary to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. As a result of this infection, we speculate that he develops hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to the documented association between constrictive pericarditis and intestinal lymphangiectasia because an extensive work-up for a primary immunodeficiency was negative. This is the first case ever to present constrictive pericarditis because of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection.
