Detection of group A streptococcal antigen from throat swabs with five diagnostic kits in general practice. During a 5-month period, 248 general practitioners from 164 general practice offices obtained duplicate throat swabs from 2469 patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis. At the general practice office, one of the swabs was assayed for the presence of group A streptococcal antigen, using one of five commercially available diagnostic kits. (The participants did not receive instruction in the use of the kits). The other swab was cultured in our laboratory for the presence of group A streptococci. The diagnostic parameters for the five kits were as follows: Abbott TestPack Strep A--sensitivity, 79% (110/139) and specificity, 98% (490/501) Direct Strep A EIA (Roche)--sensitivity, 79% (104/132) and specificity, 63% (178/281)
