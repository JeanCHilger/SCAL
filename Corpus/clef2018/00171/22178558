Diagnostic strategies for acute tonsillitis in France: a cost-effectiveness study. Inability to identify clinically group A streptococcal (GAS) tonsillitis has resulted for a long time in treating all tonsillitis with antibiotics in France. The use of the rapid detection tests (RDT) for GAS is currently recommended, in order to keep antibiotics only for GAS tonsillitis. Our objective was to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis, comparing various strategies for the management of acute tonsillitis in France.We used a decision analysis model, including seven strategies (S) for tonsillitis management, specifically in children and in adults: S1: observation only (reference strategy) S2: clinical scoringThe use of the RDT alone had the best cost-effectiveness ratio in both adults and children. For this strategy, we estimated the cost per suppurative complication avoided at 970€ in children and at 903€ in adults. For the strategy associating a confirmative throat culture to the RDT, the extra cost per suppurative complication avoided was estimated at 106,666€ in children and at 228,000€ in adults. Sensitivity analysis showed the stability of the model while making the main parameters vary.In acute tonsillitis, in both adults and children, RDT testing by practitioners is the more efficient strategy to identify and treat patients with GAS tonsillitis. Combining RDT testing with throat culture can provide additional effectiveness, but at the cost of a significant extra charge for the community.
