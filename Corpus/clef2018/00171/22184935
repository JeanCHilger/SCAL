Evaluation of a rapid culture-based screening test for detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The performance of a culture based assay, BacLite Rapid MRSA for the rapid detection (5 hours) of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from specimens (n = 377) obtained from nares, throat, wounds and perineum was investigated. Compared to culture based reference methods (chromogenic MRSA ID (bioMerieux)), selective enrichment broth, PBP2' latex agglutination (Oxoid) and VITEK 2 identification (bioMerieux), an overall sensitivity of 71% with a 82% specificity and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95% was provided. The Baclite test is rapid and easy to use and has the advantage of a culture-based detection method for MRSA.
