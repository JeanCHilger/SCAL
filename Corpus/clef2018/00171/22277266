Circulating cytokines in patients undergoing tonsillectomy with fibrin glue. Fibrin glue is used as a haemostatic agent or as a sealant. The aim of this study is to objectively evaluate the efficacy of the use of fibrin glue Quixil - a human surgical sealer - in tonsillectomy, for the reduction of post-operative inflammatory response.A prospective randomized single-blind study.The study was performed on 40 consecutive patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy (T&A). Patients were randomly assigned to one of two sub-groups: a study group and a control group. The tonsillar beds of patients in the study group were coated with fibrin glue (Quixil, OMRIX biopharmaceuticals) at the end of the operation the patients in the control group were treated for hemostasis without the use of fibrin glue. Complete blood counts and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (assayed by specific immunoassay - ELISA) were assessed in samples drawn pre- and 16 h post-tonsillectomy.Forty patients (aged 5.8 Â± 2.4 years) were consecutively enrolled 45% (18) of the patients were treated with fibrin glue, 55% (22) were not. Compared to controls, Quixil-treated patients demonstrated a reduction in post-tonsillectomy circulating leukocytes (29.2% vs. 45.4%, p<0.05), neutrophiles (28.3% vs. 42.1%, p<0.05), IL-6 (+1% vs. +42%, p<0.05), and TNF-alpha (+8% vs. +26%, p<0.05.Intra-operative fibrin glue therapy is associated with decreased immediate inflammatory response following T&A. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term outcome.1B.
