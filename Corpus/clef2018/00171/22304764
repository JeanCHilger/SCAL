Expression,  purification and protective antigen analysis of cell wall protein MRP of Streptococcus suis type 2. To amplify the mrp gene of Streptococcus suis type 2 05ZYH33,  express it in E.coli BL21 in order to acquire high purity recombinant protein MRP,  then evaluate the protective antigen of recombinant protein MRP.Using PCR technology to obtain the product of mrp gene of 05ZYH33,  and then cloned it into the expression vector pET28a(+). The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography,  later immunized New Zealand rabbit to gain anti-serum,  then test the anti-serum titer by ELISA. The opsonophagocytic killing test demonstrated the abilities of protective antigen of MRP.The truncated of MRP recombinant protein in E.coli BL21 expressed by inclusion bodies,  and purified it in high purity. After immunoprotection,  the survival condition of CD-1 was significantly elevated. The survival rate of wild-type strain 05ZYH33 in blood was apparently decreased after anti-serum opsonophagocyticed,  but the mutant delta MRP showed no differences.MRP represent an important protective antigen activity.
