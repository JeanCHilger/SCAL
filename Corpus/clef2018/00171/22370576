Papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome. Papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS), is an acute dermatosis characterized by a papular-purpuric edematous rash in a distinct ''gloves and socks'' distribution often accompanied by fever, asthenia and lymphadenophaties. It is mainly caused by parvovirus B19 (B19V) but other viruses and drugs such as trimethoprim/sulfametaxol or chemotherapics may be involved. We describe a case of PPGSS with a serologically proven B19V infection in a 42-year-old Italian kindergarten teacher suffering from acute bacterial pharyngitis Immunoglobulin M by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to parvovirus B19 were positive. Histological examination showed dermal-ipodermal inflammation with evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis principally interesting the small venules The cutaneous rash resolved after 2 weeks. We reported our case to support that PPGSS is an immunomediated disease and that B19V morbidity varies with the immunologic and hematologic status of the host. In addition, a patient with PPGSS might be infectious at the moment of diagnosis, with significant implication for susceptible contacts.
