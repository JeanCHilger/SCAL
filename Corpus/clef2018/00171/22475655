Cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent patients. Clinical and immunological considerations. Cytomegalovirus primary infection is considered dangerous for some kinds of patients: immunocompromised (HIV-infected and transplanted patients), newborns with congenital infection, and immunocompetent patients in critical condition. CMV infection is usually asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic in immunocompetent hosts. We collected all cases of acute CMV infection that came to our attention during the period November 2009 - May 2011 to analyze their clinical features. Immunoenzymatic methods (ELISA) were used for the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies in every case. We observed 73 cases of acute CMV infection. The male-female ratio was 1.5/1. The average age was 36.4. All the patients had fever, 16 (22%) pharyngitis, only 9 (12.3%) lymphadenopathy. The most common complications were hepatitis, encephalitis, pericarditis and pneumonia. Unknown genetic factors may greatly influence the clinical expression of the illness.
