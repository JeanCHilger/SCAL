The diagnostic effectiveness of an immunoenzyme test system for determining diphtheria toxin antigens in the blood serum in a clinical laboratory trial. The data on the approbation of the diagnostic value of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system for the determination of diphtheria toxin in the blood sera of diphtheria patients and persons suspected for diphtheria are presented. The EIA system was prepared on the basis of F(ab)2 fractions of purified antidiphtheria antibodies. 240 serum samples from diphtheria and tonsillitis patients and from healthy persons were studied. Diphtheria toxin was determined in all patients with the toxic form of diphtheria and in 41.3% of patients with its localized forms. Blood was taken mainly of the first week of the disease. In healthy persons the results of EIA were negative. Thus, the trial of the assay system in a clinical laboratory showed its good diagnostic effectiveness. The use of this EIA system in medical practice is believed to be quite promising.
