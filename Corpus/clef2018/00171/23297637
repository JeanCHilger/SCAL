Humoral immune response in patients with angina and soft tissue infections of group a streptococci etiology. Evaluate informativity of simultaneous determination of antibodies (AB) against extracellular (AB against streptolysin-O-ASL-O) and cellular (IgM against A-polysaccharide - A-PSC) antigens in patients with angina and soft tissue infections caused by serogroup A streptococci (SGA) and identify features of humoral immune response to SGA infection according to infectious process localization. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2 groups of patients with bacteriologically confirmed SGA infection (50 cases of angina - group 1 and 51 case of soft tissue infection - group 2) were examined for the presence of ASL-O by using Architect ci8200 analyzer (Abbott, USA) and IgM against SGA A-PSC by EIA. RESULTS. In group 1, 23 (46%) individuals were recognized as positive by ASL-O level, and in group 2 - 20 (39% p>0.05)
