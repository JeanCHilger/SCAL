Value of agglutination tests for the rapid identification of isolated streptococci in medical microbiology. The clinical need for rapidly and correctly differentiating pathogenic streptococci into Lancefield groups prompted the development of rapid agglutination techniques by the direct colony method. Pastorex Streptogroupe (Diagnostics Pasteur, France) and Streptex (Wellcome Diagnostics, USA) were tested on 90 streptococcal isolates and compared with the identification obtained by conventional procedures. No cross-reactions were observed with any of the 33 strains of enterococci and of the seven strains representative of other genus among Gram-positive bacteria. When combined with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, both Pastorex and Streptex were specific tests for identifying beta-hemolytic streptococci, with Pastorex being slightly faster.
