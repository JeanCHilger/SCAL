Monoclonal antibody to human renal glomeruli cross-reacts with streptococcal M protein. Two murine monoclonal antibodies (immunoglobulin M) evoked against human kidney tissue were examined for cross-reactivity with group A streptococci. A glomerulus-specific antibody, PMII.40.H.2, cross-reacted in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified pepsin-extracted M proteins from type 6 and 12 streptococci, but not type 1, 3, 5, 19, and 24 M proteins. The cross-reactive monoclonal antibody also opsonized type 6 and 12 streptococci, indicating that it was directed against protective M protein epitopes that were exposed on the surfaces of these organisms. A control antibody, which was tubule specific, did not cross-react with any of the purified M proteins, nor did it opsonize any of the serotypes of streptococci tested. Western immunoblot experiments identified the glomerular cross-reactive antigen as a 43-kilodalton protein. The results demonstrate that M protein of group A streptococci and glomerular antigens of the human kidney possess cross-reactive determinants.
