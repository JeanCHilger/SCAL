Heart cross-reactive antigens of mutans streptococci share epitopes with group A streptococci and myosin. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) generated by immunization of mice with membranes of Streptococcus pyogenes Manfredo (M type 5) were tested for their reactivity with sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of Streptococcus mutans GS5, Streptococcus rattus BHT (formerly S. mutans, serotype b), and S. mutans Ingbritt 175 in the Western blot. The reaction of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-extracted proteins of whole S. mutans, serotype b), and S. rattus with the mAb revealed that the shared cross-reactive antigens were near m.w. 62,000 to 67,000. Several higher m.w. proteins in S. mutans Ingbritt 175 reacted with the mAb but were not observed in the other two strains of streptococci. Cytoplasmic membranes of S. rattus BHT reacted with these mAb in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The most reactive BHT membrane component detected by these mAb was a 62-kDa polypeptide that was similar in m.w. to the membrane component recognized by these antibodies in purified S. pyogenes membranes. The reactivity of the mAb with BHT membranes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was absorbed by rabbit skeletal muscle myosin. The patterns of reactivity observed in the BHT membrane immunoblots in this study closely resemble those previously obtained using polyclonal rabbit anti-human heart sera.
