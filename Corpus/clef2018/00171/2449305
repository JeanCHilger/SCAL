Antibodies to basement membrane proteins nidogen and laminin in sera from streptococcal-related diseases and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients. Using the ELISA technique, antibodies against two different basement proteins, laminin and nidogen (ALNA), were determined in 226 children suffering from one of 37 different inflammatory or infectious diseases. These included 80 patients with streptococcal infection and 40 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Forty-eight percent of the streptococcus-infected patients (or 75% of those in the acute phase) and 60% of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients had significantly elevated ALNA levels compared with healthy controls. Interestingly 10 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients displayed normal ALNA levels, suggesting a particular immune process occurring in children affected by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. By means of periodate oxidation and glycosidase treatments we have shown that ALNA positive sera recognized terminal alpha-galactose as the reactive epitope.
