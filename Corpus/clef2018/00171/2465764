Serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of 28- and 35-kDa proteins of human T lymphocytes stimulated by streptococcal M protein. Purified polypeptide fragments of certain surface M proteins of group A streptococci stimulate blastogenesis and the differentiation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes of normal human lymphocytes. The biochemical basis of lymphocyte stimulation by a type M5 protein polypeptide fragment (pep M5) was investigated. Optimal blastogenic doses of pep M5 or phytohemagglutinin stimulated the phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. However, pep M5 but not phytohemagglutinin induced the phosphorylation of 28- and 35-kDa proteins. The 28-kDa protein was shown to be phosphorylated only at serine residues, whereas the 35-kDa protein was phosphorylated only at tyrosine residues. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with pep M5 caused a two-fold increase in the CD8+ and CD4+ 4B4+ subpopulations of T lymphocytes. The phosphorylation of the 28-kDa protein appeared to be confined to the CD4+ T cell subpopulation.
