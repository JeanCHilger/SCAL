Behavior of leukocyte elastase in chronic inflammatory tonsillar diseases. Inflammatory diseases may lead to local tissue injury due to an imbalance between leukocyte elastase and protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-macroglobulin). Hence, we determined the plasma level of elastase in patients with chronic tonsillitis using an enzyme-linked immunoassay and compared the results with those obtained from controls. There was a significant elevation of leukocyte elastase in patients with chronic inflammation of the tonsils compared with our controls. The sensitivity and specificity of the elastase assay characterise this method as a reliable one. Hence, the determination of leukocyte elastase in peripheral blood can be useful if the indication for tonsillectomy is in question.
