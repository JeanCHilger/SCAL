A study of the antigenicity of group A streptococcus strain "Matsuyama 2166" and its prevalence. Antigen analysis of group A streptococcus strain, "Matsuyama 2166", which had been typed as T12-28 (by the T-agglutination method), MNT (nontypeable by the M-precipitation method) using conventional typing sera was examined by the precipitation and precipitation absorption technique. The prevalence of group A streptococci, typed under the name "Matsuyama 2166" was also investigated. The results were as follows: 1) The strain "Matsuyama 2166" is OF (Opacity Factor) (+) and its serological components consist of M "Matsuyama 2166" antigen, which is unique in our collection of M-types, and T28 antigen as a major antigen along with T12 as a minor. 2) Out of the group A streptococci typed as MNT, 96.6% of the streptococci were types as T12-28 and 96.5% of T28 by conventional typing sera were strains to be typed as M "Matsuyama 2166" using the newly prepared M "Matsuyama 2166" typing serum, suggesting the great advantage to M-typing rate of T28 strains. 3) Group A streptococcus M "Matsuyama 2166" was also found in isolates from Thailand or Malaysia. It is interesting that T-types found in those isolates seems to be a little different from the T-types isolated in Japan. These results showed that there was the difficult problem when we did the speculation of M-type from the result of T-type.
