Reliable five-minute test strip method for identification of Streptococcus pyogenes. A novel and rapid method (Strep Strip, Lab M) for identification of Streptococcus pyogenes was evaluated. The method combines the established test for pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (PYR) with a rapid chromogenic test for beta-glucosidase on a paper strip. The test was evaluated with 274 clinical isolates and 237 culture collection isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci. Streptococcus pyogenes was identified with 100% specificity. Six isolates identified as Lancefield group A and which might therefore be assumed to be Streptococcus pyogenes were shown by the test strip method not to be this species. The beta-glucosidase test on the test strip allowed differentiation between enterococci and Streptococcus pyogenes (both PYR positive) in all cases. The test strip method represents an economical and accurate method for identification of Streptococcus pyogenes in clinical material.
