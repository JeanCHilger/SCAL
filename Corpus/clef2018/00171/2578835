Determination of antibodies to Streptococcus group A polysaccharide in human sera by an immunoenzyme method. Use was made of the ELISA to develop a highly sensitive quantitative method for detection of antibodies against Streptococcus group A polysaccharide (polysaccharide A) in human sera. The main advantage is that one can use only one optimal dilution of the sera together with the reference serum. Sera of 53 healthy volunteers and 77 patients with a history of Streptococcus group A infections were screened for the presence of polysaccharide A antibodies. Highly reproducible results were obtained in 97% of cases. The specificity of the method was shown with the polysaccharide A-induced inhibition of the reaction. Positive reactions obtained with the tested sera in gel immunodiffusion correlated with the data derived by the ELISA. Using the latter high level of specific antibodies was found in some of the sera that yielded negative reactions when tested by gel immunodiffusion. This may be associated with the presence of non-precipitating antibodies.
