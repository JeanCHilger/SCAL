Monoclonal autoantibodies to different epithelial structures of the thymus gland obtained by the immunization with streptococcal group A antigens. By the indirect immunofluorescence method it was shown to which epithelial thymus structures monoclonal antibodies (mAT) reacting with the different epidermal structures are directed. These mAT related to the autoantibodies were obtained earlier, as a result of lymphoid cells polyclonal activation, by the immunization of BALB/c mice with streptococcal group A nonspecific protein antigens of the cell wall. It was shown that mAT A6/1, reacting with the basal layer of the skin epithelium are directed to the epithelium of the cortical and medullar thymus zones, which is regarded as the so called endocrinal epithelium. These mAT, by the study with immunoblotting method, react with the protein of mV SOkD, B5/1 mAT to the skin epithelium, on the thymus sections react with the single cells around the Hassel bodies.
