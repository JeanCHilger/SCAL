Evaluation of the pacific biotech CARDS STREP A test for detecting group A streptococci from cases of pharyngitis. The Pacific Biotech CARD STREP A test for rapid screening of throat specimens for group A streptococci was evaluated. Relative to conventional culture, this assay had a sensitivity of 76.1% (108 of 142) and a specificity of 98.7% (392 of 397). The relatively low sensitivity of the test makes it of questionable value as a screening procedure.
