Penicillin and clindamycin alter some group A streptococcal products. The effects of subMICs of penicillin and clindamycin on group A streptococcal products were analyzed. Penicillin caused an increase in the expression of the group carbohydrate for the three strains tested in contrast, clindamycin inhibited the expression in two strains. The M and T proteins were not affected by the drugs. Clindamycin caused an increase in the hyaluronidase activity and both antimicrobial agents inhibited the activity of streptolysin at 1/2 MIC.
