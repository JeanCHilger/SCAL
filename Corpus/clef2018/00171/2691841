Extensive sequence homology between IgA receptor and M proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes. Many strains of Streptococcus pyogenes are known to express a receptor for IgA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for such a receptor, protein Arp4, has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of 386 residues includes a signal sequence of 41 amino acids and a putative membrane anchor region, both of which are homologous to similar regions in other streptococcal surface proteins. The processed form of the IgA receptor has a length of 345 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 39544. The N-terminal sequence of the processed form is different from that previously found for a similar IgA receptor isolated from a S. pyogenes strain of type M60. The sequence of protein Arp4 shows extensive homology to the C-terminal half of streptococcal M proteins, but not to the streptococcal IgG receptor protein G or staphlyococcal protein A. Apart from the membrane anchor, this homology includes a sequence of 119 amino acid residues containing three repeated units and a 54-residue sequence without repeats. The protein expressed in Escherichia coli is found in the periplasmic space, in which it constitutes the major protein. Protein Arp4 is the first example of a surface protein that has both immunoglobulin-binding capacity and structural features characteristic of M proteins.
