Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of streptococcal infection. The problems related to the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of streptococcal infection at all levels of health service are analysed. The principles of microbiological streptococcal identification with the aid of express-systems and standard culture techniques are outlined. Particular emphasis is placed upon immunoassay of streptococci using a broad spectrum of extracellular products and antigens of the cell wall of group A streptococcus, and upon methodological approaches to solving certain clinical and diagnostic problems.
