Use of nasal and pharyngeal swabs for rapid detection of respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs from 134 children with acute respiratory diseases were examined for the presence of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus and adenovirus antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were compared with those obtained by virus isolation and serology. Altogether, 56 RS virus-positive (prospective study), 51 adenovirus-positive (retrospective study), and 27 negative (prospective study) samples were examined. The sensitivities of ELISA were 96 and 98% for RS virus and adenovirus antigen detection, respectively. No false-positive results were observed. It is concluded that the joint eluate from a nasal and a pharyngeal swab, properly taken and handled, serves well for the detection of RS virus and adenovirus acute respiratory infections by ELISA.
