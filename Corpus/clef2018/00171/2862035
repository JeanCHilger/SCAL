Colonization antigens and haemagglutination patterns of human Escherichia coli. The haemagglutinating properties of 223 (35 enterotoxigenic and 188 non-enterotoxigenic) Escherichia coli strains with nine erythrocyte types were investigated 153 strains were also tested for beta-haemolysis and colicin production and for the presence of CFA/I, CFA/II, K88 and K99 antigens. A selected group of strains was also examined by electron microscopy to determine the presence of fimbriae or fibrils and to establish the relationship between these, the haemagglutinating properties and the presence of colonization antigens. Generally, the haemagglutinating patterns yielded by the same strains grown in Mueller Hinton broth and on CFA agar differed considerably. Mannose-sensitive haemagglutinating (MSHA) patterns were more homogeneous than mannose-resistant haemagglutinating (MRHA) patterns. Forty-seven percent of the non-enterotoxigenic MRHA+ strains were haemolytic while only 6% of the remaining strains were (chi2 correction = 34.01
