Comparison of three rapid methods for detection of antibodies to streptolysin O and DNase B. Three commercial systems were compared for ability to detect antibodies to streptolysin O (ASO) and DNase B (ADB). Streptozyme (Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, N.J.) exhibited high sensitivity (100%) for detecting ASO but low sensitivity for ADB (22.2%). The LeapStrep (Organon Teknika, Malvern, Pa.) and Check-Spectra (Diagnostic Technology, Hauppauge, N.Y.) tests had low sensitivities for detecting ASO (35.3 and 21.4%, respectively) and ADB (22.2 and 33.3%, respectively).
