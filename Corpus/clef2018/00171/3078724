Interactive effect of Gm and Km allotypes on cellular immune responses to streptococcal cell wall antigen. Serum samples from 121 unrelated, healthy Japanese individuals were typed for several Gm and Km(1) allotypes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from these subjects were cultured with streptococcal cell wall (SCW) antigen and the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into T lymphoblasts was measured. Log-linear analysis showed a significant interactive effect of Gm1,1713,16,21 and Km(1) on the cellular immune response to group A SCW antigen.
