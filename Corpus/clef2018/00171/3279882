Rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis in a primary care unit. One of the main consulting motives in ambulatory pediatric practice is acute pharyngotonsillitis. This work values the efficacy of a test to confirm rapid diagnosis (30 minutes) of streptococcal pharyngitis. Authors selected 100 children in a office of primary health care whose ages were between two and seven years, from February to July in 1986. They have considered classical clinical symptoms of pharyngitis and have applied a throat culture and rapid test in all. After comparing test results and culture results, obtained sensibility and specificity have been 80% and 95% (p less than 0.01) respectively. According to these results, they believe on the necessity of a test that permits a rapid diagnosis and which enables to treat acute pharyngitis in a more suitable way in ambulatory pediatrics.
