Evaluation of a kit for rapid detection of group A streptococci in a pediatric emergency department. We evaluated a kit for the rapid detection of group A streptococci from throat swabs (Culturette Brand 10-Minute Group A Strep ID, Marion Scientific, Division of Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, Missouri) in the laboratory and in a busy pediatric emergency department. The sensitivity of the kit in the laboratory was 80% for all specimens and 94% for specimens with more than 10 colony-forming units of group A streptococci the specificity was 99%. After initial training, emergency department pediatricians and nurses achieved sensitivities of 72% and 69% respectively. The specificity achieved by the pediatricians was 76% initially but 96% after further training. Untrained residents achieved a sensitivity of 58%. We conclude that this kit is potentially useful in the hands of adequately trained personnel, but without training the accuracy of the results is unacceptable. We recommend that the kit be used by designated staff trained and monitored by laboratory personnel.
