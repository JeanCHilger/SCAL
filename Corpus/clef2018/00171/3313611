Use of reference specimens for throat swab cultures on Streptocult. Seventy-five general practitioners (GPs) who regularly used Streptocult for culture of throat swabs participated in a study aimed at evaluating the need for and the possible educational effect of examining reference specimens. Their pre-study and post-study accuracy in the interpretation of cultures of simulated throat specimens were analyzed. One group of 38 GPs received instructions as well as supplementary reference specimens during the study, while no instructions were given to the remaining 37 GPs. There was no discernible difference in the post-study accuracy of the two groups. Before the study, 80% of the GPs had felt to be in need of reference specimens after the study, 61% did so. A majority suggested that three reference specimens should be distributed once or twice a year. Eighty-six per cent had never checked the temperature in their incubator. After doing so, only 54% measured a temperature within the recommended range of 35-37 degrees C.
