Identification of the site on IgG Fc for interaction with streptococci of groups A, C and G. The interaction between living groups A, C and G streptococci and IgG Fc was studied using human IgG, IgG Fc and IgG Fc-intermediate (Fci) fragments, chemically modified human IgG and fragment D of staphylococcal protein A (SPA). Diethylpyrocarbonate modification of His or N-acetylimidazole modification of Tyr of human IgG resulted in the loss of its capacity to inhibit the binding of radiolabelled human IgG Fc to the group A streptococci types M1 and M55, and to the group C strain SC-1, indicating that the amino acids His and Tyr are involved in the binding. Lys seems not to participate in the binding of IgG to these bacteria, however, since reductive methylation of Lys did not reduce its inhibitory capacity. Fragment D of SPA also inhibited the binding of radiolabelled human IgG Fc to strains M1, M55 and SC-1. We have previously shown that these bacteria do not bind to IgG fragments consisting of only the C gamma 2 or C gamma 3 domains. On the basis of these results, and the known relative positions in space of the His and Tyr residues on IgG Fc, it is speculated whether streptococci with IgG Fc receptors, like SPA and rheumatoid factors, interact with IgG in the interface between the C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 domains and involve His 435 and one or more of Tyr 436, His 433 and His 310. The similarities in binding sites on IgG for RFs and these bacterial Fc binding proteins suggest structural similarities between them that may be relevant to the production of rheumatoid factors in rheumatoid arthritis.
