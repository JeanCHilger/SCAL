A study of anti-group A streptococcal monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive with myosin. Anti-group A streptococcal monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BALB c/BYJ mice immunized with purified membranes from M type 5 Streptococcus pyogenes. Two of the anti-streptococcal monoclonal antibodies were previously shown to cross-react with muscle myosin. In this study the monoclonal antibodies were reacted with tissue sections of normal human heart and skeletal muscle. Antibody binding was estimated by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques. Both of the monoclonal antibodies (36.2.2 and 54.2.8) investigated in this report reacted with heart and/or skeletal muscle sections. When evaluated by immunofluorescence, monoclonal antibody 54.2.8 demarcated the periphery of cardiac striated muscle cells and reacted to a lesser degree with subsarcolemmal components. Monoclonal antibody 36.2.2 failed to react with heart sections, but both of the monoclonal antibodies reacted strongly with skeletal muscle sections. Results similar to those observed with indirect immunofluorescence were obtained with the immunoperoxidase technique. By Western immunoblotting and competitive inhibition assays, monoclonal antibodies 36.2.2 and 54.2.8 both were found to react with the heavy chain of skeletal muscle myosin. However, only 54.2.8 reacted with the heavy chain of cardiac myosin. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies for subfragments of skeletal muscle myosin indicated that monoclonal antibody 36.2.2 was specific for light meromyosin fragments, whereas 54.2.8 reacted with both heavy and light meromyosin. The data demonstrated that two monoclonal antibodies against streptococci were specific for skeletal muscle and/or cardiac myosin and for subfragments of the myosin molecule. The reactions of the monoclonal antibodies with human tissue sections were consistent with the immunochemical reactions of the monoclonal antibodies with both denatured and native myosin.
