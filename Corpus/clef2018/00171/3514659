Reduction of morbidity and mortality rates for neonatal group B streptococcal disease through early diagnosis and chemoprophylaxis. Pregnant women, part of the term service population at Orlando Regional Medical Center, were screened for group B streptococci (GBS), using Lim Group B Strep Broth (GIBCO Laboratories, Madison, Wis.) and the Phadebact Strep B Test (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Piscataway, N.J.). Of the 803 women screened, 173 were confirmed as colonized with GBS at the time of admission in labor. Eighty of these women were treated with ampicillin at least 6 h prior to delivery. The remaining 93 women received no ampicillin. None of the infants born to the treated women was colonized with GBS at surface culture sites. Forty-three of the infants born to untreated women were colonized. Rapid identification of GBS colonization in women, combined with ampicillin chemoprophylaxis, significantly reduced vertical transmission of GBS.
