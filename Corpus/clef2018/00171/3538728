Distribution of type-specific antibodies to streptococcal lipoproteinase based on population screening data. In the serum samples obtained from residents of the Todzhinsky district in the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic antibodies to 12 out of 15 studied types of group A streptococcal lipoproteinases (OF-factor) were detected, with the prevalence of types 2, 4, 22, 25, 48, and 60, their incidence in the population constituting 34%. Antibodies to OF-antigens 58, 62, and 63 were not detected. The distribution of OF-antibodies was found to vary with sex, occurring in females 1.5 times more frequently than in males, and with age, accumulating in subjects aged 21-30 and 31-40. The distribution of antibodies to different OF serotypes did not depend on the blood serum streptolysin O titers.
