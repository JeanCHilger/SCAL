Aspiration drainage of splenic abscesses. The successful use of guided percutaneous needle aspiration in the management of four patients with solitary splenic abscess is described. Two patients had needle aspiration alone and two patients, with large splenic abscesses, had drainage tubes inserted. The procedures were well tolerated and allowed rapid microbiological diagnosis with selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The techniques were useful in patients felt to be poor anaesthetic risks, and the complications of splenectomy were avoided.
