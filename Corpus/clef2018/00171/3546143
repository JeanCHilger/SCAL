Immunologic cross-reactivity of type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) and staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C1. Immunologic cross-reactivity between Streptococcus pyogenes type A exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins B and C1 was demonstrated by Ouchterlony double diffusion, Western immunoblot, and immunodot analyses. Specific antiserum to type A streptococcal exotoxin reacted more strongly with staphylococcal enterotoxin B than with enterotoxin C1. The reactivity of type A streptococcal exotoxin with antiserum to staphylococcal enterotoxin B was greater than that of antiserum to enterotoxin C1. These results suggest that a conserved domain is present in the three exotoxins, which most likely originated from a common evolutionary ancestor.
