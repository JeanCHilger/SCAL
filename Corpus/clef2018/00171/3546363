Rapid detection of group B streptococcal antigen in human amniotic fluid. Infants exposed in utero to group B streptococcus (GBS)-infected human amniotic fluid (HAF) are at high risk for serious infection. Latex particle agglutination (LPA) tests are not approved for detection of GBS in HAF. Two LPA systems, Patho-Dx Strep B and Wellcogen Strep B, were used to test unfiltered sterile HAF and filtered HAF containing concentrations of GBS carbohydrate from 0.2 to 100 micrograms/ml. Four different processing techniques were used to prevent nonspecific LPA: EDTA, nitrous acid, enzyme, and nitrous acid-heat. GBS (10(2) CFU/ml) was inoculated into filtered HAF, incubated, sampled serially, processed with enzyme, and tested by LPA. Unprocessed, unfiltered HAF showed 33% nonspecific agglutination when tested by LPA. Processing of HAF removed nonspecific agglutination and improved GBS antigen detection. Without processing, LPA could not detect less than 100 micrograms of GBS carbohydrate per ml. With nitrous acid or enzyme processing, as little as 0.2 microgram/ml could be detected. Results were easier to read after enzyme processing than after nitrous acid processing. Although both LPA systems were equally efficient, testing was easier with the Patho-Dx system. After enzyme processing, LPA could detect as few as 10(4) CFU/ml when agglutination was read with a 4 X hand lens. Substances in HAF induce false-positive reactions during LPA testing. Processing removes the interference and improves the detection of GBS. LPA testing of HAF may allow earlier identification and treatment of infants at risk for serious GBS infection.
