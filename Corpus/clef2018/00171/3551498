Repeated passage of freshly isolated group A streptococci on blood agar. II. Effect on adherence capacity. Group A streptococcal strains (three T-type 1, two T-type 2 and three T-type 4), freshly isolated from throat cultures, were subjected to 25 serial passages on blood agar. All strains changed their M protein production and/or opacity factor (OF)-activity during the passages. The capacity of each strain to adhere to a pool of buccal cells from six healthy individuals was studied both before and after passage. Five of six strains with decreased OF-activity/M protein production diminished significantly in adherence capacity, whereas one of two strains with increasing OF-activity adhered better to the epithelial cells. The results are discussed in relation to the clinical view of asymptomatic carriers of group A streptococci.
