Isolation of Streptococcus milleri from clinical specimens. During a period of 26 months, 80 strains of Streptococcus milleri were isolated from 80 patients with clinical evidence of infection. More than a third of the isolates were from lesions related to the gastro-intestinal tract and a quarter from abscesses of various other sites. The haemolytic activity and group antigenic profile of these isolates are discussed. In addition, the clinical significance of S. milleri isolated from various sites is evaluated.
