Biochemical and biological properties of the binding of human fibrinogen to M protein in group A streptococci. Fibrinogen is known to bind to group A streptococci and precipitate with extracts containing streptococcal M protein. We have previously shown that the binding of fibrinogen to M-positive streptococci prevents opsonization by complement and protects that organism from phagocytosis in nonimmune blood. In the present study, we used 3H-labeled fibrinogen, a highly purified peptide fragment of type 24 M protein (pep M24), and anti-pep M sera to show that fibrinogen binds to M-positive streptococci with high affinity (dissociation constants, 1 to 5 nM) occupation of the high-affinity binding sites suffices to protect the organism from phagocytosis
