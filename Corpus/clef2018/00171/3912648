Rapid practical method for detection of beta lactamase-producing bacteria. A method is described for rapid detection of beta lactamase-producing organisms within 24 h. The specimen is plated on agar medium, and a standard penicillin susceptibility disc is placed at the site of the lung inoculum. Penicillin resistant bacteria will grow at the area of inhibition. Beta lactamase activity can then be ascertained by utilizing a rapid disc test.
