Faecal and pharyngeal shedding of rotavirus and rotavirus IgA in children with diarrhoea. In 70 children 0-4 years of age with acute diarrhoea, the shedding of rotavirus and the excretion of rotavirus-specific IgA antibody in the stools were examined throughout the period of clinical symptoms. Quantitative detection of rotavirus and IgA was performed by an ELISA technique. The maximal rotavirus shedding was found between the second and fifth day and the maximal excretion of IgA antibody about the seventh day, which marked the clinical recovery of most children. Throat swabs were examined for both virus particles and specific IgA antibody to try to document the respiratory spread of rotavirus infection. Rotavirus antigen could not be demonstrated in the throat swabs, but specific IgA antibody was detected at levels comparable to the faecal specimens obtained at clinical recovery. The observations indicate that the presence of rotavirus secretory IgA limits the duration of diarrhoea and plays a major role in the intestinal resistance to infection.
