Gonococcal serology. A comparison of three different tests. Three serological tests for the detection of gonococcal antibodies were compared: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an indirect haemagglutination reaction (IHA), and a gonococcal complement-fixation test (GCFT). The ELISA was performed with gonococcal pili of a Rotterdam strain (1443) as antigen, the IHA with pilus antigen of an American strain (2686, Buchanan), and the GCFT with whole gonococci of a single strain (46695, Oliver) as antigen. The tests were performed on sera from the same groups of Dutch patients samples of sera were taken at the first examination and generally 11-22 days later. The ELISA and the IHA were more sensitive than the GCFT. The specificity of the tests was equal in low-risk groups, but the GCFT was slightly more specific in high-risk groups. The ELISA and the IHA did not differ in sensitivity and specificity. The agreement between the ELISA and IHA for patients with uncomplicated gonorrhoea was low (chi = 0.44), but the agreement between the GCFT and the two pilus assays was less (chi = 0.26 and 0.20). The sensitivities were highest for sera from patients with oropharyngeal gonorrhoea or with gonococcal complications
