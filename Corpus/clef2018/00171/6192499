Expression of streptococcal M protein in Escherichia coli. The structural gene for group A streptococcal M protein, the fibrillar surface molecule enabling the organism to resist phagocytosis, has been cloned into Escherichia coli. The molecule produced by Escherichia coli is slightly larger than the M protein isolated by solubilization of the streptococcal cell wall, but is similar in size to that secreted by streptococcal protoplast and L forms. Immunologically, the molecule synthesized by Escherichia coli has the same type-specific determinants as the streptococcal M protein.
