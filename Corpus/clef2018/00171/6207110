Unique and common protective epitopes among different serotypes of group A streptococcal M proteins defined with hybridoma antibodies. A set of four monoclonal antibodies was produced against a highly purified pepsin extract of type 5 streptococcal M protein. Three of the four antibodies cross-reacted with purified M proteins from heterologous serotypes and opsonized the respective heterologous organisms. Our studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies may be useful in identifying subpeptides of various M proteins containing common, protective epitopes that are capable of evoking antibodies that would protect against several different potentially "rheumatogenic" serotypes.
