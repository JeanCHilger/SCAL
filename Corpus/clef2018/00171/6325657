Rapid diagnosis of adenoviral tonsillitis: a prospective clinical study. Adenovirus antigen was detected by radioimmunoassay in the nasopharyngeal specimens of 30 of 74 children with febrile exudative tonsillitis. In the other 44 children, the cause of tonsillitis was identified in 16 (beta-hemolytic streptococci or Epstein-Barr, parainfluenza, or herpes simplex viruses). The clinical picture of adenoviral tonsillitis was difficult to differentiate from that of streptococcal disease 20 of the patients had originally been given antibiotics. In 68% of patients without complications, the serum concentration of C-reactive protein was less than 20 mg/L, suggesting a viral disease. No other hematologic test was found helpful in identifying the adenoviral tonsillitis. The rapid detection of adenovirus antigen permitted withdrawal of unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment in most patients.
