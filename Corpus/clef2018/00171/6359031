A rapid hippurate hydrolysis test for the presumptive identification of group B streptococci. A rapid test for the detection of sodium hippurate hydrolysis using sodium hippurate-impregnated strips was developed. This test made possible the detection of hippurate hydrolysis by Lancefield Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci within 10 min and required only a single colony for testing. All Lancefield Group B streptococci tested were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. All other strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci examined were negative with the exception of 2 strains of Group D beta-hemolytic streptococci.
