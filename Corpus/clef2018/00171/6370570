Clinical evaluation of the improved streptex method for grouping streptococci. The improved Streptex method for serogrouping streptococci incorporates a new extraction enzyme and a simplified procedure requiring no centrifugation. A total of 114 clinical isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci were serogrouped from primary plates, isolation plates, and Todd-Hewitt broth cultures using this system. Results were compared to those of the heat extraction Lancefield precipitin method. An additional 33 stock culture isolates of related streptococcal species and 5 strains of Listeria were serogrouped to assess the specificity of the test. Agreement between the two methods was 82.5% with primary plates and 96.5% with both isolation plates and broth cultures. Four isolates from three different serogroups were nongroupable by the Lancefield method, but did agglutinate in specific Streptex antisera therefore, the enzyme extraction procedure appeared more sensitive than the heat extraction method. Streptex accurately grouped five isolates of gamma-hemolytic group B streptococci, but failed to detect antigen in 33% of the group D streptococcal extracts tested. In addition, cross-reactions were observed with strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Streptex produced fewer ambiguous results and required fewer repeat tests. When used with isolation plates or broth cultures, Streptex is both sensitive and specific for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, F, and G.
