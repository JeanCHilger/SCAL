Cross-reacting antigen of Streptococcus group A and of the stromal fibroblasts of lymphoid organs. It has been demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescent method that sera of rabbits immunized with nontype-specific (NTS) proteins of the group A streptococcal cell wall react with cultivated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts were explanted from human and guinea-pig lymphoid organs. The same reactions were observed with F(ab')2 fragments of IgG obtained from antisera to NTS-proteins. Fractions containing NTS-antigens inhibited these reactions. A possible role of the cross-reactive streptococcal antigen in common with the antigen of lymphoid organs during thymic damage and the development of the autoimmune process in rheumatic fever is discussed.
