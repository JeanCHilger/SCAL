Neonatal Streptococcus group B sepsis: problems of early diagnosis, therapy and prevention. 38 cases of neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis (31 with early onset and 7 with late onset) were observed during the years 1976-1982. Early onset disease showed the following clinical characteristics: 1. frequent lack of risk factors for infection in obstetric history, 2. very early onset of symptoms of respiratory distress, 3. rapid development of shock after only minor or missing clinical signs of infection, and 4. unspecific findings on chest radiography. Neutropenia or marked leukocyte left shift as well as the presence of gram-positive cocci in gastric or tracheal aspirate proved to be useful diagnostic clues. The latex agglutination test for the detection of GBS-antigen in urine yielded in our hands many false positive results and unspecific reactions. Given the big difficulties of early diagnosis of early onset GBS-sepsis, the relatively liberal use of antibiotics in newborns with respiratory distress is probably unavoidable. Hereby prior culturing of blood and early termination of antibiotic therapy with negative cultures (of blood, CSF, tracheal aspirate) seems essential to us. The clinical significance of newer therapeutic (granulocyte transfusions, exchange transfusions, immunoglobulins) and prophylactic (intra-partum antibiotics, vaccination) modalities is according to the current literature still not clear in many respects.
