Rapid diagnosis of purulent meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid of 589 subjects, 78 of whom were suffering from a purulent meningitis were examined. Comparatively by classical bacteriological techniques (direct examination and culture) and by electro-immunodiffusion, latex agglutination, and Limulus endotoxin assay. Soluble bacterial Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens, were tested by electro-immunodiffusion and latex agglutination, and soluble bacterial N. meningitidis group B, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae antigens by electro-immunodiffusion. Specific antigens and endotoxin were found in 75.8 per cent of the specimens with a rapid answer (120 min). The three tests revealed also only the diagnosis in 29.1 per cent of cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in 33.3 per cent of meningococcal meningitis and in 47 per cent of Gram-negative bacteria meningitis. Only five cerebrospinal fluid from the 589 specimens tested were given a non-specific reaction. These two advantages--sensitivity and specificity--of these three tests render them techniques of the future in the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.
