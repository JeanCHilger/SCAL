Interaction of anti-kojibiose antibody with the lipoteichoic acids from Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Antisera prepared in rabbits by immunization with p-aminophenyl beta-kojibioside conjugated to bovine serum albumin (antikojibiose sera), readily agglutinated whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus faecium, and showed specific reactions with the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) of these streptococci by passive hemagglutination, microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The interaction of the antikojibiose sera with the LTAs was inhibited best by kojibiose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-D-glucose], somewhat less by the dextran from which the kojibiose was prepared, and not measurably by maltose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucose]. The sera reacted only minimally in only the most sensitive assay (microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with LTA from group A streptococci (this LTA contains a single kojibiosyl residue as part of the glycolipid moiety of the molecule and failed to react with the Lactobacillus fermentum LTA which is substituted with alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----2)-D -glucosyl units.
