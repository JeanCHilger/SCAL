Evaluation of the Rapid Strep system for the identification of clinical isolates of Streptococcus species. A total of 247 strains of streptococci isolated from humans were tested for identification in the Rapid Strep system. The identification rates and identification levels were different for each Streptococcus species. Our data indicate that the Rapid Strep system will identify nearly all the beta-hemolytic Streptococcus species if serological procedures are used in conjunction with the rapid physiological procedures. Of the group D streptococci, 98% of the enterococci and 95% of the non-enterococci were correctly identified. Of the commonly occurring viridans species, 85% were correctly identified, but only 10% of the less frequently occurring viridans species were identified. A total of 90% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and 60% of the Aerococcus strains were correctly identified.
