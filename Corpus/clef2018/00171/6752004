Haptoglobins, streptococcus agglutination and streptococcal infections. The haptoglobins in man and in mammals react with streptococci bearing the T4-antigen. Hp 2-2 and Hp 2-1 react with high titres like complete agglutinins while Hp 1-1 acts like a blocking antibody. It is surprising to observe the similarity of the behaviour of the haptoglobins and of IgG and IgM. Streptococci carrying Hp 1-1 yield a positive Coombs-test. The Coombs-serum however, is an anti-human-haptoglobin-body from sheep. By means of supplements it has been possible to increase partly considerably the titres of Hp 2-1 and Hp 2-2 against the streptococci.
