The serotyping of hospital strains of streptococci belonging to Lancefield group C and group G. A collection of more than 300 strains belonging to either Lancefield group C or group G was made. The cultures had been isolated either sporadically from patients with serious disease or as apparent clusters from various nosocomial outbreaks. T-protein antigens were sought. So far, nine distinct serotypes have been found among the group G streptococci and seven serotypes amongst the Streptococcus equisimilis (group C) strains. Of the sixteen serotypes, four were the original T-types 7, 16, 20 and 21 described by Griffith (1934). Because of the similarities of representatives of the two groups to Lancefield group A streptococci (Griffith, 1934 Maxted & Potter, 1967) a few strains not unexpectedly carried T antigens usually seen in group A streptococci. Using this scheme it has been possible to serotype 76% of S. equisimilis strains of human origin and 82% of group G streptococci from human clinical material. A small collection of group C and group G streptococci of animal origin could not be serotyped with the experimental T-antisera.
