Lymphocyte cell subpopulations during acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: cell surface antigens and binding of streptococcal membrane antigens and C-reactive protein. T lymphocyte surface markers were examined in 23 patients with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (AGN) in parallel with normal controls and individuals without nephritis who showed evidence of pharyngeal or skin-sore beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection. Numbers of T gamma cells were similar in AGN and normal controls but were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than those in skin-sore culture-positive streptococcal infection controls. Numbers of T mu cells were similar in AGN and normal controls but were lower (P less than 0.05) than those observed in streptococcal controls. Percentages of T mu cells were similar in AGN and normal controls but were lower (P less than 0.05) than those recorded in streptococcal infection control groups. Proportions of T cells were reduced during AGN (P less than 0.05). Lymphocytes capable of binding type 12 group A streptococcal membranes were increased (30.4%) in patients with AGN as compared to normal controls (4.1%). Subjects with streptococcal infection alone showed elevated but intermediate relative numbers (10.5%) of lymphocytes binding group A membranes. Increased relative numbers of both B and T lymphocytes binding group A streptococcal membranes were present in both AGN and non-nephritogenic streptococcal infection controls.
