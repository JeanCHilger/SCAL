Diagnosis of group A streptococcal infections directly from throat secretions. The diagnosis of group A streptococcal disease still relies on isolation of group A streptococcal strains on sheep blood agar followed by presumptive identification based on bacitracin sensitivity or the results of the more precise serogrouping methods such as the Lancefield precipitin test. A technique that would permit rapid identification of streptococcal infections directly from throat secretions would allow immediate appropriate antimicrobial therapy for the management of streptococcal infections to be started. We have been able to identify soluble group A antigen directly from throat secretions by using a latex agglutination test. In a clinical trial in which latex (Streptex group A) and conventional culturing techniques were used, 53 throat secretion cultures were tested: 26 were positive by both procedures, 5 were positive by culture only, 3 were positive by the latex agglutination test only, and 19 were negative by both tests.
