Antigen localization in Streptococcus group A, L forms and revertant by an immunoferritin method. The comparative study of antigen localization in the initial streptococcus, in its stable L-forms and in the revertant obtained from the L-forms in early L-transformation passages. has been carried out. In this study 3 sera were used in homologous and heterologous reactions Ferritin-labeled homologous antibodies have been shown to localize directly on the cell-wall surface in the initial strain and in the capsule-like slime in the revertant. The L-forms have been found to possess some membrane-localized antigens in common with the revertant and, to a lesser extent, with the initial streptococcal strain.
