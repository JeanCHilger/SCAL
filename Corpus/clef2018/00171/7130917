Obstructive epiglottitis in adults. Acute epiglottitis, considered primarily a disease of infancy and early childhood, is seen rarely in adulthood but may be increasing in incidence. Although it may appear more slowly in adults, it is imperative to establish a rapid diagnosis and promptly assure care for this life-threatening disease. Epiglottitis may cause total obstruction of the upper airway, and it often falls to the primary care physician to discriminate this disease from the many self-limiting infections of the upper airway. The diagnosis should be considered if dysphagia and sore throat are not accompanied by hoarseness. Management of the airway is the first priority, but intravenous antibiotic use is justified.
