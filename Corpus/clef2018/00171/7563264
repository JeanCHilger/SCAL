Characterization of group A streptococci isolated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. T-agglutination patterns of 190 strains of group A streptococci isolated between January 1989 and December 1993 from body fluids (10), throat culture (56), pus (51) and skin lesions (73) were determined. Mucoid colonial morphology was exhibited by 6.3% (12/190) of the strains on initial isolation. Type T-5,11,27,44 comprised 23.7%, followed by T-1,3,13,B3264 (11.1%), T-4,6 (8.4%) and T-8,25, Imp 19 (7.9%). About 42% (80/190) strains could not be characterized by T agglutination pattern. T-typing of 71 selected strains at WHO Collaborating Center, Minneapolis yielded similar results. Nineteen selected strains were further characterized by M-typing only three strains were M-typeable. These strains were isolated from throat (M1), sputum (M5) and pus (M12). About 68% (48/71) isolates produced serum opacity factor. These data support the existence of as yet uncharacterized group A streptococcal serotypes in this region.
