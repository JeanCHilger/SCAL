Exposure to superantigens as an immunogenetic explanation of type I diabetes mini-epidemics. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is considered to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases result from the breakdown of self-tolerance elicited by environmental factors on a susceptible genetic background. This reduced tolerance allows immunocompetent cells to attack normal structures present on an individual's tissues. The study of the T cells present in the islets of patients who died at the onset of the disease allowed the recognition of "superantigens" as etiopathogenetic factors in the development of IDDM. Since superantigens are the product of bacteria or viruses able to quickly stimulate a large number of the peripheral T cells sharing the same T cell receptor V beta segments once presented by certain HLA class II molecules, a number of observations in genetics, immunology, virology and epidemiology can now find a unifying explanation.
