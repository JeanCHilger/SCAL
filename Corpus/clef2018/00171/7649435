A single emm gene-specific oligonucleotide probe does not recognise all members of the Streptococcus pyogenes M type 1. Serological typing of the streptococcal M protein has recently been challenged by a number of unique molecular methodologies based on oligonucleotide recognition of allelic variations within the M protein (emm) gene. In these methods, stringent hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe to a polymerase chain reaction amplified emm gene is used as confirmation of specific M type identity. A sample of 17 isolates from 7 previously defined distinct genotypes were tested using a single M1 oligonucleotide probe. Isolates from only three of the genotypes hybridized with the probe. The results demonstrate that a single emm-specific oligonucleotide probe can not identify all members of M type 1, as defined by conventional serotyping using polyclonal antisera.
