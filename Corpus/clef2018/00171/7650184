Comparison of BioStar Strep A OIA optical immune assay, Abbott TestPack Plus Strep A, and culture with selective media for diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. We directly compared three techniques for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in 500 symptomatic children seen in the Emergency Department or Child Care Clinic of The Children's Hospital of Denver. Throats were vigorously swabbed with two rayon swabs, which were transported immediately to the Microbiology Laboratory. Each swab was cultured aerobically on Strep A Isolation Agar (Remel) and then tested for antigen-one swab by the Strep A OIA optical immune assay (BioStar) and the other by the TestPack Plus Strep A (Abbott) technique. Each test was performed blind to the others. The refrigerated pledget was cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth if an antigen test was positive and both direct plate cultures were negative (the "gold standard" was any culture positive). All isolates were serologically grouped. Of 500 complete patient cultures, 151 (30%) were positive for group A streptococcal growth. The two antigen tests gave comparable results with an average sensitivity of 83%. Each was significantly (P < 0.02) less sensitive than its corresponding culture. The BioStar Strep A OIA optical immune assay produced significantly (P < 0.003) more false-positive results than did the Abbott test. Rapid antigen testing is not sensitive enough to eliminate the need for backup cultures.
