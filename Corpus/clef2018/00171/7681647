Office diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis employing the rapid antigen detecting test. A 1-year prospective study of reliability and cost in primary care centres. The impact of introducing the rapid antigen detecting test for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in primary care centres and the direct and comprehensive cost-effectiveness of four alternative strategies for the management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and the prevention of rheumatic fever were assessed in a 1-year prospective randomized study, carried out in children between the ages of 5 and 14 years. Data from the study showed that the test was easy to perform and reliable when introduced as a service in primary care. The strategy of using the rapid antigen detecting test and a 10-day oral penicillin course for diagnosis and treatment proved to be the safest and most cost-effective. If compliance with a 10-day course of oral penicillin is unlikely to be achieved, the strategy of introducing the test and treatment by intramuscular benzathin penicillin G proved to be the second best cost-effective alternative. In developing countries, where acute rheumatic fever is still common and the cost of the test and a 10-day course of penicillin may prove to be formidable, a strategy of treating all children with pharyngitis with intramuscular benzathin penicillin G seems to be the most cost-effective. The strategy of diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis on clinical grounds proved to be the worst.
