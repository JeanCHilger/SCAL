M-like, immunoglobulin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes type M15. An M-like protein from Streptococcus pyogenes type M15 strain EF1949 (EMML15) was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. Recombinant EMML15 protein revealed a unique binding pattern for human IgG subclasses not described previously. Comparative analysis of the EMML15 amino acid sequence with those of other M-like proteins of opacity factor positive (OF+) serotypes and protein H, and IgG receptor from OF- serotype M1, showed that IgG-binding proteins with common binding of IgG3 were closely related and distinct from streptococcal IgG receptors not binding IgG3. Thus, the Ig-binding proteins from S. pyogenes were subdivided into two main categories according to binding pattern, protein structure, and gene location.
