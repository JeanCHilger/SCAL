Pneumococci in nasopharyngeal samples from Filipino children with acute respiratory infections. The presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract was studied in 318 Filipino children less than 5 years old with an acute lower respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from 292 children. With both quantitative bacterial culture and detection of capsular polysaccharide antigens by coagglutination, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and latex agglutination, pneumococci were found in 160 (70%) of the 227 samples eligible for analysis. Culture was positive in 115 samples and antigen was positive in 140 samples. The culture isolation rate was significantly lower if the patient had received antimicrobial agents in the 48 h prior to the sampling. The seven most common types or groups of pneumococci were 6, 14, 19, 23, 15, 7, and 11, which together accounted for 64% of all pneumococcal findings.
