Decreased T cell reactivity to trypsinized group A, type M22 streptococci in psoriasis. The proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis to streptococcal M protein were investigated using whole and trypsinized group A M22-positive streptococci. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to whole type M22 group A streptococci were significantly increased in guttate, but not chronic plaque, psoriasis patients compared to 17 non-psoriatic controls (p < 0.05 n = 17). A significant reduction of this response was observed in both guttate (p < 0.001
