Group A streptococcal antigens and superantigens in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis. Evidence from repeated clinical observations and from a variety of experimental approaches implicates group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune arthritides. Several streptococcal antigens and superantigens have now been characterized and their properties suggest that they may be involved in the mechanisms which underlie these diseases, although other antigens and superantigens yet to be discovered may also be involved. The association between group A streptococcal infection and autoimmune arthritis offers a useful model for providing a long-elusive understanding of the role of bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.
