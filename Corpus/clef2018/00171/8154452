Rapid diagnostic tests in microbiology in the 1990s. The selection and management of all diagnostic tools should be guided in the 1990s by carefully informed decisions. Concerns of test sensitivity and specificity must be balanced against cost. Although clinical judgment alone is often prompt and cost-effective, the risk of inaccuracy and serious consequences may be too great to forgo rapid diagnostic assays. The clinical effect and the imperatives in health care of the 1990s will guide the intelligent management and use of advancing rapid assay technology.
