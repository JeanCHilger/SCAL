Complement activation in newborn infants with early onset infection. The complement system is an important element in host defense. Quantitative deficiencies of total hemolytic complement activity and decreased C3 levels were reported in sera from normal neonates. However, little is known about complement activation products in the newborn. In a prospective study, complement activation products were determined in 32 healthy term neonates, in 41 neonates with colonization of their mothers, in 15 colonized neonates, and in 10 neonates with early onset infection. In all newborns, EDTA plasma was obtained within the first 6 h of life. The anaphylatoxin C3a-desArg was determined with a novel ELISA using an MAb reacting with a neoepitope of C3a-desArg. C3bBbP (alternative pathway convertase) and C1rsC1-inactivator (activation product of classical pathway) were measured with double-sandwich ELISA. C3 was determined by radial immunodiffusion. Plasma concentrations of C3a-desArg were similar in healthy term neonates and healthy adults, whereas diminished C3 levels were observed in the newborn infants. There were no significant differences between healthy neonates, neonates with colonized mothers, and colonized neonates. In neonates with infection, a significant elevation of C3a-desArg was found at the onset of the disease, resulting from alternative pathway activation. In contrast, the C1rsC1-inactivator complex showed no significant differences among healthy, colonized, and infected neonates. The anaphylatoxin C3a mediates inflammatory reactions such as vasodilatation and an increase in microvascular permeability and might therefore play an important role in severe neonatal infection.
