Evaluation of the API Coryne system for identification of Listeria species. The API Coryne system, a commercially available system for the identification of coryneform bacteria, was used to identify 103 strains of Listeria spp. from clinical and environmental sources. All isolates were identified correctly to the genus or species level, although complete characterization also required tests for beta-hemolysis and CAMP reaction.
