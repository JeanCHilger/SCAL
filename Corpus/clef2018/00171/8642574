Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in patients with infectious mononucleosis. The role of four oral flora organisms (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was investigated in 22 patients with infectious mononucleosis. Immunoglobulin-G class antibody titres to these organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels in the patients were determined at day 1 and 42-56 days later. Significantly higher antibody levels to F. nucleatum and Pr. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients as compared to their first sample. The elevated antibody levels to F. nucleatum and Pr. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in the pharyngo-tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis.
