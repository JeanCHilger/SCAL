Immunological mimicry between retinal S-antigen and group A streptococcal M proteins. Immunological mimicry between host and microbial proteins has been suggested as a potential mechanism in the development of uveitis in humans. In this study immunological crossreactivity between anti-streptococcal monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and the human eye was investigated. In indirect immunofluorescence, we demonstrated novel immunological crossreactivity of two anti-streptococcal MAbs (27 and 112) with the rod outer (and inner) segments of the retina of the human eye. In further studies, retinal S-Ag, a uveitogenic protein in the rod outer (and inner) segments, was found to react with the anti-streptococcal MAbs. In addition, several uveitogenic peptides of S-Ag were recognized by the anti-streptococcal MAbs. In the ELISA and Western immunoblot, anti-S-Ag MAbs crossreacted with group A streptococci and the streptococcal M protein further demonstrating sites of antigenic similarity. Homology between the retinal S-Ag and streptococcal M protein was observed in amino acid sequences repeated in the B repeat region of the streptococcal M5 protein. These data show that retinal S-antigen has immunological similarities with streptococcal M protein, a major virulence determinant and strong bacterial cell surface antigen.
