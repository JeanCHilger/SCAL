Molecular epidemiology of impetiginous group A streptococcal infections in aboriginal communities of northern Australia. Group A streptococcal infections among the Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory of Australia are endemic, with a concurrently high rate of the postinfection sequelae of rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The majority of the group A streptococcal isolates from the Northern Territory are not typeable by M typing. We recently developed a novel genotyping method, Vir typing. A preliminary study using this method discriminated all the M-nontypeable (MNT) isolates. Vir typing is based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the 4- to 7-kb Vir regulon of group A streptococci, which contains a number of genes, including emm (the gene for M protein). A total of 407 isolates of group A streptococci obtained from four Aboriginal communities over a 4-year period were typed by this genotyping method. Forty-two distinct genotypes were found among the isolates, including 22 among the MNT isolates. The correlation between Vir type and M type was good. This genotyping method allows the characterization of all group A streptococcal isolates from Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. We also propose that Vir typing be used in conjunction with M typing for epidemiological surveillance in geographical regions where the majority of isolates are MNT.
