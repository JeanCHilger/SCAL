Horizontal gene transfer among group A streptococci: implications for pathogenesis and epidemiology. Recent studies have revealed that there is considerable genetic diversity among the group A streptococci and that horizontal transfer and recombination of virulence genes have played a major role in generating this diversity. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these common and highly versatile human pathogens.
