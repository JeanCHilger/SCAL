Necrotizing descendent mediastinitis of oropharyngeal origin. The spread of oropharyngeal infections to the mediastinum can give rise to descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM), which causes a high rate of mortality (around 40%), particularly when diagnosis is late and drainage inadequate. In the first case we report, successful drainage of the mediastinum was achieved at the cervical and sub-xiphisternum levels and by thoracotomy. Given the condition of the second patient, transcervical drainage alone was considered the best option, but this treatment was inadequate. Rapid start of appropriate drainage of the mediastinum is of great importance. Cervical drains, which may be adequate when there is perforation of the cervical esophagus, is insufficient in DNM, which calls for more aggressive, early drainage, such as can be achieved by thoracotomy. Computerized axial tomography of the chest is essential for rapid diagnosis, to plan the most appropriate surgical approach and for follow-up and evaluation of drainage.
