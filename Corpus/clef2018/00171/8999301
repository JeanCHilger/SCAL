Evaluation of the Respiralex test for rapid isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes directly from throat swabs. Results obtained by fast Respiraplex test were compared with findings of classical method of cultivation in order to assess possibilities of this test in isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes directly in the throat swab. The sensitivity of the fast test was 79.4% specificity 100%. On the basis of gathered results, the following can be concluded: the fast test cannot completely substitute the classic method of cultivation although high specificity occurs, because of low sensitivity especially in patients with small number of colonies in the culture.
