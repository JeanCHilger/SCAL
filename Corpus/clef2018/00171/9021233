Incidence and studies on antigenic specificities of antineutrophil-cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Sera from 210 patients with Acute Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and 14 patients with streptococcal impetigo without glomerular disease were tested for the presence of IgG-ANCA using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) on ethanol fixed normal human neutrophils. In the group of nephritic patients, ANCA were detected by IIF in 9% (18 out of 210 cases) in an atypical diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (a-ANCA) in 14 cases and in a (p-ANCA) perinuclear staining in the remaining 4 cases. Longitudinal studies performed on six IIF positive patients, showed persistence of the phenomenon for up to six months, without relationship with activity of disease. No patient with streptococcal impetigo showed positivity on the IIF assay. Positive sera were analyzed on ELISA plates for their IgG reactivity against specific purified ANCA antigens: Proteinase-3 (PR3), Myeloperoxidase (MPO). Cathepsin-G and Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein (BPI). Anti-MPO antibodies were present in 4 cases (3 a-ANCA and 1 p-ANCA). No reactivity was identified against PR-3, BPI and Catepsin-G in any of the samples. The presence of ANCA was significantly associated with a more severe glomerular disease as assessed by the serum creatinine and the crescents formation. Further studies are required to identify other antigenic specificities of these autoantibodies. Their absence in the streptococcal impetigo control group might suggest that their presence in APSGN could play some pathogenic role in kidney disease.
