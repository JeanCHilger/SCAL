Headache etiology in a pediatric emergency department. Headache may be the presenting complaint of serious diagnoses such as meningitis, brain tumor, or shunt malfunction, yet no previous studies have examined the spectrum of diagnoses for the pediatric emergency department (ED) population with a chief complaint of headache.In 1993, 53,988 visits were made to the ED of an urban children's hospital. Six hundred ninety-six patients (1.3%) had a chief complaint of headache. Half of these visits, distributed randomly throughout the year, were chosen for review total sample size was 288.Patient age ranged from two to 18 years (2-5 years, 24.3% 6-12 years, 57.6%Serious conditions presenting with the chief complaint of headache in the pediatric ED were not common in our population. The most frequent diagnoses in our review were viral illness, sinusitis, and migraine, in contrast to adult studies in which tension headache and migraine were most common. Only 6.6% of patients had serious neurologic diagnoses, which is in the range reported for general EDs. Of the serious conditions in our study, 80% were viral meningitis.
