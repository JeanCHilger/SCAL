Immunologic and clinical correlations in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. The intimate relationship of Streptococcus pyogenes and rheumatic fever is well-established, but the precise pathogenesis of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease continues to elude intense investigative efforts by students of the disease worldwide. Technologic advances in molecular biology, not thought possible two decades ago, have given additional insight into the immunologic aspects of the disease. On the clinical side echocardiography has proved to be a marvelous, non-invasive technique to evaluate cardiac anatomy and function. We are now able to gain a closer correlation of the clinical presentation and the autoimmune response. The increased understanding acquired both from the "bench" and the "bedside" are making this perplexing disease somewhat less mysterious. We seem tantalizingly close to grasping a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.
