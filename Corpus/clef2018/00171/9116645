Antigenic epitope mapping of the M24 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes: implications for serodiagnosis of rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever continues to be a significant problem in Australian Aboriginal communities and developing countries worldwide. Early diagnosis could facilitate the institution of penicillin prophylaxis resulting in the prevention of recurrences of rheumatic fever. An overlapping biotinylated peptide bank of 82 peptides, based on the known sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes M24 protein, was used in a standard enzyme immunoassay. A total of 82 sera were tested from both aboriginal and non-aboriginal subjects with clinically proven rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease and matched controls. Two peptides with significant sequence homology at the C-terminal end were found to be discriminatory between aboriginal cases and controls. It is proposed that these peptides could be the basis of a serological test for rheumatic fever.
