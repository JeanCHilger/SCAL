Streptococcus B meningitis in post-partum. We report a case of post-partum meningitis due to group B-streptococcus developing 24 h after vaginal delivery. Diagnosis was established by latex agglutination of streptococcus B-antigenes and confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid-culture later on. Clinical and haematological signs of meningitis disappeared after treatment with ampicillin. In a review of the literature we found eight other cases of streptococcal post-partum meningitis. In all of these cases, delivery was vaginal and no antibioprophylaxis was given.
