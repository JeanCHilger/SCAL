C repeats of the streptococcal M1 protein achieve the human serum albumin binding ability by flanking regions which stabilize the coiled-coil conformation. The M and M-like proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes are fibrous cell surface proteins. They have multiple binding sites for several human proteins and are composed of the C-terminal anchor domain, the alpha-helical coiled-coil domain, and the N-terminal non-coiled-coil domain. The coiled-coil domain of the M1 protein consists of repeat units called B, C, and D and a spacer unit S between B and C. Recombinant fragments A-B-S-C-D, A-B-S, B-S-C, S-C, S-C-D, C-D, and C of the coiled-coil domain were studied by analyzing their secondary structures and binding affinities to human serum albumin (HSA). As shown by circular dichroism, all fragments are in an alpha-helical conformation. C-D and S-C-D form coiled coils at room temperature and bind below 37 degrees C with high affinity to HSA. C-D and S-C-D unfold in two steps with Tm values of approximately 31 and approximately 65 degrees C complex formation with HSA increases the unfolding temperatures. B-S-C has a lower alpha-helical content, a less pronounced coiled-coil conformation, and a reduced thermal stability, binds HSA weaker, and is only slightly stabilized by HSA binding in comparison to C-D and S-C-D. C and S-C are less stable than the other fragments and are not organized as coiled coils showing some features of alpha-helical single strands only below 20 degrees C, and binding of HSA was not observed. The results indicate that the formation of coiled-coil structures, supported by flanking D regions and, to a lesser extent also B regions, is essential for the binding of C repeat units to HSA.
