Identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci to the species level by PCR. A PCR assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus gordonii, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) to the group level was developed. This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.
