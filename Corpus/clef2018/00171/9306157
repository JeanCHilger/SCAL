Kinetics of specific salivary IgA responses in man after oral challenge by ribosomal immunostimulant. The kinetics of specific IgA mucosal responses was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers over 3 weeks of treatment by oral administration of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, composed of ribosomes from the four bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The levels of IgA specific for these four bacteria increased after each immunization and, after the third week of treatment, were significantly higher than baseline day 0 values. This study demonstrates that oral ribosomal immunostimulation results in the production of specific salivary antibodies liable to recognize whole bacteria antigens, and therefore likely to confer protection. The kinetic analysis performed also demonstrates the rapidity of specific mucosal immune responses after oral stimulation in man, a feature still seldom explored.
