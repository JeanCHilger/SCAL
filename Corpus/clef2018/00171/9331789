Group A and group B streptococcal vaccine development. A round table presentation. The data presented above provide a broad overview of ongoing work to develop vaccines against group A and group B streptococcal infections. The encouraging results of human trials with conjugate group B polysaccharide vaccines suggest that this approach will lead to a safe and effective method for preventing these devastating infections in newborn infants. The results of preclinical studies of the various strategies to develop group A streptococcal vaccines are also encouraging. Whether one approach will be more advantageous or efficacious than another will need to await clinical trials. Nevertheless, we predict that in the next decade we will make significant strides in preventing streptococcal infections and their complications.
