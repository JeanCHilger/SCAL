Immunoglobulins inhibit adherence and internalization of Streptococcus pyogenes to human pharyngeal cells. Purified human sIgA against group A streptococci inhibited streptococcal adherence to pharyngeal cells whereas rabbit serum raised against the whole M+ strain did not. Of note, inhibition of adherence by sIgA occurred despite a much lower immunreactivity against the M6 protein as compared to the hyperimmune serum against the whole M+ strain. The M protein does probably not mediate the adherence of group A streptococci to respiratory cells, as shown by previous studies. However, since the isogenic M- derivative was less invasive to human pharyngeal cells than the M+ strain, our invasion experiments suggest that the M protein may play a role in internalization of group A streptococci into eukaryotic cells. More importantly, internalization and not adherence could be blocked by rabbit serum immunized with recombinant M6 protein.
