Otitis media and tonsillitis--2 of the most frequent pediatric diagnoses. Acute otitis media and tonsillopharyngitis are two of the most common diseases in pediatric clinical practice. Careful examination of the ears and the tonsils are mandatory in the evaluation of a febrile child. Acute otitis media usually can be diagnosed by a carefully taken history and examination alone. The infection usually requires antibiotic treatment, with amoxicillin being still recommended as the first choice drug. Pharyngitis and tonsillitis are more variable in their origin, the majority of cases is caused by different viruses. However, clinical examination alone is not specific enough to rule out the most important bacterial pathogen, group A streptococcus, which still has to be treated by penicillins. Thus, rapid test methods and classic bacteriological culture are used to assess group A streptococcus infections. Infectious mononucleosis and diphtheria are the most important diseases to be considered carefully in each patient.
