Potential diagnostic role of renal sonography in acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) "with minimal urinary signs". The Authors studied 8 patients with an average age of eight and a half affected with G.N.A.P.S. with "minimum urinary signs". A renal ecography carried out in a diagnostic approach showed in 7 cases out of 8 the constant presence of an increased volume of the kidney, associated with hyperecogenicity and 3rd degree thickening of the cortical. They conclude that this information could be of great use for a rapid diagnostic orientation in forms of G.N.A.P.S. "with minimum urinary signs".
