Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome secondary to infection with neuraminidase producing Streptococcus pneumoniae is well recognised, but was previously considered to be rare. This case report describes the course of a 9-month-old male with pneumococcal pneumonia, T activation and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. The clinical features of three other cases treated in Southeast Queensland in the past 2 years and 12 previously reported cases are summarised. The widespread availability of rapid diagnostic testing for this entity should allow for increased recognition, enabling appropriate use of low plasma volume blood products with improved patient outcome.
