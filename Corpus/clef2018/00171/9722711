Helicobacter pylori: the mouth, stomach, and gut axis. The aim of this study was to identify the natural reservoir and route of transmission of Helicobacter pylori infection. Two hundred eight (208) dyspeptic patients (114 males, 94 females peak age of cohort, 50-59.9) were recruited. Specimens were collected from saliva, supra- and subgingival dental plaque, tongue scrapings, and oropharyngeal swabs. At subsequent endoscopy, gastric antral biopsy was performed for the rapid urease test (RUT), microbiological culture, and, in some patients, histology. Gastric juice samples were aspirated, and in 50 patients duodenal aspirate was collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers targeted to the 16S rRNA sequence of H. pylori was also employed for each of the specimens. In those patients where H. pylori was detected from multiple sites (dental plaque, gastric juice, gastric biopsy, and duodenal aspirate), restriction endonuclease digestion with Hae III was performed to determine if they were epidemiologically linked. The results indicated that 15/208 patients (7%) tested positively for H. pylori by PCR in dental plaque
