Diagnostic value of rapid streptococcal antigen test provided by Abbott "test pack strep A": current report. The upper respiratory tract infections are the most frequent infectious diseases in human. Beta haemolytic streptococcus group A is the most common etiologic factor of bacterial pharyngitis. Delayed or inadequate treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis can cause serious subsequent complications. Only a part of patients show typical features of the disease so that the diagnosis can be based on clinical appearance alone. For this reason we propose direct antigen test as a rapid useful method which allows detection of group A streptococci in throat swabs. The aim of the study is to estimate clinical value of rapid antigen test in differential diagnosis of pharyngitis in children and adults. We have performed 50 tests using commercial kit--Abbott Test Pack Strep A. Simultaneously conventional bacterial throat cultures were performed. The comparison of results acquired by both methods did not revealed any differences.
