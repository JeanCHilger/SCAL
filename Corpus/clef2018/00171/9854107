Evaluation of the oxoid dryspot streptococcal grouping kit for grouping beta-hemolytic streptococci. The latex agglutination kits that are widely used for grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci in clinical laboratories use liquid latex suspensions. The Oxoid Dryspot kit (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom) uses predispensed latex dried onto reaction cards or cardboard strips. All streptococci of groups A (85 strains), B (87 strains), C (30 strains), D (38 strains), F (23 strains), and G (65 strains) were correctly grouped by using these reagents. The Oxoid Dryspot Streptococcal Grouping kit is a reliable method for grouping of the beta-hemolytic streptococci encountered in clinical laboratories.
