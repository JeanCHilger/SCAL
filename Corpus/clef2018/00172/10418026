Value of a rapid screening technique for vaginal carriage of group B Streptococcus during hig-risk pregnancies. Vaginal colonization by Group B streptococci (GBS) during pregnancy is associated with lige-threatening neonatal infections acquired during passage through the birth canal. Factors associated with an increased risk of GBS transmission to the neonate include prematurity, premature spontaneous rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks of gestational age, prolonged (> 12 h) rupture of the membranes at full term, fever in the mother, multiple pregnancy, and a history of GBS infection. A study was conducted to evaluate the performance characteristics of a rapid GBS screening test comparatively with conventional microbiological cultures. The 113 high-risk women admitted for delivery to the obstetrics department of the Charleville-Mézières Hospital from January to May 1998 were included in the study. Vaginal specimens were examined by both the Strep B OIA test (International Microbio) and by conventional culturing. Comparison of the results of these two methods showed that sensitivity and specificity of the Strep B OIA test were satisfactory. The Strep B OIA test is a rapid test suitable for use in emergency situations. A positive result should lead to intrapartum prophylactic antimicrobial therapy.
