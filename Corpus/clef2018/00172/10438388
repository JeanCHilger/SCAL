Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of glycoconjugate vaccines against group B Streptococcus types VI and VIII. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) types VI and VIII are prevalent among serotypes isolated from pregnant women in Japan. Maternal vaccination with a safe and effective GBS vaccine has been proposed as a rational approach to prevent neonatal GBS disease. Because antibody specific for the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) antigens of GBS is protective, vaccines were developed with purified type VI and VIII CPS coupled to tetanus toxoid. In rabbits the newly synthesized conjugate vaccines elicited high-titered, type-specific antibody that was opsonically active in vitro. Moreover, litters born to mice actively vaccinated with the conjugate vaccines, in contrast to uncoupled CPS or saline, were protected against an ordinarily lethal challenge of GBS of homologous serotype. GBS types VI and VIII conjugate vaccines of the design presented may be important components of a multivalent GBS vaccine for use in regions where these serotypes predominate.
