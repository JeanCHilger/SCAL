Rapid streptococcal testing in Vietnamese children with pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis has been a significant public health problem in Vietnam for many years. Accurate diagnosis of the infection, however, has been difficult. We carried out a clinical trial of a rapid streptococcal antigen detection test (Quick-Vue (R) Flex Strep A) on a population of 777 children with pharyngitis seen at the Institute for the Protection of Children's Health (Children's Hospital) in Hanoi, Vietnam. Bacterial culture was performed in parallel with the rapid test on simultaneously obtained throat swab specimens. The rapid test was found to be 89% sensitive and 92% specific (96% in children not on prior antibiotics) compared to culture. The test was also found to be convenient and acceptable to patients and clinicians. A significant benefit of the test is that those children found positive are more likely to be treated with penicillin rather than a broad spectrum antimicrobial, which in turn will reduce the likelihood of resistant infections in the future.
