Development of antigen detection assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis using sputum samples. The rising incidence of tuberculosis worldwide means an increasing burden on diagnostic facilities, so tests simpler than Ziehl-Neelsen staining are needed. Such tests should be objective, reproducible, and have at least as good a detection limit as 10(4) bacteria/ml. A capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detection of lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in human sputum samples. As a capture antibody, we used a murine monoclonal antibody against LAM, with rabbit antiserum against Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a source of detector antibodies. The sensitivity of the capture ELISA was evaluated by using purified LAM and M. tuberculosis whole cells. We were able to detect 1 ng of purified LAM/ml and 10(4) M. tuberculosis whole cells/ml. LAM could also be detected in culture filtrate of a 3-week-old culture of M. tuberculosis. The culture filtrate contained approximately 100 microgram of LAM/ml. The detection limit in sputum pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and proteinase K was 10(4) M. tuberculosis whole cells per ml. Thirty-one (91%) of 34 sputum samples from 18 Vietnamese patients with tuberculosis (32 smear positive and 2 smear negative) were positive in the LAM detection assay. In contrast, none of the 25 sputum samples from 21 nontuberculous patients was positive. This specific and sensitive assay for the detection of LAM in sputum is potentially useful for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
