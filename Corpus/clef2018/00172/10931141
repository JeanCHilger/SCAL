Autoantibodies in the sera of patients with rheumatic heart disease: characterization of myocardial antigens by two-dimensional immunoblotting and N-terminal sequence analysis. The concept of antigenic mimicry in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic fever has been under investigation for decades and the range of cross-reactive tissue antigens for streptococcal-induced antibodies identified in rheumatic heart disease is still expanding. To identify heart tissue-reactive antigens which may be implicated in the secondary immunopathogenesis of rheumatic fever, sera from 56 patients with acute rheumatic heart disease were probed in two-dimensional Western blots for reactivity against heart tissue antigens. After two-dimensional immunoblot analysis, proteins were submitted to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. This analysis identified creatine kinase, two mitochondrial proteins and, at a low level, various stress proteins as cross-reactive myocardial antigens. Therefore, in addition to myosin, creatine kinase may represent another major antigen for autoreactive antibodies in rheumatic heart disease. Mitochondrial proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease for some years, and in this study we have identified two mitochondrial proteins as relevant antigens in rheumatic heart disease.
