Prevention of nonspecific reactions on reversed passive latex agglutination assay (RPLA) for detecting low amounts of staphylococcal enterotoxins. The SET-RPLA, from Denka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokio, a commercial reversed passive latex agglutination test kit, has been recommended to establish the enterotoxicity capacity of some staphylococcal strains, implicated in food poisoning outbreaks that produce low levels of enterotoxins (SE). Despite the RPLA specificity, the occurrence of nonspecific reactions when testing low-SE-producing is common. In order to control these nonspecific reactions the addition of purified normal rabbit IgG purified was applied on approximately 350 staphylococcal isolates from human milk and anatomic sites of healthy dental student carriers. The results indicated that addition of 5% (v/v) of purified normal rabbit IgG (0.74 mg/mL) to the culture supernatant fluid is a simple and reliable tool for the controlling of nonspecific reactions in the RPLA assay.
