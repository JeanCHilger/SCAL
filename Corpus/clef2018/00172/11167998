Serial analysis of serum and ascitic fluid levels of soluble adhesion molecules and chemokines in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The aim of this work was the evaluation of serum and ascitic fluid levels of chemokines (IL-8, growth-regulated oncogene (Gro-alpha), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)), and of soluble adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin, L-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)) in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). These compounds were serially analysed in serum and ascitic fluid by ELISA in patients with SBP (n = 20), non-infected cirrhotic controls (n = 12), and healthy controls (n = 15). Infected and non-infected cirrhotic patients showed significantly higher serum levels of adhesion molecules. SBP was associated with significantly higher serum and ascitic fluid levels of IL-8, Gro-alpha and ICAM-1 and with ascitic fluid concentrations of MCP-1. Significantly elevated serum levels of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were detected in patient non-survivors after SBP. Thus, higher ascitic fluid levels of chemokines could be implicated in the peritoneal infiltrate in patients with SBP. Prognostic significance can be attributed to serum levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in these patients.
