PCR m typing: a new method for rapid typing of group a streptococci. A new approach for the M-typing of Streptococcus pyogenes is reported. Oligonucleotide primers were used in a PCR to amplify the N-terminal region of the emm gene. The presence of the PCR amplification product is associated with the corresponding M serotype. This technique offers potential advantages over other molecular typing methods.
