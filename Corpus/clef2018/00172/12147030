Acute nosocomial HCV infection detected by NAT of a regular blood donor. Routine HCV NAT of blood donors to detect persons in the preseroconversion phase of acute infection was introduced in Canada in October 1999. The source of virus exposure was investigated in the first, and to date only, blood donor found to be HCV NAT positive, anti-HCV negative in Canada. He was a regular donor with none of the commonly reported risk factors for HCV infection.Epidemiologic follow-up revealed that the blood donor had received antibiotics at an outpatient IV clinic 5 weeks before donation. IV solution bags and tubing for individual patients were stored in the clinic, and then the same equipment was used each time the patient returned for the next dose of antibiotics until it was replaced after every 72-hour period. Among eight other patients whose clinic visitation times overlapped was a man with chronic HCV infection. Genomic sequencing of HCV isolates from the blood donor, the patient with chronic hepatitis C, and local controls was carried out to study possible nosocomial infection.Genomic sequencing showed a high degree of relatedness in the hypervariable region of HCV isolates from the blood donor and putative source patient as compared with controls. Detailed molecular analysis of quasispecies of the HCV isolates further indicated that viruses from the two individuals were genetically very close to each other.The introduction of routine screening of blood donors by HCV NAT was directly responsible for the early detection and investigation of an unusual case of HCV infection involving a regular donor. Genomic sequencing studies provided firm evidence of patient-to-patient transmission of HCV in an IV clinic. The report clearly demonstrates the value of molecular fingerprinting in tracking nosocomial HCV infections.
