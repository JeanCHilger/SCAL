Evaluation of methods to increase the sensitivity and timeliness of detection of Streptococcus agalactiae in pregnant women. Direct culture of rectovaginal specimens on Granada agar was compared to culture on sheep blood agar plate (SBAP) and AccuProbe detection of group B streptococcus from overnight LIM broth enhancement cultures (LIM-SBAP). Both broth-enhanced methods demonstrated excellent sensitivity (97.5% for LIM-SBAP and 93.5% for AccuProbe), while Granada agar demonstrated a sensitivity of only 40.3%.
