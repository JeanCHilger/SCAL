M protein gene type distribution among group A streptococcal clinical isolates recovered in Mexico City, Mexico, from 1991 to 2000, and Durango, Mexico, from 1998 to 1999: overlap with type distribution within the United States. To examine the type distribution of pathogenic group A streptococcal (GAS) strains in Mexico, we determined the emm types of 423 GAS isolates collected from ill patients residing in Mexico (Durango or Mexico City). These included 282 throat isolates and 107 isolates from normally sterile sites. Of the other isolates, 38 were recovered from other miscellaneous infections. A total of 31 different emm types were found, revealing a broad overlap between commonly occurring emm types in Mexico and the United States. The information obtained in this study is consistent with the possibility that multivalent, M type-specific vaccines prepared for GAS strain distribution within the United States could theoretically protect against the majority of GAS strains causing disease in the two cities surveyed in Mexico.
