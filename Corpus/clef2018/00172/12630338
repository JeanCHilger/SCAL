Incidence and distribution of Streptococcus pyogenes type M in patients treated at the Dr. Fran Mihaljević Infectious Disease Clinic in Zagreb from 1990 to 1996. The aim of this study was to estimate the changes in the appearance and distribution of M types of Streptococcus pyogenes in different cultures from 78 patients treated during the 1990-1996 period at the Dr. Fran Mihaljević University Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb.Isolates were characterized by the T-agglutination pattern and M type and/or opacity factor type using the standards recommended by two World Health Organization Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on streptococci from Minneapolis and Prague.In this study, 19% (15/79) of isolates were recovered from normally sterile sites, 26.6% (21/79) came from skin and 54.4% (43/79) from throat swabs. In one patient isolates from the skin and blood culture were analyzed. Of all, 92.4% (73/79) of the isolates were typed by T-agglutination pattern and 73.5% (58/79) by M protein and/or OF typing. The results of M typing showed 14 M types: M1, M3, M4, M5, M6, M11, M12, M28, M57, M58, M60, M75, M76 and M78. The most commonly isolated types were M1 and M3 (13.8%, 8/58 each), followed by M28 found in 12.1% (7/58), and M6 and M12 in 10.3% (6/58) each. These five M types accounted for 60.3% (35/58) of all isolates. Analysis to changes in the distribution of M1 and M3 types during the 1990-1991 and 1992-1993 periods revealed a significantly greater proportion of M1 and M3 isolates in the former (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.018). A significantly greater proportion of M1 and M3 isolates was also recorded in the 1990-1991, than in 1994-1996 period. (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, P = 0.021). It was investigated whether Streptococcus pyogenes M1 and M3 types were associated with toxic and invasive infection. There were 28.2% (22/78) of patients with toxic and invasive infection: 31.9% (7/22) of them with the diagnosis of scarlet fever, whereas 68.1% (15/22) of the strains were obtained from normally sterile sites. There were 45.5% (10/22) of M1 and M3 types from patients with toxic and invasive infections. Types M6, M28 and M76 were found in an equal proportion of 9.1% (2/22), and M4, M12 and M 60 of 4.5% (1/22) each. In three strains, M type could not be identified (T8/25 SOR+, T25 SOR+ and T11 SOR+). M1 and M3 types were isolated from 10.3% (6/56) of patients with other streptococcal infections. A significantly greater proportion of M1 and M3 types was recorded in patients with toxic and invasive infections than in those with other streptococcal infections (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.004). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess whether the increased proportion of streptococcal M types 1 and 3 was associated with the 1990-1991 period, or with the infection characteristics.The changes in the distribution of M types 1 and 3 were found to be significantly associated only with toxic and invasive infections (odds ratio 4.35, p = 0.025). Odds ratio suggests that patients with toxic and invasive infections had a 4.35--fold increased risk of infections caused by types M1 and M3 found in patients with other streptococcal infections. The increased proportion of M types 1 and 3 during the 1990-1991 period was more significantly associated with the characteristics of infection than with the study period.
