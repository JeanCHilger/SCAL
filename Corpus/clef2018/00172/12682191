drs (Distantly related sic) gene polymorphisms among emm12-type Streptococcus pyogenes isolates. Twenty-eight emm12-type Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections or from asymptomatic carriers were genetically typed. Sequencing of drs (distantly related sic [streptococcal inhibitor of complement]) genes identified two novel alleles and revealed a polymorphism for drs similar to that of sic. No association was observed between the five different drs alleles and the five restriction patterns of the vir regulon for the isolates studied. These data suggest that drs sequencing may be useful for further differentiation of S. pyogenes isolates with emm12 and identical vir regulon restriction patterns.
