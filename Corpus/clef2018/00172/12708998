IgG class antibodies to heat shock-induced streptococcal antigens in psoriatic patients. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Probably autoimmune in nature, and associated with streptococcal throat infections as a triggering factor. Although many groups have associated the disease with other pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes seems to be the most important microorganism related to this disease. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the streptococcal antigens involved in the process.In this work IgG class antibodies to soluble antigens obtained from Staphyloccus aureus, Candica albicans or S. pyogenes before and after heat shock induction, were analyzed by ELISA in 28 psoriatic patients and 30 healthy donors.In all cases, the patients and the controls had IgG class antibodies to the four antigens. Nevertheless, the IgG levels to the heat shock-induced S. pyognes were statistically different between the patients and the controls (P < 0.001). There was no difference between the groups when the IgG antibodies to the other antigens, including the noninduced streptococcal extract, were analyzed. Additionally, anti-streptolysin O titers and throat cultures were carried out in all patients and controls. No differences between ASO titers were found but the patients were more frequently colonized by pyogenes.Results obtained in this study suggest that heat shock-induced proteins from S. pyogenes are associated with psoriasis.
