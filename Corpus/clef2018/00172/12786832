The effects of ultraviolet B treatment on the expression of adhesion molecules by circulating T lymphocytes in psoriasis. T lymphocytes are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis > 80% of T lymphocytes that infiltrate psoriatic lesions express the surface glycoprotein cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), compared with < 20% in the blood. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) B is an effective treatment for psoriasis.To compare the effects of UVB treatment of psoriasis on the expression of CLA and several other surface markers expressed by circulating T lymphocytes.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from psoriatic patients were stained for adhesion molecules and stimulated with streptococcal antigens before and once weekly during 3 weeks of UVB treatment.A marked and progressive decrease was observed during the treatment in expression of the CLA and the very late antigen-4alpha by T cells this decrease correlated closely with clinical improvement (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index). T-cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was not significantly affected during the treatment and no change was observed in the activation markers CD25 and CD69 or lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation with streptococcal antigens or superantigens.UVB treatment is associated with a marked reduction in the expression of skin-homing molecules by circulating T cells. This may be relevant to the therapeutic effect of UVB in psoriasis.
