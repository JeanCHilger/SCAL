Demonstration of PGL-I & LAM-B antigens in paraffin sections of leprosy skin lesions. An investigation on the demonstration of PGL-I and LAM-B antigens in thirty-four paraffin embedded skin biopsies taken from leprosy patients who covered the whole spectrum of the disease and in four control specimens was carried out. Neither the PGL-I antigen nor the LAM-B antigen was demonstrated in the normal skin specimens that were used as negative control and only the LAM-B antigen appeared in the tuberculosis specimens in which the PGL-I antigen was negative. The PGL-I antigen was demonstrated on thirty-three leprosy samples except one TT sample and the LAM-B antigen, on all samples by immunochemical staining technique. The antigens were identified as intracytoplasmic bacillary staining, in solitary, granular as well as debris patterns
