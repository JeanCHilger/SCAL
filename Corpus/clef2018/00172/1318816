Immune-mediated neuropathy and myopathy in post-streptococcal disease: electron-microscopical, morphometrical and immunohistochemical studies. A 22-year-old man suffered from a complete flaccid tetraparesis and an immune complex-mediated rapid progressive glomerulonephritis after group A streptococcal infection. Serum creatine kinase was excessively elevated and myoglobinuria occurred. Nerve conduction studies revealed evidence of axonal neuropathy. Recovery was satisfactory within 18 months. Sural nerve and peroneus muscle biopsies were performed in the 4th and 14th week of the disease. Light microscopy of the sural nerve showed an incipient axonal type of neuropathy in the first biopsy. Ultrastructurally, Wallerian degeneration and endoneurial inflammatory cells were present. In the muscle biopsy, few atrophic fibers and altered blood vessels without further anomalies were found. In the second sural nerve biopsy, macrophages were numerous, some of which were immunoreactive for HLA-DR, and only a few myelinated and some unmyelinated nerve fibers remained. Muscle fibers in the second biopsy showed high-grade atrophy and myofibrillar abnormalities. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse endoneurial immunoglobulin deposition in the first sample, while in the later biopsy specimen, deposits of IgG, and kappa and lambda light chains were visible in circumscribed endoneurial areas. Immune-mediated neuropathy and myopathy are not well-known complications of streptococcal disease. This is, to our knowledge, the first detailed report on morphological findings in muscle and nerve in such a disorder.
