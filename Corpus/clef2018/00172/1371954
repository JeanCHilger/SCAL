Specific inhibition of mRNA accumulation for lymphokines in human T cell line Jurkat by mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan antigen. The immunomodulatory effect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived lipoarabinomannan (LAM) on mitogen/antigen-induced expression of mRNAs for a number of cytokines in human monocytic cell line Mono-Mac-6 and in T cell line Jurkat was investigated. Interestingly, LAM exhibited a down-regulatory effect on the accumulation of mRNAs for IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) in T cells co-stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin-P (PHA) and 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristyl-13-acetate (PMA). In human Mono-Mac-6 cells. LAM has a weak inhibitory effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mRNA accumulation for IL-1 beta, a slight stimulatory effect on mRNAs accumulation for IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but clearly no effect on mRNA accumulation for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). These findings imply that LAM may contribute to the immunologic defects associated with a number of mycobacterial infections by modulating these mediators.
