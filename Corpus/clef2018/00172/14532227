National Department of Defense surveillance data for antibiotic resistance and emm gene types of clinical group A streptococcal isolates from eight basic training military sites. Antibiotic resistance and emm gene types were examined from 692 Group A streptococci isolates from eight United States military basic training sites between 1998 and 2001. Macrolide resistance was associated with geographic sites and emm type. These data are useful for vaccine development initiatives and antimicrobial treatment considerations.
