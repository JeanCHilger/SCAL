Influenza and other viral respiratory infections. Since the discovery of influenza virus in 1933, many viruses have been reported as the causative agents of acute respiratory infections. On the other hand, disease entities such as influenza, common cold, pharyngitis and atypical pneumonia etc. are recognized and established clinically. Recent development and popularization of rapid diagnostic kit of influenza and anti-influenzal drugs(amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitor) in Japan made the concern of influenza more concretly. The discrepancy between clinically diagnosed influenza and virologically confirmed influenza is discussed for treatment and prevention of influenza in practice.
