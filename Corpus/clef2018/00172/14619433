Clinical characteristic of the elderly in influenza infection. Influenza is a serious disease for the elderly. Although influenza causes a high fever in the elderly similar to that of healthy adults, the cough lasts longer but frequency and degree of sore throat and coryza are lower in the elderly. A characteristic of influenza in the elderly is a high frequency of pneumonia complications. Decreased serum albumin level is a good indicator of the risk of post-influenza pneumonia. Rapid diagnosis kits have contributed to better diagnosis of influenza in clinical practice. In addition to amantadine, newly developed neuraminidase inhibitors are available for treatment of influenza. These drugs can mitigate various symptoms efficiently and hasten recovery. To treat influenza in the elderly, not only are prophylaxis and treatment of pneumonia important, but management of the general health condition is essential.
