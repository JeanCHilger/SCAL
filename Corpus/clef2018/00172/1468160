Failure to detect unique reactivity to streptococcal streptokinase in either the sera or renal biopsy specimens of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Using purified group A streptokinase (SKA) as the antigen, ELISA assays were carried out on the sera of normal unaffected children, acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis patients (APSGN) and acute rheumatic fever patients (ARF). The results demonstrate that antibody titers to SKA increase with age in normal children and by age 8 years the vast majority of children have antibodies to SKA. APSGN patients did not demonstrate unique reactivity to SKA when compared to ARF patients either at time of onset of disease or during convalescence. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to SKA which recognize both group A and C streptokinase failed to detect the presence of streptokinase in the biopsy sections obtained from ten well-documented APSGN patients. We conclude that there is no unique reactivity to group A streptokinase in the sera of APSGN patients. Furthermore, we failed to demonstrate the presence of streptokinase in the biopsy specimens of an early case of APSGN patients.
