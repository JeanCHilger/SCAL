Development of a sandwich-dot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detection in cerebrospinal fluid. A new sandwich dot-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (sdot-ELISA) was developed using omniserum prepared against different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae as capture antibody and also as second or revealing antibody after its conjugation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for detection of pneumococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 103 CSF samples of different categories were screened with newly developed dot-ELISA and results were compared with commercially available latex agglutination (LA) kit. The newly developed sdot-ELISA was more sensitive than LA test and can be used as an alternative diagnostic tool in laboratory and in field conditions. An added advantage of this ELISA system was that it did not require antibodies produced in two different animal species.
