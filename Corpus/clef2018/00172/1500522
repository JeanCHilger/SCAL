Comparison of three methods for detection of group A streptococci in throat swabs. Group A streptococci are generally detected in throat swabs by (i) rapid antigen tests, (ii) conventional culture, or (iii) combinations of both. Direct fluorescent-antibody testing of a 2-h enrichment broth (FA/EN) was an accepted method for same-day results before the advent of rapid antigen tests. We compared FA/EN in Todd-Hewitt Broth (THB) with conventional culture and a rapid antigen test, TestPack Strep A (TPS). Nine hundred seventy specimens were evaluated in this study. Cultures were performed for 48 h on sheep blood agar (SBA) incubated aerobically and on a selective agar for group A streptococci (SSA) incubated in 5 to 10% CO2. Following a 2-h incubation, the fluorescent-antibody test was performed. A subculture of the centrifuged sediment from the THB enrichment was also done. In comparison with a positive culture on SBA or SSA or subculture of the THB pellet, the sensitivities and specificities of the different methods were as follows: SBA, 92 and 100% SSA, 92 and 100%
