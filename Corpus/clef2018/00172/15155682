Role of Streptococcus pyogenes two-component response regulators in the temporal control of Mga and the Mga-regulated virulence gene emm. We examined the role of Streptococcus pyogenes two-component response regulators (SptR) in expression of Mga and the Mga-regulated gene emm. Both serotype M6 and serotype M1 mutants in 12 of the 13 identified sptR genes exhibited levels of emm transcripts and Mga protein comparable to those of the wild type during exponential and stationary phases of growth. Thus, temporal control of these virulence genes does not require Spt response regulators.
