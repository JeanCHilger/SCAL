Group A streptococcal vaccine delivery by immunization with a self-adjuvanting M protein-based lipid core peptide construct. To develop a broad strain coverage GAS vaccine, several strategies have been investigated which included multi-epitope approaches as well as targeting the M protein conserved Cregion. These approaches, however, have relied on the use of adjuvants that are toxic for human application. The development of safe and effective adjuvants for human use is a key issue in the development of effective vaccines. In this study, we investigated the lipid polylysine core peptide (LCP) system as a self-adjuvanting GAS vaccine delivery approach.An LCP-GAS construct was synthesised incorporating multiple copies of a protective peptide epitope (J8) from the conserved carboxy terminal C-repeat region of the M protein. B10.BR mice were immunized parenterally with the LCP-J8 construct, with or without conventional adjuvant, prior to the assessment of immunogenicity and the induction of serum opsonic antibodies.Our data demonstrated immunogenicity of LCP-J8 when coadministered in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), or administered in the absence of conventional adjuvant. In both cases, immunization led to the induction of high-titre J8 peptide-specific serum IgG antibody responses, and the induction of heterologous opsonic antibodies that did not cross-react with human heart tissue proteins.These data indicated the potential of a novel self-adjuvanting LCP vaccine delivery system incorporating a synthetic GAS M protein C-region peptide immunogen in the induction of broadly protective immune responses, and pointed to the potential application of this system in human vaccine development against infectious diseases.
