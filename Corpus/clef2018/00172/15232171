Human immunogenicity studies on group A streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCPA) as a potential vaccine against group A streptococcal infections. Group A streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCPA) is a major virulence surface factor. Its highly conserved nature among all tested serotypes of group A streptococci (GAS) as well as animal protection studies make SCPA a prime vaccine candidate. The present study was undertaken to explore the human immunogenicity to SCPA using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Children (n=72) who had signs and symptoms of acute pharyngitis and had GAS isolated from the throat at initial visit were included. Acute and convalescent sera were collected 4 weeks apart. ELISA was performed using recombinant SCPA peptide as antigen.The mean convalescent anti-SCPA level was twice the level of mean acute anti-SCPA and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). There was a rise in convalescent anti-SCPA in all children aged 2-12 yr.Our observations confirmed that SCPA was highly immunogenic in children infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Further studies need to be done to characterize the immune response including antibody subclass.
