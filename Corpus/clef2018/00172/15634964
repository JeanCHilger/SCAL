Comparison of emm typing and ribotyping with three restriction enzymes to characterize clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes. A total of 336 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates recently recovered from patients with pharyngitis from 13 countries were characterized by emm typing and riboprinting using an automated Riboprinter (Dupont/Qualicon) based on the patterns produced by three restriction enzymes, EcoRI, PstI, and HindIII. Three enzymes were necessary to increase the discrimination of ribogroups formed by each enzyme. A total of 40 ribogroups and 38 emm sequences (not counting allelic variations) were identified. Multilocus sequence typing was performed on a sampling of the isolates, and those results were consistent with those of both emm typing and ribotyping. Correlations were observed among all three methods.
