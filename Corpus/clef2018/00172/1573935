TWAR infection is a common diagnosis in outpatient clinics. Infections caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae were first described in 1985. The infection can cause common cold, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, fatigue and sometimes influenza-like illness. Examination can indicate serous otitis media, sinusitis, laryngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. The course can be long and relapsing. The recommended drugs for treatment are tetracycline or erythromycin for at least two weeks. Five verified cases are described in the article, four of them with symptoms from the upper respiratory tract only. It is concluded that Chlamydia pneumoniae is a not unusual cause of upper airway diseases. Up to now the diagnosis can best be verified by micro immunofluorescence. The authors call for a rapid and reliable test for use in physician's office. It is proposed that infections caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae be termed TWAR.
