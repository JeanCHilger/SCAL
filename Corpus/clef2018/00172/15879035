Construction and expression of recombinant streptolysin-o and preevaluation of its use in immunoassays. Commercially available immunoassays for assessment of anti-streptolysin-O antibodies use native streptolysin-O obtained by a complex process. We prepared a biologically active recombinant streptolysin-O with higher yield and a simpler purification process. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay developed with this recombinant showed good correlation with a commercial test, suggesting that it could be suitable for immunoassays.
