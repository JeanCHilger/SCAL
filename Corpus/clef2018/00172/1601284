Duplication of a DNA sequence homologous to genes for immunoglobulin receptors and M proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes. The nucleotide sequence of an open reading frame of 355 amino acids downstream of the IgA-binding protein gene arp4 in Streptococcus pyogenes M-type 4 has been determined. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the open reading frame shows an extensive homology to streptococcal M proteins and immunoglobulin binding proteins. Expression of the open reading frame has not been detected and the function may be as a genetic reservoir in the generation of new immunoglobulin receptors and antigenic variants of M proteins.
