Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulates CD1 antigen presentation pathways through TLR-2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major pathogen of worldwide importance, which releases lipid Ags that are presented to human T cells during the course of tuberculosis infections. Here we report that cellular infection with live M. tuberculosis or exposure to mycobacterial cell wall products converted CD1- myeloid precursors into competent APCs that expressed group 1 CD1 proteins (CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c). The appearance of group 1 CD1 proteins at the surface of infected or activated cells occurred via transcriptional regulation, and new CD1 protein synthesis and was accompanied by down-regulation of CD1d transcripts and protein. Isolation of CD1-inducing factors from M. tuberculosis using normal phase chromatography, as well as the use of purified natural and synthetic compounds, showed that this process involved polar lipids that signaled through TLR-2, and we found that TLR-2 was necessary for the up-regulation of CD1 protein expression. Thus, mycobacterial cell wall lipids provide two distinct signals for the activation of lipid-reactive T cells: lipid Ags that activate T cell receptors and lipid adjuvants that activate APCs through TLR-2. These dual activation signals may represent a system for selectively promoting the presentation of exogenous foreign lipids by those myeloid APCs, which come into direct contact with pathogens.
