Muramidase and lactoferrin in adenoidal hypertrophies, hypertrophic and chronic infected tonsil tissue--a quantitative analysis. Muramidase and lactoferrin are important components of the antimicrobial defense system. Muramidase has the ability of opsonization and immunopotentiation and therefore a close relation to the lymphatic tissue. Till now there are only immunohistochemical and microbiological studies on the presence of muramidase and lactoferrin in adenoid and tonsil tissue available.We investigated the concentrations of muramidase and lactoferrin in palatine tonsils and adenoidal hypertrophies quantitatively using ELISA.We investigated tissue of 18 palatine tonsils and 16 pharyngeal tonsils.We found a significant difference in the concentration of muramidase but no difference in the concentration of lactoferrin between adenoids and tonsils. There was no significant difference in the concentration of lactoferrin and muramidase between the hypertrophic and chronic infected tonsils. There was no correlation between the age of the patients and the concentration of muramidase and lactoferrin. A connection between the microbial biofilm, the concentration of the proteins and the recurrent tonsillitis is discussed.Due to the production of muramidase and lactoferrin adenoids and tonsils play an important role in the local antimicrobial defense in any age or inflammation.
