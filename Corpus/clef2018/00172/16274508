Group A streptococcal infections: trend and strain emm typing in an area of central Italy, 1985-2002. A retrospective study of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections was performed for the period 1985-2002 in an area of central Italy. Although very severe diseases such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) were observed, a general increase in invasive infections was not found. Isolates of GAS were classified by M protein genotyping (emm typing) and analysed according to their origin from invasive and non-invasive infections. The predominant emm types were types 1, 4 and 12, followed by types 3, 6 and 28. During the study period the proportion of isolates of types 1 and 12 fell, while other types (3, 6, 22, 28 and 77) appeared. Isolates from invasive and non-invasive infections shared several emm types however, most invasive strains belonged to five types only (types 1, 4, 12, 28 and 77), while non-invasive isolates were generally more heterogeneous.
