Rapid tests for group B Streptococcus colonization in laboring women: a systematic review. We set out to determine the accuracy and rapidity of various intrapartum group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization tests.We performed a systematic review of test-accuracy studies, which were identified without language restriction from Medline and Cochrane databases bibliographies of known primary and review articlesThere were 29 test-accuracy studies in 15,691 women, evaluating 6 different tests: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), optical immunoassay (OIA), DNA hybridization, enzyme immunoassay, latex agglutination, and Islam starch medium tests. The methodologic quality of the studies was generally poor. The most accurate was the real-time PCR test, but it was less rapid than OIA test. Real-time PCR took 40 minutes to complete, whereas the OIA took 30 minutes.Real-time PCR and OIA are candidates for rapid near patient intrapartum GBS testing to determine the need for antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent neonatal GBS disease. Before implementation in practice, a robust technology assessment of their accuracy, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness is required.
