Peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation and Th1/Th2 cytokine production in response to streptococcal M protein in psoriatic patients. Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that is probably a T cell-mediated autoimmune condition which is strongly associated with streptococcal throat infections. Although some groups have associated the involved response with different streptococcal antigens, M protein has been described as the major virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes. Thus, it is necessary to describe some features of the cellular responses to this streptococcal antigen.Proliferation and Th1/Th2 cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to total soluble extracts from type M5 S. pyogenes with (TSE37Sp) and without (M(-)TSESp) M protein were analyzed in 10 psoriatic patients and 10 healthy controls.PBMC from both patients and controls proliferated to both extracts. Responses to M(-)TSESp were significantly lower than those to TSE37Sp (P < 0.05). PBMC IL-2 and gammaIFN production after TSE37Sp stimulus was much higher than after M(-)TSESp antigenic stimulation in both groups (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, IL-4 production was quite low in both groups and in response to both extracts. We found a differential production of IL-10 between groups. PBMC from healthy controls responded to TSE37Sp with a much higher production of this cytokine as compared to the responses showed to M(-)TSESp while the cells from psoriatic patients responded without differences in the production of IL-10.Results obtained suggest an important Th1 response to M protein in psoriatic patients which could be associated with the cellular responses involved in psoriasis, while healthy subjects respond in a probably non-Th2 IL-10 producing regulatory T cells fashion.
