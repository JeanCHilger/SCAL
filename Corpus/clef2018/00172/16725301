Prevalence of emm types and antibiotic resistance of group A streptococci in Austria. The prevalence of emm types and the antibiotic resistance patterns of consecutive isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes from South-East Australian patients collected in 1996 and 2003 were determined. Emm 1, emm 4, emm 12, and emm 28 were found to be the predominant types. A remarkable decrease of macrolide resistance from 1996 (19%) to 2003 (3%) was observed.
