Investigation of bactericidal effect and cytokine response of the oral epithelial cells against different antigenic doses of Streptococcus pyogenes. Epithelial cells (EC) have an important role in the constitution of both innate and acquired immune responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of bactericidal effects and cytokine production patterns of human oral epithelial cells (OEC) against different doses of Streptococcus pyogenes. For this purpose, OEC have been stimulated with S. pyogenes with an effector/target (E/T) cell ratio of 1/1, 1/100, 1/1.000 and 1/10.000, and bactericidal effects and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels were detected in the first and sixth hours of incubation. The mean rates of bactericidal effect detected in the first and sixth hours were 38.7% and 54.5%, respectively. The bactericidal effects observed at 1/1 E/T cell ratio in the first hour, and at 1/1 and 1/100 E/T cell ratio in the the sixth hour were found significantly higher then the other cells ratios (p<0.05). Time- and dose-depended differences were detected in the cytokine responses of OEC for different S. pyogenes concentrations. IL-6 levels produced by stimulated OEC were found higher, and IL-8 levels were found lower then the levels which were produced by unstimulated OEC (p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively) in the first hour, while there were no change in IL-10 levels after stimulation with different bacterial concentrations (p>0.05). At the sixth hour there were no differences in the IL-6 levels produced by stimulated and unstimulated cells, while the levels of IL-8 produced by stimulated cells were found lower then the levels produced by unstimulated cells in the E/T cell ratio of 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10.000 (p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.01, respectively). Nevertheless IL-10 levels in the E/T cell ratio of 1/100 and 1/1.000 were statistically higher then the levels produced by unstimulated cells (p<0.05, p<0.05). As a result OEC stimulated with S. pyogenes showed dose dependent manner in bactericidal effect and cytokine production. It is suggested that epithelial cells stimulation with different doses of antigen contributed to the immune system activation or tolerance.
