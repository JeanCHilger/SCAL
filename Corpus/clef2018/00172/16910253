Rapid antigen tests in acute pharyngitis. Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common illnesses for which adults seek medical help from primary care physicians. Approximately 15% of cases in adults are caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Strategies of management should aim at identifying the latter with a view to prevent the development of complications. Rapid Antigen tests have a reported specificity of more than 95%. Antibiotic therapy is only recommanded for patients with positive rapid antigen test results and those with risk factors.
