A new method for the rapid diagnosis of acute streptococcal infection. The work deals with the development of the rapid method of the identification of acute streptococcal infection on the basis of the coagglutination test. The rapid method of the extraction of group-specific polysaccharide antigen from the cell walls of group A streptococci is proposed. The data on the use of native sera and their fractions in the development of coagglutination diagnostica have been described and analyzed. The advantages of the new method of the diagnosis of acute streptococcal infection in comparison with the traditional microbiological method are shown.
