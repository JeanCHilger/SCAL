Baseline mycobacterial immune responses in HIV-infected adults primed with bacille Calmette-Guérin during childhood and entering a tuberculosis booster vaccine trial. Most new tuberculosis vaccines will be administered as a booster to subjects primed with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) during childhood.We investigated in vivo and in vitro immune responses to mycobacteria in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects in Tanzania primed with BCG during childhood and entering a tuberculosis booster vaccine trial. Tests included intradermal skin testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) and Mycobacterium avium sensitin (MAS) lymphocyte proliferation assays and interferon (IFN)-gamma levels after stimulation with Mycobacterium vaccae sonicate (MVS), M. tuberculosis early secreted antigen (ESAT)-6, M. tuberculosis antigen 85 (Ag85), or M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysate (WCL)A total of 888 subjects with CD4 cell counts > or = 200 cells/mm3 were enrolled. PPD and MAS test results were positive in 34% and 30% of the subjects, respectively. Proliferative responses were detected as follows: MVS, 6% Ag85, 24%Of HIV-positive BCG-immunized adults with CD4 cell counts > or = 200 cells/mm3 in Tanzania, 94% are primed for booster mycobacterial immunization.
