Intermediate maturation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis LAM-activated human dendritic cells. Contrasting observations raise the question of the role of mycobacterial derived products as compared with the whole bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis on maturation and function of human dendritic cells (DCs). DC-SIGN has been identified as the key DC receptor for M. tuberculosis through its interaction with the mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM). Although ManLAM is a major mycobacterial component released from infected antigen-presenting cells, there is no formal evidence yet for an effect of ManLAM per se on DC maturation and function. DCs activated with purified ManLAM displayed an intermediate maturation phenotype as compared with lipopolysaccharide fully matured DCs with reduced expression of MHC class I and class II molecules, CD83 and CD86 and of the chemokine receptor CCR7. They were sensitive to autologous natural killer (NK) lysis, thus behaving like immature DCs. However, ManLAM-activated DCs lost phagocytic activity and triggered priming of naive T-cells, confirming their intermediate maturation. Partial maturation of ManLAM-activated DCs was overcome by triggering the CD40/CD40L pathway as a second signal, which completed maturation phenotypically and abolished autologous NK lysis susceptibility. Altogether, these data provide evidence that ManLAM may induce a partial maturation phenotype on non-infected bystander DCs during infection suggesting that ManLAM released from infected cells might impair adaptive immune response towards M. tuberculosis.
