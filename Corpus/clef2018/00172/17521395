Production of recombinant gG-1 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 in a prokaryotic system in order to develop a type-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The herpes simplex viruses are important causes of disease worldwide. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the primary cause of oral-facial and pharyngeal infections and may cause herpetic whitlow, eye infections as well as severe and sometimes dangerous infections of the eyes and brain. HSV-1 also accounts for 10-15% of all genital herpetic infections. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis of this virus and development of diagnostic serological techniques for HSV-1 is of particular importance. In the present study, pTrc His2A-gG1 plasmid, containing the full-length glycoprotein G (gG) protein, was produced in a prokaryotic system for the first time. Upon confirmation of a 37-kDa gG-1 protein production in a prokaryotic system based on western blotting and monoclonal antibodies, the protein was produced at a large scale and purified by ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-sepharose. An HSV-1 type-specific diagnostic kit was designed and developed and the specificity and sensitivity of this kit were demonstrated to be 89.5% and 100%, respectively, as compared with a commercially available kit. A significant correlation was shown between the developed kit and the commercial kit.
