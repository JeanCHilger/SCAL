Necrotizing fasciitis rapidly diagnosed by aspiration cytology. A case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci is reported. A 66-year-old man was admitted because of pain and swelling in the right buttock. Rapid application of aspiration cytology made it possible to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis with bacterial infection. Unfortunately, however, the patient died of cardiac arrest due to hyperpotassemia 11 h after admission. Mortality from this disease is most often related to failure in recognizing it early. Rapid diagnosis and early treatment is mandatory in order to save the patients' life. We emphasize the usefulness of rapid aspiration cytology, despite the unfortunate outcome in the present case.
