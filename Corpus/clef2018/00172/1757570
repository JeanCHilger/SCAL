Comparison of commercially available group B streptococcal latex agglutination assays. Detection of group B streptococcus (GBS) antigen in urine by latex particle agglutination (LPA) may facilitate the rapid diagnosis of GBS sepsis. We sought to compare three commercial LPA assays with specimens that were spiked with type-specific antigen, group-specific antigen, or type III organisms. There were sensitivity differences between the assays, but the Bactigen assay performed best, detecting as little as 1 ng of GBS group-specific antigen per ml in urine and as few as 10(5) CFU of GBS type III organisms per ml in urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid.
