Comparison of two rapid tests for detecting group A streptococcal pharyngitis in the pediatric population at wright-patterson air force base. This prospective cohort study compared two rapid antigen tests for group A streptococcus in an enrolled pediatric population of a busy Air Force clinic during the autumn of 2005. The study was performed to determine whether the Genzyme test was a more sensitive rapid test than the currently used Quidel test. A highly sensitive rapid test would eliminate the need to perform backup cultures, thus saving time and facilitating faster diagnosis and treatment. The study revealed that the Genzyme test was more sensitive (85.5%) than the Quidel test (79.5%). However, the difference was not statistically significant using the McNemar chi(2) tool and was attributable to random variability. Therefore, future comparative studies need to be performed to find a rapid antigen test with sensitivity comparable to that of throat culture, for use at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base pediatric clinic.
