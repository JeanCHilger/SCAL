Early diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia by antigen detection using immunobinding assay. The possibility of rapid diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection by immunobinding assay is described. Immunobinding assay which was developed by Kotani and McGarrity is a simple and rapid method for identification of mycoplasmas. Small amounts of antigen were spotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane. It was treated with a specific rabbit antisera against M. pneumoniae. The antigen-antibody complex was visualised with the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase method. Cross reaction was seen between M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium. Throat swabs from hamsters infected with M. pneumoniae were positive on 7th and 14th day after infection. Although the cross reaction was seen between M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium, this method could be useful for rapid diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection.
