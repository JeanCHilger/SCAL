Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal hemorrhagic colitis complicated with pharyngitis and impetigo. A 6-year-old boy with bloody diarrhea was diagnosed with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal hemorrhagic colitis. Complications included pharyngitis and impetigo, both caused by the same organisms. In addition to being isolated from stools, Streptococcus pyogenes was also isolated from skin lesions. Furthermore, a rapid group A streptococcal antigen test by throat swab was also positive. Hemorrhagic colitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is extremely rare, and much rarer are its complications with pharyngitis and impetigo. Compared with findings in reports of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal proctitis and perianal and perineal diseases, this case suggests a distinct pathogenesis for hemorrhagic colitis.
