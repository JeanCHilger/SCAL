Epidemiology and clinical pictures of pharyngitis: report on the activity of a family paediatrician. Pharyngitis (PM) is the most common child disease, that Family Paediatricians (FP) have to deal with. The aim of this study is to analyze epidemiology of PM comparing the validity of clinical scores and Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) to diagnose Group A Streptococci PM. An evaluation of antibiotic prescription was performed too on the basis of the two groups.A three-years epidemiological investigation was performed on a group of children observed in a FP office. Children was divided into two groups on the basis of the RADT (RADT+ and RADT-) and for each group statistical and epidemiological analysis was performed.A total of 1.445 children was gathered, 1.128 of them (78%) had RADT- and 317 (22%) RADT+. Data analysis shows significant statistical differences between data of children with RADT+, comparing to those of RADT-, regarding Milano Score and other clinical criteria, with the only exception of McIsaac Score.PM remains the most important children disease in an FP office. The use of RADT allows a rapids and correct etiological diagnosis and to contain to less than 50% antibiotic prescription. RADT is the diagnostic test to use in the PM practice, being easy and quick to perform, compared with clinical criteria and scores.
