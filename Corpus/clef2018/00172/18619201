T-cell responsiveness to specific group A streptococcus antigens in patients with recurrent erysipelas. Peripheral blood leukocytic migratory activity (LMA) was studied in 51 patients with recurrent erysipelas versus 63 patients with primary erysipelas. To reveal LMA, the authors employed in vitro a screening cell migration test as an indicator of the cooperation of T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, by stimulating with polysaccharide A, surface proteins, L-antigen, hyaluronidase, streptolysine-O, and a complete set of Grasse S. pyogenes. In patients with recurrent erysipelas, undulating LMA changes were found in the course of the disease in response to the stimulation with partial specific S. pyogenes antigens. There were differences in the time course of LMA changes, when stimulated with specific surface streptococcus antigens and with components of streptococcus with toxic activity. Significant LMA differences were found in relation to the pattern of a local process: active LMA changes from acceleration to suppression in the erythematous-hemorrhagic form and hyperergic reactions of LMA acceleration in the bullous-hemorrhagic one.
