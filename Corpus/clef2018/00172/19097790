Synthesis of a Streptococcus pyogenes vaccine candidate based on the M protein PL1 epitope. Group A streptococcus is a Gram-positive bacteria that causes a range of infectious diseases. Targeting the bacteria, a new self-adjuvanting vaccine candidate, incorporating a carbohydrate carrier and an amino acid-based adjuvant, was synthesised utilising carbohydrate chemistry and solid-phase peptide synthesis procedures. Characterisation of the candidate was achieved using reverse-phase HPLC and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The successful synthesis and characterisation of the vaccine candidate may contribute to the discovery of a therapeutically and clinically viable vaccine against group A streptococcus.
