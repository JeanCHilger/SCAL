Effects of helicobacter pylori eradication on chronic nonspecific pharyngeal symptoms. Although its pathophysiology is not obvious, the discussion on chronic nonspecific pharyngeal symptoms encompasses a broad range of various factors, such as nasal obstruction, extraesophageal reflux disease, some of the chronic upper respiratory infections, and allergy. We found a high seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori in a group of selected patients with no possible conditions responsible for complaints. To show a possible role of H. pylori infection in chronic pharyngeal complaints, we investigated symptomatic response following eradication therapy.In a prospective cohort study, 72 subjects with H. pylori seropositivity had their symptoms measured by a questionnaire before and 3 months following H. pylori eradication therapy. The symptomatic response was compared between eradicated and noneradicated groups 3 months after eradication therapy.In 39 of 72 patients H. pylori was eradicated successfully. Mann-Whitney U analysis showed the pharyngeal symptom improvement rate, measured using the absolute difference in symptom score. For two major symptoms (chronic throat irritation, sore throat), it was significantly lower for H. pylori-noneradicated cases than for H. pylori-eradicated cases (p = .003 and p < .001, respectively).Resolution of the symptoms in the eradicated group suggests that H. pylori has a role in developing chronic nonspecific pharyngeal symptoms. These data may be important for future treatment strategies for this disease.
