Emergence of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in emm6 Streptococcus pyogenes and in vitro resistance selection with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. To investigate the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes and its in vitro selection by ciprofloxacin and the respiratory fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.S. pyogenes (n = 5851) recovered from pharyngitis and invasive infections during 2003-06 in Belgium were screened for fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility (ciprofloxacin MIC > or =2 mg/L) and further studied for mutations in the topoisomerase genes, reserpine-sensitive efflux, clonality by PFGE and emm typing. Fourteen well-characterized fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible or -susceptible isolates were exposed stepwise to increasing levels of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Selected mutants with increased MICs were analysed for resistance mechanisms. Mutation frequencies at 2x and 4x MIC of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin were estimated for a clinical emm6 parent strain carrying mutations in both parC and gyrA.Prevalence of fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible S. pyogenes (n = 437 7.47%) increased significantly from 2.08% and 5.08% to 13.11% during 2003-05 and decreased to 8.93% in 2006 (chi(2) testWe report an emergence of levofloxacin and high-level ciprofloxacin resistance associated with a second-step gyrA mutation in a clinical emm6 S. pyogenes. The observed high mutation frequency and in vitro selection of high-level resistance to the respiratory fluoroquinolones in the emm6 double mutant is of concern.
