Beta-D-glucuronidase activity assay for rapid differentiation of species within beta-haemolytic group C and G streptococci. Methylumbelliferyl-conjugated enzyme substrates were assessed for their ability to differentiate beta haemolytic streptococci in Lancefield groups C and G. Both Streptococcus equisimilis (group C) and large colony human biotype group G strains were consistently differentiated from group C and G "Streptococcus milleri group" bacteria by their ability to hydrolyse the beta-D-glucuronide substrate. The test was completed in less than one hour.
