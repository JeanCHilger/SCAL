Evaluation of three commercial broth media for pigment detection and identification of a group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae). Detection of group B Streptococcus (GBS) strains at various bacterial concentrations was evaluated using three pigment-producing broth media. At 10(3) CFU/ml, StrepB carrot broth (SBCB), Granada instant liquid biphasic (IGLB), and Northeast Laboratory GBS screening medium (NEL-GBS) showed 100% detection, but at the lower bacterial counts, SBCB and IGLB were more sensitive than NEL-GBS after 24 h.
