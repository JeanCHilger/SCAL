Epidemiological markers of Streptococcus pyogenes strains in Tunisia. To further understand the epidemiology of Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus (GAS) infections in Tunisia, phenotypic and genomic markers of GAS isolates, including antibiotic susceptibility, biotypes, T and emm types and toxin gene profiles, have been characterized. A total of 103 isolates, collected between 2000 and 2006, were investigated 47 were recovered from invasive infections, and 56 from non-invasive infections. Rates of resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin and rifampin were 70.8%, 4.8%, 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively. High levels of resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin were observed in 1.9% and 4.8% of isolates, respectively. Biotype 3 was most common. Twenty different T patterns were observed, with a predominance of T3/13/B3264, and 38 different emm types. In both invasive and non-invasive isolates, emm118 (9.7%), emm42 (8.7%), emm1 (7.8%), st432 (6.8%), emm28 (5.8%) and emm76 (5.8%) were the most prevalent types
