Evaluation of rapid methods for detecting Streptococcus pyogenes. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is one of the most frequent reasons for consultations in primary and paediatric care. An inadequate treatment could cause adverse effects and bacterial resistance. The rapid antigen tests are an important advance, enabling the diagnosis of infection by Streptococcus pyogenes to be diagnosed in a few minutes. The aim of this review is to assess the rapid antigen-detection test in the diagnosis of S. pyogenes from throat samples.Systematic review and meta-analysis (2000-09). Source database: MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cinahl, CRD, ECRI, Hayes and HTA's agencies. The quality of included studies was measured according to Quadas's criteria. The diagnostic validity indices have been calculated. A meta-analysis was performed in order to synthesize the results of the different evaluated studies.Twenty four studies were included. The quality was moderate. The sensitivity ranged between 65.6% and 96.4% specificity from 68.7%-99.3%Rapid tests offer good accuracy for use as diagnostic method, however, these devices have to be complemented with the microbiological culture, because there are false positive and negative results.
