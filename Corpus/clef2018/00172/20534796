Quantitative analysis of a urine-based assay for detection of lipoarabinomannan in patients with tuberculosis. Urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) detection is a promising approach for rapid diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB). In microbiologically confirmed TB patients, quantitative LAM detection results increased progressively with bacillary burden and immunosuppression. Patients with disseminated TB and/or advanced HIV are target populations for whom urine LAM detection may be particularly useful.
