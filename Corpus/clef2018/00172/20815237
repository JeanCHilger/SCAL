Scl1 of M41-type group A streptococcus binds low-density lipoprotein. To study the interaction of streptococcal collagen-like protein 1 (Scl1) of M41-type group A streptococcus (GAS) ATCC12373 with low-density lipoprotein (LDL).We cloned, expressed and purified the recombinant proteins rScl1 and its V region rScl1-V, designated as C176 and C176V, derived from Scl1. 41 of M41-type GAS. The binding of rScl1 to LDL was detected with affinity chromatography-binding assay, Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and whole cell binding assays were used to detect the interactions of whole GAS cells with LDL.The results demonstrated that C176 and C176V could specifically bind purified LDL, and M41-type GAS cells expressing native Sell could bind LDL whereas M6-type GAS could not.The Sell of M41-type GAS specifically binds LDL.
