A secreted receptor related to M1 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes binds to fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. An extracellular protein (eMP) of Streptococcus pyogenes M type 1 was isolated by affinity chromatography on albumin- and IgG-Sepharose. The protein was found to bind to the human plasma proteins, fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. Analysis of eMP by Western blotting demonstrated a major band with a molecular weight of 49 kD which was responsible for binding of the three plasma proteins. The purified protein was found to bind selectively to human and primate polyclonal IgG, human and mouse albumin, as well as human fibrinogen which has been the only fibrinogen tested. Serological investigations revealed a close relation of eMP to streptococcal M1 protein. It showed a reaction of identity with cell-extracted M1 protein in immunodiffusion. Moreover, the 49 kD peptide responsible for binding, was recognized with an antiserum directed against the 20 amino acids comprising synthetic peptide (42VAL-61GLU) of the N-terminal part of the M1 protein sequence. The affinity of M protein to plasma proteins other than fibrinogen opens new approaches to its purification by affinity chromatography.
