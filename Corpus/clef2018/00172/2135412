Studies of antigens related to metabolic and growth inhibitions of Staphylococcus aureus L-form. Metabolic and growth inhibiting activities in immunoglobulin (of anti-S. aureus L-form serum and anti-S. aureus coccal form serum) could be absorbed by cell membranes of S. aureus L-form and its coccal form, respectively. These activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Actinomyces viscosus. These findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. The membrane antigens of L-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. A large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of L-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). A fractionation study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities.
