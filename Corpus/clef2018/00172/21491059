Optimization of screening methodologies for the detection of Streptococcus agalactiae in pregnant women. Streptococcus agalactiae is a significant worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women and their newborn infants. The objective of this work was to determine the usefulness of bioMerieux chromogenic medium chromID Strepto B (CR) for detecting S. agalactiae in pregnant women from the selective Todd-Hewitt broth (sel-THB ) against the methods proposed by the CDC . A total of 1924 swabs were analyzed, 962 from vaginal introitus and 962 rectal, belonging to 962 women in weeks 35-37 of pregnancy. The swabs were directly seeded in CR. Both swabs were later placed in sel-THB with 15 µg/ml supplement of nalidixic acid and 10 µg/ml colistin. After 24 h of incubation, subcultures in CR medium and agar containing 5% sheep blood (SBA) were performed. The prevalence found was 17.4%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of sel-THB subcultures with CR supplement and 48 h incubation were: 98.8, 100, 100 and 99.7%, respectively. The corresponding values of direct harvest of the sample were 57.8, 100, 100, and 90%, respectively. Sensitivity of sel-THB in SBA was 85%. Sel-THB subculture performance in CR was outstanding in comparison with the method proposed by the CDC.
