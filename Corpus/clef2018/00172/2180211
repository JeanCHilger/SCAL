Acute tonsillitis: clinical symptoms bacteriologic culture and rapid test as deciding criteria for the use of antibiotics. In order to prevent late sequelae from an untreated streptococcal pharyngitis all patients with streptococcal tonsillitis/pharyngitis have to be treated with antibiotics, preferably penicillin. A correct diagnosis by clinical criteria is only achievable in 72% of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis. Additional criteria such as diagnosis by culture are, therefore, mandatory. Time is a major disadvantage of traditional culture methods. Slide agglutination tests show an acceptable sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93%. Due to the possibility of false negative test results, with consequent withholding of adequate antimicrobial chemotherapy, these test results should be used only as a valuable guide. Decision to administer an antibiotic should still be based on clinical criteria.
