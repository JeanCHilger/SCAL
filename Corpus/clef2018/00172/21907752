HLA class II transgenic mice develop a safe and long lasting immune response against StreptInCor, an anti-group A streptococcus vaccine candidate. Streptococcus pyogenes infections remain a health problem in several countries because of post-streptococcal sequelae, such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. We developed a vaccine epitope (StreptInCor) composed of 55 amino acid residues of the C-terminal portion of the M protein that encompasses both T and B cell protective epitopes. Recently, by using human blood samples, we showed that the StreptInCor epitope is able to bind to different HLA class II molecules and that it could be considered a universal vaccine epitope. In the present work, we evaluated the immune response of HLA class II transgenic mice against aluminum hydroxide-absorbed StreptInCor. After a period of one year, several organs were analyzed histologically to verify the safety of the candidate vaccine epitope. Our results showed that StreptInCor is able to induce robust and safe and long lasting immune response without deleterious reactions in several organs. In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that StreptInCor could be considered a safe vaccine against severe streptococcus-induced diseases.
