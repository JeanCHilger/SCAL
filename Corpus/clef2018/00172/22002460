Genital and extra-genital screening for gonorrhoea using the BD Probetec ET system with an in-house PCR method targeting the porA pseudogene as confirmatory test. Diagnosing gonorrhoea from extra-genital as well as genital sites is important in managing this sexually transmitted disease. In this study we evaluated a screening procedure for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) from all sample sites in a low-prevalence setting. A total of 69,252 specimens submitted for Chlamydia trachomatis testing were also examined for GC on the BD Viperâ„¢ platform using the BD Probetec ET system. In order to avoid false-positive results all GC BD reactive samples were re-tested using a PCR method with the porA pseudogene as target. Using this method we screened 170% more samples for GC than in the previous year, in the same population, and diagnosed more than twice as many GC-positive episodes. The BD system can be used successfully to screen extra-genital as well as genital specimen types for GC in a low-prevalence area if it is combined with a validated confirmatory PCR test.
