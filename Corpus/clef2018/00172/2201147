The physicochemical and biochemical characteristics of the cell walls in M+ and M- variants of Streptococcus group A type 29. The amino acid composition of cell walls and surface proteins, isolated from virulent (M+) and avirulent (M-) streptococcal strains (group A, type 29) has been determined by the method of E. H. Beachey et al. The kinetics of the lysis and proteolysis of streptococcal cell walls with muramidase and protease obtained from Actinomyces levoris and streptolysin has been studied. The constants describing the progress rates of these processes has been determined their values in case of both lysis and proteolysis are higher in virulent strains than in avirulent ones.
