Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors in the upper respiratory tract. Retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLRs) are a novel family of pattern recognition receptors that include retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), and laboratory of genomics and  physiology 2 (LGP-2). The knowledge of RLRs and their function in the human airway is limited. This study explores the role of RLRs in the upper respiratory tract.Tonsils, adenoids, nasal polyps, and biopsy specimens from the nasal mucosa were examined for the  occurrence of the RIG-1, MDA-5, and LGP-2 using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line FaDu was cultured with the RIG-1/MDA-5 ligand poly(I:C)/LyoVec (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) and analyzed for cytokine release  using ELISA.RIG-1, MDA-5, and LGP-2 mRNA were found in all tissues tested. The airway epithelium appeared to be their most prominent location. The RIG-1 and MDA-5 mRNA levels were higher in nasal polyps than in normal nasal mucosa, a state that seemed to be reversed  by local steroid treatment. Culture of FaDu with poly(I:C)/LyoVec resulted in IL-6 and IL-8 release. No alteration in RLR expression in tonsils was seen on infection.This study shows the presence and functional activity of RLRs in the human upper airways. It  also suggests a role for RLRs in nasal polyposis.
