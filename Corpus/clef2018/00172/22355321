IGD motifs, which are required for migration stimulatory activity of fibronectin type I modules, do not mediate binding in matrix assembly. Picomolar concentrations of proteins comprising only the N-terminal 70-kDa region (70K) of fibronectin (FN) stimulate cell migration into collagen gels. The Ile-Gly-Asp (IGD) motifs in four of the nine FN type 1 (FNI) modules in 70K are important for such migratory stimulating activity. The 70K region mediates binding of nanomolar concentrations of intact FN to cell-surface sites where FN is assembled. Using baculovirus, we expressed wildtype 70K and 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations in (3)FNI and (5)FNI (7)FNI and (9)FNI
