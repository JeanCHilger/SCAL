The role of the plasmid in expression of the OF-type antigen of group A streptococcus. In our previous investigations we demonstrated the ability of some natural MLS plasmids to regulate the expression of several functionally related genes of Streptococcus pyogenes. In the present paper the mechanism of the plasmid effect of the SOR expression has been studied. The filter mating transfer of the plasmid pEL1 and pAM beta 1 into the recipient strain 154(8-3)SOR+ (cured of EmR) but not into the strain CSLL2SOR+ resulted in two types of transconjugants obtained: EmRSOR+ (90%) and EmRSOR- (10%). It was found in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments that the OF-EmR transconjugants but not OF+EmR ones carry the same pEL1 plasmids that are harboured by the donor strain SM60ERL1. Mutation to SOR- is considered to be the results of the plasmid of transposon DNA insertion into the homologous region of the recipient strain 154(8-3).
