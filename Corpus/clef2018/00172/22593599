Identification of DNA signatures suitable for use in development of real-time PCR assays by whole-genome sequence approaches: use of Streptococcus pyogenes in a pilot study. A stepwise computational approach using three layers of publicly available software was found to effectively identify DNA signatures for Streptococcus pyogenes. PCR testing validated that 9 out of 15 signature-derived primer sets could detect as low as 5 fg of target DNA with high specificity. The selected signature-derived primer sets were successfully evaluated against all 23 clinical isolates. The approach is readily applicable for designing molecular assays for rapid detection and characterization of various pathogenic bacteria.
