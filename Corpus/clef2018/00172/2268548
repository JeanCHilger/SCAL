An immunofluorescence study of the viral and inframicrobial flora of the pharynx in 0- to 5-year-old children with acute respiratory diseases. The pharynx viral and inframicrobial flora of 52 0-5-year-old children with acute respiratory diseases was investigated through the immunofluorescence techniques. Results showed a high positivity rate (91% to 95%), the simultaneous presence in most of the patients of two to five antigens and the dominance of parainfluenza type 3 virus. The significance of the pharyngeal flora is discussed from an immunologic point of view.
