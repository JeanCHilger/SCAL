Evaluation using QFT-2G/TBGL/LAM in the patients with osteoarticular tuberculosis of post-treatment period. To evaluate results of QFT-2G/TBGL/ LAM in patients who had been completed the antituberculosis treatment for osteoarticular tuberculosis with various periods after the completion of the treatment,Fifty-five patients who had been completed the antituberculosis treatment for osteoarticular tuberculosis at least one year after the completion of treatment were evaluated using QFT-2G/TBGL/LAM tests. Forty patients with spinal tuberculosis and 15 patients with articular tuberculosis were included. The patients with the period after the completion of the treatment less than 4 years were classifled as short-term group (33 patients) and those with the period not less than 4 years were classified as mid-long-term group (22 patients). The results of the tests were compared between the two groups.The result of QFT-2G test was positive in 60.6% of the patients in short-term group while 45.5% in mid-long-term group (p=0.12). On the other hand, the result of TBGL test was positive in 75.8% of the patients in short-term group whereas 22.7% in mid-long-term group (p=0.0001) and the result of LAM test was positive in 90.9% of the patients in short-term group whereas 63.6% in mid-long-term group (p= 0.01), both of these tests showed significantly low,er positive rate in mid-long-term group. There was no significant difference in the comparisons between patient groups writh/without pulmonary tuberculosis as well as with/without surgical treatment.The patients with a history of osteoarticular tuberculosis tend to show positive results of QFT-2-G test for a prolonged period, whereas significantly less positive results of TBGL/LAM tests in mid-long-term.
