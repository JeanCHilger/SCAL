Biological evaluation of diazene derivatives as anti-tubercular compounds. Despite efforts made in chemotherapeutic research in the past and present, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, still causes more than a million deadly casualties each year, second only to HIV. The rapid generation and spread of drug resistant strains, a problem exacerbated by co-infection with HIV demands further efforts in the investigation of novel classes of anti-tubercular compounds. A library of eight substituted diazenecarboxamides, three carbamoyldiazenecarboxylates and four diazene-1,2-dicarboxamides was synthesized in a straightforward manner followed by a biological evaluation of the compounds. We observed minimal inhibitory concentrations below 10 μg/mL against the H37Rv lab strain of M.tb. Three compounds that showed a potency of 90% growth inhibition of M.tb at a concentration lower than 10 μg/mL were further evaluated and showed potency against other clinically relevant mycobacterial species such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium ulcerans. The selected compounds were examined for acute cell toxicity on a murine macrophage like monocyte cell line J774 A.1 in which the cell viability was reduced by 50% at concentrations ranging from 7.4 μg/mL to 20.7 μg/mL. Neither of the three compounds showed signs of genotoxicity by VITOTOX or by Comet assay. The study was complemented by demonstration of the inhibition of intracellular replication of M.tb H37Rv inside J774 A.1 cells at 2 μg/mL concentration and the susceptibility of a MDR LAM-1 strain at concentrations between 5 and 1 μg/mL of the most active compound.
