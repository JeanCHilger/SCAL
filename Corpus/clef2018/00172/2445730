Streptococcus pyogenes type 12 M protein gene regulation by upstream sequences. A partial nucleotide sequence that included 1,693 base pairs of the M12 (emm12) gene of group A streptococci (strain CS24) and adjacent upstream DNA was determined. Type 12 M protein-specific mRNA of strain CS24 is transcribed from two promoters (P1 and P3) separated by 30 bases. The transcription start sites of the emm12 gene were located more than 400 bases downstream of a deletion that causes decreased M-protein gene transcription in strain CS64. Deletion analysis of M protein-expressing plasmids indicated that an upstream region greater than 1 kilobase is required for M-protein gene expression. The M-protein gene transcriptional unit appears to be monocistronic. Analysis of the emm12 DNA sequence revealed three major repeat regions. Two copies of each repeat, A and B, existed within the variable 5' end of the gene repeat C demarcated the 5' end of the constant region shared by emm12 and emm6.
