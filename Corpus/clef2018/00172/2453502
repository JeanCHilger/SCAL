Isolation and characterization of the cell-associated region of group A streptococcal M6 protein. DNA sequence analysis of the complete M6 protein gene revealed 19 hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus which could act as a membrane anchor and an adjacent proline- and glycine-rich region likely to be located in the cell wall. To define this region within the cell wall and its role in attaching the molecule to the cell, we isolated the cell-associated fragment of the M protein. Assuming that the cell-associated region of the M protein would be embedded within the wall and thus protected from trypsin digestion, cells were digested with this enzyme, and the wall-associated M protein fragment was released by phage lysin digestion of the peptidoglycan. With antibody probes prepared to synthetic peptides of C-terminal sequences, a cell wall-associated M protein fragment (molecular weight, 16,000) was identified and purified. Amino acid sequence analysis placed the N terminus of the 16,000-molecular-weight fragment at residue 298 within the M sequence. Amino acid composition of this peptide was consistent with a C-terminal sequence lacking the membrane anchor. Antibody studies of nitrous acid-extracted whole bacteria suggested that, in addition to the peptidoglycan-associated region, a 65-residue helical segment of the C-terminal domain of the M protein is embedded within the carbohydrate moiety of the cell wall. Since no detectable amino sugars were associated with the wall-associated fragment, the C-terminal region of the M6 molecule is likely to be intercalated within the cross-linked peptidoglycan and not covalently linked to it. Because the C-terminal region of the M molecule is highly homologous to the C-terminal end of protein A from staphylococci and protein G from streptococci, it is likely that the mechanism of attachment of these proteins to the cell wall is conserved.
