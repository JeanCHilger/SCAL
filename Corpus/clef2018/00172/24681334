2,4-Dialkyl-8,9,10,11-tetrahydrobenzo[g]pyrimido[4,5-c]isoquinoline-1,3,7,12(2H,4H)-tetraones as new leads against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Given the re-emergence of tuberculosis in Europe and beyond, the search for novel bio-active compound classes against this disease is of utmost importance. As a result of a high intrinsic tolerance of the etiological agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, towards most antibiotics and xenobiotics, the search for such new compounds is far from trivial. Further exacerbated by the rapid generation and spread of drug resistant M. tuberculosis and fuelled by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, halting the tuberculosis epidemic is of paramount importance. As part of our program to design new 2-aza-anthraquinones with anti-mycobacterial activity, various dialkyltetrahydrobenzo[g]pyrimido[4,5-c]isoquinolinetetraones were designed and synthesised. The compounds were submitted to a biological evaluation in which the activity against M.tb H37Rv(lux) was observed, as well as the acute toxicity towards J774 A.1 macrophages. From these results, the selectivity index was calculated. Furthermore, the activity of the most promising compounds was further studied against a multi-drug resistant LAM-1 strain and against intracellular replicating M.tb. The study was further extended with a comet assay and a VITOTOXâ„¢ assay to investigate the possibility of observable genotoxic effects caused by these compounds.
