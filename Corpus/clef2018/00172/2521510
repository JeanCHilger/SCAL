Cellular and biochemical responses of human T lymphocytes stimulated with streptococcal M proteins. Purified group A streptococcal M proteins, pep M5 and pep M6, bearing heart cross-reactive epitopes were compared with pep M24, which lacks such epitopes, in their ability to induce functional differentiation of human T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes activated by pep M5 and pep M6 demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cultured heart cells, whereas pep M24-activated cells differentiated into suppressor T cells, which specifically blocked cytotoxic T lymphocytes against cultured human myocardial cells and not NK cell activity against K562 cells. Pep M5 and not pep M24 induced an increase in the number of CD4, 4B4, helper/inducer T cells. In addition, these M proteins appear to induce different biochemical changes in T lymphocytes. Both pep M5 and pep M24 induced the phosphorylation of a 35-kDa cytoplasmic protein however, only pep M5 induced the phosphorylation of a 28-kDa membrane protein, primarily in CD4 T cells. These data indicate that the virulent M protein Ag of group A streptococci may exert their effect on the human immune system via different mechanisms. Determining these mechanisms and the biochemical pathways involved in T cell differentiation triggered by these Ag may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of post-streptococcal diseases.
