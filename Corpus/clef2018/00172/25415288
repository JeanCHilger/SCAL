Value of urine lipoarabinomannan grade and second test for optimizing clinic-based screening for HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis. We assessed the role of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) grade and a second LAM test for HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) screening in outpatient clinics in South Africa.We enrolled newly diagnosed HIV-infected adults (â‰¥18 years) at 4 clinics, excluding those on TB therapy. Participants provided sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy and culture. Nurses conducted 2 rapid urine LAM tests at the point-of-care and graded positive results from low (faint) to high (5+). Culture-confirmed pulmonary TB was the gold standard. We used area under receiver operating curves (AUROC) to compare screening strategies.Among 320 HIV-infected adults, median CD4 was 248 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 107-379/mm) 54 (17%) were TB culture positive. Fifty-two (16%) of all participants were LAM positive by either testIn this clinic-based study, "faint" line was a false-positive second urine LAM test added no value, and an optimal screening strategy was 1 LAM test followed by sputum AFB microscopy for urine LAM-negative people.
