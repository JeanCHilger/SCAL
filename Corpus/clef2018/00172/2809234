The presence of M proteins in outbreak strains of Streptococcus equisimilis T-type 204. Cultures of Streptococcus equisimilis (Lancefield group C) from three outbreaks of illness were found to carry the T-protein antigen 204. Strains of this type were not otherwise represented in a collection of 743 cultures of these 'pyogenes-like' streptococci isolated from other outbreaks of infection or as random isolates. Two of the three outbreaks were of pharyngitis. The third arose in a maternity unit where the organism was isolated from mothers with puerperal fever, from staff and also from the environment. Representative strains were found to carry M-protein antigens as judged by their ability to survive and multiply in fresh normal human blood. Comparison of absorbed rabbit antiserum to the M antigens in opsonic and precipitin tests showed that a distinct M antigen was present on isolates from one outbreak of sore throat and that all cultures from the other two incidents shared a common M antigen. Samples of serum were also available from patients in the outbreak of puerperal sepsis. Most patients developed antibodies to one or more streptococcal antigens including the M protein, streptolysin O, streptokinase and the hyaluronidase specific for strains of group C and group G streptococci.
