Cytomegalovirus mononucleosis in children compared with the infection in adults and with Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis. We report clinical and laboratory findings in 11 previously healthy children with cytomegalovirus (CMV) mononucleosis and compare them with those of 18 adults with CMV mononucleosis and with those of 22 age-matched children with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mononucleosis. Exudative pharyngitis was more common in children whereas prolonged fever was more common in adults. Prominent lymphadenopathy and exudative pharyngitis, however, were less frequent in children with CMV mononucleosis than in those with EBV mononucleosis. Nevertheless, children with CMV mononucleosis are more likely to resemble those with EBV mononucleosis than adults with CMV mononucleosis.
