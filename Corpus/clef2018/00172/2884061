Rapid identification of enterococci by pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase activity (PYRase). Group A streptococci and enterococci can be differentiated from other streptococci by their ability to cleave pyrrolidonyl beta-naphthylamide (PYRase). We evaluated two PYRase systems [Strep-A-Chek (SAC), E-Y Laboratories, San Mateo, CA Strep-A-Fluor (SAF), BioSpec, Inc., Dublin, CA) for the presumptive identification of enterococci. Initially, 40 enterococcal and 21 nonenterococcal streptococci were tested, retrospectively. A prospective comparison of SAC and SAF to bile-esculin reaction (BE) was then incorporated into our routine procedure for the identification of non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal colonies from cultures. All isolates were speciated using standard biochemical tests. We encountered 85 enterococcal and 26 nonenterococcal isolates. Tests were performed on colonies from primary plates whenever possible (77 isolates). Sensitivity and specificity of both SAC and SAF were greater than 96% in identifying enterococci from routine cultures. These PYRase tests were cost-effective, easily adaptable to work-flow, and yielded results within 30 min. Thus, PYRase testing appears to be a reasonable alternative for the identification of enterococci in the clinical laboratory.
