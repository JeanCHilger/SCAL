Rapid detection of respiratory syncytial virus in clinical specimens. Results of the direct immunofluorescence (IF) test in 152 clinical specimens (throat swabs) were compared with those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) isolation. The prevalence of RSV infections in the upper and lower respiratory tract was high especially in infants until 12 months of age. The average RSV isolation rate was 18.42%, whereas the virus antigen detection was positive in 19.74% of cases. The agreement between virus isolation and direct IF was 92.1%, the sensitivity of IF being 82.14% and its specificity 94.35%.
