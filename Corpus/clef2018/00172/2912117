Rapid streptococcal antigen detection in experimental keratitis. We assessed the role of commercially available immunodiagnostic procedures in comparison to Gram stain and culture in experimental bacterial keratitis. Rabbit corneas were inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. faecalis, or Haemophilus influenzae. Corneal scrapings were processed before and during antibacterial therapy using a coagglutination assay to detect pneumococcal capsular antigen (Phadebact Pneumococcus test) and an enzyme immunoassay to detect group A streptococcal cell-wall antigen (TestPack Strep A test). In untreated infected eyes, both immunoassays were highly specific and as sensitive as Gram stain for detection of the respective microorganisms. For S. pneumoniae keratitis, the sensitivity of coagglutination was 82% and Gram stain, 73%. For S. pyogenes keratitis, the sensitivity of enzyme immunoassay was 100% and Gram stain, 62%. Immunoassays and Gram stain were less sensitive than culture during antibacterial therapy. Successful clinical application of the coagglutination assay in a patient with pneumococcal keratitis permitted early use of specific cephalosporin treatment.
