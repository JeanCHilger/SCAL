Crosslinking of actin filaments and inhibition of actomyosin subfragment-1 ATPase activity by streptococcal M6 protein. M proteins are antiphagocytic molecules on the surface of group A streptococci having physical characteristics similar to those of mammalian tropomyosin. Both are alpha-helical coiled-coil fibrous structures with a similar seven-residue periodicity of nonpolar and charged amino acids. To determine if M protein is functionally similar to tropomyosin we studied the interaction of M protein with F-actin. At low ionic strength, M protein binds to actin weakly with a stoichiometry different from that of tropomyosin. M protein does not compete with tropomyosin for the binding to actin, indicating that it is functionally different from tropomyosin. M protein does compete with myosin subfragment-1 for binding to actin and induces the formation of bundles of actin filaments. The formation of actin aggregates is associated with a sharp reduction in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by subfragment-1. Intact streptococci having M protein on their surface are shown to bind to actin.
