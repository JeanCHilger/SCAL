Evaluation of a direct fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody for detection of cytomegalovirus in centrifugation culture. A fluorescein-conjugated murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactive with cytomegalovirus (CMV) was evaluated for the detection of CMV in centrifugation culture. Of 188 specimens, 90 were positive for CMV in centrifugation culture. The fluorescein-conjugated MAb detected CMV in 86 of 90 (95%) specimens at 16 h postinoculation, and 88 of 90 (98%) were positive at 36 h. The fluorescein-conjugated MAb can be used in a direct immunofluorescence assay that can be completed in 15 min following cover slip fixation. Use of this antibody in centrifugation culture provides a convenient and rapid assay for the identification of CMV.
