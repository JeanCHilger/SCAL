Microtechnique for serum opacity factor characterization of group A streptococci adaptable to the use of human sera. We have developed a microtechnique for detection of streptococcal serum opacity factor (OF) and for typing of group A streptococci by inhibition of OF. This technique, which involves the use of single wells of standard 96-well tissue culture plates, offers several advantages over previous methods: no advance test preparation is required, allowing tests to be quickly and easily performed only small quantities of reagents are required
