The pathogenetic potential of environmental antigens in IgA nephropathy. Patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) can be considered high responders for IgA production data which indicate a generalized hyperreactivity of the immune system include autoantibody production, increased response to viral vaccination, and high titers of antibodies to various common respiratory and gastrointestinal microbes. From clinical and experimental observations, two types of antigen seem to be most involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN, ie, environmental respiratory or gastrointestinal infectious agents and dietary antigens. A role played by microbes has been suggested because macroscopic hematuria shortly follows a pharyngitis or a gastrointestinal disturbance. Antibodies to a wide spectrum of viral and bacterial infectious agents have been detected in sera from patients with IgAN. The possible role of dietary antigens has been demonstrated experimentally in animal models. In human IgAN, antibodies to various dietary antigens have been detected in sera
