The distribution of immunocompetent cells in the compartments of the palatine tonsils in bacterial and viral infections of the upper respiratory tract. Employing a series of monoclonal antibodies directed against T cell subsets using the avidin-biotin complex method as the immunoperoxidase technique and using fluorescein-conjugated antisera directed against the major immunoglobulins, we have studied the distribution of immunocompetent cells in sections of tonsils from 21 patients with various inflammatory diseases of the tonsils, including Streptococcal tonsillitis, recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. The following conclusions can be made in regard to our study. The percentage of T cells decreases in all compartments of the tonsils with increasing episodes of tonsillitis as well as with infectious mononucleosis and Streptococcal tonsillitis. Similarly, the percentage of HLA-DR positive cells decreases with increasing episodes of tonsillitis and is statistically significant in the mantle zone. The percentage of IgM B cells and IgD B cells tends to increase in the extrafollicular zone and decrease in the mantle zone with increasing episodes of tonsillitis as well as with increasing age. The percentage of IgG and IgA plasma cells is highest in children who have had 3-5 episodes of tonsillitis, but markedly decreases in the follicle and extrafollicular compartments in patients who have had more than 5 episodes of tonsillitis. FACS analysis of B cells in the tonsils and peripheral blood show a marked decrease in IgD in both the tonsil and the peripheral blood and a significant increase of IgG in the peripheral blood. These findings may suggest late clonal expansion of B cells in recurrent tonsillitis and Streptococcal tonsillitis. Finally, the distribution of immunocompetent cells in recurrent tonsillitis, Streptococcal tonsillitis and tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis appears to be independent of age.
