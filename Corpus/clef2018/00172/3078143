Evaluation of four methods for the detection of streptococcal group A antigen directly from throat swabs. We have compared the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of four rapid tests for the detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci antigen directly from a throat swab. The four methods were very specific, all of them offered reproductibility and surpassed conventional culture in speed and simplicity.
