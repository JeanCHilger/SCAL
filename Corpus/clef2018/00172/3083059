Relationship between fibronectin and lymphoid cells in buccal mucosa, labial salivary glands and palatine tonsil. The distribution of fibronectin in human buccal mucosa and labial salivary glands and its relationship to lymphoid cells was studied using an immunoperoxidase technique and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. In all specimens fibronectin was associated with basement membranes of epithelia, vascular endothelium and perineural sheaths. In histologically normal areas of buccal mucosa fibronectin was distributed as a sparse network in the superficial lamina propria. A more extensive network of fibronectin was found within the lamina propria of mucosal specimens infiltrated with T lymphocytes, whereas fibronectin was absent in areas occupied by B lymphocytes. A similar relationship between lymphocyte type and the presence of a fibronectin network was found in labial glands and palatine tonsil. Fibronectin was not detected within oral, salivary gland, tonsillar crypt or capsular epithelium.
