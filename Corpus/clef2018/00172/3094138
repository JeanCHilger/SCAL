Detection of bacterial antigens in body fluids by the Phadebact system. 150 infected patients from 2 study centers had body fluids examined for presence of bacterial antigens (group B streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type b) using the Pharmacia Phadebact system. The rates of detection of the pneumococcal antigens in the urine or serum of the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumococcal meningitis were 0.38, 0.47 and 0.5, respectively. The overall detection rate for H. influenzae infections was 0.92 and for group B streptococcal infections 0.87. Serum and urine from 100 non-infected patients were also tested for the presence of group B streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b antigens with only 1 false positive (H. influenzae type b).
