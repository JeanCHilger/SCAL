Comparative studies on Actinomyces pyogenes and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. Actinomyces pyogenes and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum were further characterized. A. haemolyticum, in contrast to A. pyogenes, gave synergistic hemolytic reactions with streptococci of serological group B and inhibited staphylococcal beta-hemolysis. A. pyogenes and A. haemolyticum had a number of common, as well as distinctly different enzymatic properties, useful for their characterization. Extracts from A. pyogenes reacted with antiserum against streptococci of serological group G in contrast to those from A. haemolyticum.
