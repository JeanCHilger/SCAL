Evaluation of TestPack Strep A for the detection of group A streptococci in throat swabs. The performance of TestPack Strep A (Abbott Laboratories), a rapid enzyme immunoassay, was compared with a culture-based method for the detection of group A streptococci in 648 throat swabs. The rapid test correctly detected 99 of the 128 positive and 511 of the 520 negative specimens, a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 98%. Although highly specific, TestPack Strep A is less sensitive than culture techniques for the detection of group A streptococci in throat swabs.
