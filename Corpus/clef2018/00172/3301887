Novel color test for rapid detection of group A streptococci. A novel color test for the rapid detection of group A streptococci has been developed. The test, designed to be suitable for use in clinical laboratories as well as by less experienced personnel, incorporates the simplicity of latex tests with a color change to indicate the presence of group A streptococcal antigen. The test, which takes 5 min, was evaluated with 646 throat swabs, with a 15.6% incidence of group A streptococci for swabs which yielded 10 or more group A streptococcal colonies in cultures, the sensitivity was 96.8%, and the specificity was 99.1%. In addition, the color test was 100% sensitive and specific when used to detect group A streptococcal antigen in beta-hemolytic colonies from culture plates.
