What a difference a day makes: a decision analysis of adult streptococcal pharyngitis. With the availability of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) antigen detection tests, the management of adult pharyngitis is being reassessed. A decision analytic model was developed which considered four strategies: immediate treatment, no treatment, performing a rapid antigen test, or obtaining a bacterial culture. Patient outcomes were expressed in "well" days, which were reduced by the "sick" days associated with adverse reactions to treatment or complications of GABHS infection. When immediate test results are available, testing is the optimal strategy for probabilities of GABHS between 1 and 49 per cent. This range includes almost all patients, using probability estimates based on clinical criteria. The absolute benefit of testing was 0.1 days. The major advantage of a rapid test is the avoidance of penicillin reactions. Variations in the symptomatic benefits of treatment had minimal effects on the analysis. The analysis supports the use of an antigen test for adult patients with pharyngitis.
