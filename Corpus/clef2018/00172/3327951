Anti-streptopolysaccharide antibody in children with rheumatic fever and scarlet fever. As the serological test of streptococcal infection, the measurement of anti-exotoxin antibodies such as ASO is widely practiced. M protein of the cell wall of group A streptococcus has type specificity. To detect the anti M protein antibody is very significant, but it is not easy to apply this to clinical practice because there are many types and because of the difficulty of purifying M protein. C polypeptide has group specificity, so the measurement of the antibody to C polypeptide is very important as the serological test of group A streptococcus.
