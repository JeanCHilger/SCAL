Detection of group A streptococci in the laboratory or physician's office. Culture vs antibody methods. Much controversy has existed concerning the clinical significance of small numbers of group A streptococci (eg, one to ten or even 50 colonies) recovered in culture. The relative quantity of streptococci recovered is, in part, technique dependent. This review documents the need for sensitive throat culture technology, addresses technical problems associated with the culture procedure, and, in light of these problems, explores the need for very carefully performed studies on streptococcal antigen detection kits before their implementation as a routine test either in physicians' offices or in microbiology laboratories.
