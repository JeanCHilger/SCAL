Colonization of Nigerian neonates with group B streptococci and its rapid detection. The rate of colonization by group B streptococci among Nigerian neonates in Abeokuta was found to be 19% (38 of 200 newborns). The recently described serotype IV was the commonest (35.1%) among the strains isolated. Three methods for the rapid detection of heavy colonization by group B streptococci in neonates were compared: Gram stain of the pharyngeal aspirate collected immediately post-partum direct application of latex agglutination to the first post-partum pharyngeal aspirate
