Pharmacokinetics of intravenous immunoglobulin (Sandoglobulin) in neonates. Sandoglobulin administration to neonates was safe at a dose of 500 mg/kg. GBS-specific IgG was significantly elevated for 14 days postinfusion. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest a two-compartment model with a redistribution phase and terminal elimination phase. A half-life of 11.3 days for the initial phase and 30.7 days for the terminal phase was observed. Further, studies will be necessary to determine if IGIV therapy will be effective in preventing or treating GBS infections in neonates.
