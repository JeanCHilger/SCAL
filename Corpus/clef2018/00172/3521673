A method for the rapid detection of streptococcal group A antigen by specific monoclonal antibody. In this study we evaluate the efficacy of a method for the rapid detection of group A streptococci employing a hybridoma mouse antibody specific against group A streptococcal carbohydrate. Using coagglutination technique we demonstrated an absolute specificity. The sensitivity was absolute if the preparation contained greater than or equal to 5 X 10(4) cocci. This test seems therefore a valid criterion for symptomatic patients with a larger number of group A streptococci in throat specimens, more sensitive than other methods, but not sensitive enough for carriers of few bacteria.
