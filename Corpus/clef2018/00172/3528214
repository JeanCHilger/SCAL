Evaluation of spot CAMP test for identification of group B streptococci. The CAMP (Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen) test is commonly used for the presumptive identification of Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield group B). Using 350 clinical isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci, we compared a 30-min spot CAMP test with the standard overnight CAMP test and the Lancefield precipitin test. We found 99% agreement among all three tests for all streptococci tested. The spot CAMP test is a rapid, inexpensive, and accurate method for identifying group B streptococci.
