Incidence of circulating immune complexes in patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and in patients with streptococcal impetigo. In an attempt to further study the possible contribution of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in the pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, 61 patients with APSGN were studied during the first three weeks of the disease, and 13 patients with noncomplicated streptococcal impetigo as a control group. C1q solid phase ELISA and Conglutinin (K) solid phase ELISA were used to measure the levels of immune complexes. The incidence of CIC in a single serum sample from patients with APSGN was 48%. Elevated levels of immune complexes were found in 46% of the patients with streptococcal impetigo. The absolute levels of CIC were comparable in both groups of patients. No correlation was found among the presence of CIC and the clinical, immunoserological or pathological findings of the disease. Our results do not support the hypothesis that trapping of the circulating immune complexes play an important role on the renal injury poststreptococcal infection. Instead, we suggest that CIC are an epiphenomena present in APSGN, and may represent rather a systemic inflammatory immune response in patients with group A streptococcal infection.
