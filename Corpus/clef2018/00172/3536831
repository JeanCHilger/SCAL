Rapid method for the detection of group B streptococci from human sources. A modification of the classical CAMP test has been devised for the rapid detection of streptococci of serological Group B from human sources. The method was compared with detection based on the development of orange pigmented colonies on a starch-based medium and with detection by conventional methods. In a survey of vaginal carriage of Group B streptococci in parturient women, the modified CAMP test detected a carriage rate of 13.09%, the starch-based, pigment enhancing medium, 5.76% and the conventional methods, 8.38%. It proved to be particularly useful for detecting the organisms in the presence of other bacteria.
