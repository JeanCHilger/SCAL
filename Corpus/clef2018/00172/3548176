Determination of antibodies against ribosomes and various cell wall components and detection of circulating antigens of group A Streptococcus in patients with erysipelas. The level of antibodies to the ribosomes, polysaccharide A and peptidoglycan of group A streptococcus in the blood of patients with primary, secondary, and often relapsing erysipelas was studied by means of the enzyme immunoassay with the use of the sandwich techniques. For control, the sera of healthy donors were used. In the sera obtained from all groups of erysipelas patients a significant rise in the levels of antibodies to ribosomes and peptidoglycan in comparison with the controls was revealed. An increase in the level of antibodies to polysaccharide A was revealed only in patients with frequently relapsing and secondary erysipelas. Depending on the clinical form and the duration of the disease, polysaccharide A was detected in 32-51.9% of erysipelas patients and protein-ribosomal antigen was detected in 28.6-51.9% of such patients.
