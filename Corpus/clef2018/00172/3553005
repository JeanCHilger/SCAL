Induction of biologically active antibodies by a polyvalent synthetic vaccine constructed without carrier. Four synthetic peptides that copy fragments of two bacterial antigens (Streptococcus pyogenes M protein and diphtheria toxin), one viral antigen (hepatitis B surface antigen), and one parasitic antigen (circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium knowlesi) were covalently bound within the same construct. This totally synthetic polyvalent administered to mice with Freund complete adjuvant or in saline with murabutide (an adjuvant-active muramyl peptide) elicited high levels of antibodies which, in certain cases, were shown to be biologically active. The results indicated that these antibodies recognized specifically the four peptides. None of the epitopes were immunodominant. It was also demonstrated that the association of several peptides enhanced their respective immunogenicities as compared with those of their homopolymers. Finally, this study shows that a totally synthetic vaccine administered in saline with a synthetic adjuvant can be immunogenic in the absence of a protein carrier.
