Ten-minute detection of group A streptococci in pediatric throat swabs. A 10-min latex agglutination test kit, Culturette Brand Ten-Minute Group A Strep ID (Marion Scientific, Div. of Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, Mo.), was assessed for the rapid detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus directly from a throat swab. Four hundred and thirty-five throat swab specimens from children with suspected group A streptococcal infection were tested by the Ten-Minute Group A Strep ID and by concurrent conventional culture. The strep test was effective in detecting group A streptococcal infection 90% (63/70) of culture-positive specimens gave positive latex tests. The specificity of the test was 99.2% (362/365). The predictive values were 95.5% for positives and 98.1% for negatives. Overall agreement with culture was 98% (425/435). This test offers a sensitive and specific method for the early detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in throat swabs of children and would be most useful in a hospital laboratory or pediatrician's office.
