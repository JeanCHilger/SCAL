Rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis in two pediatric offices using a latex agglutination kit. The diagnostic accuracy and practicality of a latex agglutination test for the rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis directly from throat swabs were evaluated in two private pediatric practices. Compared with anaerobic throat culture the latex agglutination method had a sensitivity of 93.4%, a specificity of 90.2% and an overall accuracy of 91.8%. Even used as a while-you-wait test, the rapid method fit easily into the routine of busy office practice. Latex agglutination testing for the rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis may prove to be a valuable adjunct to the office microbiology laboratory.
