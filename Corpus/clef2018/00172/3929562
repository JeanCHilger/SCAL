Binding of aggregated human serum albumin to M12 and some other types of group A streptococci. In radiobinding tests many group A, C and G streptococci react with IgG and IgA, irrespective of the antigen-combining sites, as well as with various other serum proteins, e.g. human serum albumin (HSA). The present study demonstrated that glutaraldehyde-aggregated, radiolabelled HSA (a*HSA), in comparison to monomeric HSA, binds more avidly to streptococci. Of group A streptococci, strains representing types M6, M12, M18, M46, M55 and M57 displayed pronounced binding of a*HSA whereas a number of other serotypes were non-reactive. The streptococcal sites involved proved to be relatively heat-resistant and highly sensitive to trypsin treatment. Human fibrinogen counteracted the binding of a*HSA. The uptake by M12 was inhibited strongly by rabbit antiserum raised against M12, whereas other antisera were less active. The results suggest that the bacterial structure binding a*HSA is a protein and that, in at least one serotype, M12, the binding occurs to the M-protein.
