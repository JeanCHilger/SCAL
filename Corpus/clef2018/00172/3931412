Genetic transformation in Streptococcus sanguis. Identification, surface spreading and competence of invasive strains of Streptococcus sanguis Lancefield groups H and W and other invasive viridans streptococci. Of 46 viridans streptococci isolated from cases of probably true bacteremia, 26 strains or 56% could be grouped serologically in the Lancefield system. Eight strains (17%) were identified as serogroup H (characteristic of Streptococcus sanguis), ten strains (22%) as serogroup W (a new group antigen found in S. sanguis) and eight strains (17%) as serogroup K (related to S. mitis (mitior)). The high number of serogroupable viridans streptococci was specially due to the introduction of serogroup W and indicates the importance of this serogroup in cases of bacteremia. A set of six diagnostic tests (production of hydrogen peroxide, arginine and esculin hydrolysis, polysaccharide production, Voges-Proskauer reaction, mannitol fermentation) was used for speciation of the viridans streptococci in addition, search for spreading zones around the colonies was included in the diagnostic procedure. Spreading zones were only present in S. sanguis and occurred more frequently in group H strains than group W strains. The 46 viridans streptococci were tested in genetic transformation. The prevalence of spontaneous competence in strains isolated from the blood was high, particularly in S. sanguis serogroup H (88%) and W (50%). For serogroup H, spontaneous competence was found as frequently among invasive strains as among carrier isolates previously studied.
