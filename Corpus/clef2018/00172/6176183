Three infants with congenital rubella syndrome were given human leukocyte (alpha) interferon at doses of 2 x 10(5) to 7 X 10(5) U/kg per day for 10 days. A transient decrease in pharyngeal virus excretion was observed with treatment. No significant side effects were associated with the administration of human leukocyte interferon to these infants.
