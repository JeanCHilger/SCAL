Free and bound antigen of Streptococcus group A L forms and the circulating immune complex level of erysipelas patients. The level of circulating immune complexes in the blood serum of patients with relapsing erysipelas was found to be correlated with the level of the antigen of group A S. haemolyticus L-forms, this antigen entering in to the composition of the immune complexes. In 68% of cases the antigen of the streptococcal L-forms was bound and only in 20% of cases, free. High titers of antibodies to group A S. haemolyticus L-forms in patients with relapsing erysipelas at the absence of free antigen indirectly suggests that the antigen is incorporated into antigen-antibody complexes.
