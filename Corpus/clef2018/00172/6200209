Natural cytotoxicity of lymphocytes and monocytes and its augmentation by OK432 in melanoma patients. Lymphocytes and monocytes from the peripheral blood of 30 patients with malignant melanoma were tested for natural cytotoxicity against K562 cells in a 3-h 51Cr-release assay, and the effects of OK432 (a streptococcal preparation) on the cytotoxicity were examined. The lymphocyte cytotoxicity of melanoma patients was similar to that of normal donors and control patients with benign skin disease. Furthermore, the lymphocyte cytotoxicity of melanoma patients was not correlated to the stage of the disease. Similarly, lysis of K562 cells by monocytes isolated by adherence to autologous serum-coated plastic dishes in melanoma patients was comparable to that of controls and not associated with the stage of the disease. Positive monocyte reactions were recorded in 10 of 30 (33%) melanoma patients, seven of 21 (33%) normal donors and three of 10 (30%) control patients. There was no correlation between lymphocyte cytotoxicity and monocyte cytotoxicity. Overnight treatment of monocytes and lymphocytes with OK432 resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity. Significant augmentation of cytotoxicity by OK432 was observed in 28% of the monocyte samples and 86% of the lymphocyte samples, while partially purified human interferon augmented cytotoxicity in 63% of the monocyte samples and all the lymphocyte samples. These results suggest that neither lymphocyte nor monocyte cytotoxicities are depressed in melanoma patients as compared with normal donors and patients with benign disease and that OK432 has a stronger stimulatory effect on lymphocytes than on monocytes.
