Two cases of coxsackie B2 infection in neonates: clinical, virological, and epidemiological aspects. Two cases of neonatal coxsackie virus B2 infection are described. One infant presented with meningitis and enteritis, the other with rhinitis, meningoencephalitis, and enteritis. Both infants made good recoveries. The virus infection could also be demonstrated in all nonimmune family members, most of whom gave a history of recent mild febrile disease (pharyngitis, diarrhea). Enterovirus infections may be suspected in cases of neonatal meningitis or myocarditis associated with gastrointestinal signs, especially 1. when it is during the hot season July-October, 2. when there has been febrile illness in other family members recently. For an effective and rapid isolation of the agent, rectal swabs or stool specimens not only from the patient, but also from household contacts should be sent to the virus laboratory on several consecutive days. Meningitic infection may be proved by an early c.s.f. sample. For serodiagnosis a first blood specimen should be drawn as soon as possible, a second one some days later. The importance of rapid virological diagnosis and of stringent hygienic measures to prevent spread of the infection is stressed.
