Stimulation of lymphokine formation as an index of reactivity to bacterial antigens. In the cultures of lymphocytes from healthy donors, activated by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcal antigens (allergens) the formation of lymphokines stimulating the oxygen-dependent metabolism of human neutrophils was studied. The preparations yielded positive reactions in a wide range of concentrations (2-60 micrograms/ml) in experiments with concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml these reactions were observed, respectively, in 71.5%, 40.0% and 47.7% of the donors. Individual features were most pronounced when minimally active concentrations were used, and an increase in dosage led to smoothing out differences and to an increase in lymphokine production. Direct contact with allergens did not induce the stimulation of neutrophils. The results thus obtained are discussed from the viewpoint of the functional cooperation of different effector systems of immunity.
