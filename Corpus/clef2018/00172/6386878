Enzyme immunoassay for the detection of group A streptococcal antigen. A competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay for the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes directly from throat specimens or from solid bacteriological medium is described. Group A-specific polysaccharide adsorbed onto treated polystyrene beads, in conjunction with rabbit antibody to S. pyogenes, was used to determine the presence of the polysaccharide antigen. Inhibition values in excess of 65% were observed with 10(4) or more CFU of S. pyogenes per test. An inhibition of 25% was demonstrated with as few as 10(3) CFU per test. Heterologous microorganisms tested at 10(6) CFU per test reacted at levels of inhibition less than 25%. Two types of bacterial transport medium and swabs of different fiber compositions did not alter the assay performance. Accurate identification of S. pyogenes was achieved by testing single colonies picked directly from blood agar plates which had been incubated for 18 to 24 h. In addition, the assay was performed on throat specimens from children and adults having pharyngitis. A single-swab, blind study was conducted in which enzyme immunoassay reactivity was compared with results of blood agar culture and bacitracin sensitivity. When there were discordant results, serological identification was used as the confirmatory test. At an optimal cutoff value of 40% inhibition, sensitivity and specificity by enzyme immunoassay were 97.0% and 97.9%, respectively, as compared with confirmed culture results. The assay has an incubation time of 3 h and is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of S. pyogenes antigen.
