Evaluation of the Strep-A-Fluor identification method for group A streptococci. Strep-A-Fluor (Bio Spec, Inc., Dublin, Calif.) is a new test designed for the rapid identification of group A streptococci. A filter paper strip impregnated with a synthetic substrate is used to detect a specific aminopeptidase present in group A streptococci by UV fluorescence. In a blind study, 305 beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were correctly categorized as group A or non-group A.
