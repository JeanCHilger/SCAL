Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card. Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
