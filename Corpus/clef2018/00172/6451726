Clinical studies on cefoperazone in the pediatric field (author's transl). Cefoperazone (CPZ) at dose levels of 80 approximately 100 mg/kg/day, divided 3 approximately 4 times, was drip-infused or intravenously injected for a period of 2 approximately 6 days to 10 patients. All 10 cases, 4 cases of bronchopneumonia from which H. influenzae was detected (Group A S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were also detected in each 1 case). 2 cases of coli urinary tract infection, 1 case of acute colitis from which pathogenic E. coli was detected, 1 case of E. coli carrier, 1 case of acute bronchitis (bacteria were not detected), and 1 case of urinary tract infection (bacteria were not detected) showed rapid improvement of clinical symptoms with rapid eradication of the pathogenic bacteria. In one case of urinary tract infection where S. epidermidis and S. faecalis were simultaneously detected, S. epidermidis was removed but S. faecalis was merely decreased. The effective antibacterial concentration after intravenous injection of CPZ in the feces was determined and found to be present in sufficient concentrations to prevent colon infection. No particular side effects were observed during CPZ therapy.
