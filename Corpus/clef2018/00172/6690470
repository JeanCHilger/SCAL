Identification of group C streptococcal antigen extracts with lectin-bound polystyrene particles. Crude extracts of Dolichos biflorus can be coupled to polystyrene particles to yield an agglutination reagent for the detection of group C streptococcal antigen extracts. The reagent is relatively inexpensive and simple to prepare and can be employed for the definitive identification of this beta-hemolytic streptococcus.
