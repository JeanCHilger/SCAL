Detection of pneumococci in blood cultures by latex agglutination. Latex agglutination by use of the Pneumoslide test on clinical blood cultures detected 22 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains as the etiological agents in 47 streptococcal septic episodes. The other 25 isolates were identified as viridans streptococci or streptococci of groups A, B, D, or G. The test demonstrated 100% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and predictive values for positive and negative reactions of 91 and 92%, respectively. Two false-positive reactions were caused by strains of viridans streptococci. The two strains continued to give positive reactions when colonies from blood agar plates were tested according to the instructions of the manufacturer. This latex agglutination test is an effective tool for the rapid diagnosis of pneumococci in blood cultures.
