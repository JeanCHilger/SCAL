Complex surveillance of Streptococcus pyogenes V. Protective features complex surveillance of streptococcus of cell-mediated immunity against group a streptococci. Exoproducts of incubated white blood elements from persons hypersensitive to zymosan were found to promote the phagocytic activity of human microphages (and guinea pig macrophages) under conditions of a combined model of "MIF-opsonophagocytic test". The stimulation resulted in a bacteriostatic effect, was non-type-specific and improved microphage potential to inactivate streptococci opsonized with anti-M antibodies in low titre. The microphages pre-exposed to anti-M sera remained unaffected, the effect was non-species-specific and nontype-specific and the stimulation resulted from the action of albumin fraction exoproducts. This seems to suggest that human mediators (lymphokines) may promote the activity of phagocytes. The cell-mediated immunity appears thus to have protective features even in the case of streptococci which are the typical extracellular parasites. The drawbacks of the model used, which make it difficult to quantify the found mechanism under in vivo conditions, are discussed in detail.
