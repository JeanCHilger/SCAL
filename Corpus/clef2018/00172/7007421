Hemolysin and K antigens in relation to serotype and hemagglutination type of Escherichia coli isolated from extraintestinal infections. Escherichia coli isolated from cases of bacteremia and from a variety of urinary tract infections were characterized according to serotype (O:H antigenicity), K type (possession of K1, K2, K3, K12, or K13), hemagglutination (HA) type, and production of beta-hemolysin. Results obtained with the bacteremia and urinary tract infection isolates were similar except for more hemolytic isolated from urine than from blood (42 versus 29%) and more K1+ isolates from blood than from urine (50 versus 29%). A close correlation was found between Ha type VI (production of fimbriae which mediate mannose-resistant HA of human and African green monkey erythrocytes) and the production of hemolysin or K1 capsular antigen or both. Most (95 of 98, or 95%) of the HA type VI+ blood isolates and most (146 of 164, or 89%) of the HA type VI+ urine isolates produced hemolysin or K1 or both, in contrast to 22 and 26%, respectively, of those belonging to HA types other than HA type VI. Also, 76% of all hemolytic and 70% of all K1+ isolates belonged to HA type VI. Remarkably few of the HA type VI+ isolates (13%) and even fewer of the HA type VI- isolates (3%) produced both K1 and hemolysin these belonged mainly to serotypes O16:H6, O18:H7 and O2:H4. Other major serogroups were usually K1+/hemolysin- (O1, O7) or K1-/hemolysin+ (O2, O4, O6). At least 74% (262 of 351) and possibly as many as 83% (293 of 351) of those isolates which produced mannose-resistant HA of human erythrocytes were classified as HA type VI+
