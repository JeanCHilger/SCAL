The determination of antistreptokinase by an immunoenzyme method. The sensitivity of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of antistreptokinase, a new method for its measurements, is 10 times higher than the sensitivity of the prototype method. EIA is more sensitive than the prototype method, the incorrectness of the latter being ruled out endogenous substrates, patients's blood fibrinogen and plasminogen, are used, whose concentrations vary in streptococcal diseases. Effects of nonspecific blood proteinase which, together with streptokinase, may cause a proteolytic effect, on the results of analysis are also ruled out. Microquantities of blood serum are needed for EIA of streptokinase, whereas at least 2 ml of plasma is required for the prototype test. The suggested method is more informative, since it detects the diagnostic titers in a wider range, vs. the prototype technique, and is more diagnostically valuable in comparison with other tests for the diagnosis of streptococcal infection, detection of antistreptolysin 0 and antihyaluronidase.
