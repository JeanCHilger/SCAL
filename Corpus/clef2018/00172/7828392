Indium-111 labelled leucocyte uptake in aortitis. Inflammatory conditions of the aorta may present with non-specific clinical features, including unexplained fever. Indium-111 labelled leucocyte imaging may be performed in such patients to look for the presence of occult sepsis or to assess the activity of a known vasculitis. Of approximately 1100 patients to undergo leucocyte scintigraphy for these indications over a 5 year period, three had focal leucocyte uptake in the aorta. The final diagnoses were: (1) periaortitis in Wegener's granulomatosis (2) aortic dissection in giant cell arteritis
