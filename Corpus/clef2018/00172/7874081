Streptokinase alleles and disease association in group A streptococci. Allele-specific oligonucleotides were used for PCR-based typing of the streptokinase locus of group A streptococcal strains, including well characterized type strains, isolates from patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and strains from Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory of Australia. The streptokinase SKN allele, previously thought to be associated with glomerulonephritis, was no more frequent in nephritogenic than in non-nephritogenic streptococcal strains in this collection.
