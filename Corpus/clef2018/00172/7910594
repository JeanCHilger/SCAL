Mycobacterium tuberculosis alters expression of adhesion molecules on monocytic cells. The host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is characterized by interactions between mononuclear cells, with recruitment and fusion of these cells culminating in granuloma formation. In addition, the host response to M. tuberculosis requires CD4+ T-cell reactivity, mediated by antigen-independent as well as antigen-dependent mechanisms. Thus, we hypothesized that cell adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1 CD54) would participate in the response to infection with M. tuberculosis. Exposure of THP-1 cells derived from a monocyte/macrophage cell line to M. tuberculosis (1:1 bacterium/cell ratio) elicited a sustained increase (660% +/- 49% above resting level) in the expression of ICAM-1 that continued for at least 72 h. Neither the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1
