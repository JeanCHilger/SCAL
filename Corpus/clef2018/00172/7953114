Enzyme immunoassay test system for detection of antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes group-specific A polysaccharide in blood droplets on paper. An enzyme immunoassay-based test system has been developed to assess the level of specific antibodies to A polysaccharide which permits analysis of material (droplets of native sera or blood eluate) collected on filter paper. Special variants of the test system permit separate detection of IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies. The test system is fit for clinical and epidemiologic studies.
