Colonization of professional divers by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 and V. cholerae non-O1 at dive sites in the United States, Ukraine and Russia. Vibrio cholerae, recognized as the causative agent of epidemic cholera, was isolated from healthy professional divers and from water samples collected at dive sites in the United States, Ukraine and Russia. Swabs of nose, ear and throat of divers and their tank regulators, i.e. the divers and their diving gear, were taken before and after routine dives. Blood samples were collected before and 30-60 days after each dive to measure IgG and IgA titers against the whole cell antigen of V. cholerae O1. Nine strains of V. cholerae O1 and nine strains of V. cholerae non-O1 were isolated during this study. These isolates were identified by conventional biochemical tests and indirect fluorescent antibody staining methods, using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody, COLTA, prepared against the 'A' antigenic factor of the lipopolysaccharide of V. cholerae O1, and serotyped by slide agglutination. Seven of the nine strains of V. cholerae O1 isolated and successfully cultured during the studies, were toxigenic by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction. Analyses of IgG and IgA antibodies of the divers showed that most of the divers had prior exposure to V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae serotype non-O1 strains isolated during the study were found to be non-toxigenic.
