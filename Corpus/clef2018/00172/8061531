The contribution of latex tests for the diagnosis of bacterial infections in Abidjan. From 313 samples of CSF, urine, sera and pleural liquid, the authors show how appreciable is the contribution in research of soluble antigens by sensibilized latex particles agglutination method in etiologic diagnosis, especially during meningitis, pulmonary and neonatal infections. Soluble antigens were declared positives in 62.26% of cases against S. pneumoniae, 25.4% of cases against H. influenzae, 6.66% of cases against S. agalactiae, 5.71% of cases against N. meningitidis C, with variable percentages from one biological liquid to another. Compared to classical bacteriologic techniques, this method allows the diagnosis of an infection even when decapitated, and could be used in emergency diagnosis.
