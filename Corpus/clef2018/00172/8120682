Adult bacterial nasopharyngitis: a clinical entity? To investigate bacterial nasopharyngitis as a cause of adult upper respiratory infection.Prospective case series.Walk-in medical clinic of a university hospital.507 patients with cold or flu symptoms, sore throat, or recent cough 21 control subjects without symptoms of upper respiratory infection.After thorough history and physical examination, the patients underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration and throat culture. Nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for both bacteria and viruses antigens for influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were sought by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria may have a causal role in adult nasopharyngitis, although further data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
