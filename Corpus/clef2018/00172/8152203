Effectiveness and tolerance of cefixime in comparison with penicillin V in bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis in children. Cefixime Study Group. 154 children aged 2 to 12 years with clinical diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis and--in most of the patients--a positive enzyme immunoassay for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci before therapy were enrolled in this open controlled randomized and multicenter trial. The children received either 8 mg/kg bodyweight cefixime once daily or 20,000 I.E. pencillin V/kg bodyweight t.i.d. Clinical evaluation and microbiological tests were carried out before treatment and 1-5 days after end of the treatment. 3-4 weeks after end of the treatment the rate of relapses was evaluated. The data of 149 children could be evaluated for clinical efficacy. In the cefixime group 93.3% of the children were cured and 6.7% improved compared to 89.2% and 10.8%, respectively, in the penicillin V group. Complete microbiological data were obtained from 136 patients. The eradication rate was 82.7% in the cefixime group and 77% in the group of patients treated with penicillin V. At follow up relapses were seen in 7 of the cefixime treated patients and in 6 of those receiving penicillin V. Mild side effects were reported by 4 patients in the cefixime group and by 3 children treated with penicillin V (1 drop out each). These results show that cefixime once daily is at least as effective as penicillin V t.i.d. in pharyngitis and tonsillitis in children. Both compounds are well tolerated.
