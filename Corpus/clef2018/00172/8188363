M12 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is a receptor for immunoglobulin G3 and human albumin. We previously showed that M12 protein from opacity factor-negative Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci) CS24 is responsible for immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) binding activity. Here, we report that this M protein binds human serum albumin (HSA). Deletion analysis showed that the C repeats are sufficient for binding HSA, although upstream regions may be required for optimal binding. Like protein G, IgG3 and HSA bind to independent domains in the M protein. Experiments showed that bound IgG3 did not inhibit HSA binding to the M protein. The interaction between M12 protein and HSA is specific. M12 protein does not bind chicken egg and bovine serum albumins. Alignments of C1 and C2 repeats of M12 protein to sequences at the carboxy termini of other M proteins and Ig receptors revealed highly homologous sequences in the FcRV, M5, M6, ML2.1, and M57 proteins, suggesting that all could bind HSA. As predicted from the alignment, M5 protein and M6+ streptococci bound HSA, whereas an isogenic M6- mutant did not bind HSA. Furthermore, M2 protein from an opacity factor-positive strain also bound HSA.
