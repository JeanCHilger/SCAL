Rapid detection of Streptococcus pyogenes in pediatric patient specimens by DNA probe. A chemiluminescent DNA probe test (Group A Streptococcus Direct Test Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) for rapid, direct detection of cRNA of Streptococcus pyogenes in throat swabs was compared with conventional culture and identification techniques. Throat swabs from 277 patients suspected of having streptococcal pharyngitis were examined. By DNA probe alone, 10 specimens were positive, 51 were positive by both assays, and 8 were positive by culture alone. Thus, DNA probe sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 86, 95, 84, and 96%, respectively. Including an indeterminate category, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 89, 96, 86, and 97%, respectively. After discrepancy testing, these values for the raw data improved to 90, 98, 93, and 97%, respectively. None of the 24 specimens that grew non-S. pyogenes beta-hemolytic streptococci in culture were positive by the DNA probe. Because mucoid S. pyogenes strains are more virulent than nonmucoid strains, 24 isolates were retrospectively tested with the DNA probe to ensure that both types would be detected equally well. Isolates were examined in pure cultures as well as mixed with representative normal oral flora. There was no statistical difference in detection of any of the four groups. Group A Streptococcus Direct Test is a rapid, sensitive, and specific test for S. pyogenes.
