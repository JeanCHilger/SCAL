Comparison of the Gen-Probe Group A streptococcus Direct Test with culture and a rapid streptococcal antigen detection assay for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. The Gen-Probe Group A Streptococcus Direct Test (GP-ST) is a new assay which utilizes a nucleic acid probe to detect group A streptococci directly from pharyngeal swabs. In this study, 1,103 specimens were cultured and tested by GP-ST. The sensitivities and specificities were as follows: culture, 98.8 and 100% GP-ST, 92.4 and 99.6%. Of the 1,103 specimens, 808 were also tested with the TestPack Strep A assay. For the specimens tested by all three methods, the sensitivities and specificities were as follows: culture, 99.5 and 100%
