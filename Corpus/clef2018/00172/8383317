Pharyngitis in children. Although the group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is the most important treatable cause of pharyngitis, other organisms, including viruses and groups C and G streptococci, should always be considered in the diagnosis of pharyngeal symptoms. Clinical findings and a rapid strep test aid in making the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. In nonallergic patients with the latter, penicillin V potassium is the antibiotic of choice for those allergic to penicillin, erythromycin is my preferred alternative.
