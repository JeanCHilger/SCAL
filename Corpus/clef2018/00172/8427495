Immune response to Prevotella intermedia in patients with recurrent nonstreptococcal tonsillitis. The role of three oral flora organisms (Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was investigated in 31 children with recurrent nonstreptococcal tonsillitis. Antibody titers to the three organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the 31 patients, as well as in 32 control patients who had not suffered from recurrent tonsillitis. None of the individuals in either group suffered from periodontal or dental illness. Significantly higher antibody levels to P intermedia were found in the study group as compared to controls (median 91.0 versus 72.5 p = .02). In contrast, the antibody titers to the other two organisms were generally low (less than 0.30), and no difference was found among the two study groups. The elevated antibody levels to P intermedia, a known oral pathogen that is also isolated from most recurrently inflamed tonsils, suggest a pathogenic role for this organism in recurrent tonsillitis.
