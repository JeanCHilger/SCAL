The diagnostic and prognostic significance of the indices of the immune response to streptococcal group A antigens in rheumatism. Serum samples obtained from 33 patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF), 60 patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and 30 adult healthy persons have been studied. Antibodies to streptococcal A polysaccharide (SAP) and lypoteichoic acid (LTA) were examined by ELISA, to streptolysin O by standard technique. SAP antibodies in high titers persisted from 5 to 12 months in ARF and rheumatic carditis patients especially when RHD was developing. High titers of antibodies to LTA and SLO persisted for 3 months since ARF onset, then fell (p < 0.05). ELISA proved sensitive in determination of antibodies to SAP and LTA. Its combination with determination of the titers to SLO antigens confirmed Streptococcus A infection involvement in emergence of ARF in all the cases including insidious or late-onset carditis and chorea. High levels of antibodies to SAP and LTA were more frequently detected in patients with RHD than in healthy persons (p < 0.001). Correlation between frequency of high levels of antibodies to SAP and bicillin 5 or erythromycin administration, duration of RHD was not established.
