Recombinant, octavalent group A streptococcal M protein vaccine. One of the major obstacles to the development of group A streptococcal M protein vaccines is the multiplicity of M serotypes expressed by these organisms. In this study, we have constructed a recombinant, hybrid M protein that contains type-specific aminoterminal fragments of eight different M proteins. We show that the purified hybrid recombinant protein is immunogenic in rabbits and evokes antibodies that react with native M proteins from the respective streptococcal serotypes. In addition, the immune sera evoked by the octavalent protein opsonized six of the eight serotypes of streptococci, indicating that the majority of the M protein fragments contained protective epitopes that retained their native conformations in the hybrid protein. None of the antisera raised against the octavalent protein crossreacted with human heart tissue. These studies indicate that multivalent, hybrid M proteins may be used to elicit broadly protective immune responses against multiple serotypes of group A streptococci.
