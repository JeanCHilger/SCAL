Roles of the bacterial cell wall and capsule in induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha by type III group B streptococci. Group B streptococci (GBS) are the major cause of sepsis and fatal shock in neonates in the United States. The precise role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the development of human GBS sepsis has not been defined however, whole GBS have been shown to induce the production of this inflammatory cytokine. We sought to determine which bacterial cell wall components of GBS are responsible for triggering TNF-alpha production. Human cord blood monocytes were stimulated with encapsulated (COH1) or unencapsulated (COH1-13) whole type III GBS or with purified bacterial components, including type III capsular polysaccharide (III-PS), group B polysaccharide (GB-PS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or peptidoglycan (PG). Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli served as a control. Supernatants were harvested at specific timed intervals, and TNF-alpha levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Monocytes exposed to COH1 and COH1-13 induced similar amounts of TNF-alpha. III-PS, GB-PS, LTA, and PG each induced TNF-alpha in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. However, TNF-alpha release was significantly greater after stimulation by the GB-PS or PG than after stimulation by III-PS or LTA (P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that GB-PS and PG are the bacterial cell wall components primarily evoking TNF-alpha release. These, alone or in concert with other factors, may be responsible for septic shock accompanying GBS sepsis.
