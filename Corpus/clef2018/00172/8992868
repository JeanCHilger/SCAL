Evaluation of the therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis using Abbott Test Pack strep A. A total of 953 children (511 boys and 442 girls) with streptococcal pharyngitis diagnosed with Abbott Test Pack Strep A (ATPSA) or throat cultures were analyzed. ATPSA specimens were repeatedly obtained until ATPSA turned negative during or after the treatment. The percentage of positive ATPSA specimens reached the lowest value (9.2%) on the fourth day of the course of the treatment, which indicates the acquisition from an infected individual is probably uncommon after the initial treatment. Bacteriological treatment failure (positive ATPSA after 14 days of treatment) occurred in 4.1% of the children. Out of 953 subjects studied, 216 (22.7%) had recurrent infections. More than 30% of the recurrent infections occurred within 2 months after initial infection. ATPSA is useful for establishing a rapid diagnosis and confirming the bacteriological success of the treatment.
