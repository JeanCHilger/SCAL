Cytokines in acute rheumatic fever. Plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF alpha) were determined by ELISA in 27 patients with acute rheumatic fever (RF), 12 with only arthritis (RFA) and 15 with rheumatic heart disease (RHD), before, during and after treatment. Altogether, significant increases in TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 levels were observed in the acute phase as compared to the data found during and after treatment. No significant differences were observed for the other cytokines. Elevations of one or more of the inflammatory cytokines were observed in 9 of 12 patients with RFA, and 12 of 15 with RHD. Increase of TNF alpha (6/9) and IL-8 (5/9) levels were higher in RHD patients with cardiac failure. These cytokines were below the detection limits on day 7 of treatment in all 22 patients, except in two, and in all 10 days after treatment.These findings suggest that inflammatory cytokines, as TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-6, may play a pathogenic role in rheumatic fever.
