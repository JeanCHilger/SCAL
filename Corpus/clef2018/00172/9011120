Rapid detection of the hemolysin genes in Aeromonas sobria by the polymerase chain reaction. The hemolysin of Aeromonas sobria is one of the important virulence factors in this organism. Rapid detection and identification test for A. sobria is important for early and specific diagnosis of this infectious disease. We evaluated the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the rapid detection of A. sobria. Two pairs of synthetic oligonucleotide primers (ASA1-s and a AerAAS-s and a) were used in PCR technique to detect the different hemolysin genes (ASA1 and aerAAS) in A. sobria. The PCR identified 91% of ASA1-positive and 23.4% of aerAAS-positive strains in beta-hemolytic A. sobria. Other species of Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae O1 and V. parahaemolyticus tested were negative in the PCR with two pairs of primers. The PCR technique for detection of two hemolysin genes suggested the possibility of application of this method for detection of A. sobria in A. sobria-associated infections.
