Systemic immune response to Streptococcal and Staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids in children with recurrent tonsillitis. The antibodies to LTA of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in sera from 110 children with or without recurrent tonsillitis were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibody of IgA class was not detected in any sera. There was a significant positive correlation between IgG and IgM antibody levels to LTA of S. pyogenes and those to LTA of S. aureus. There was no significant correlation between anti-LTA IgM antibody and age or episodes of tonsillitis. However, serum anti-LTA IgG levels in younger patients ( < or = 7 y.o.) were significantly lower than those in their elders (>7 y.o.) (anti-S. pyogenes p = 0.0007, anti-S. aureus
