Immune responses against Streptococcus pyogenes in human palatine tonsils. We investigated cellular immunity against Streptococcus pyogenes in human tonsils by measuring antigen-specific immunoglobulin-secreting cells and the production of cytokines from CD4+ T cells in response to M proteins. The incidence of S pyogenes in tonsils was significantly higher in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT) than in patients with tonsillar hypertrophy (TH). M protein-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G spot-forming cells were increased in patients with RT compared with patients with TH. In RT the number of M protein-specific IgA spot-forming cells was significantly greater in the S pyogenes-negative subjects than in the S pyogenes-positive subjects. Proliferation of CD4+ T cells and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukins -2, -4, -5, and -6 (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) from those T cells were observed in response to M protein. The concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-4 were higher in RT than in TH. These findings suggest that S pyogenes is associated with the pathogenesis of RT and that immune responses against M protein may play an important role in preventing the colonization of this bacteria in tonsils.
