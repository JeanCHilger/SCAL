Management of group A streptococcus pharyngitis with a second-generation rapid strep screen: Strep A OIA. Empirical therapy of presumed group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis leads to unnecessary and inappropriate use of antibiotics and pressure for emergence of resistant strains of common bacteria. Immunoassay technology has produced several rapid tests for GAS. The wide variations in diagnosis and treatment of acute pharyngitis are reviewed including the impact of rapid strep tests. Published studies comparing Strep A OIA to routine agar culture and other rapid strep screens are presented to assess the reliability and applicability of this novel assay. These data suggest that Strep A OIA may be superior to the "gold standard" throat culture and other rapid streptococcal antigen detection assays. Judicious use of Strep A OIA can result in rapid, precise diagnoses and eliminate unnecessary and inappropriate use of antibiotics. Careful antibiotic selection can reduce the pressure for emergence of resistant bacteria. This innovative, effective assay can contribute to a lessening of this serious clinical challenge.
