Conversion of M serotype 24 of Streptococcus pyogenes to M serotypes 5 and 18: effect on resistance to phagocytosis and adhesion to host cells. In this study, we utilized recombinant strains expressing the M5 and M18 proteins and M- mutants of group A streptococci to compare the abilities of these M proteins to confer resistance to phagocytosis and to mediate adhesion to host cells. The data indicate that the M5 and M18 proteins can confer resistance to phagocytosis, that fibrinogen is required for this resistance, and that these M proteins can mediate adhesion to HEp-2 cells.
