M protein mediated adhesion of M type 24 Streptococcus pyogenes stimulates release of interleukin-6 by HEp-2 tissue culture cells. We investigated the contributions of lipoteichoic acid and M protein to reversible and irreversible adhesion of group A streptococci and the effects of such adhesion on release of interleukin-6. Streptococci in which lipoteichoic acid was masked by the hyaluronate capsule were readily washed from HEp-2 cells, indicating no attachment. Unencapsulated, M-negative streptococci in which lipoteichoic acid was exposed were removed more slowly, indicating loose attachment. Only unencapsulated streptococci that expressed both lipoteichoic acid and M protein remained stably adherent to HEp-2 cells throughout multiple washes. Streptococci expressing both M protein and lipoteichoic acid induced release of interleukin-6 from HEp-2 cells, whereas an isogenic, M-negative mutant failed to induce release of interleukin-6. These data suggest that lipoteichoic acid mediates reversible adhesion and that M protein is required for irreversible adhesion and for inducing release of interleukin-6 from HEp-2 cells.
