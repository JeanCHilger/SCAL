Detection of lipoarabinomannan-IgG in serum for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. To ascertain the value of lipoarabinomannan-IgG (LAM-IgG) determination in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.LAM-IgG in sera obtained from 90 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 53 patients with lung cancer and 30 healthy individuals were detected by using rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The positive rate was 82% in tuberculosis group, and the false positive rates were 8% and 3% in cancer group and healthy controls respectively.The results suggested that rapid ELISA and LAM-IgG detection was a useful supplementary tool for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.
