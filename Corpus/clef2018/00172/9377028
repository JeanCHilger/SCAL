Immunoenzyme test system for detecting antibodies to group-specific antigens of group A Streptococcus on the base of conjugated N-acetylglucosamine and its use in medical practice. Enzyme immunoassay kit has been created for detecting antibodies to group A Streptococcus, based on N-acetylglucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine was selected as the group-specific determinant due to the structure of group A Streptococcus polysaccharide, in which this monosaccharide residue is lateral to the main polysaccharide chain and hence more available for antibodies. Water-soluble polyacrylamide is the carrier in this kit, for this carrier is stable and not liable to nonspecific reaction with proteins. In addition, the synthesis of polyacrylamide conjugates ensures reproducible results. Use of this kit permits the identification of group A streptococcal etiology of the disease and thus carry out appropriate therapy moreover, it helps predict the outcome of an acute streptococcal infection and detect the poststreptococcal complications in the early period of the disease.
