Glomerular proliferating cell kinetics in acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). To investigate the time sequence of glomerular cell proliferation in acute human glomerulonephritis, renal biopsy tissues were examined from 15 acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) patients (who were biopsied 1-31 days after onset), using an immunoperoxidase technique with monoclonal antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and various cell surface markers. Few, if any, PCNA+ cells were observed in normal glomeruli, but many cells were positive for PCNA in the acute phase of APSGN. Glomerular PCNA+ cells were observed either within glomerular tufts, or lining Bowman's capsule (parietal epithelial cells) the number of positive cells tended to decrease exponentially as the disease duration increased (r = -0.91, P < 0.0001). PCNA+ cells within glomerular tufts were further identified by double immunostaining. PCNA was not found in PMN or T cells, but a small proportion of macrophages were PCNA+. Most of the remaining PCNA+ cells were resident glomerular cells
