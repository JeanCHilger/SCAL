Does culture confirmation of high-sensitivity rapid streptococcal tests make sense? A medical decision analysis. Since the 1990 publication of a decision analysis, in which the treatment of pharyngitis in children was evaluated, a number of assumptions important in that analysis have changed. Updating many of the assumptions and costs used in that analysis to reflect the conditions currently found in a large, suburban pediatric practice, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed in which four strategies for the treatment of pharyngitis were considered: treat all, high-sensitivity antigen test, culture, and high-sensitivity antigen test with culture confirmation.Decision analysis.Using microbiology data from the 13 published studies in which a high-sensitivity antigen test (Strep A OIA BioStar Inc., Boulder, CO) and blood agar plate culture were evaluated against a variety of gold standards, the sensitivity and specificity of the high-sensitivity antigen test were 89.1% and 95%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of blood agar plate throat culture were 83.4% and 99%, respectively. Penicillin V was used as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated pharyngitisAlthough most cost-effective, the treat-all strategy is not recommended because of concerns about antibiotic resistance, which could not be included in the model, and the high number of allergic reactions found in children who did not have streptococcal infection. Use of the high-sensitivity antigen test without culture confirmation of all negative results was the most cost-effective strategy in which a diagnostic test was used with respect to prevention of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications of streptococcal pharyngitis. Culture confirmation of negative high-sensitivity antigen tests was not cost-effective under any of those conditions currently seen in the United States.
