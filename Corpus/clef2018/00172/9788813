Streptococcal emm types associated with T-agglutination types and the use of conserved emm gene restriction fragment patterns for subtyping group A streptococci. The T-agglutination types were determined for a diverse collection of 1531 group A streptococci for which the 5' M protein gene (emm) sequences had been analysed. The majority of the T-agglutination types correlated with previously seen M/emm/T-type associations however, several new associations were found. Analysis of a subset of this collection -- which included 1157 clinical isolates with multiply encountered emm types -- found that emm amplicon restriction profiles of isolates sharing identical T types and opacity factor phenotypes are useful for detecting groups of isolates with identical emm genes. Many emm genes of known 5' sequence display a highly conserved restriction pattern amongst clinical isolates widely separated both geographically and temporally.
