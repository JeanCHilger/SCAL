Birth of twin males with normal karyotype after intracytoplasmic sperm injection with use of testicular spermatozoa from a nonmosaic patient with Klinefelter's syndrome. To report the birth of healthy twin males after the use of testicular spermatozoa from a nonmosaic patient with Klinefelter's syndrome.Case report.Private reproduction center with university affiliation.A couple undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) combined with testicular sperm extraction because of the husband's secretory azoospermia and a nonmosaic 47,XXY peripheral blood karyotype. The wife, a healthy female, presented with a history of oligomenorrhea.ICSI was performed using testicular spermatozoa 3 mM pentoxifylline solution was used to induce sperm motility because the spermatozoa recovered were all immotile.Normal fertilization, embryo cleavage, pregnancy outcome, and peripheral blood karyotype of the newborns.Thirteen metaphase II oocytes were injected. Seven of them fertilized normally and six did not fertilize. Three good-quality embryos (4-cell stage class II) were transferred, and four were cryopreserved at the two-cell and four-cell stages using a slow freezing protocol. Twelve days after ET, a beta-hCG determination was positive. Ultrasonographic examination revealed three intrauterine fetal sacs, but one of them showed a fetal pole without cardiac activity and vanished in subsequent ultrasonographic examinations. The patient delivered twins with normal male peripheral blood karyotypes.Normal outcome after the use of testicular sperm extraction and ICSI in a nonmosaic patient with Klinefelter's syndrome reaffirms the notion of low transmission risk of this gonosomal aneuploidy.
