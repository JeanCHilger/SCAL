Antigenic definition of plasma membrane proteins of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin: predominant activation of human T cells by low-molecular-mass integral proteins. Mycobacterial plasma membrane proteins, in particular the detergent-soluble or 'integral' ones, comprise a class of mostly unexplored antigens capable of inducing potent activation of human T cells. Plasma membrane isolated from culture-grown Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG Indian vaccine
