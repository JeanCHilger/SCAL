Pathologic correlation of sonographic echogenic foci in the fetal heart. The goal of the current paper is to present, on the basis of six investigated fetal hearts, the pathological substrate of prenatally, sonographically diagnosed echogenic intramyocardial foci. The right ventricle, left ventricle, interventricular septum and papillary muscles of both ventricles of six hearts of the fetuses of high-risk pregnant women showing sonographically diagnosed intramyocardial echogenic foci were investigated. At termination of pregnancy all the women were between the 20th and the 24th week of gestation. Of the six cases, four were induced abortions and two were spontaneous abortions. For the control group we investigated the hearts of two fetuses without heart defects at the 22nd and 23rd week of gestation which had proven extracardial anomalies and a normal karyotype. Both cases were induced abortions which prenatally showed no echogenic cardiac foci. In all eight cases a prenatal karyotyping was performed. In the six cases with echogenic foci the location and number of the foci were determined both prenatally and by means of histologic sections the size of the foci was measured as well. Histological staining was with routine haematoxylin-eosin
