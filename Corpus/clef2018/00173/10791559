5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene variants and congenital anomalies: a HuGE review. The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is involved in folate metabolism. The MTHFR gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p36.3), and two common alleles, the C677T (thermolabile) allele and the A1298C allele, have been described. The population frequency of C677T homozygosity ranges from 1% or less among Blacks from Africa and the United States to 20% or more among Italians and US Hispanics. C677T homozygosity in infants is associated with a moderately increased risk for spina bifida (pooled odds ratio = 1.8 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 2.2). Maternal C677T homozygosity also appears to be a moderate risk factor (pooled odds ratio = 2.0
