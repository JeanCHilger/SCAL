Intrauterine MRI with single-shot fast-spin echo imaging showed different signal intensities in hypoplastic lungs. Ultrasonography is used for the prenatal diagnosis of hypoplastic lungs. However, ultrasound poses problems because of difficulties in getting the entire lung in perspective and the results depend on the skill of the examiner. When the alveolar formation of the fetal lung is retarded, the fetus is predicted to show an altered density on MRI using an SSFSE sequence due to a varied amount of alveolar lung fluid. We present a case of twins who showed a marked difference in signal intensity of the lung on MRI, which was useful for predicting the fetal pathophysiology. Intrauterine MRI provides the possibility of diagnosing hypoplastic lungs prenatally.
