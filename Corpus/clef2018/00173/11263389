Clinical significance of serum anti-mycobacterium tuberculosis antibody in diagnosis of tuberculosis. To evaluate the significance of measuring serum antilipoarabinomannan IgG (LAM-IgG), an anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibody, in diagnosis of tuberculosis.Sensitivity and specificity of the antibody in diagnosis of tuberculosis were detected. Results of the antibody detection, sputum smear and PPD examination were compared, and the relationship between the level of the antibody and the situation of the disease was also observed.The sensitivity of the antibody in diagnosis of tuberculosis was found to be 71.9%, while the specificity 91.9%. The consistent rates of the antibody with sputum smear and PPD test were 80.2% and 61.6% respectively. The level of the antibody was related with the situation of the disease.Detection of the antibody is helpful for diagnosing tuberculosis and can be used to evaluate the prognosis of the disease.
