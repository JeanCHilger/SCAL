Is routine amniocentesis for advanced maternal age still indicated? To evaluate a policy of selective rather than routine use of amniocentesis for advanced maternal age.A consecutive series of 359 pregnant women aged 38-47 underwent nuchal translucency measurement (NTM) at 10-14 weeks, maternal serum screening (MSS) by alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at 15-17 weeks, and second trimester ultrasound at 21-23 weeks. Women with NTM <3 mm, MSS-derived risk <1/250, and a normal second trimester sonography were considered at low risk and were suggested not to have an amniocentesis.Either the NTM or MSS test was positive in 130 women 105 (81%) of them elected to have an amniocentesis, versus 122 (53%) of 229 in whom both tests were negative (p < 0.001). Nineteen (5%) of 359 patients had NTM > or =3 mmAmniocentesis may be offered on a selective rather than routine basis in women over 38, based upon the results of noninvasive screening tests.
