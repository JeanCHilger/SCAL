ICAM-1 in maternal serum and amniotic fluid as an early marker of preeclampsia and IUGR. To determine if plasma and amniotic fluid levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at 16 weeks' gestation could be predictive of preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).A retrospective analysis was undertaken in 44 serum samples stored for Down's syndrome screening at 16 weeks' gestation and 44 amniotic fluid samples obtained by midtrimester amniocentesis.No significant difference was found between women who subsequently developed preeclampsia or IUGR and the control group.This study failed to demonstrate that ICAM-1 may be an early serum marker of preeclampsia or an amniotic fluid marker of IUGR.
