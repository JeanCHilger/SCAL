Lipoarabinomannan-reactive human secretory immunoglobulin A responses induced by mucosal bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination. The ability of 17 recombinant mycobacterial proteins, native antigen 85 complex, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis lysate to detect antibody responses induced by bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and active tuberculosis infection were studied in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Only LAM-reactive serum immunoglobulin G responses were significantly increased in both BCG-vaccinated patients and patients with active tuberculosis (P<.05), and oral BCG vaccination also induced significant increases in LAM-reactive secretory immunoglobulin A (P<.05). LAM-reactive antibody assays can serve as markers of humoral and mucosal immunity in future trials of BCG and newer attenuated mycobacterial vaccines.
