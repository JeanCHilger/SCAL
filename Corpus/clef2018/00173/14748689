Multiple aneuploidies in the oocytes of balanced translocation carriers: a preimplantation genetic diagnosis study using first polar body. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of first polar bodies (1PBs) has been used in carriers of balanced chromosomal reorganizations and also for aneuploidy screening. Although an acceptable number of normal or balanced embryos is usually obtained using PGD in translocation carriers, the pregnancy rate is disappointingly low. To determine whether aneuploidy of chromosomes not involved in the chromosome rearrangements could be the cause of the low pregnancy rates achieved, the present authors analysed the segregation products of three translocation carriers, t(813)(q24.1
