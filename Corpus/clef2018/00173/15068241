Overexpression of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase in fetal Down syndrome brain. Trisomy 21, Down Syndrome, is the most common genetic cause of human mental retardation and results from non-disjunction of chromosome 21. Several reports have been linking folate metabolism to DS and indeed, chromosome 21 even encodes for a specific folate carrier. The availability of brain tissue along with the advent of proteomics enabled us to identify and quantify C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (THF-S), a key element in folate metabolism in brain along with other enzymes involved in C1-metabolism. Brains of controls and DS subjects at the 18th-19th week of gestation were homogenised and separated on 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent in-gel digestion and mass spectrometrical identification and quantification with specific software. THF-S was represented by three spots, possibly representing isoforms or posttranslational modifications. Two spots were significantly, about twofold, increased in fetal DS brain: Controls [means +/- SD: (spot 1) 2.55 +/- 0.69 (spot 3) 1.39 +/- 0.86] vs. Down syndrome [means +/- SD: (spot 1) 4.25 +/- 1.63
