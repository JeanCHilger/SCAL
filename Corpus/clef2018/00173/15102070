Evidence for a rhesus monkey model of asymptomatic tuberculosis. Rhesus monkeys (RM) were inoculated intrabronchially with graded doses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains Erdman and H37Rv in an effort to produce a model of asymptomatic tuberculosis infection. Erdman strain produced active disease within 7-11 weeks regardless of dose. Low doses of H37Rv resulted in asymptomatic infections high doses produced active disease within 11 weeks. Over a 4-month period of post-inoculation study, MTB culture-filtrate protein (CFP)-stimulated bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALC) and blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from monkeys with active disease (30 cfu Erdman-inoculated) or asymptomatic infection (200 cfu H37Rv-inoculated) produced similar significant quantities of mRNA encoding for IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, but insignificant quantities of IL-4 mRNA. Differences were observed in antigen-induced in vitro blastogenic responses and serum anti-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antibody responses in animals with active compared with asymptomatic MTB infections. The results indicate that RM are a good model for the study of asymptomatic tuberculosis infections using low doses of H37Rv.
