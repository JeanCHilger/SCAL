First-trimester screening for trisomy 21 combining biochemistry and ultrasound at individually optimal gestational ages. An interventional study. To assess the effectiveness of the Combined Test in the prenatal detection of trisomy 21 in the general pregnant population using a new timing for the screening approach.First-trimester maternal serum biochemical markers (pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and free-beta hCG) were determined in maternal serum at 7 to 12 weeks. Fetal nuchal translucency and gestational age were assessed at the 10- to 14-week ultrasound scan. A combined risk was estimated and delivered to the women the same day. When the risk was 1:250 or above, chorionic villus sampling was offered.Mean gestational age at biochemistry was 9.4 weeks, being 12.3 at ultrasound. In the 2780 studied pregnancies with a complete follow-up, observed detection rates were 88% (7/8) for trisomy 21 and 75% (3/4) for trisomy 18, with a 3.3% (92/2765) false-positive rate.The Combined Test, assessing biochemistry and ultrasound at individually optimal ages in the first trimester, showed an 88% detection rate for trisomy 21 with a remarkably reduced false-positive rate (3.3%).
