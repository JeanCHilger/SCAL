Antimycobacterial antibody level in pleural, pericardial and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with tuberculosis. The goal of the study was to evaluate IgG, IgA and IgM mediated humoral immune response against 38kDa and 16 kDa or 38kDa and LAM mycobacterial antigens in pleural, pericardial or cerebrospinal fluid from patients with tuberculosis (TB) and to compare to non-tuberculous controls (NTB). 30 cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) (16 TB pts and 14 NTB pts), 17 pericardial fluids (6 TB and 11 NTB) and 20 pleural fluids (7 TB and 13 NTB) were examined. Commercially available ELISA-based assays (Pathozyme Tb complex plus, Myco G, A and M--Omega Diagnostic) were used. Tests were performed and cut off established according to manufacturer instruction. Mean IgG level against 38 + 16kDa was significantly higher in neurotuberculosis group compared to control (p<0.05). Sensitivity of the test in detecting neurotuberculosis was of 42% and specificity of 96%. Mean IgG, IgA and IgM against 38kDa + LAM level was higher in TB group compared to NTB in CSF. No difference was observed between TB and NTB group in pleural effusion. Antimycobacterial antibody levels were non-significantly increased in pericardial fluid in TB. The findings of the study indicate that TB is associated with the presence of detectable levels of antibodies in the CSF and pericardial effusion. Anti 38kDa + 16kDa IgG test can be used in combination with other diagnostic methods to increase diagnostic accuracy of neurotuberculosis.
