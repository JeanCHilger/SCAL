Second-trimester biparietal diameter/nasal bone length ratio is an independent predictor of trisomy 21. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the second-trimester fetal biparietal diameter/nasal bone length (BPD/NBL) ratio and trisomy 21.Thirty-one cases of trisomy 21 for which complete ultrasound images included the nasal bone were identified from the University of Washington prenatal diagnosis database and matched to 136 euploid fetuses based on maternal age, indication for referral, and gestational age.The mean NBL was shorter (mean +/- SD, 2.3+/-1.7 mm versus 3.9+/-1.2 mm P<.001) and the BPD/NBL ratio was greater (17.7 [range, 6.2-114] versus 11.7 [range, 5.8-80]The second-trimester BPD/NBL ratio was a significant and independent predictor of trisomy 21. An assessment of the BPD/NBL ratio may improve the diagnosis of trisomy 21 when used with current prenatal screening practices.
