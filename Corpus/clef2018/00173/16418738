Confirmation of mosaicism and uniparental disomy in amniocytes, after detection of mosaic chromosome abnormalities in chorionic villi. Chromosome mosaicism is detected in about 1-2% of chorionic villi samples (CVS), and may be due to a postzygotic nondisjunction event generating a trisomic cell line in an initially normal conceptus (mitotic origin) or the postzygotic loss of one chromosome in an initially trisomic conceptus (meiotic origin and trisomy rescue). Depending on the distribution of the abnormal cell line, the mosaic can be confined to the placenta (CPM) or generalised to the fetus (TFM, true fetal mosaicism). Trisomy rescue could theoretically be associated with a 33.3% probability of uniparental disomy (UPD) in the fetus. The aim of this study was to determine the risk of fetal involvement in a cohort of numerical and structural chromosome mosaics revealed in chorionic villi by means of combined direct and long-term culture analyses we also determined the incidence of UPD associated with mosaic aneuploidies and supernumerary markers involving imprinted chromosomes. A total of 273 of a consecutive series of 15,109 CVS evaluated during a period of 5 years showed a mosaic condition in direct preparations and/or long-term cultures
