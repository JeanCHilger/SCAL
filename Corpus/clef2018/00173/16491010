Correlation of abnormal rapid FISH and chromosome results from amniocytes for prenatal diagnosis. Rapid fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on 1,788 amniocenteses, using Aneuvision (Vysis) probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y, over several years, yielded 115 cases with percentages of aneuploidy between 4 and 100%. All cases above 60% were confirmed to be positive by chromosome analysis. Fifteen of forty-one cases that would be considered inconclusive by generally accepted criteria (i.e. with less than 60% of cells with an abnormal signal pattern) revealed lower cutoffs to be positive when confirmed by chromosome analysis. For trisomy 21, 6 cases with percentages from 36 to 57% were positive 4 of 7 cases with percentages from 22.5 to 33% were positive
