Adiponectin and insulin resistance in early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia. To evaluate the importance of adiponectin and insulin resistance in early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia.A nested case-control study in 72 pregnant women who participated in the first-trimester Down-syndrome-screening programme and who delivered at our hospital.University Hospital, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.Pregnant women: 36 women with pre-eclampsia of which 20 late onset and 16 early onset were compared with 36 uncomplicated pregnancies who delivered at term.In all the women, insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment ratio (HOMA-IR) and plasma adiponectin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Insulin resistance and adiponectin concentration.First-trimester plasma adiponectin mean levels in the whole pre-eclampsia group were significantly lower than that in the control group (8.4 +/- 3.3 versus 14.8 +/- 4.6 microgram/ml P < 0.001), whereas first-trimester mean HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the pre-eclampsia group than that in the control group (2.0 +/- 1.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.4First-trimester adiponectin and HOMA-IR values seem to select two completely different populations: early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia, which might suggest a different pathogenesis.
