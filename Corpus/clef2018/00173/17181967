Pregnancy outcomes of 194 couples with balanced translocations. To investigate the pregnancy outcomes of couples with either maternal or paternal balanced translocations.One hundred and ninety-four couples were divided into three groups based on the kind of translocations: 135 with reciprocal translocation, 52 with nonhomologous Robertsonian translocations, and 7 with homologous Robertsonian translocations. Past reproductive histories were surveyed. For those who wanted to have their own babies by natural conceptions after knowing their karyotypes as well as the risks of abnormal offsprings, subsequent pregnancy outcomes were recorded. Total pregnancy outcomes were compared between three groups.(1) 503 previous and subsequent pregnancies were recorded in detail. The pregnancy outcomes are as follows: spontaneous abortions 81.7% (411/503) induced terminations because of fetal abnormalities 3.2% (16/503)Balanced translocation carriers suffer from poor pregnancy prognosis. Couples with homologous Robertsonian translocations have little chance to give birth to normal/balanced offsprings.
