Humoral immune response against mycobacterial antigens in patients with tuberculosis and mycobacterial infections other than tuberculosis. The aim of the study was to compare humoral immune response against various mycobacterial antigens in TB and MOTT vs healthy control group. 350 serum samples from TB patients, 20 samples from MOTT patients and 58 samples from healthy donors were examined. ELISA detecting IgG, IgA and IgM against antigens: 38 kDa and 16 kDa, 38kDa and lipoarabinomannan, and A-60 were used. Mean IgG level was higher in TB compared to healthy controls (p<0,001). Mean IgG level against 38kDa and 38 + 16 kDa mycobacterial antigens was higher in TB than in MOTT group. Mean level of the IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against LAM was higher in MOTT compared to TB patients. In all subgroups person-to-person heterogeneity of antigen recognition was observed. Humoral immune response to recombinant mycobacterial antigens significantly differs in TB and MOTT patients.
