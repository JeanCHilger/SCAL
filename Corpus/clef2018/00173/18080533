Study of DC-SIGN gene polymorphism in patients infected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis strains of different genotypes in the Irkutsk Region. Polymorphism of the promoter of DC-SIGN gene in Caucasians was studied at positions -336A/G and -871/G in 134 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 112 healthy individuals, who lived in the Irkutsk Region, Eastern Siberia. In 90 patients from the patient cohort M. tuberculosis DNA was isolated and investigated using the MIRU-VNTR typing test by 12 loci. Comparison of DC-SIGN gene polymorphism in patients with tuberculosis and healthy controls revealed no significant differences in loci -336A/ G and -871A/G. Analysis of MIRU-VNTR patterns identified 50 unique profiles, among which there were genotypes of the families Beijing, T. LAM, Haarlem, "Ural" (Haarlem 4) and X. Among 90 MIRU-VNTR genotypes, 42 profiles belonged to the Beijing family. Moreover, the minimum spanning tree (MST) test revealed a number of Beijing-like strains. The genotypes of the subjects affected with Beijing and Beijing-like strains and those affected with the strains of other families (non-Beijing) were compared. A significance reduction was found in the incidence of the -336G genotype among the subjects affected with Beijing strains versus those infected with non-Beijing strains at a frequency of 0.09 and 0.24, respectively (chi2 = 7.64 p = 0.006
