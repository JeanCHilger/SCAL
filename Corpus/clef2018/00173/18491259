Atrioventricular septal defect in the fetus--associated conditions and outcome in 246 cases. To evaluate the associated conditions and the outcome of atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) detected in fetal life.Retrospective review of all cases of AVSD detected prenatally between 1998 and 2006 in two tertiary referral centers in Germany.246 cases of AVSD were detected in the study period: 129 (52.4 %) chromosomal anomalies 72 (29.3 %) heterotaxy syndromesAmong fetuses with AVSD, those with trisomy 21 are detected earlier in pregnancy, have less distorted cardiac anatomy, higher rates of biventricular repair and better survival rates. Due to the limited sample size in euploid fetuses, it remains unclear whether this apparent protection afforded to Down syndrome accounts also for cohorts with isolated and balanced AVSD.
