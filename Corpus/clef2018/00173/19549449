Prognostic factors for preimplantation genetic screening in repeated pregnancy loss. The objective of this study was to identify specific subgroups of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients of unknown aetiology in whom the selection of chromosomally normal embryos for transfer improves reproductive outcome in preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). A total of 428 PGS cycles were included and chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y were evaluated. In RPL patients < or =37 years, a lower incidence of chromosomal abnormalities (P = 0.0004) and miscarriages (P = 0.0283) was observed, and there were significantly higher pregnancy (P < 0.0384) and implantation (P < 0.0434) rates than in patients >37 years. In the former subset, results showed: (i) significantly higher implantation rates (P = 0.0411) in couples that had experienced a previous aneuploid miscarriage (ii) similar aneuploidy, pregnancy and implantation rates in couples suffering previous miscarriages during fertility treatments and in those with previous spontaneous pregnancies
