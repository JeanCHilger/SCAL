Maternal and perinatal risk factors for childhood leukemia. This report describes an exploratory population-based study of maternal and perinatal risk factors for childhood leukemia in Sweden. The Swedish National Cancer Registry ascertained 411 cases in successive birth cohorts from 1973 through 1984 recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. Using the latter, we matched five controls without cancer to each case by sex and month and year of birth.

Children with leukemia were more likely than controls to have Down's syndrome (OR = 32.5
