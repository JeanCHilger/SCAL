Binder phenotype: associated findings and etiologic mechanisms. Binder phenotype (BP), or maxillonasal dysostosis, consists of 6 characteristics: arhinoid face, abnormal position of nasal bones, intermaxillary hypoplasia/malocclusion, reduced/absent anterior nasal spine, atrophy of nasal mucosa, and absence of frontal sinus. The purposes of this study were (1) to review the characteristic facial findings, other malformations, and diagnoses in 8 patients with BP (2) to compare these patients to those in the literature
