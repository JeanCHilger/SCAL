Prenatal detection of chromosome aneuploidy by quantitative-fluorescence PCR. QF-PCR refers to the amplification of chromosome-specific polymorphic microsatellite markers using fluorescence-labelled primers, followed by semi-quantitative analysis of the products on a genetic analyser to determine copy number and/or imbalances of specific chromosomal material. This approach is now widely used for rapid prenatal diagnosis of the common trisomies. In addition, it can successfully detect maternal cell contamination and mosaicism in prenatal material.
