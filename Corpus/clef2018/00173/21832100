Systematic review and meta-analysis of antigen detection tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Tests that detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in clinical specimens could provide rapid direct evidence of active disease. We performed a systematic review to assess the diagnostic accuracy of antigen detection tests for active tuberculosis (TB) according to standard methods and summarized test performance using bivariate random effects meta-analysis. Overall, study quality was a concern. For pulmonary TB (47 studies, 5,036 participants), sensitivity estimates ranged from 2% to 100% and specificity from 33% to 100%. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was the antigen most frequently targeted (23 studies, 49%). The pooled sensitivity of urine LAM was higher in HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected individuals (47% 95% confidence interval [CI], 26 to 68% versus 14%
