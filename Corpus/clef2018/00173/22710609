Diagnostic accuracy of induced sputum LAM ELISA for tuberculosis diagnosis in sputum-scarce patients. To examine whether a lipoarabinomannan (LAM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that offers diagnostic utility using urine in patients with tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection can be used in induced sputum to diagnose sputum-scarce  patients with suspected TB.LAM was measured in induced sputum samples obtained from 61 consecutively recruited sputum-scarce TB suspects in a tertiary hospital respiratory clinic in South Africa. Liquid culture positivity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used as the reference  standard. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess alternative LAM concentration cut-offs.A total of 87% (53/61) of study patients had a valid M. tuberculosis culture result 49% (23/53) were HIV-infected and 17% (9/53) were culture-positive for M.  tuberculosis. Induced sputum smear microscopy and LAM ELISA had an overall sensitivity of 56% (95%CI 27-81)In this proof-of-concept study, the ELISA was not clinically useful for TB diagnosis using induced sputum.
