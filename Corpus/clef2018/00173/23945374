Associations between human leukocyte antigen class I variants and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis subtypes causing disease. 窶サhe development of active tuberculosis disease has been shown to be multifactorial. Interactions between host and bacterial genotype may influence disease outcome, with some studies indicating the adaptation of M. tuberculosis strains to specific human populations. Here we investigate the role of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes in this biological process.窶サhree hundred patients with tuberculosis from South Africa were typed for their HLA class I alleles by direct sequencing. Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotype classification was done by IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping and spoligotyping.窶ジe showed that Beijing strain occurred more frequently in individuals with multiple disease episodes (P < .001) with the HLA-B27 allele lowering the odds of having an additional episode (odds ratio, 0.21 P = .006). Associations were also identified for specific HLA types and disease caused by the Beijing, LAM, LCC, and Quebec strains. HLA types were also associated with disease caused by strains from the Euro-American or East Asian lineages, and the frequencies of these alleles in their sympatric human populations identified potential coevolutionary events between host and pathogen.窶サhis is the first report of the association of human HLA types and M. tuberculosis strain genotype, highlighting that both host and pathogen genetics need to be taken into consideration when studying tuberculosis disease development.
