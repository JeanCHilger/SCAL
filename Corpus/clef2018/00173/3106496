Mycobacterium leprae antigen-induced suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro. The extent to which M. leprae and its products induced suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro was evaluated. M. leprae antigens suppressed T cell proliferation in response to mitogens and antigens in both lepromatous and tuberculoid patients, as well as controls never exposed to M. leprae or M. leprae endemic areas. Both soluble and particulate fractions of M. leprae were found to suppress proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of suppression was inversely related to the proliferative response of the donors mononuclear cells to M. leprae. Evidence indicates that M. leprae contains both stimulatory and suppressive molecules for T cells. One such suppressive antigen, Lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-B of M. leprae, also suppressed the proliferative response of tuberculoid patients. Suppression was also observed with the LAM-B of M. tuberculosis. The suppressive effects observed were not due to the toxicity of the antigen. Some of the suppressive activity was mediated by T8+ suppressor cells and was expressed in both lepromatous and tuberculoid patients. We suggest that previous sensitization to M. leprae and other cross-reactive mycobacterial antigens determines the sensitivity of T cells to the suppressive effects of M. leprae antigens.
