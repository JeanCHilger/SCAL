Serum screening for fetal Down syndrome in pregnant women with an indication for prenatal diagnosis because of age: fewer amniocenteses. To examine the influence of maternal serum screening for foetal Down's syndrome (DS) on the number of amniocenteses in women with an indication for prenatal diagnosis because of age > or = 36 years.Longitudinal descriptive study.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Groningen.Between October 1, 1990 and March 31, 1994, sera from 693 women, 36 years or older with a singleton pregnancy, were tested (alpha-foetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotrophin) to calculate the likelihood of their having a foetus with DS.195 pregnant women (28%) were screen-positive (risk of having a foetus with DS > or = 1:250) 105 of these (54%) chose to have an amniocentesis. Of the remaining 498 (screen-negative) women, 22 (4%) chose to have an amniocentesis. All 7 cases of DS were in the screen-positive group.Maternal serum screening in women aged > or = 36 years can markedly reduce the number of invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures, with a minimal reduction in the detection of DS foetuses. It is advisable to offer this form of screening to all women in this age group.
