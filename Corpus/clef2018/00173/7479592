Second-trimester levels of maternal urinary gonadotropin peptide in Down syndrome pregnancy. Urinary gonadotropin peptide (UGP beta-core fragment), a major metabolite of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), was shown recently to be markedly elevated in Down syndrome pregnancy between 19 and 22 weeks of gestation. To confirm and extend this finding, we obtained maternal urine and matching maternal serum samples from 14 cases of Down syndrome and six other aneuploidies between 17 and 21 weeks of gestation. UGP was measured in all these samples and in 91 singleton control urines. Results were corrected for urinary creatinine level and expressed as multiples of the control median (MOM). hCG levels were assayed in all serum samples from the cases and compared with previously established reference values. The median UGP level in Down syndrome cases was 5.34 MOM (range 2.71-12.57)
