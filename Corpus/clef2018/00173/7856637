Phenotype/karyotype correlations of Y chromosome aneuploidy with emphasis on structural aberrations in postnatally diagnosed cases. Over 600 cases with a Y aneuploidy (other than non-mosaic 47,XYY) were reviewed for phenotype/karyotype correlations. Except for 93 prenatally diagnosed cases of mosaicism 45,X/46,XY (79 cases), 45,X/47,XYY (8 cases), and 45,X/46,XY/47,XYY (6 cases), all other cases were ascertained postnatally. Special emphasis was placed on structural abnormalities. This review includes 11 cases of 46,XYp- 90 cases of 46,XYq- (52 cases non-mosaic
