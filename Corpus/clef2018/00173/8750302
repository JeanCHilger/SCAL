Detection of low-grade mosaicism in fetal cells isolated from maternal blood. Recovering and analysing fetal erythrocytes from maternal blood is being pursued for non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis. We report the observation of 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism in fetal cells from a woman whose first-trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) initially showed only 46,XY. Only after exhaustive (500 cells) analysis were four XXY cells found in cultured villi.
