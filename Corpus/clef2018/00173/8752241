Hyperechogenic fetal bowel and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein: a poor fetal prognosis. To evaluate the clinical significance of increased fetal bowel echogenicity in women with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) during the second trimester.The study group comprised six pregnant women with elevated second-trimester MSAFP (greater than 2.5 multiples of the median), whose ultrasonographic evaluations indicated hyperechogenic fetal bowel. They were compared with six pregnant women whose fetuses, during routine second-trimester ultrasonographic screening for fetal anomalies, were found to have a hyperechogenic bowel without elevated MSAFP, according to natural history, pregnancy outcome, and associated features.All six fetuses with the combination of elevated MSAFP and echogenic bowel were growth-restricted four died in utero and one of the two live-born infants died during the neonatal period. The single survivor in this group was born prematurelyFetal bowel hyperechogenicity found in women with elevated second-trimester MSAFP levels is associated with poor fetal outcome, particularly fetal growth restriction with fetal and neonatal death, and should be considered an ominous prenatal finding.
