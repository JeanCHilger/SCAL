Identification of antibody responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in the CSF of tuberculous meningitis patients by Western blotting. One of the adjunctive modes of diagnosing tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is to detect immune responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen. Up to 70% of clinical TBM reveal the presence of antimycobacterial antibody by the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Defining the specificity of this immune response by Western blotting on separated M. tuberculosis antigen has been attempted in this study. Only antimycobacterial antibody-positive TBM cases were included in the study. An analysis of 30 such TBM cases showed a major immune reactivity to the 30- to 40-kDa region (93%) while a lower degree of immune reactivity was seen to the 14-kDa region (87%) and to the 18- to 25-kDa region (60%). Grossly the antibody reactivity on Western blot correlated with the ELISA results. Assessment of antimycobacterial antibody in the neurologic control CSF samples of pyogenic meningitis [n = 10], cryptococcal meningitis [6], neurocysticercosis [28], neurosyphilis [8], viral meningoencephalitis [8], carcinomatous meningitis [8], iatrogenic meningitis [6], and nonneurological control CSF samples from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia [20] revealed the presence of antibody in the CSF of 2 of the 10 pyogenic meningitis and 5 of the 28 neurocysticercosis cases. A Western blot analysis of these 7 cases revealed immune reactivity to 30- to 40-kDa regions only in 2 cases (1 of pyogenic and 1 of neurocysticercosis). The remaining 5 CSF samples did not reveal any immune reactivity on Western blotting, although ELISA demonstrated antimycobacterial antibodies. The antibody response to M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan and 38-kDa antigen by ELISA revealed 70.58 and 41.17% positivity, respectively. Thus this study has demonstrated that, by Western blotting, the major immune response is to the 30- to 40-kDa region, namely, lipoarabinomannan. Further, this finding will be useful for specific immunodiagnosis of the TBM.
