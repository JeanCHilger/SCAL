Trisomy X: ACLF (Association des Cytogénéticiens de Langue Française) retrospective study. A retrospective study of patients with trisomy X was carried out by the Association des Cytogénéticiens de Langue Française (ACLF). One hundred and ninety observations were collected from 18 cytogenetic laboratories. Variability in presentation is the most striking feature. Results must be treated with some caution, since they concern only individuals referred for karyotyping.
