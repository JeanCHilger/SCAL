Epidemiologic study of Down syndrome in a racially diverse California population, 1989-1991. The prevalence of Down syndrome was studied among all live births occurring between 1989 and 1991 in the California counties monitored by the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program. Objectives of this study were: 1) to calculate adjusted prevalence rates and quinquennial maternal age-specific risk rates of Down syndrome after adjusting for elective abortion of prenatally diagnosed fetuses 2) to estimate the impact of prenatal diagnosis and subsequent elective abortion of affected fetuses on the observed prevalence of Down syndrome
