Competitive and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Mycobacterium bovis infections based on MPB70 and lipoarabinomannan antigens. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA) using M. bovis BCG Tokyo culture filtrate as antigen and anti-MPB70 4C3/17 monoclonal antibody was developed for use in multiple animal species. An analysis of the C-ELISA data for cattle and bison serum panels revealed specificities of 68% to 85% and sensitivities of 85% to 89%. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) of this data revealed areas of 81% to 92% for C-ELISA and demonstrated that C-ELISA as well as the indirect ELISA protocols, MPB70-ELISA and LAM-ELISA, discriminate M. bovis infected animals from non-infected animals for these particular panels. The kappa statistic values for agreement beyond chance between C-ELISA and MPB70-ELISA were determined after ELISA cutoffs were adjusted to minimize false positives. There were poor to excellent agreements between C-ELISA and MPB70-ELISA in all species tested (Bovidae, Cervidae, and Camelidae) that were consistently higher than the kappa statistic between C-ELISA and LAM-ELISA. The humoral response to one antigen and little or no response to the other in many animals argued for a parallel interpretation of C-ELISA and LAM-ELISA to increase sensitivity.
