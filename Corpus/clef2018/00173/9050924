Rapid detection of trisomy 21 by homologous gene quantitative PCR (HGQ-PCR). Down's syndrome results from the production of three copies of chromosome 21 within a cell. We have devised a method termed the homologous gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HGQ-PCR), which uses one pair of primers and which can directly identify the additional copy of chromosome 21 by simultaneously amplifying two highly homologous genes of the human liver-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 21 (PFKL-CH21) and the human muscle-type phosphofructokinase located on chromosome 1 (PFKM-CH1) for self-detecting determination. On analysis of 34 cases of Down's syndrome, including two cases of unbalanced translocation 46, XY, der (14 21) (q10
