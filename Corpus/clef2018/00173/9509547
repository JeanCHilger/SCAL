Rapid detection of aneuploidies by microsatellite and the quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction. Several studies have been performed to assess the diagnostic value of using small tandem repeat (STR) markers and quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) assays for the rapid detection of aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21, 18, 13 (Mansfield, 1993 Pertl et al., 1994, 1996
