Detection of anti-lipoarabinomannan antibodies for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis. A serological test that contributes in diagnosing tuberculosis would aid patient management.To evaluate MycoDot, a new commercially available serological test, for the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies to lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a glycolipid common to mycobacteria.Serum samples from 102 non-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with no previous history of tuberculosis and with suspected active pulmonary (66) and/or extra-pulmonary (36) tuberculosis were investigated 50 HIV-negative healthy subjects, sputum culture-negative, tuberculin skin test negative and with no history of tuberculosis, were used as controls.In 28 patients with microbiologically ascertained tuberculosis 25/28 serum samples were positive, whereas the test was negative in two patients with renal tuberculosis and in one with pulmonary tuberculosis. The remaining 74 serum samples were negative. The follow-up of these patients excluded a mycobacterial infection. Control subjects were negative. On the basis of our design, the MycoDot test, with its rapidity and degree of sensitivity, is suitable for routine use in laboratory diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
