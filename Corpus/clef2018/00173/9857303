Paternal exposures and cardiovascular malformations. The Baltimore-Washington Infant Study Group. Possible associations between paternal exposures and cardiovascular malformations were evaluated in the Baltimore-Washington Infant Study, a population based case-control investigation of congenital heart disease and environmental factors.
