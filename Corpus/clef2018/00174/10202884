Elevated day 3 serum follicle stimulating hormone and/or estradiol may predict fetal aneuploidy. To determine whether baseline serum FSH and/or E2 concentrations can predict the risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities.Case control study.Reproductive technology program at a university hospital.Patients who underwent dilation and curettage (D + C), and whose products of conception were karyotyped.Patients underwent natural conception or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation followed by intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, gamete intrafallopian transfer, or zygote intrafallopian transfer.Baseline serum FSH and E2 concentrations and fetal karyotype.Genetic evaluation of 78 D + C specimens revealed 34 normal and 44 abnormal fetal karyotypes. A significantly greater proportion of women with abnormal fetal karyotype had elevated baseline serum FSH (> or =15 mIU/mL [RIA] or 10 mIU/mL [Immulite]) and/or E2 > or = 50 pg/mL [Immulite]) compared with women of normal fetal karyotype. Among karyotypically abnormal abortuses, autosomal trisomy was the most common abnormality noted (79.5%), followed by mosaicism (6.8%), triploidy (6.8%), monosomy XO (4.5%), and balanced translocation (2.3%).Baseline serum FSH and/or E2 concentrations may be valuable as predictors of fetal aneuploidy.
