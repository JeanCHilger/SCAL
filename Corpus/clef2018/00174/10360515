Early pregnancy screening for fetal aneuploidy with serum markers and nuchal translucency. We determined the aneuploidy detection rate achievable by early pregnancy screening with pregnancy associated plasma protein (PAPP)-A, free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and ultrasound nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. Women having prenatal diagnosis were scanned, and a blood sample was taken and stored. Stored samples were tested and a total of 37 were found to have Down syndrome, 8 to have Edwards syndrome and 255 were controls. Results were expressed in multiples of the gestation-specific median (MOM) value in the controls after regression and, for the serum markers, maternal weight adjustment. In Down syndrome the medians were for PAPP-A 0.63 MOM (95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.87) free beta-hCG 1.88 MOM (1.33-2.66)
