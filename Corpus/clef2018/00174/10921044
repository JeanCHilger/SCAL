Establishment of two human esophageal carcinoma cell lines and their cytogenetic analysis. To explore the relation between chromosomal aberration and carcinogenesis of the esophagus by molecular cytogenetic analysis of two esophageal carcinoma cell lines.Small tissue blocks taken from resected specimens of patients with esophageal cancer (EC) were cultured in medium 199 added with 1.5% fetal bovine serun, and two esophageal carcinoma cell lines, EC8712 and EC8733, were established in 1987. They grew in monolayers. Molecular cytogenetic studies were performed on the two cell lines using chromosome G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative gene hybridization (CGH) techniques.Both cell lines were aneuploid. Loss of chromosome Y, partial deletion of 1p, translocation of 2q and amplification of 5p, were observed in the 2 cell lines. Amplification of 8q and 13q in EC8733 and deletion of 17p in EC8712 were detected.The presene of the reported chromosomal aberrations may be related to the carcinogenesis and cancer development of the esophagus.
