Second trimester markers of aneuploidy. The risks of aneuploidy associated with identification of a sonographic marker in the low risk population is controversial.

Screening programmes in the first trimester, second trimester and combined first and second trimester will undoubtedly alter the second trimester scan as a screening tool for aneuploidy. This chapter reviews the current sonographic markers and the difficulties in their application to the general population.
