Prenatal diagnosis of partial monosomy 18p(18p11.2-->pter) and trisomy 21q(21q22.3-->qter) with alobar holoprosencephaly and premaxillary agenesis. A prenatal diagnosis of partial monosomy 18p(18p11.2-->pter) and trisomy 21q(21q22.3-->qter) in a fetus with alobar holoprosencephaly (HPE) and premaxillary agenesis (PMA) but without the classical Down syndrome phenotype is reported. A 27-year-old primigravida woman was referred for genetic counselling at 21 weeks' gestation due to sonographic findings of craniofacial abnormalities. Level II ultrasonograms manifested alobar HPE and median orofacial cleft. Cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on cells obtained from amniocentesis revealed partial monosomy 18p and a cryptic duplication of 21q,46,XY,der(18)t(1821)(p11.2
