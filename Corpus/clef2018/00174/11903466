Epidemiologic features of infantile spasms in Slovenia. To determine the epidemiologic features of infantile spasms (ISs) in Slovenia.Medical records of all children with ISs in Slovenia in the period from 1985 to 1995, based on community pediatrician referrals to four hospitals, including all pediatric EEG laboratories, were retrospectively studied. The outcome was assessed by a follow-up study in 1998.Forty-seven children with ISs were identified over an 11-year interval. The cumulative incidence was 2.06 per 10,000 live births. Among 29 (61.7%) children with symptomatic etiology, 14 cases had prenatal etiology [tuberous sclerosis (TS), seven vascular insult, threeThe incidence of ISs in Slovenia is similar to that in some parts of the United States, but lower than that in Finland or Sweden. The outcome depends mainly on etiology. Additional neuroimaging studies are needed for evaluation of cryptogenic cases.
