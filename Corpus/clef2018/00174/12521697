First-trimester pregnancy scanning as a screening tool for high-risk and abnormal pregnancies in a district general hospital setting. This study set out to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of routine early ultrasound (12-14 weeks) within a district general hospital (DGH) for identifying high-risk and abnormal pregnancies. This was a pilot study for screening by ultrasound examination all women who presented to their community midwife before 12 weeks' gestation. The study involved 991 women who presented clinically pregnant before 12 weeks' gestation between May 1998 and May 1999. Women were offered routinely two ultrasound examinations during their pregnancy, the first at 12-14 weeks' gestation and the second at 20-21 weeks' gestation. The main outcome measures were: range and number of abnormal/high-risk pregnancies identified during an ultrasound scan at 12-14 weeks' gestation range and number of abnormalities diagnosed during scans at later gestations
