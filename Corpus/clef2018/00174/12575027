Midtrimester triple-test levels in women with chronic hypertension and altered renal function. To study the association between midtrimester triple-test levels and renal function in pregnant women with chronic hypertension.Forty-three patients with chronic hypertension for whom renal function was evaluated by the creatinine clearance test between 14- and 20-weeks gestation were studied. Midtrimester triple-test values obtained as part of Down screening program were correlated with renal function.hCG correlated inversely with creatinine clearance (r = -0.345 p = 0.002) and directly with alpha-fetoprotein (r = 0.499In pregnant women with chronic hypertension, impaired renal function may alter midtrimester maternal serum hCG levels.
