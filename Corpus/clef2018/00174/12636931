Amniotic fluid levels of S100B protein in normal and trisomy-21 foetuses. The human chromosome 21 has been shown to contain the gene for the beta subunit of the S100B protein. The present case-control study was aimed at investigating whether overproduction of S100B protein is detectable in the amniotic fluid of foetuses with trisomy-21.Measurements of S100B in amniotic fluid samples from 14 pregnant women with trisomy-21 foetuses were compared with those obtained from 182 physiological pregnancies. S100B was measured in the samples using an immunoluminometric assay (LIA-mat Sangtec 100).Our results showed that S100B protein amniotic fluid levels were significantly higher in trisomy-21 foetuses (0.83+/-0.21 microg/l) than in controls (0.51+/-0.22 microg/l) (p<0.05).The present finding supports the notion that the expression of S100B is increased in trisomy-21 foetuses it also constitutes a prerequisite basis for a possible involvement of the protein in pathogenic processes associated with trisomy-21, and/or for its potential employment as a diagnostic tool.
