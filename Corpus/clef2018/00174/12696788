Ethical dimensions of nuchal translucency screening. First-trimester screening for NT, when conducted according to accepted standards of quality, is a reliable diagnostic screen. There is no compelling beneficence-based argument opposed to offering it, and offering it is an important autonomy-enhancing strategy. Screening should be offered only in centers where high quality is available. In our view, the results of ongoing trials will enhance this position.
