Establishment and characterization of a human gestational choriocarcinoma cell line (HOCC). Human gestational choriocarcinoma cell line (HOCC) was established from the mouse graft of choriocarcinoma. The HOCC cells were spindle or polygonal in shape and multi-nucleated giant cells, showing neoplastic and pleomorphic features. The cell proliferated stably, and the population doubling time was about 32 hours. The chromosome numbers showed a wide distribution of aneuploidy, the mode was in hypertriploid range and the marker chromosomes were recognized in the several generations. Heterotransplantation was easy, and subcutaneous transplantation of 1 X 10(7) cells in nude mouse formed a tumor composed of choriocarcinoma. It is most noteworthy characteristic of the cell line that it produced human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in an in vitro culture system and in vivo in nude mice.
