Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening in patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriages. To determine the aneuploidy rate in embryos of women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriages and to evaluate whether preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening could be a feasible approach to improve the possibility of successful pregnancy in these couples.Prospective cohort study.Tertiary university referral center.Women (n = 49) with recurrent idiopathic miscarriages.In vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening.Ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) and aneuploidy rate.The aneuploidy rate was, respectively, 43.85% and 66.95% in the younger and older group. The ongoing PR per cycle was 25.71% in the younger and 2.94% in the older patients.There is no therapeutic evidence to prescribe IVF with or without preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening for this heterogeneous group of patients.
