Linear insertion of the atrioventricular valves without defect. On a first anatomical series of 52 hearts of trisomic 21 fetuses, published in June 2002, we described a new minor cardiac anomaly, belonging to the atrioventricular septal defect, with a linear insertion of the atrioventricular valves without defect. We want to confirm these data, on a larger series of 213 new hearts of trisomic 21 fetuses by adding a complementary section to the standard examination 100% of controls have shown a normal insertion with an offsetting of the atrioventricular valves. On 113 out of these 213 hearts of trisomic 21 fetuses, with a so called "normal" heart at the standard examination showing no defect, the complementary section has shown that only 37.2% of these hearts have a normal insertion, whereas 62.83% show a linear insertion, without offsetting and without any septal defect. This linear insertion has been observed in all the different types of atrioventricular septal defect as a good hallmark for trisomy 21
