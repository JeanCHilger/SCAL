Study on the mechanism of oocyte aneuploidy by spectral karyotyping. To establish the method of detecting oocyte aneuploidy by spectral karyotyping (SKY).The unfertilized oocytes were fixed 1-2 days after oocyte retrieval. Spectral karyotyping was performed according to the protocol.64% of oocytes were normal, 36% of oocytes were aneuploidy, of which 22% were due to nondisjunction and 14% unbalanced predivision.SKY is an effective method for detecting oocyte aneuploidy. Both nondisjunction and unbalanced predivision are involved in oocyte aneuploidy formation.
