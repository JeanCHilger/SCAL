First-trimester risk assessment: twin gestations. To determine the role of first-trimester screening in multiple gestations.A review of the literature revealed numerous studies in this area. However, most of the studies involved first-trimester singleton pregnancies.The few studies that reviewed the experience with multiple gestations demonstrated feasibility of this technique. However, the detection rate for twin gestations was less than that of singleton gestations.Although the data support the value of screening twins with biochemistry and ultrasound in the first trimester, further study is necessary to determine the most sensitive method.
