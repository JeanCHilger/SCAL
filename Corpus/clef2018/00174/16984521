Delivery of a healthy twin after intrauterine demise and expulsion of a first twin. We report on a diamniotic-dichorionic twin pregnancy after in vitro fertilization. The first twin was diagnosed with Down syndrome and spontaneously aborted at 24 weeks of gestation after intrauterine death at week 18. The second healthy twin was delivered by cesarean section 11 weeks later. We discuss management aspects and review the literature.
