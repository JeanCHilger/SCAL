Variable aneuploidy mechanisms in embryos from couples with poor reproductive histories undergoing preimplantation genetic screening. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) is used to determine the chromosome status of human embryos from patients with advanced maternal age (AMA), recurrent miscarriage (RM) or repeated implantation failure (RIF).Embryos from 47 such couples were investigated for chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21 and 22 using fluorescence in situ hybridization with two rounds of hybridization. The investigation included parental lymphocyte work-up, the screening of blastomeres on day 3 and full follow-up on day 5/6 of untransferred embryos.The outcome of 60 PGS cycles is described, in which 523 embryos were biopsied 91% gave results, of which 18% were diploid for all the chromosomes tested and 82% were abnormal. The pregnancy rate per cycle that reached the biopsy stage was 27%, and 30% per embryo transfer. Satisfactory follow-up was obtained from 353 embryosThis complete investigation has identified significant differences between referral groups concerning the origin of aneuploidy in their embryos.
