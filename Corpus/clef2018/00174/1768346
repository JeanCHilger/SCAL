Fetal nuchal cystic hygromata: associated malformations and chromosomal defects. During a 6-year period (1985-1990), blood karyotyping was performed in 44 fetuses with septated, bilateral, dorsal, cervical cystic hygromata. This condition constitutes a different entity from nuchal oedema. There were 33 (75%) chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner's syndrome (n = 31), trisomy 18 (n = 1) and trisomy 21 (n = 1). Congenital heart defects (CHD), mainly coarctation of the aorta, were present in 15 of the fetuses with Turner's and in 1 of the chromosomally normal fetuses. The incidence of CHD was higher in the fetuses with ultrasonographic evidence of moderate/severe hydrops (41% 13 of 32 cases) than in those with mild or no hydrops (25%
