First-trimester pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and subsequent abnormalities of fetal growth. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between first-trimester pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and birthweight along its continuum and at its extremes.This was a retrospective cohort of 1371 women who underwent first-trimester screening for fetal aneuploidy and who delivered at our hospital.First-trimester PAPP-A has a positive relationship with birthweight. As PAPP-A decreases, the risk of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants increases. PAPP-A of <10%, <5%, and <1% were associated with an increasing adjusted odds ratio for SGA infants (2.0 [95% CI, 1.2-3.5 P = .012]First-trimester PAPP-A is a marker of placental function that correlates with birthweight along its continuum and at its extremes. The strong association between low PAPP-A and SGA warrants further investigation of its usefulness as a screening tool.
