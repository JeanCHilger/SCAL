Pregnancy outcome in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency. The aim of this study was to examine fetal and neonatal outcomes in the setting of nuchal translucency (NT) > or =3 mm at routine first-trimester screening.A nested case-series study within a retrospective cohort of women screened for Down syndrome at 11-14 weeks of gestation. Crown-rump length, NT values and additional anomalies at first and early second trimesters were recorded. Follow-up information was obtained by a review of medical records and self-report from patients. Adverse outcomes included fetal death and termination of pregnancy due to structural or chromosomal anomalies.A total of 1930 pregnant women were screened between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. The prevalence of increased fetal NT (> or =3 mm) was 1.4% (n=27). Among these, 12 showed increased fetal NT as an isolated finding. In this group, 2 women experienced fetal demise (16%) and 10 delivered healthy babies. In the group with additional abnormalities (n=15), 9 (60%) were found to have chromosomal abnormalities, all of which were terminated. For all cases with increased fetal NT, total incidence of adverse outcome was 62%.At first-trimester ultrasonography, a fetal NT > or =3 mm was associated with a high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the presence of associated abnormalities. For cases with the increased fetal NT at first-trimester fetal assessment and follow-up is necessary to detect possible adverse outcomes.
