Omphalocele and gastroschisis and associated malformations. The etiology of gastroschisis and omphalocele is unclear and their pathogenesis is controversial. Because previous reports have inconsistently noted the type and frequency of malformations associated with omphalocele and gastroschisis, we assessed these associated malformations ascertained between 1979 and 2003 in 334,262 consecutive births. Of the 86 patients with omphalocele, 64 (74.4%) had associated malformations. These included patients with chromosomal abnormalities (25, 29.0%) non-chromosomal syndromes including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Goltz syndrome, Marshall-Smith syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Oto-palato-digital type II syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, and fetal valproate syndrome
