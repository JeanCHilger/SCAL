Transabdominal chorionic villus sampling: experience at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital. To describe the experience of transabdominal chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital.Between January 2004 and July 2006, 185 pregnant women chose to have CVS for prenatal diagnosis after counseling. Transabdominal CVS under ultrasound guidance was performed in all cases under local anesthesia using spinal needle 20-gauge with back and forth movement technique. The sample was immediately examined under a microscope to determine if the villi were obtained and to remove the decidua (maternal cells) from the villi.The mean gestational age was 12.25 +/- 1.05 weeks (range 10-20 weeks). The procedure was successful in all cases, 168 cases (90.9%) with one attempt. The indications for prenatal diagnosis included fetal risk for chromosomal abnormalities (110 cases 59.46%), severe thalassemia syndrome (57 casesTransabdominal CVS is a rather safe and reliable prenatal diagnostic technique. The fetal loss rate following the procedure in the present study was 0.54%. However operator' experience and skill in ultrasound-directed needle guidance procedure are essential.
