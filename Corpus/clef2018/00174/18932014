Dominant versus recessive: molecular mechanisms in metabolic disease. Inborn errors of metabolism used to be regarded as simple monogenic traits, but a closer look at how different alleles of a gene determine different phenotypes shows that the molecular mechanisms in the individual case are often complicated. Most metabolic disorders represent a spectrum of phenotypes from normal via attenuated to severe (and sometimes prenatally fatal), and disease manifestation is often influenced by other specific genetic or exogenous factors. The terms 'dominant' or 'recessive' relate to the functional consequences of differing alleles in the (compound) heterozygous individual the terms are irrelevant for homozygous individuals and inappropriate for X-linked disorders. Mutations affecting the same amino acid residue may be associated with different inheritance patterns. True dominant inheritance in metabolism is rare
