Early fetal megacystis at first trimester: a six-year retrospective study. A fetal megacystis is defined by a longitudinal bladder diameter more than 7 mm. The purpose of this study is to describe the prenatal ultrasound findings of this early fetal pathology and to assess pronostic and aetiologycal criteria.Between January 2003 and December 2008, 12 cases of early fetal megacystis were identified in our referral fetal medicine unit (Saint-Etienne hospital, France).There were two cases of spontaneous resolution and one case wasn't a fetal megacystis. Termination of pregnancy for medical indications was realised for another cases because of associated malformations and bad evolution (six cases) and three chromosomal abnormalities (two cases of trisomy 18 and one of trisomy 21).Sonographic follow-up and fetal karyotyping are important to evaluate prognosis. However, our data suggest that fetal megacystis is a severe condition when diagnosed in early pregnancy.
