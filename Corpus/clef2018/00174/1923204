Fetal lateral ventricle choroid plexus cysts: the dilemma of amniocentesis. Although lateral ventricle choroid plexus cysts in the second-trimester fetus have been considered a benign developmental phenomenon of no clinical significance, an association with trisomy 18 has been suggested. We designed a prospective study to determine whether karyotype analysis is indicated when such cysts are encountered on prenatal sonogram. During a 20-month period, 5400 low-risk pregnant women were examined sonographically in the second trimester to evaluate the prevalence of fetal lateral ventricle choroid plexus cysts and the incidence of ultrasonographic anomalies associated with such cysts in fetuses with trisomy 18 referred from cytogenetic laboratories. Thirty cases of fetal lateral ventricle choroid plexus cysts (0.6%) were detected during the study period 28 newborns were normal and two had trisomy 18. One of the affected infants had other associated ultrasonographic abnormalities suggesting aneuploidy, whereas no detectable abnormalities could be found in the other. Three other pregnant women were referred to us from the cytogenetics services because fetal karyotype revealed trisomy 18
