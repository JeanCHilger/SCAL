What is the optimal gestational age for history-indicated cerclage placement? We estimated the optimal gestational age for placement of a history-indicated cerclage in a retrospective cohort study of pregnancies during the period between 1994 to 2007. Pregnancies were divided into two groups: group 1, cerclage <14 weeks (N = 83), and group 2, cerclage >or=14 weeks (N = 59). The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) <35 weeks. Parametric and nonparametric tests were performed where appropriate. One hundred forty-two pregnancies by 130 women were included. Demographic characteristics were similar between groups. The median gestational age at cerclage was 12 weeks (group 1) and 15 weeks (group 2). There was no difference in the primary outcome, incidence of SPTB <35 weeks (17% versus 20% P = 0.59) between groups 1 and 2, respectively. Likewise, the secondary outcomes, mean gestational age at birth (38 versus 37 weeks
