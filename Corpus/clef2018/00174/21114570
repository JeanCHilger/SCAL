Increased pulsatility of the ductus venosus blood velocity in the first trimester is associated with the delivery of small for gestational age or low birth weight infants. To determine the relationship between ultrasound findings during the first trimester and obstetrical outcomes.A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 516 women who underwent ultrasound examination between 12 and 14 gestational weeks.The reduced crown-rump length, biparietal diameter, femur length (Z-score < -1 and -1.5) and increased umbilical artery pulsatility index (>90th and 95th percentile) were not associated with poor obstetrical outcomes. A ductus venosus pulsatility index greater than the 90th percentile was associated with aneuploidy, small for gestational age and low birth weight infants.Increased pulsatility in the ductus venosus is associated with increased risk for chromosomal abnormality in early pregnancy. Here we show that increased pulsatility is also linked to fetal growth restriction.
