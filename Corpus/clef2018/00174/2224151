Flow cytometry: its applications to immunohaematology. Flow cytometry, using fluorescent probes, has only recently been applied to practical aspects of immunohaematology. It has been used for the detection and quantitation of cell-bound immunoglobulins and complement, minor cell populations, cellular antigens, and platelet and granulocyte antibodies. Practical applications of detecting minor cell populations have been successful in determining the extent of fetal maternal haemorrhage determining the survival of transfused RBCs (small and large volumes)
