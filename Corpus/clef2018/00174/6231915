The effect of prenatal diagnosis on the incidence of Down syndrome in Western Australia. This paper compares the incidence rates of Down syndrome livebirths in Western Australia during two 5-year periods before and after the advent of prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. A statistically significant fall in the incidence of liveborn Down syndrome is demonstrated and the relevance of amniocentesis screening is discussed in the light of possible future demographic change.
