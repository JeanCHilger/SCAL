Epidemiologic detection of low dose effects on the developing fetus. Evaluations of the health effects of exposures in the workplace and environment have broadened to include effects on reproduction, as well as on the development of cancer. Models to assess risks associated with varying doses of exposure rest almost entirely on data about cancer. In this paper we discuss some distinctive features of reproduction which bear on the interpretation of such models, when applied to reproduction, rather than carcinogenesis. Dose-response curves describe the relationship between two exposures (smoking and alcohol drinking) and two outcomes (spontaneous abortion and birthweight) are used to illustrate some of the questions which arise in attempting to determine a "safe" level of exposure.This paper examines the ways in which evaluation of risks of exposure to noxious substances differ in the field of reproduction from the risks of carcinogenesis, and presents models of the effects of varying doses of exposures to smoking and alcohol drinking on spontaneous abortion and birthweight.  Models to assess risks associated with varying doses of exposure are almost all based on data about cancer, but the models for risk assessment in reproduction and in oncogenesis differ in at least 3 fundamental ways:  1) the range of relevant adverse reproductive outcomes is more varied and may involve different underlying mechanisms 2) the relation of timing and duration of exposure to outcome may be different in reproductive endocrinology and in oncogenesis, with many morphological effects depending on exposure at a precise and relatively short period of development
