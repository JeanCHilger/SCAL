Changes in immunological properties of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase in trisomy 21 pregnancies. Immunoreactivity, cytochemical, immunocytochemical characteristics and subcellular distribution of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) were investigated in blood and/or smear samples from 18 women aged 23-46 years (mean 32.5 years) with trisomy 21 fetuses (17-21 weeks) and 28 women aged 20-42 years (mean 31 years) with normal fetuses (17-22 weeks). Immunochemical NAP investigations were carried out in 8 pathological and 8 normal pregnancies cytochemical and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out in 18 pregnant women with trisomy 21 fetuses and 28 controls. NAP from women with trisomy 21 fetuses is characterized by: (1) a significant decrease in reactivity with anti-liver-type alkaline phosphatase (AP) and anti-NAP antisera
