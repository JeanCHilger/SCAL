Increased incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities in chorionic villus samples from pregnancies established by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). We studied 201 pregnancies that were established by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) and compared the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities with that found in a large control population matched for indication group (advanced maternal age) and time of sampling. A total of 252 IVF-ET fetuses were cytogenetically analysed by either chorionic villus sampling (CVS n = 80) or amniocentesis (n = 172). Eleven chromosome abnormalities were found in the CVS group (13.8 per cent)
