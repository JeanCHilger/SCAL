The stability of hCG and free beta-subunit in serum samples. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) free beta-subunit measurement is used as a screening test for Down syndrome pregnancies. Use, shipping, and storage conditions have, however, to some extent been limited by a stability problem the swamping of serum free beta-subunit levels by new molecules coming from the dissociation of hCG. We examined the stability of free beta-subunit levels in six fresh serum samples from the first trimester of pregnancy. The mean hCG level in the fresh serum samples was 3710 +/- 886 micrograms/l
