Effect of adjustment of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our objective was to determine the effect of the 20% upward adjustment of maternal serum alphafetoprotein (MSAFP) in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) on the number of patients that would be classified at increased risk for pregnancy complicated by either Down syndrome (DS) or neural tube defect (NTD). We retrospectively evaluated a database containing 63,110 patients who underwent multiple serum marker screening between 14 and 22 weeks gestation 620 patients with IDDM had measurements of MSAFP of which 479 also had measurements of beta-HCG, allowing calculation of DS risk. Increased NTD risk was defined as MSAFP >2.5 MOM while increased DS risk was defined as a calculated risk > or =1/270. One IDDM patient delivered an infant with a NTD
