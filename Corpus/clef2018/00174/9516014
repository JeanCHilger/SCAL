Evaluation of first-trimester screening by fetal nuchal translucency and maternal age. The aim of this screening study was to evaluate first-trimester screening for chromosomal defects by fetal nuchal translucency thickness at 10-14 weeks of gestation in four Fetal Medicine Units in Greece. Estimates of the risk for trisomy 21 were calculated taking into account fetal nuchal translucency thickness and maternal age. There were 3550 cases the median maternal age was 29 years (range 16-48 years)
