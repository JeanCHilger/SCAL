FISH preimplantation diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidy in recurrent pregnancy wastage. Our purpose was to detect aneuploidy for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y in preimplantation embryos from patients with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage.Three patients with a history of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion were included in this study. Embryos were biopsied at the eight-cell stage, individually fixed on slides, and processed for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). A multiple FISH protocol for seven chromosomes pairs (13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y) has been developed.A total of 39 embryos was studied with the multiple FISH protocol developed. Successful analysis of the biopsied embryos was achieved within the time limits usually allowed in a preimplantation diagnosis program. Analysis of the blastomeres showed that 17 embryos were chromosomally normal for the probes used, 16 embryos were aneuploid, and in 6 embryos no informative results were obtained.In the patients studied, a large proportion of embryos (41%) exhibited chromosomal abnormalities for the probes used. Preimplantation diagnosis to screen for chromosome abnormalities could be a feasible approach to improve the possibility of successful pregnancy in these couples.
