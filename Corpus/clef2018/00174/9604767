Simultaneous detection of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in blastomeres obtained from preimplantation embryos. Simultaneous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used in a preimplantation genetic diagnosis program to determine which embryos were normal for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21.Single blastomeres were disrupted and attached to glass slides using acetic acid and ethanol. Using a ratio mixture of chromosome enumeration DNA probes in combination with locus-specific identifier DNA probes, FISH was performed for the identification of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21.Fourteen couples enrolled in IVF produced 134 embryos for biopsy. Blastomeres subjected to five-color FISH revealed that 22% of embryos were normal for chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21. In addition, 52% were abnormal and no results could be detected for 25%. Twelve couples underwent embryo transfer, two couples did not receive embryos due to lack of any normal embryos, and three couples became pregnant.The simultaneous detection of five-color FISH is a feasible method to detect aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos from women of advanced maternal age.
