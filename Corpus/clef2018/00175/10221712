Impact of blastomere biopsy and cryopreservation techniques on human embryo viability. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of cryopreservation on 55 embryos which had one blastomere biopsied for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy before freezing. The thawing outcome was compared to that obtained in 94 embryos which derived from our conventional freezing programme in patients with comparable characteristics who were treated in the same period. Their embryos were morphologically similar but the incidence of aneuploidy was 100% in the biopsy group and unknown in the controls. The percentage of embryos which survived intact after thawing was significantly lower in the biopsied group compared to the controls (9 versus 25% respectively P < 0.025), whereas the rate of lysis was superior among biopsied embryos (34 versus 13% in the controls
