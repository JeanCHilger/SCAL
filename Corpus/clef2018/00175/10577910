Mutation rates in humans. I. Overall and sex-specific rates obtained from a population study of hemophilia B. A population-based study of hemophilia B mutations was conducted in the United Kingdom in order to construct a national confidential database of mutations and pedigrees to be used for the provision of carrier and prenatal diagnoses based on mutation detection. This allowed the direct estimate of overall (micro), male (v), and female (u) mutation rates for hemophilia B. The values obtained per gamete per generation and the 95% confidence intervals are micro=7.73 (6. 29-9.12&parr0
