A correlative study of prenatal ultrasound and post-mortem findings in fetuses and infants with an abnormal karyotype. To compare ultrasound and post-mortem findings in 98 fetuses and infants with an abnormal karyotype.Criteria for inclusion were an ultrasound examination at the National Center for Fetal Medicine (NCFM), an abnormal karyotype, and an autopsy performed during the period 1985-94.Trisomy 18 and 21 were the two most common abnormal karyotypes. The highest number of congenital anomalies was observed in cases with trisomy 13 and 18 congenital heart defects (CHD) were most prevalent among fetuses with trisomy 18. In 80% of cases there was full agreement between the ultrasound and autopsy findingsThe present comparison of sonographic diagnoses with post-mortem findings demonstrates good accordance between the two methods. It also demonstrates the importance of awareness of the anomalies known to occur with different aneuploidies.
