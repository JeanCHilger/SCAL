The contribution of uniparental disomy to congenital development defects in children born to mothers at advanced childbearing age. Most instances of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) start as trisomies and, similar to the latter, show a significant increase of mean maternal age at delivery. To investigate the incidence of UPD in offspring of older mothers, we investigated two groups of patients: 1) 50 patients with unclassified developmental defects born to mothers 35 years or older at delivery were tested for UPD for all autosomes by means of microsatellite marker analysis 2) The incidence of UPD versus other etiologies in correlation, with maternal age below versus 35 years and above at delivery was studied in patients investigated in our laboratory for maternal UPD 15 (Prader-Willi syndrome, PWS), paternal UPD 15 (Angelman syndrome, AS), and maternal UPD 7 (Silver-Russell syndrome, SRS). In group 1, four patients of 50 showed UPD for an autosome that clarified the etiology of their developmental problems: a 27-year-old woman with growth retardation and early puberty disclosed maternal heterodisomy 14
