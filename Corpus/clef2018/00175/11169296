Prenatal diagnosis of intrahepatic communications of the umbilical vein with atypical arteries (A-V fistulae) in two cases of trisomy 21 using color Doppler ultrasound. We report on two cases of the prenatal diagnosis of arterio-venous communication between the intra-abdominal umbilical vein and atypical arteries. The diagnosis was made by color and spectral Doppler and 'color power angiography'. Both cases presented with hydrops fetalis, one at 14 and the other at 31 weeks of gestation. In the first case, color Doppler demonstrated an atypical arterial vessel connecting the umbilical vein with the aorta the ductus venosus was patent. Echocardiography showed a so-called atrioventricular canal. In the second case, a complex intrahepatic vascular malformation was found. Color Doppler demonstrated communications between the umbilical vein and the hepatic artery and an atypical artery
