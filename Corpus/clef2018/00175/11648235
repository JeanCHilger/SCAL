Phillips v. United States. The U.S. District Court, District of South Carolina, held that the parents of a child with Down's syndrome were entitled to recover damages for the medical and custodial expenses necessitated by the child's condition due to the failure of the Naval Regional Medical Center staff to provide adequate genetic counseling and prenatal testing.  Members of the staff also failed to diagnose and treat a cardiac disorder in the newborn child.  Additional damages awarded to the parents for emotional distress were reduced by half to account for the benefits of the child's birth, despite his condition.
