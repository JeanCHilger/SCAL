Call v. Kezirian. Summary of opinion:  The Superior Court, Los Angeles County, had dismissed a prenatal malpractice action against a physician for failing to diagnose prenatally Down's syndrome on the ground that action was barred by the statute of limitations and failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal, holding that the statute of limitations began to run only after the plaintiff's parents learned that her condition could have been detected by amniocentesis.
