Advancing maternal age: the actual risks. A growing number of US women are delaying childbirth until their late 30s.  Pregnant women 35 years old face various risks including genetic disorders, prenatal medical and obstetric complications, intrapartum complications, and perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.  With each passing year, the risk of chromosomal abnormality such as Down's syndrome increases.  Physicians perform chorionic villus sampling (CVS) between 9-11 weeks gestation and amniocentesis between 16-18 weeks to detect chromosomal abnormalities.  CVS carries the higher risk of spontaneous abortion (1-2%).  35-year old pregnant women are more likely to suffer from hypertension and gestational diabetes than younger women.  Yet their incidence remains at an acceptable level.  Older pregnant women tend to also be at risk of several antepartum obstetric complications such as gestational bleeding, abruptio placentae, and placenta previa.  The likelihood of cesarean section and dysfunctional labor is greater among 35-year old pregnant women.  Between 1974 and 1978, older mothers were 4 times more likely to die than young mothers, but by 1982 the overall maternal mortality rate fell by 50%.  The main causes of death among older mothers were hemorrhage, embolism, and hypertensive conditions.  Positive effects of advanced maternal age were less worry about and better adjustment to pregnancy, cautiousness, and more likely to consult their physicians.  Advanced maternal age tends not to effect neonatal outcome other than chromosomal anomalies. Physicians should not allow the pregnancy of 35-year old mothers to go beyond 42 weeks' gestation.  Despite the minimal increased risks, 35-year old women should not allow their advanced age to be an absolute barrier to reproductive decisions.  Obstetricians should conduct thorough and appropriate antepartum testing and surveillance, however.
