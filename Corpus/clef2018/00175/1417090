Congenital chylothorax in a trisomy 21 newborn. We here report a case of trisomy 21 with congenital chylothorax. The patient was a male newborn who had been diagnosed as having trisomy 21 with congenital chylothorax. This is the fifth case of the both conditions in English literature. Congenital chylothorax is very rare in a trisomy 21 patient. There, however, may be causal relationship between the two conditions.
