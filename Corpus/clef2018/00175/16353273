Expectation and knowledge of women undergoing first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome in a Chinese population. To study the preference of pregnant women regarding the time taken to report the results of first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome and their knowledge about it.A questionnaire survey was conducted on a cohort of 325 pregnant participants who attended our first-trimester combined nuchal translucency and biochemical screening programme for fetal Down syndrome. This service was operated in a one-stop setting and the result of the screening test was available within 1 to 2 h after the collection of blood sample.The majority of participants: (1) could recall the quoted detection rate correctly (96.6%) (2) understood that a negative test does not exclude Down syndrome (91.1%)The majority of the pregnant women in our test considered same day reporting of screening test results to be no different from a one-stop clinic. This would have important implications for the organisation and structuring of our service provision, since the operation of a one-stop clinic imposes significant stresses on the clinical staff involved.
