The influence of risk estimates obtained from maternal serum screening on amniocentesis rates. To investigate the influence of Down syndrome risk estimates obtained from maternal serum screening (MSS) on women's choices regarding amniocentesis.Women who screened positive for Down syndrome by an Ontario MSS program between 1993 and 1998 were grouped on the basis of their risk estimate and ethnicity. Amniocentesis uptake rates between the groups were compared in order to determine how the MSS risk estimate influenced uptake.Analysis of 16 792 women showed that amniocentesis uptake rates increased as the estimated risk increased. Uptake in women < or = 35 was higher than that for older women (70% vs 60%, p = 0.001). Uptake in Caucasian and Asian women was higher than the uptake in Black women (67% vs 49%, p = 0.001). Women aged 35 years or older were more likely to proceed with amniocentesis if the MSS risk estimate was higher than their age-specific risk.The increase in amniocentesis rate paralleled the increase in MSS risk estimate for Down syndrome. Risk-specific amniocentesis rates are higher in women aged less than 35 years. Women aged 35 years or older whose risk estimate by MSS is lower than their age-specific risk are less likely to opt for amniocentesis.
