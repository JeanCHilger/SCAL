Prenatal diagnosis of de novo t(218 To present the prenatal diagnosis of a de novo complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR) associated with de novo interstitial deletions and duplication and to review the literature.Amniocentesis was performed at 18 weeks' gestation because of an increased risk for Down syndrome based on maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotrophin screening. Amniocentesis revealed a karyotype of 46,XY,t(218SKY showed a three-way CCR. Cytogenetic polymorphism investigation of the derivative chromosome 14 of the fetus and the parental chromosomes 14 determined the maternal origin of the translocation. Polymorphic DNA marker analysis confirmed the maternal origin of the de novo interstitial deletions and duplication. No cryptic imbalance at or near the breakpoints of the CCR was detected by the molecular analysis.De novo apparently balanced CCRs may be associated with imbalances in other chromosomes. We suggest further investigation and re-evaluation of cryptic or subtle imbalances in all cases classified as de novo apparently balanced CCRs.
