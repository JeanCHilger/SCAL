Darwin and evolutionary tales in leukemia. The Ham-Wasserman Lecture. All cancers evolve by a process of genetic diversification and "natural selection" akin to the process first described by Charles Darwin for species evolution. The evolutionary, natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is almost entirely covert, clinically silent and well advanced by the point of diagnosis. It has, however, been possible to backtrack this process by molecular scrutiny of appropriate clinical samples: (i) leukemic clones in monozygotic twins that are either concordant or discordant for ALL (ii) archived neonatal blood spots or Guthrie cards from individuals who later developed leukemia
