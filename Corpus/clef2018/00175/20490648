Maternal antimullerian hormone levels do not predict fetal aneuploidy. To determine if diminished ovarian reserve (measured by maternal antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels), is associated with fetal aneuploidy (determined by prenatal karyotype).This case-control study included 213 women with singleton pregnancies who underwent both serum aneuploidy screening and invasive prenatal diagnosis. 18 patients carrying an aneuploid fetus served as cases and the remaining 195 women with a euploid fetus were controls. Serum AMH was measured using two assays: AMHbc (Beckman-Coulter) and AMHdsl (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Karyotypes were determined by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.AMHbc levels did not differ between women with an aneuploid fetus and women with a euploid fetus (p = 0.46) and did not predict aneuploidy (ROC Area = 0.57). Additionally, AMHbc values declined significantly with advancing gestational age.Maternal AMH does not appear to be a marker of fetal aneuploidy in ongoing pregnancies. Contrary to previous reports, we found a significant decline in maternal AMH levels with advancing gestational age.
