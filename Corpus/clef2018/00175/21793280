Is there any effect of fetal gender on the markers of first trimester Down's syndrome screening? At present, the most effective trisomy 21-screening method is the estimate of risk combining maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency, beta-hCG and pregnancy-associated PAPP-A.The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of fetal gender in first trimester Down's syndrome screening markers.Retrospective study.Prenatal Diagnosis Centre in a tertiary hospital in Lagos.Of a total of 350 pregnancies in which fetal nuchal translucency and maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were performed were included in this study. These markers were investigated to see if they differed on the basis of fetal gender.PAPP-A levels were higher in female fetuses although the difference was not statistically significant. Nuchal translucency was 0.099 mm more in male fetuses.The results suggest that first trimester markers differ on gender but are of no clinical significance, confirming the result of other authors.
