Heterotopic pregnancy associated with assisted reproductive technology. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has been reported to be 1 per 30,000 pregnancies. This incidence may be much higher in pregnancies associated with assisted reproductive technology. Intravaginal ultrasonography and the use of quantitative beta-subunit assays of human chorionic gonadotropin should allow early diagnosis and treatment.
