Placental biopsy. There is increasing patient demand for placental biopsy, principally for karyotyping because it enables termination of pregnancy in the first trimester if an abnormality is detected. Precise risks in terms of fetal loss rates due to the procedure have not been clearly established. Over 41,000 biopsies have been performed worldwide, with an average fetal loss rate of 3.54%.
