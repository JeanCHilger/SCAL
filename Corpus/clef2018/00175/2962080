Duration of vaginal bleeding and trisomy at prenatal diagnosis. In the case-control study of 118 women with autosomal trisomy identified at prenatal diagnosis and their 442 karyotypically normal matched controls, we found that there was no overall association between risk of trisomy and the presence of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. However, a lengthy duration of bleeding appears to predict increased risk of trisomy.
