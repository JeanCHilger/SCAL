Cardiac defects in chromosomally abnormal human embryos of 10-14 weeks' gestation. Cardiac defects were studied in five chromosomally abnormal embryos of 10-14 weeks' gestation by free-hand microdissection of hearts measuring 2.5-6 mm in diameter. The type of cardiac malformation alone or in association with other anomalies helped to confirm the chromosome diagnosis established prenatally by chorionic villus sampling or after spontaneous abortion. It was suggestive of a chromosomal disorder in one case in which cytogenetic investigation had failed.
