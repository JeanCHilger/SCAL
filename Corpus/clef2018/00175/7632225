Prenatal diagnosis of the two-vessel cord: implications for patient counselling and obstetric management. The study was designed to investigate the implications of the sonographic diagnosis of the two-vessel umbilical cord for patient counselling and pregnancy management. Retrospective analysis was carried out of prenatal findings and pregnancy outcomes when a two-vessel cord was diagnosed in utero. Eighty-two fetuses each with a single umbilical artery were diagnosed by ultrasound. Ten were aneuploid, including nine with visible structural defects and one with early onset intrauterine growth retardation. Of the remaining 72, 31 had other anomalies diagnosed postnatally 27 of these had structural defects detected on ultrasound examination. However, in nine of these 27 sonographically abnormal fetuses, one or more major structural defects were missed by ultrasound examination. Among the 45 chromosomally normal fetuses with no visible defects on scan, four had anomalies diagnosed after birth. Among the chromosomally normal singletons, six of 22 with other anomalies seen on scan and seven of 38 with no other visible defects on scan had intrauterine growth retardation. Among chromosomally normal twins, one of two with other anomalies seen and two of five appearing otherwise normal had intrauterine growth retardation
