Prenatal diagnosis of 45,X/46,XX mosaicism and 45,X: implications for postnatal outcome. The prognosis for 45,X/46,XX mosaicism diagnosed prenatally has yet to be established. We report our experience with 12 patients in whom prenatal diagnosis of 45,X/46,XX mosaicism was detected by amniocentesis for advanced maternal age or decreased maternal serum alpha-feto protein and compared them with 41 45,X/46,XX patients diagnosed postnatally. The girls in the prenatal group range in age from 3 mo to 10 years. All have had normal linear growth. Four had structural anomalies including: ASD (n = 1) ptosis and esotropia (n = 1)
