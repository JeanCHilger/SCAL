Prenatal detection of trisomy 21 in uncultured amniocytes by fluorescence in situ hybridization: a prospective study. A prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the detection of trisomy 21 in interphase nuclei of uncultured amniotic fluid cells. Five hundred cases were analysed in situ and classified as normal or abnormal the results were subsequently checked against the cytogenetic findings. Four hundred and ninety-three were correctly identified as normal with an 86.6 per cent average frequency of scored nuclei exhibiting two signals
