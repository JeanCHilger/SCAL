Flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA and RNA contents of hydatidiform mole. Two significant parameters indicating malignant nature and prognosis. The cellular DNA and RNA contents of trophoblastic tissue of 86 patients with trophoblastic disease and chorionic tissue of 10 patients in early pregnancy were analysed by flow cytometry (FCM) and strict follow-up was carried out. The result showed the rate of accurate diagnosis by DNA and RNA determinations were 60.0% and 85.7% respectively in benign moles 86.7% and 86.7% in invasive moles
