Prostate-specific antigen in amniotic fluid of normal and abnormal pregnancies. To examine if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is present in amniotic fluid or maternal serum during pregnancy and if its presence is associated with fetal abnormalities.Samples tested included amniotic fluids from 853 pregnant women for whom amniocentesis was performed 312 nonpregnant women who donated bloodPSA was present in most amniotic fluids the median PSA concentration increased from gestational week 11 to 22 and stabilized thereafter until delivery. The most prominent PSA concentration change occurred during gestational weeks 13-14. Pregnant women had significantly higher serum PSA concentrations than nonpregnant womenOur data suggest that PSA may play a role in fetal development, especially at gestational ages between 13-20 weeks. The diagnostic usefulness of PSA in identifying fetal abnormalities remains to be determined.
