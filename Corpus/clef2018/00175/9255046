A phenotypically normal liveborn male after prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 20 mosaicism. We report on a case of prenatally diagnosed trisomy 20 mosaicism. Conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a chromosome 20 specific probe were performed on the lymphocytes and extra-embryonic tissues after birth. All of them revealed normal karyotypes. The baby is developing normally at the age of 2 years.
