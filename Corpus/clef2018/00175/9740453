Attitude of potential users in Sicily towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis for beta-thalassaemia and aneuploidies. This study aims to report the willingness of different populations of high-risk couples to undergo preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for beta-thalassaemia as an alternative to prenatal genetic diagnosis (PND), and the willingness of infertile couples to undergo PGD for aneuploidies. An information sheet and questionnaire presenting PGD and PND procedures were distributed to four population types: 54 high-risk couples for beta-thalassaemia coming for their first PND (population A) 51 similar couples coming for their second or further PND without previous experience of therapeutic abortion (population B-na)
