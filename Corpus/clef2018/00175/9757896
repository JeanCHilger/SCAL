Spermatozoa with chromosomal abnormalities may result in a higher rate of recurrent abortion. To determine whether sperm aneuploidy can lead to abortion.Clinical study.Couples with reproductive problems evaluated in a private diagnostic laboratory.Two men whose wives had histories of multiple abortions.Whole and Percoll-processed semen samples were analyzed.The results of fluorescence in situ hybridization.Aneuploidy rates in Percoll-processed samples were higher than those found in whole specimens. Aneuploid spermatozoa also displayed greater motility.Sperm aneuploidy should be studied before and after Percoll capacitation in all couples with unexplained infertility.
