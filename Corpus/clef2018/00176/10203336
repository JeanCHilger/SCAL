Calcium signals in cell lines derived from the cerebral cortex of normal and trisomy 16 mice. We established two immortalized cell lines from cerebral cortex of normal (CNh) and trisomy 16 (CTb) mouse fetuses, an animal model of human trisomy 21. Those cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ dyes, Indo-1 and Fluo-3, exhibited increments of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in response to external glutamate, NMDA, AMPA and kainate. CTb cells exhibited higher basal Ca2+ concentrations and had higher amplitude and slower time-dependent kinetics in the decay than CNh cells, suggesting an impaired Ca2+ buffering capacity in the trisomy 16-derived cell line. Nicotine also induced increments of [Ca2+]i. The CTb cell line could represent a model for studying cellular alterations related to Down syndrome.
