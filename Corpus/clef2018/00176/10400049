Best second trimester sonographic markers for the detection of trisomy 21. We analyzed all genetic sonograms obtained during a 6 year period to establish the independent ability of the following sonographic markers of aneuploidy in the diagnosis of trisomy 21: structural anomalies, cardiac abnormalities, nuchal fold thickness of 6 mm or greater, bowel echogenicity, choroid plexus cysts, and renal pyelectasis. With the exception of bowel echogenicity and choroid plexus cysts, the sonographic markers were more common in trisomy 21 than euploid fetuses (all P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that cardiac anomalies (odds ratio = 255 95% confidence interval, 25, 2592), other structural anomalies (odds ratio = 25
