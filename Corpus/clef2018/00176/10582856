Fetal Down syndrome screening: a cost effectiveness analysis of alternative screening programs. To compare the efficacy and cost effectiveness of different screening programs for fetal Down syndrome (DS).Screening tools evaluated included maternal age, triple screening (TS), and ultrasound (U/S) for fetal markers of DS. Sensitivities used were TS: 55% <35 years, 80% > or = 35 years U/S: 70%. Average regional fees used were TS: $80, U/S: $200, amniocentesis (AM): $1,000. Five screening programs were evaluated: 1) <35 years, no screeningIt was estimated that 260 cases of DS would occur in the population of 167,654 women (8.4% > or = 35 years at delivery). Sensitivity for programs 1-5 was 30, 69, 62, 51, and 36 percent, respectively, and cost/DS was 181,000, 203,000, 162,000, 151,000, and 194,000 dollars, respectively.DS screening incorporating TS in all patients with program #4 and without program #3 selective U/S in women <35 years yield the best combination of sensitivity and cost effectiveness while minimizing the number of AM-related losses.
