First trimester biochemical screening for Down syndrome: free beta hCG versus intact hCG. To compare free beta hCG versus intact hCG in first trimester Down syndrome screening we analysed 63 cases of Down syndrome and 400 unaffected control pregnancies between 10 and 13 weeks' gestation. The Down syndrome median multiple of the median (MoM) was significantly higher (p=0.001) for free beta hCG (1.89 MoM) than for intact hCG (1.37 MoM). Although distributions for free beta hCG (unaffected, 0.2157 DS, 0.2322) are wider than for intact hCG (unaffected, 0.1697
