Replication status as a possible marker for genomic instability in cells originating from genotypes with balanced rearrangements. Most allelic pairs of DNA replicate synchronously during the S phase of the cell cycle. However, some genes frequently replicate asynchronously, i.e. genes on the X chromosome and imprinted genes. Earlier studies demonstrated an asynchronous pattern of replication in some precancerous and invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix as well as in multiple myeloma. A high rate of asynchronous pattern was found in: (1) lymphocytes of individuals with solid tumors as well as in other malignancies (2) amniocytes of genotypes with an extra chromosome 13, 18 and 21
