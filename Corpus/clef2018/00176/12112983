The role of ultrasound in screening for fetal Down syndrome. Antenatal Down syndrome screening begins with maternal age-specific risks. It also may incorporate the maternal serum screen and antenatal ultrasound. These complementary tests improve the efficacy of maternal age in Down syndrome screening. Ultrasound enhances antenatal Down syndrome screening by 1) precise dating of a pregnancy for the interpretation of serum screen results 2) detecting major structural anomalies that occur in approximately 20% of all second-trimester Down syndrome fetuses
