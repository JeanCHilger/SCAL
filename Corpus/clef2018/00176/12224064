Association between fetal nuchal translucency thickness in first trimester and subsequent gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Increased fetal nuchal translucency (NT) in the first trimester is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Whether the increased NT is also associated with an increased frequency of pregnancy-associated hypertension (PAH) is not known. Seven hundred and seventy-nine pregnant women who received NT-based Down syndrome screening and delivered their babies at our hospital by September 2000 were enrolled into this study. Among these women, there are 46 cases of preeclampsia, 68 cases of gestational hypertension (GH) 665 women without any adverse pregnancy outcomes served as controls. Correlation analysis demonstrated that NT MoM (multiples of median) level had a positive association with maternal diastolic blood pressure at the time of admission for delivery (r = 0.104
