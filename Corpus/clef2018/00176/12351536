Prenatal testing in ICSI pregnancies: incidence of chromosomal anomalies in 1586 karyotypes and relation to sperm parameters. Prenatal testing was offered in all pregnancies obtained after ICSI with ejaculated or non-ejaculated sperm as part of the evaluation of the safety of ICSI.Between 1990 and 2001, a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis was offered for multiple or singleton pregnancies respectively during a genetic counselling session for all couples applying for ICSI. ICSI was carried out using ejaculated, epididymal or testicular sperm.In total, 1586 ICSI fetuses obtained after fresh embryo transfer were tested by CVS (n = 698) or by amniocentesis (n = 888). Abnormal fetal karyotypes were found in 47 samples [3.0% 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-3.9%]A significantly higher rate of de-novo chromosomal anomalies (1.6 versus 0.5% in amniocentesis for a mean maternal age of 33.5 years P < 0.007) was observed in ICSI offspring, relating mainly to a higher number of sex chromosomal anomalies and partly to a higher number of autosomal structural anomalies. This finding was related to sperm concentration and motility. The significantly higher rate of observed inherited anomalies (1.4 versus 0.3-0.4% in prenatal tests in the general population
