Second trimester trisomy 21 maternal serum marker screening. Results of a countrywide study of 854,902 patients. In France, maternal serum marker screening is governed by specific legislation. We conducted a study of the countrywide trisomy 21 screening based on second trimester maternal serum markers.We reviewed the medical records of 854,902 patients prospectively screened for second trimester maternal serum markers in the 60 authorized laboratories over the two-year period 1997-1998. All patients screened in France were included. The risk of trisomy 21 was calculated from the combination of maternal age and maternal serum markers. The same cut-off (1/250) was used in all laboratories.In 1998, 65% of pregnant women underwent maternal serum screening. In the 837,765 patients under 38 years of age who were screened, 54,321 (6.48% 5% CI 6.42-6.53%) had a calculated risk >1/250. Of the 884 Down syndrome cases observed, 626 were detected by maternal serum markers (70.8%Strict rules covering prenatal trisomy 21 screening are of benefit to patients, practitioners and laboratories alike, and ensure good quality control, a high trisomy 21 detection rate and a low amniocentesis rate.
