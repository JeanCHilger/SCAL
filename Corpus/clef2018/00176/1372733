Prenatal identification of small mosaic markers of different chromosomal origins. In situ hybridization using a series of alphoid DNA probes has demonstrated the origin of two small accessory mosaic marker chromosomes ascertained from 1079 amniocenteses. These markers appeared to be de novo, derived from acrocentric chromosomes, and identical by traditional cytogenetic staining (G, Q, C, AgNOR, Hoechst-distamycin). Molecular characterization showed that one marker had originated from chromosome 14, the other from chromosome 22. Clinical outcome in both cases was normal.
