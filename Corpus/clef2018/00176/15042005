An outcomes analysis of five prenatal screening strategies for trisomy 21 in women younger than 35 years. This study was undertaken to examine the cost-effectiveness and procedural-related losses associated with 5 prenatal screening strategies for fetal aneuploidy in women under 35 years old.Five prenatal screening strategies were compared in a decision analysis model: triple screen: maternal age and midtrimester serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and unconjugated estriol quad screen: triple screen plus serum dimeric inhibin AIn the baseline analysis, sequential screening was the least expensive strategy ($455 million). It detected the most Down syndrome fetuses (n=1213), averted the most Down syndrome live births (n=678), but led to the highest number of procedure-related euploid losses (n=859). The integrated screen had the fewest euploid losses (n=62) and averted the second most Down syndrome live births (n=520). If fewer than 70% of women diagnosed with fetal Down syndrome elect to abort, the quad screen became the least expensive strategy.Although sequential screening was the most cost-effective prenatal screening strategy for fetal trisomy 21, it had the highest procedure-related euploid loss rate. The patient's perspective on detection versus fetal safety may help define the optimal screening strategy.
