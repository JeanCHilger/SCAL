Expression of cystathionine beta-synthase, pyridoxal kinase, and ES1 protein homolog (mitochondrial precursor) in fetal Down syndrome brain. Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and characterized by somatic anomalies and mental retardation. The phenotype of DS is thought to result from overexpression of genes encoded on chromosome 21. Although several studies reported mRNA levels of genes localized on chromosome 21, mRNA data cannot be simply extrapolated to protein levels. Furthermore, most protein data have been generated using immunochemical methods. In this study we investigated expression of three proteins (cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), ES1 protein homolog, mitochondrial precursor (ES1)) whose genes are encoded on chromosome 21 in fetal DS (n = 8 mean gestational age of 19.8 +/- 2.0 weeks) and controls (n = 7
