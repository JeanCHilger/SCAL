Pregnancy loss rate following routine genetic amniocentesis at Wellington Hospital. To determine the institutional pregnancy loss rate following second-trimester genetic amniocentesis.Data from 293 consecutive women who had routine genetic amniocentesis at Wellington Hospital from 1 January to 31 December 2001 were collected. The primary outcome measure was pregnancy loss rate up to 6-weeks post-procedure. Secondary outcomes were pregnancy loss after 6 weeks and culture failure.Complete information on the pregnancy outcome was obtained for 269 of 293 pregnancies (92%) corresponding to 275 procedures, including two twin pregnancies and four repeat amniocentesis for culture failure (1.3%). There were two miscarriages within 6 weeks of amniocentesisThe pregnancy loss rate from amniocentesis and the culture failure rate in Wellington Hospital (using modern techniques) are similar to rates found in recently published studies.
