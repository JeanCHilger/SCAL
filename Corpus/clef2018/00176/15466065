Conditions leading to pediatric cardiology consultation in a tertiary academic hospital. To determine the basis for cardiac consultations for pediatric patients in an academic hospital setting.The activities of the cardiology consultation service were tabulated for 12 months, from July 2001 to June 2002. Patients were identified from 4 sources, ie, a monthly log of patient encounters maintained by the consultation service, encounter forms submitted to the billing office, consultation notes maintained in a central file, and a departmental list of echocardiography studies. Patients who required clearance for noncardiac surgical procedures were generally evaluated in the cardiology clinic and not by the consultation service. Patient data were obtained from consultation and echocardiography reports and from hospital computer-based records for discharge summaries for inpatient admissions, emergency department encounter summaries, and laboratory reports. For each patient, consultations were tabulated as separate encounters if they occurred on different days in the emergency department, during separate admissions, or for different clinical concerns during a single admission.A total of 2071 consultations were performed for 1724 patients. The age at the time of consultation was 6.6 +/- 9.3 years (median: 1.2 years range: 1 day to 60.6 years). A total of 1507 patients (87.4%) had a single consultationAlthough a variety of conditions were assessed, some were encountered more frequently. Future educational curricula developed for cardiac training of pediatric residents should appropriately emphasize conditions necessitating consultation.
