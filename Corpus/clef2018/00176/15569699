Cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood: kinetics, source and structure. The kinetics and structure of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is currently under investigation. Plasma fetal DNA seems quite stable albeit cleared rapidly following birth, suggesting continuous fetal DNA release into the maternal circulation during pregnancy. However, to understand better the kinetics of circulating DNA, studies to determine the biological (structural) form in which fetal and maternal DNA exist and the mechanisms underlying variation in plasma are warranted to ensure quantitative diagnostic reliability. It is likely that circulating fetal DNA is released from fetal and/or placental cells undergoing apoptosis. Thus, the majority of fetal DNA is proposed to circulate in membrane-bound vesicles (apoptotic bodies). This review summarizes the latest reports in this field.
