Live delivery following transfer of a single frozen-thawed embryo derived from a 42-year-old woman with marked decreased oocyte reserve. To determine if live birth is possible in a woman of older reproductive age and who has markedly decreased oocyte reserve following frozen embryo transfer of an oocyte fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection of testicular sperm.Ethinyl estradiol followed by ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins was used and a mature follicle was attained. Following oocyte retrieval 34 hours later, intracytoplasmic sperm injection of testicular sperm was performed. The embryo was cryopreserved.A live delivery of a full-term baby ensued. Following subsequent frozen embryo transfer, the baby was diagnosed with Down's syndrome and subsequently died.This is the first report of a live delivery following frozen embryo transfer in a woman of advanced reproductive age with marked decreased oocyte reserve.
