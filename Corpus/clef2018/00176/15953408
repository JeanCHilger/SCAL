Double aneuploidy involving trisomy 7 with Potter sequence. We report a prenatal case of double aneuploidy (consisting of chromosome 7 and X) with the features of Potter sequence. Of the stillborn fetus, skin fibroblast cultures were performed and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique was also used for further investigation. On physical examination the fetus was found to have malformed ears, micrognatia, hypertelorism, abnormal extremities, rocker-bottom feet and abnormal external genitalia and polycystic right kidney was seen after an extensive autopsy. As amniocentesis and cordocentesis materials revealed X chromosome mosaicism, trisomy 7 was detected in the skin fibroblast culture of the ex fetus and karyotype evaluated as composite
