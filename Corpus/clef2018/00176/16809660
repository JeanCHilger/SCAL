Choroid plexus cysts. Research shows that there is an association between choroid plexus cysts and aneuploidy. Family physicians treating prenatal patients should understand the management of this sonographic finding.To determine the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of prenatal choroid plexus cysts.A 23-year-old patient, gravida 1, para 0, was seen at an inner city Family Medicine health center for prenatal care. A screening ultrasonogram performed at 16 weeks of gestation showed bilateral choroid plexus cysts approximately 5 mm in diameter. The patient declined amniocentesis. Maternal serum triple screen markers (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and estriol) were all normal, as was the level II sonogram at 20 weeks and the fetal echocardiogram at 28 weeks. At birth the baby was found to be normal after a clinical assessment was performed.A review of the literature using MEDLINE with the search strategy of choroid plexus, choroid plexus fetus/fetal, choroid plexus management, choroid plexus treatment, and choroid plexus epidemiology.
