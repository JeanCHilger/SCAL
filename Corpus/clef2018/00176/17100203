Prenatal diagnosis of mosaicism identified in amniotic fluid cell cultures. Chromosomal mosaicism in prenatal diagnosis is an important problem to be solved immediately and the probable phenotypic reflections should be explained to the family. We report two numerical and two structural mosaicisms detected in amniocyte cultures. The first fetus had a 47,XY,+mar[10]/46,XY[10] karyotype. The marker chromosome was shown to be derived from chromosome 15 by FISH method. The newborn had intrauterine growth retardation and cerebral thrombosis and died at the 29th day of age. The second fetus had a 45,X[4]/46,XX[26] karyotype. The parents refused cordocentesis and decided to terminate pregnancy in the 21st week. The third case, presented with bilateral large choroid plexus cysts, had a 46,XX, dup(1)(q22-q32)[9]/46,XX[21] karyotype. The parents' karyotypes were normal and the pregnancy was aborted in the 23rd week of gestation. The second structural abnormality was reported as 46,XX,t(611)(q23
