Estimation of ultrasonographic markers of chromosomal abnormalities in verification of second trimester maternal serum biochemistry. In the case of positive triple test results the presence or absence of sonographic markers is associated not only with fetal abnormalities, but also with a variety of adverse outcomes of pregnancy.Evaluation of sonographic markers of chromosomal abnormalities in verification of positive results of triple tests.In consecutive series of 780 pregnant women we performed triple tests at 14-19 weeks. We reviewed the presence or absence of sonographic markers for fetal abnormalities including nuchal thickening (NT), nasal bones (NB), extermities (HL, FL), umbilical cord diameter (UCD), bowel echogenity (BE), renal pyelectasis (DPR) and chorioid plexus cyst (CPC).There were 47 (6.02%) positive results of triple tests including 36 (4.6%) cases with false positive result. In the group of affected fetuses we observed at least two sonographic markers. In the group with false-positive results 15 (41.6%) fetuses had adverse pregnancy outcome with only one ultrasound marker.Positive result of the triple test and the presence of two or more markers of fetal abnormalities increase the risk of fetal abnormalities, whereas absence or presence of only one marker and normal karyotype should classify pregnancy to high risk of adverse perinatal outcome.
