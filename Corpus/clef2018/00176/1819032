A genetic study of retinoblastoma. Eight patients with retinoblastoma (RB) were studied by high resolution chromosome R-banding technique, and the esterase D was quantitatively determined in red blood cells of the patients. Among these patients, 2 showed 13q14 deletion mosaicism, 1 showed a monosomy 13q14.1-q14.2, and the remaining 5 had normal karyotype. Our findings indicated that 1) the RB gene is located at 13q14.1. The result confirmed previous data 2) 13q deletion is an important event in the development of RB
