Abnormal second trimester screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities as a predictor of adverse pregnancy outcome. Second-trimester maternal serum markers (triple test) is common used to estimate of the fetal risk of genetic abnormalities and open neural tube defects. Positive results of the triple test concomitant with the normal fetus karyotype pattern can also predict the adverse pregnancy outcome. Many authors have been indicated such false positive results of the triple test in the cases of the uterine myomas, PIH, IUGR, and IUD.The purpose of this study was to determine the association between abnormal second trimester Down syndrome screening markers and adverse pregnancy outcome.A total of 775 pregnant women underwent maternal serum screening. Pregnancy complications were studied in the groups of pregnancies with structurally and chromosomally normal fetuses--with: elevated AFP > 1,89MoM, elevated beta-hCG > 1,69MoM or low beta-hCG < 0,48MoM.Increased maternal serum AFP > 1,89MoM were found to be significantly associated with IUGR, PIH and placental pathology. Increased beta-hCG > 1,69MoM were significantly associated with PIH and IUGR. Finally decreased beta-hCG < 0,48MoM were found to be significantly associated with IUGR, PIH and IUD.Triple test can be used not only for the detection of fetal chromosomal and NTD abnormalities but also for the detection of high-risk pregnancies.
