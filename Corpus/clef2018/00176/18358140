Mosaic trisomy 9: report of a new case with a long-term survival. Trisomy 9 is an uncommon chromosome abnormality that may be seen in a mosaic or non-mosaic state.To better define the phenotype and prognosis of this disorder we report a new case of mosaic trisomy 9 with a long-term survival.We present the case of a female patient, born from the first pregnancy of a healthy couple. Fetal ultrasounds disclosed intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios. Cesarean section was performed in the 34th week. Birth weight was 1,478 g. Neonatal examination showed: dolichocephaly hypotelorism, microphthalmia, short palpebral fissuresIt is important to be aware of the possibility that mosaicism may exist in a patient with normal blood karyotype and abnormal phenotype. We conclude that a great number of cells is needed in order to obtain a correct karyotype diagnosis. Correct diagnosis is essential to define the prognosis and provide accurate genetic counselling.
