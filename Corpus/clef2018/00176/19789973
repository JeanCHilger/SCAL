Prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia due to FGFR3 gene mutations: a 9-year experience : prenatal diagnosis in FGFR3 gene. Prenatal diagnosis with ultrasound findings compatible with skeletal dysplasia due to FGFR3 mutations over a 9 year period in pregnancies and abortuses.54 samples were studied. Aneuploidy studies were carried out on all samples. By sequencing analysis, we determined mutations for achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH), and type I and type II tanathophoric dysplasia (TD).2 chorionic villi samples had a G380R mutation due to a mother with ACH 4 amniotic fluid samples with TDs in which the foetuses had micromelia plus hypoplastic thoracesMolecular studies in ongoing pregnancies are indicated in cases with an affected parent, a family history with positive molecular studies (maternal anxiety), and when the US finding demonstrates micromelia with a hypoplastic thorax. A protocol for tissues of abortuses should include an X-ray, pathologic anatomy, and genetic studies.
