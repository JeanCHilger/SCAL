Percutaneous transvesical chorionic villus sampling: an alternative approach to the retroverted uterus. In 458 consecutive chorionic villus sampling (CVS) procedures, we observed a significant influence of uterine position upon sampling efficacy. Compared with anteverted (N = 243) or axial (N = 149) locations, the retroverted uterus (N = 66) was associated with a lower mean sample weight per aspiration (22, 18, and 15 mg, respectively P less than .01) and a greater frequency of multiple-pass procedures (23, 31, and 52%, respectively
