Aneuploidies in embryos and spermatozoa from patients with Y chromosome microdeletions. In patients with Y chromosome microdeletions and high percentage of numeric chromosome abnormalities detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization on sperm, a high percentage of abnormal embryos was observed compared with oligozoospermic patients without Y chromosome microdeletions, with a significant increase in the percentage of embryos with monosomy X. Differences in fertilization rates between the different patient groups were not observed however, blastocyst rates were significantly impaired in patients with Y chromosome microdeletions.
