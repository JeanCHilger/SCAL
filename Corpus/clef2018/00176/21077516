Recurrent aneuploidy--fact or fiction. To evaluate the likelihood that some women are more prone to forming chromosomally abnormal embryos unrelated to age.The literature involving studies suggesting that predisposition to aneuploidy does exist was reviewed. In addition a new anecdotal unpublished report on a tendency to form trisomies is presented and a couple of case reports dealing with the possibility of predisposition to polyploidy are discussed.The results of in vitro fertilization and pre-implantation diagnoses confirm the suspicion that some women are more prone to trisomies or polyploidy.In vitro fertilization with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis may help in preventing miscarriage from recurrent polyploidy but is not so valuable for recurrent trisomies.
