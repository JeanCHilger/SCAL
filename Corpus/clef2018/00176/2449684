The use of gamma glutamyl transferase activity in amniotic fluid in the detection of fetal trisomy 21. The value of using gamma glutamyl transferase (GT) to select amniotic fluids for karyotyping from patients at low risk of chromosome defects is assessed. This paper reports on 16 pregnancies with fetal trisomy 21 and compares these to two previous reports of GT in fetal trisomy 21. The value of GT is contrasted to the value of AFP in selecting liquors for karyotyping.
