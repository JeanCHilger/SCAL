Molecular genetics of Turner's syndrome. Recombinant DNA technology now allows an analysis of sex chromosomal abnormalities at the molecular level. X chromosomes differ in respect of their pattern of cutting sites for particular restriction enzymes these differences can be used to determine which X chromosomes or which part of an X chromosome has been inherited from a parent. Furthermore, these techniques can be used to define the presence or absence of particular regions of the X chromosomes with a higher level of resolution than it is possible to achieve using light microscopy. Thirty-eight families in which there was a child or fetus with Turner's syndrome were studied using a series of DNA probes that detect differences (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) among X chromosomes. Analysis of the origin of the normal X chromosome was possible in 27 families. In 14 families with 45,X the observed X was maternal in each, whereas in 13 children with other karyotypes (46,X,i(Xq)
