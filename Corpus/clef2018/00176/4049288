Morphology of early fetal deaths and their chromosomal characteristics. The morphologic features of a consecutive series of 3,472 singleton spontaneous abortions are described. Of the total, 21% consisted of well-formed fetuses (over 30 mm long), 27.9% had no identifiable fetal tissues, 34.2% consisted of fetal membranes only, and the remainder, 16.8%, consisted of a variety of embryonic types. The rate of focal malformations among embryos over 10 mm in length and among fetuses was 16.4%. The overall rate of chromosome anomalies in the 1,356 karyotyped specimens was 39.8%. The vast majority, 94%, occurred in embryos less than 30 mm, and in specimens whose development had not proceeded beyond differentiation of fetal membranes. The rate of chromosome anomalies among nonmalformed fetuses (greater than 30 mm) was only 1.7%. However, the presence of limited embryonic development was not a good predictor of the presence of a chromosome anomaly. Slightly over half (56%) of all specimens less than 30 mm long had chromosome anomalies for individual classes of such specimens the rate ranged from 45% to 81%. The morphologic category with the highest rate of karyotypic anomalies had an excess of monosomy X abortuses. A gradient of developmental level could be associated with the degree of intrauterine mortality of each chromosome anomaly
