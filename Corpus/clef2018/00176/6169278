Prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects: predictive value of AF-AFP in a low-risk population. Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AF-AFP) determinations were performed on 1,215 women who were at low risk for fetal neural tube defects and who were undergoing mid-trimester amniocentesis for cytogenetic indications, primarily age-related aneuploidy. Maternal sera obtained before amniocentesis and amniotic fluids were assayed in duplicate for alpha-fetoprotein by radioimmunoassay. Of the 1,215 low-risk women, eight (0.7%) had significant elevations of AF-AFP (greater than or equal to +5 SD). In none of the cases was the elevation associated with a fetal neural tube defect. Two cases with elevated AF-AFP were associated with chromosome aberrations one with impending fetal demise
