Chromosome abnormalities and spontaneous fetal death following amniocentesis: further data and associations with maternal age. The pooled results are presented of two North American surveys concerning spontaneous fetal deaths of conceptuses with cytogenetic abnormalities diagnosed prenatally whose mothers had declined elective abortion. The rate of fetal death of those with nonmosaic genotypes associated with Down syndrome was 30.1% (95% confidence interval of 19.0%-42.0%), which is almost identical with the difference of 30% previously estimated between rates observed at amniocentesis and in live births. The fetal death rate for (nonmosaic) 47,+18 was 68.0% (95% confidence interval of 46.5%-85.1%), close to the estimated difference of 75% between rates at amniocentesis and in live births for this genotype. For other nonmosaic genotypes, the rates (and 95% confidence intervals) were: 47,+13, 42.9% (9.9%-81.6%) 47,XXX, 0% (0%-9.0%)
