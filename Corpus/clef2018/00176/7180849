Minor chromosomal variants and major chromosomal anomalies in couples with recurrent abortion. One hundred three women with prior histories of recurrent spontaneous abortion and 81 of their mates were karyotyped with Q-banding during 1976-1980. Recurrent abortion was defined as two or more spontaneous pregnancy losses no couple with a previous malformed fetus or child was included. These cases were reviewed in order to examine the possible contributions of minor polymorphic chromosomal variants and major chromosomal abnormalities to recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss. Balanced translocations were detected in four women and two men in the study
