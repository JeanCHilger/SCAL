True hermaphroditism: genetic variants and clinical management. The diagnosis and management of 22 patients with true hermaphroditism are described. Sixteen of them were first seen before the age of 4 months. The initial manifestations were ambiguous genitalia in 20 cases (two of them identified prenatally by ultrasound examination), isolated clitoromegaly in one, and penile hypospadias plus unilateral cryptorchidism in one. All patients but one had at least one palpable gonad. Eleven of the twelve patients examined before the age of 6 months had basal plasma testosterone levels > 0.4 ng/ml. In older patients the stimulation test was necessary to demonstrate male testosterone secretion. The most common peripheral karyotype was 46,XX (17 cases) the other karyotypes were 47,XXY (1 case) and mosaicism 46,XX/46,XY (2 cases) or 46,XX/47,XXY (2 cases). One of the patients with the 46,XX karyotype had 46,XX/46,XY on fibroblast culture
