Aneuploidy among prenatally detected neural tube defects. We have reported previously a 10% aneuploidy detection rate among 39 cases of fetal neural tube defects (NTD). Subsequently we amassed an additional experience of over 17,000 prenatal diagnosis cases over a 5-year period. During this period 106 cases of NTDs were identified 44 with anencephaly, 62 with open spina bifida. The average maternal age of this population with NTDs was 29 years (15-40)
