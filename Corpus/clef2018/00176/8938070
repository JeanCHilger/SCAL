Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 2 in association with confined placental mosaicism for trisomy 2 and severe intrauterine growth retardation. We report a liveborn infant with severe intrauterine growth retardation and renal failure, delivered following detection of non-mosaic trisomy 2 by chorionic villus biopsy in the first trimester. Detailed analysis post-delivery indicated apparent complete trisomy 2 of the chorionic tissues, with a chromosomally normal infant demonstrating maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 2.
