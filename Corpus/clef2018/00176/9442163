First trimester sonographic detection of chromosomal abnormalities in an unselected population. To investigate the role of first trimester sonography in detecting chromosomal abnormalities in an unselected obstetric population.2281 women (mean maternal age 30 years [range 16-47] mean gestational age 12(+3) weeks [range 11-14]) underwent transabdominal scanning to assess fetal structure and, if anatomical survey was considered to be incomplete (31% of cases), transvaginal sonography was also performed. Measurement of nuchal translucency was included and karyotyping performed as considered appropriate.There were 16 chromosomal abnormalities 13 (81%) were diagnosed at 11-14 weeks either because of a nuchal translucency greater than or equal to the 99th centile for gestational age (7/16A significant proportion of fetal chromosomal abnormalities can be detected by first trimester sonographic screening to assess fetal structural appearance. The sensitivity of detection can be improved by combining measurement of nuchal translucency with detailed examination of fetal anatomy.
