Chromosome 21 detection in human oocyte fluorescence in situ hybridization: possible effect of maternal age. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, among 100 uncleaved oocytes, the incidence of numerical and structural chromosome 21 and X abnormalities and to analyze the influence of various factors, such as in vitro (IVF) indications, follicle stimulation protocols, and women's age.We investigated 150 uncleaved oocytes from 128 patients after an IVF attempt. After cytogenetic analysis (Giemsa) 100 oocytes (66%) were selected for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Fluorescent probes for human chromosomes X and 21 were used simultaneously according to standard procedures for their hybridization and detection.We analyzed by the FISH protocol 100 metaphase II oocytes with 22 to 25 chromosomes. Our results demonstrate a high rate of disomy for chromosome 21 in human oocytes. Among them, eight were disomic (8%) and three were nullosomic (3%) for chromosome 21. Only one disomy of chromosome X was noted. The various indications of IVF and the different folliculogenesis stimulating protocols did not seem to influence the results but suggested a correlation between the maternal age and the aneuploidy rate of chromosome 21.
