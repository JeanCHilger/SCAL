Ascertainment of 68,XX double aneuploidy by midtrimester biochemical screening: a case report. A fetus with 68,XX karyotype was ascertained by an elevated midtrimester MSHCG. By antenatal ultrasound, the only unusual finding was in relation to the placenta. Preterm delivery was mandated by the development of severe preeclampsia. Postmortem examination of the stillborn fetus demonstrated no abnormal physical findings other than bilateral syndactyly of fingers and toes.
