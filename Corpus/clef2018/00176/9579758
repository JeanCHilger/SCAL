Women's decision-making in prenatal screening. With serum screening (MS-AFP and hCG testing for Down's syndrome) women have to make several decisions in a limited time: whether to participate in the screening in the first place then, if increased risk for fetal abnormality is detected, whether to have a diagnostic test, and finally, what to do if fetal abnormality is detected. The aim of this study was to examine how women themselves in an unselected population describe their decision-making in the different phases of serum screening. Women receiving a positive result from serum screening in two Finnish towns from September 1993 to March 1994 and a group of individually matched controls were invited to semistructured interviews
