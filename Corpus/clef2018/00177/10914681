Is there an interchromosomal effect in reciprocal translocation carriers? Sperm FISH studies. Chromosome translocations have been known to affect disjunction of chromosomes unrelated to the translocation in the mouse and in Drosophila. However, in humans, an interchromosomal effect in chromosome translocations has not been demonstrated. The availability of techniques that allow the study of nondisjunction in sperm cells has permitted us to evaluate the possibility of an interchromosomal effect in male translocation heterozygotes. In this study, multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to determine levels of disomy for the clinically relevant chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18, and 21 in 332,858 spermatozoa from nine reciprocal translocation heterozygotes and nine controls with normal karyotypes. The specific translocations studied were as follows: t(1012)(p26.1
