Congenital duodenal obstruction: early antenatal ultrasound diagnosis. Twenty-nine patients with congenital duodenal obstruction (DO) detected as a "double bubble" (DB) on antenatal ultrasound (US) or diagnosed postnatally were seen at the Women's and Children's Hospital between 1985 and 1994 24 (83%) had antenatal scans, with 21 (87%) DBs visualised. The 3 fetuses with normal scans who developed DO postnatally had duodenal "windsocks". Five of the 24 scanned patients (21%) were found to have a DB before 20 weeks' gestation: 1 simple duodenal atresia, 2 duodenal atresias with chromosomal abnormalities (1 trisomy 21 and 1 triploidy), 1 biliary atresia with a pre-pyloric vein, and 1 malrotation. Sixteen (67%) cases were detected with scans after 20 weeks (range 28-36 weeks)
