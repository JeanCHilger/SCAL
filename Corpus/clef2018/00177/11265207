Disabling malformations in Chile. Latin American Cooperative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC), 1982-1997. The ECLAMC (Estudio Colaborativo Latinoamericano de Malformaciones Cong√©nitas) is an epidemiological surveillance program for congenital defects that operates in Chile since 1969.To communicate the frequency of disabling congenital defects in Chile in the period 1982-1997.A review of the ECLAMC registry, choosing 12 congenital defects: amelia, limb amputations, limb reductions, arthrogryposis, hip luxation and subluxation, spina bifida, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, cephalocele, talipes equinovarus, Down syndrome and multiple abnormalities.In the study period, 283,403 births occurred and 7,917 newborns were malformed (7,654 born alive and 263 stillbirths). The congenital defects prevalence rates appeared higher in Chile than in other Latin American countries, specially among stillbirths. Among the studied maternity hospitals, the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile, showed the higher prevalence of congenital defects. Rancagua and the Navy Hospital in Valparaiso have a high frequency of Down syndrome. Global rates in Chile and in the rest of ECLAMC for specific defects, do not have significant differences, except for hip subluxation, that has a lower incidence in Chile.The ECLAMC allows to have a good knowledge of the prevalence of congenital malformations in Latin America.
