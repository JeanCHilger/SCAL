Detection of mosaicism in amniotic fluid cultures: a CYTO2000 collaborative study. To evaluate the assumptions on which the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines for detecting mosaicism in amniotic fluid cultures are based.Data from 653 cases of amniotic fluid mosaicism were collected from 26 laboratories. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to compare the observed number of mosaic cases with the expected number based on binomial distribution theory.Comparison of observed data from the in situ colony cases with the expected distribution of cases detected based on the binomial distribution did not reveal a significant difference (P = 0.525).The empirical data fit the binomial distribution. Therefore, binomial theory can be used as an initial discussion point for determining whether ACMG Standards and Guidelines are adequate for detecting mosaicism.
