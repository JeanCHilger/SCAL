Prognostic role of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy in assisted reproductive technology outcome. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for aneuploidy is recommended to couples at risk of generating chromosomally abnormal embryos. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that PGD for aneuploidy has an important role in the prognosis of subsequent treatments.A total of 389 couples underwent their first PGD for aneuploidy due to either female age >or=38 years (n = 266) or >or=3 previous unsuccessful cycles (n = 123). After the first PGD followed by an unsuccessful treatment cycle, 141 couples underwent 175 subsequent PGD cycles. These patients were divided into three groups depending on the number of euploid embryos available for transfer in their first PGD cycle: group A included patients where no euploid embryos were diagnosed group B included patients who had only one euploid embryoIn subsequent cycles, group A patients underwent significantly fewer transfers (45%) compared with group B (69%, P < 0.05) and group C patients (85%, P < 0.001). The pregnancy rate per transfer was significantly decreased in group A (15%) compared with group B (36% P < 0.02) and group C (30%The outcome of the first PGD for aneuploidy may have a predictive role for subsequent attempts.
