Likelihood ratio for trisomy 21 in fetuses with absent nasal bone at the 11-14-week scan. To update the likelihood ratio for trisomy 21 in fetuses with absent nasal bone at the 11-14-week scan.Ultrasound examination of the fetal profile was carried out and the presence or absence of the nasal bone was noted immediately before karyotyping in 5918 fetuses at 11 to 13+6 weeks. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the effect of maternal ethnic origin and fetal crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) on the incidence of absent nasal bone in the chromosomally normal and trisomy 21 fetuses.The fetal profile was successfully examined in 5851 (98.9%) cases. In 5223/5851 cases the fetal karyotype was normal and in 628 cases it was abnormal. In the chromosomally normal group the incidence of absent nasal bone was related first to the ethnic origin of the mother, being 2.2% for Caucasians, 9.0% for Afro-Caribbeans and 5.0% for Asians second to fetal CRL, being 4.7% for CRL of 45-54 mm, 3.4% for CRL of 55-64 mm, 1.4% for CRL of 65-74 mm and 1% for CRL of 75-84 mmAt the 11-14-week scan the incidence of absent nasal bone is related to the presence or absence of chromosomal defects, CRL, NT and ethnic origin.
