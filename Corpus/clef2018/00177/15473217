Perinatal outcomes with the antepartum diagnosis of cystic hygroma. To describe antenatal diagnosis and clinical outcomes of fetal cystic hygroma.Retrospective case series derived from ultrasound database. Diagnoses were made from July 2000 through January 2003.Twenty-five fetuses were identified with cystic hygroma. Median gestational age at diagnosis was 17.3 weeks. Posterior nuchal cystic hygromas accounted for 21 (84%) cases, while two (8%) were axillary, and one each in the anterior neck and buttock. Additional abnormalities were noted in twenty (80%) fetuses most common were non-immune hydrops (12/25, 48%) and cardiac defects (5/25, 20%). Eighteen patients (72%) underwent amniocentesis and ten were aneuploid. Six fetuses (25%) sustained intrauterine fetal demise and nine (38%) patients sought therapeutic termination. Nine infants (38%) were liveborn, but only six (25%) survived the neonatal period.Antenatal diagnosis of fetal cystic hygroma heralds an extremely poor perinatal prognosis. Associated abnormalities were noted in 80% of fetuses with a significant incidence of aneuploidy. Targeted ultrasonography and extensive counseling of parents is recommended.
