Full karyotyping, rapid aneuploidy diagnosis or both when invasive prenatal testing is performed for diagnosis of thalassaemia? A retrospective study was performed to compare the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities by different approaches of full karyotyping, rapid aneuploidy diagnosis (RAD) or both when invasive prenatal testing is performed for diagnosis of thalassaemia. The karyotype results of 1120 prenatal samples obtained from thalassaemia couples from January 1985 to December 2002 in a referral centre for prenatal diagnosis were studied. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities by four different approaches were compared: (i) karyotyping for all samples (ii) RAD (21,18,13,X,Y) for all samples
