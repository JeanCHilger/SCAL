Soluble amyloid-beta in the brain: the scarlet pimpernel. Researchers since the 1990s have predominantly focused on the amyloid hypothesis and the formation of amyloid fibrils as the culprit behind AD when we began working on soluble Abeta (sAbeta). Unexpectedly, this work produced several novel findings. First, we observed that N-terminal truncated peptides are the major components of soluble and insoluble Abeta in AD secondly, that all sAbeta species belong to the 42 form and the sAbeta x-40 species is virtually absent in AD parenchyma
