Retrospective diagnosis of Pallister-Killian syndrome by CGH array. We report a girl presenting with a polymalformation syndrome. Despite a normal karyotype on peripheral lymphocytes and the unavailability of cultured fibroblasts, a tetrasomy 12p was identified on pulmonary DNA extracted from a postmortem biopsy, by use of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and confirmed by CGH array. The clinical picture of our patient was consistent, but not specific of the diagnosis of Pallister-Killian syndrome. She presented with the association of antenatal polyhydramnios, craniofacial dysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, and a congenital cardiopathy.We discuss the usefulness of CGH and CGH array in prenatal and constitutional cytogenetics.
