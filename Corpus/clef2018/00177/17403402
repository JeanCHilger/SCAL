Trends in state/population-based Down syndrome screening and invasive prenatal testing with the introduction of first-trimester combined Down syndrome screening, South Australia, 1995-2005. The purpose of this study was to review trends in the us of maternal serum Down syndrome screening and invasive prenatal testing before and after the introduction of a state-based first-trimester combined Down syndrome screening program.A retrospective population-based study was performed on first- and second-trimester Down syndrome screening, invasive prenatal testing, and prenatal detection of Down syndrome from 1995 to 2005 in South Australia with data from state-based registers. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate trends.There was a significant decrease in the use of second-trimester Down syndrome maternal serum screening (from 75% in 1995 to 25% in 2005 P < .001) and a corresponding significant increase in first-trimester combined screening (from 0.8% in 2000 to 49% in 2005The introduction and increased use of first-trimester combined Down syndrome screening has been associated with more efficient use of invasive prenatal testing in South Australia and has maintained a high level of overall prenatal detection.
