Rapid prenatal diagnosis of numerical aberrations of chromosome 21 and 18 by PCR-STR method. In this study we reported the results for the first time of applying Polymerase Chain Reaction-Short Tandem Repeats (PCR-STR) method in the field of detection of aneuploidies for chromosomes 21 and 18 in Croatians. The aims of the study were: (I) validation of the diagnostic informativeness of 6 STR loci (D18S51, D18S858, D18S535, D21S1435, D21S1411, and D21S1414) in sample of 205 unrelated healthy individuals (II) evaluation of diagnostic power of the PCR-STR method for those 6 microsatellites
