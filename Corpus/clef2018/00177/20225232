First-trimester serum marker distribution in singleton pregnancies conceived with assisted reproduction. To evaluate marker distribution of free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (fbeta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in singleton pregnancies conceived by assisted reproduction techniques (ART).In vitro fertilization (IVF) (n = 203) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (n = 192) cases from a database of 14 645 first-trimester combined tests (overall study group) were selected and matched to 1164 controls for gestational age at sample date and maternal age.In the IVF group and ICSI group, lnPAPP-A was lower (IVF 6.74 vs 7.08 P = 0.0001The increase in FPR in the ART groups can be explained by decreased PAPP-A values. Therefore, an adjustment in risk analysis for Down syndrome is suggested.
