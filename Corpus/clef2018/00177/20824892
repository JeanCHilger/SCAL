Diagnostic yield by supplementing prenatal metaphase karyotyping with MLPA for microdeletion syndromes and subtelomere imbalances. The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the relevance of using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detection of selected microdeletion syndromes (22q11, Prader-Willi/Angelman, Miller-Dieker, Smith-Magenis, 1p-, Williams), the reciprocal microduplication syndromes and imbalance at the subtelomere regions of chromosomes in a routine prenatal setting.A total of 530 prenatal samples were analysed by commercial MLPA kits (SALSA P064, P036 and P069) in addition to rapid aneuploidy testing and G-band karyotyping.Among the prenatal samples with a normal metaphase karyotype, nine submicroscopic imbalances were detected: seven 22q11 deletions (Velocardiofacial/DiGeorge syndrome), one 15q11 deletion (Prader-Willi syndrome) and one terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome). All imbalances were found in amniocentesis (AC) taken due to fetal structural malformation and/or other ultrasound scan (US) detected abnormality. The diagnostic yield was 4.1% in the subgroup with structural malformation and 1.6% in the subgroup with other US abnormality.The data set substantiates that additional MLPA analyses for selected microdeletions and subtelomere imbalances are valuable in routine prenatal diagnostics, when a malformation(s) and/or other abnormalities are detected by US. In contrast, the additional MLPA analyses gave no diagnostic yield in case of increased nuchal translucency (NT).
