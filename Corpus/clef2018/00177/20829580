Prenatal diagnosis of 18q-syndrome: a case of fetal mosaicism with a normal karyotype in chorionic villi. We report a case of fetoplacental discrepancy with normal karyotype on chorionic villi and deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18 on amniotic fluid. Cytogenetic tests were repeated because of a short corpus callosum on ultrasound examination. This 18q-syndrome has been reported to be associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome.
