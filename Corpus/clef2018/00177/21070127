Role of the vascular endothelial growth factor in the inverse relationship between increased nuchal translucency thickness and fetomaternal transfusion. To elucidate the possible etiological role of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the inverse correlation between nuchal translucency (NT) thickness and fetomaternal transfusion (FMT).The level of FMT was determined prospectively in 80 viable, singleton pregnancies in which 10-14-week ultrasonographic scanning, NT thickness measurement chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for fetal karyotyping and VEGF concentration determination were performed. The grouping procedures were based either on NT thickness (<2 MoM in Group I, and ≥2 MoM in Group II), or on karyotype (euploid in Group A, and aneuploid in Group B). The level of FMT was determined via maternal serum α-fetoprotein levels before and after CVS. The FMT and the VEGF concentration of the chorionic tissue were analysed in comparisons between Groups I and II, and between Groups "A" and "B".The mean level of FMT after CVS was 72.5±21.3 μL and 19.28±5.4 μL in Groups I (n=44) and II (n=36), respectively (P<0.02). The VEGF concentration of the chorionic tissue in Groups I and II was 40.6±16.7 pg/mg protein and 21.1±6.3 pg/mg protein, respectively (P=0.28). The mean level of FMT was 57.9±15.0 μL and 8.1±3.9 μL in Groups A and B, respectively (P<0.003). The VEGF concentration of the chorionic tissue in Groups A and B was 25.9±10.7 pg/mg protein and 21.3±11.3 pg/mg protein, respectively (P=0.77).No difference exists in the VEGF concentration in the aspirated chorionic tissue between Groups I and II and between Groups A and B. A higher level of FMT was observed among the aneuploid pregnancies after CVS than among the euploid cases. Chorionic VEGF does not influence the inverse relationship between the pre-CVS NT thickness and FMT.
