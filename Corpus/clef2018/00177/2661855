Chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with omphalocele. Significance of omphalocele contents. Twenty-six consecutive fetuses with a sonographically detectable omphalocele and known karyotype were reviewed to identify risk factors that might be associated with chromosomal abnormalities. Risk factors that were analyzed included contents of the omphalocele sac, maternal age, fetal sex, sonographically detectable concurrent anomalies, and any major concurrent anomaly. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 10 cases (38%) from trisomy 18 (n = 4), trisomy 13 (n = 4), trisomy 21 (n = 1), or 45, X (n = 1). The absence of liver from the omphalocele sac (intracorporeal liver) was strongly associated with an abnormal karyotype chromosomal abnormalities were present in all 8 fetuses with an intracorporeal liver compared to 2 of 18 fetuses with an extracorporeal liver (p less than .0001, two-tailed Fisher exact test). Other risk factors that were statistically associated with chromosomal abnormalities included advanced maternal age (greater than or equal to 33 years, p = .03) and sonographically detectable concurrent malformations (p = .05). We conclude that sonographic findings can help determine the relative risk of chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses with omphalocele
