Uses of available record systems in epidemiologic studies of reproductive toxicology. The uses of available record systems in epidemiologic studies of reproductive toxicology are described with reference to New York State. The available record systems (and relevant reproductive end points) described include: a newborn screening program for metabolic diseases and hemoglobinopathies (relevant to point mutations) chromosome registries and prenatal cytogenetics (for chromosome anomalies)The uses of available record systems in epidemiologic studies of reproductive toxicology are described with reference to New York State.
