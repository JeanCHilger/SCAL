Down syndrome rates and relaxed selection at older maternal ages. Preferential survival in older mothers of fetuses with Down syndrome has been proposed as contributing to the maternal-age effect of this condition. If correct, this provocative hypothesis, which may be termed "relaxed selection," has major implications for approaches to prevention of Down syndrome live births in older women. Several predictions of this hypothesis are examined here by comparisons of parental ages among various populations. These revealed that: (1) mean maternal age of Down syndrome live births is slightly lower than that of Down syndrome spontaneous fetal deaths (2) mean maternal age of those with mutant D/21 translocation Down syndrome is about the same as that of controls
