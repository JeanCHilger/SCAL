Chromosome findings in 2,500 second trimester amniocenteses. We have analyzed the chromosome abnormalities found in 2,500 amniocenteses for prenatal diagnosis 1,887 (75%) were performed because the maternal age was 34 years or more. Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 1.80% of those referred for advanced maternal age, 1.2% between ages 34 and 39 years and 4.6% 40 years and over. Of these, four occurred in women who would have been 34 years at delivery (2.9%). Trisomy 21 accounted for 50% of the chromosome abnormalities
