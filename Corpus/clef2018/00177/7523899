Mutagenic lifestyles? A review of evidence of associations between germ-cell mutations in humans and smoking, alcohol consumption and use of 'recreational' drugs. In humans, associations between germ-cell mutations and hypothetical aetiological factors can be investigated by (1) examining the relationship between the factor of interest and conditions known to be of genetic aetiology (2) examining the relationship between conditions of unknown aetiology and route of exposure, especially paternal preconceptional exposure. As regards smoking, alcohol and 'recreational' drugs, the first approach has been applied in studies of retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour and chromosomal anomalies. Only Down's syndrome has received intensive investigation, in relation to maternal smoking during pregnancy
