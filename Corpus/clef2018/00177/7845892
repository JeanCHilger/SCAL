Second-trimester echogenic small bowel: an increased risk for adverse perinatal outcome. 2267 singleton fetuses who had one ultrasound examination between 15 and 21 weeks' gestation were prospectively evaluated for echogenic small bowel. Thirty-two cases of echogenic small bowel were detected--a prevalence of 1.4 per cent. Echogenic fetal small bowel was divided into two grades: grade 1, where the small bowel was more echogenic than the liver and grade 2, where the small bowel had the echogenicity of bone. In contrast to 19/23 fetuses with grade 1 small bowel echogenicity, only 2/9 fetuses with grade 2 echogenic bowel had a normal pregnancy outcome (Fisher's exact test
