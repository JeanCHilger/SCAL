FISH: sensitivity and specificity on sorted and unsorted cells. The results of our FISH studies of maternal samples and model systems are very encouraging. Aneuploidies have been detected prospectively, and the model experiments show that the FISH technique is both sensitive and specific. We have previously shown that the probe sets used in this study can be combined for simultaneous multicolor analysis. Given sufficient enrichment of the fetal cells, FISH analysis should prove applicable to this diagnostic challenge.
