Genetics and public health. Worldwide, genetic diseases affect no less than 5% of all newborns. Most are caused by altered genes transmitted at conception, while a lesser share are due to chromosomal abnormalities--quantitative imbalances in the genetic material leading to various disorders including Down syndrome. The impact of these pathologies is especially severe because they are typically chronic, often affect more than one child in a family, and commonly demand expensive or inaccessible therapeutic methods. Current trends indicate that the demand for health services dealing with these and other congenital defects in Latin America will continue to grow, making it imperative that health plans include strategies for providing appropriate services. The steps called for in seeking to provide such services are as follows: (1) clearly define the aims of the genetic health program (2) assess, organize, and distribute the available human and material resources
