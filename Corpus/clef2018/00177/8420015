Genetic conditions among patients receiving genetic services in middle Tennessee. We reviewed genetics charts of 2235 patients seen from 1985 to 1990 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, and summarized the 20 most common reasons for referral (occurring in 1138 of the patients) and the diagnoses or conditions among patients receiving genetic services in one of four clinical settings (prenatal counseling clinics, general genetics clinics, outreach genetics clinics, and ward consultations).
