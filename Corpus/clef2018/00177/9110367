Rare trisomy mosaicism diagnosed in amniocytes, involving an autosome other than chromosomes 13, 18, 20, and 21: karyotype/phenotype correlations. In order to determine the significance of trisomy mosaicism of an autosome other than chromosomes 13, 18, 20, and 21, 151 such cases diagnosed prenatally through amniocentesis were reviewed. These rare trisomy mosaicism cases include 54 from 17 cytogenetic laboratories, 34 from a previous North American mosaicism survey, and 63 from published reports. All were cases of true mosaicism with information available on pregnancy outcome, and with no evidence of biased ascertainment. There were 11 cases of 46/47, +2 2 of 46/47, +3
