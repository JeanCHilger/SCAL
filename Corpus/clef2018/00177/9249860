Comparison of 12 assays for detecting hCG and related molecules in urine samples from Down syndrome pregnancies. Urine is a new medium for Down syndrome testing. In an effort to determine the best type of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-related immunoassay for urine testing, we examined 14 Down syndrome and 91 unaffected pregnancy urine samples with 12 established assays. The assays included (a) those that detect hCG beta-core fragment only (b) those that detect beta-core fragment with less than 18 per cent free beta-subunit cross-reactivity
