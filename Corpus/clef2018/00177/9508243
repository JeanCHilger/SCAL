Autosomal-recessive omodysplasia: prenatal diagnosis and histomorphometric assessment of the physeal plates of the long bones. Second-semester ultrasonography of a female fetus documented short femora and humeri and dislocation of the radii. Based on the clinical and postmortem radiological findings, autosomal-recessive omodysplasia was diagnosed. The physeal plates of the long tubular bones were assessed by computer-assisted image analysis. The dimensions and orientation of the chondrocytic lacunae in the physeal plates of the omodysplastic fetus were compared with those in the physeal plates of fetuses without gross limb abnormalities (oligohydramnios, n = 2 hydrocephalus, n = 2
