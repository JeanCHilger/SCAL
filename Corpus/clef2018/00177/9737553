Attributable fraction for cardiac malformations. To the authors' knowledge, attributable fractions for cardiac malformations have not been reported before. The Baltimore-Washington Infant Study published factors associated with several major cardiac malformations in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and adjacent counties of northern Virginia in 1981-1989. For eight of these malformations, the authors provide attributable fractions of those factors that are potentially causal. Summary attributable fractions range from 13.6% (four factors) for hypoplastic left heart to 30.2% (seven factors) for transposition of great arteries with intact ventricular septum. Extra attributable fraction for factor x, defined as summary attributable fraction for all factors minus that for all but x, is largest for: 1) paternal marijuana use in transposition of great arteries with intact ventricular septum, 7.8% 2) paternal anesthesia in tetralogy of Fallot, 3.6%
