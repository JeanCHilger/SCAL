Prevalence of aneuploidy with a cardiac intraventricular echogenic focus in an at-risk patient population. The objective of this study was to determine the relative risk for aneuploidy in the presence of a cardiac intraventricular echogenic focus in a patient population at high risk for aneuploidy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients referred to a fetal diagnostic center who were undergoing amniocentesis. Records and second trimester sonograms were reviewed. Approximately 5100 comprehensive prenatal sonograms were obtained over a 2 year study period. Karyotyping by amniocentesis was done in 2412 women 84 of the karyotypes (3.5%) were abnormal. Fetuses with no ultrasonographic findings suggestive of aneuploidy had a 1.4% (28 of 1940) prevalence of significant chromosomal abnormalities. An intraventricular echogenic focus was found in 149 of the women with karyotype analysis
