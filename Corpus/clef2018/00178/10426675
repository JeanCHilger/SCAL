Use of the disutility ratio in prenatal screening for Down's syndrome. To assess the value of the triple test incorporating individual differences in parental evaluation of outcomes of pregnancy.Decision analysis.Monte Carlo simulation of triple test results in 25,000 women with a normal pregnancy and 25,000 women with a pregnancy affected by Down's syndrome.A decision model was developed for women who were 16 weeks pregnant. Three strategies were evaluated: 1. no prenatal testing 2. amniocentesisThe outcomes considered were: 1. birth of a child without Down's syndrome 2. birth of a child with Down's syndromeThe value of the triple test depends strongly on maternal age as well as on the individual evaluation of the outcome of pregnancy. The triple test is of considerable value for all women > 38 years its value for women between 27 and 38 years depends on the disutility ratio, and it is of little value for women < 27 years.The value of the triple test depends on the parental evaluation of outcome of pregnancy for a large group of pregnant women. The disutility ratio, as introduced in this study, might be an instrument to elicit these values for individual women in clinical practice.
