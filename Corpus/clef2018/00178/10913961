Analysis of chromosome abnormalities in sperm and embryos from two 45,XY,t(1314)(q10 Robertsonian translocation t(13q14q) is studied in sperm and embryos of two couples undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in which both males are carriers of the translocation. It is already known that the chances of achieving pregnancy for a translocation carrier are directly linked to the number of normal or balanced embryos available for replacement. In our work it was found that the frequency of balanced spermatozoa was almost identical in both patients (74 and 77%), and after PGD, the frequencies of abnormal embryos caused by the translocation were also similar. Sperm chromosome analysis in translocation carriers can provide a reasonable basis for estimating a baseline of chromosome abnormalities to be found in embryos during an assisted reproductive cycle. However, individual factors not linked to the translocation can also produce other chromosome abnormalities (mosaicism, haploidy, polyploidy) and may compromise the chances of achieving a viable pregnancy.
