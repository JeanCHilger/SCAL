Trisomy 21: 91% detection rate using second-trimester ultrasound markers. To examine cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prenatal ultrasound markers and determine which markers physicians of varying skill levels could use to identify fetuses with trisomy 21.Eighty second-trimester fetuses with trisomy 21 and 2000 controls underwent real-time plus color Doppler examination of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular systems followed by amniocentesis. Non-cardiac markers were central nervous system malformations (CNS) choroid plexus cysts (CPC)All but three markers (CPC, MR, OFT) contributed significantly to the identification of 91% of fetuses with trisomy 21 with a false-positive rate of 14%. When only non-cardiovascular markers were examined, all but CPC contributed to the identification of 60% of fetuses with trisomy 21 with a false-positive rate of 5.9%. Combining right-to-left chamber disproportion with CNS, NSF, HB and PY identified 75% of fetuses with trisomy 21 with a false-positive rate of 6.4%. All markers were independent predictors of trisomy 21 except RL and NSF.Ultrasound can detect between 60 and 91% of fetuses with trisomy 21 depending upon which markers are selected for evaluation.
