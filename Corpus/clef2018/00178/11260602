Interphase FISH with chromosome-specific protelomere probes for rapid prenatal diagnosis in a reciprocal translocation carrier. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis has become an accepted practice for rapid preliminary analysis of chromosome aneuploidy from direct amniocyte preparations. The use of dual-color interphase FISH analysis with chromosome-specific protelomere probes for the rapid exclusion of chromosomally unbalanced segregants in the pregnancy of a reciprocal translocation carrier is reported. Amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation on the carrier of a t(514)(p14.2
