Low-level sex chromosome mosaicism in female partners of couples undergoing ICSI therapy does not significantly affect treatment outcome. There is an increased rate of chromosomal anomalies, in particular low-level sex chromosome mosaicism, in the female partners of couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).Among 811 consecutive couples presenting for pre-ICSI chromosome analysis, chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 54 individuals, of which 26 were low-level sex chromosome mosaicism in the females. Attention was focused on the treatment course and outcome of ICSI in 20 couples with low-level sex chromosome mosaicism in the females actually embarking on ICSI treatment (group I, n = 38 ICSI treatment cycles). Applying a case-control design, each of the 20 couples was matched according to female age and source of spermatozoa to couples without a chromosomal abnormality in either of the partners (group II, n = 38 ICSI treatment cycles).No significant differences were found between the groups in ovarian response, fertilization rate and number of embryos transferred. Pregnancy rates, as well as implantation and abortion rates did not differ significantly between the groups.The data suggest that low-level sex chromosome mosaicism in females has no major effect on the course and outcome of ICSI.
