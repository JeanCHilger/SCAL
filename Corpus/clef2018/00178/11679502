Robertsonian translocations--reproductive risks and indications for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Robertsonian translocations carry reproductive risks that are dependent on the chromosomes involved and the sex of the carrier. We describe five couples that presented for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).PGD was carried out using cleavage-stage (day 3) embryo biopsy, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with locus-specific probes, and day 4 embryo transfer.Couple A (45,XX,der(1421)(q10For fertile couples, careful risk assessment and genetic counselling should precede consideration for PGD. Where translocation couples need assisted conception for subfertility, PGD is a valuable screen for imbalance, even when the risk of viable chromosome abnormality is low.
