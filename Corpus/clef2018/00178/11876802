The fetal mandible: a 2D and 3D sonographic approach to the diagnosis of retrognathia and micrognathia. To define parameters that enable the objective diagnosis of anomalies of the position and/or size of the fetal mandible in utero.Fetuses at 18-28 gestational weeks were examined by two- and three-dimensional ultrasound. The study included normal fetuses and fetuses with syndromes associated with known mandible pathology: Pierre Robin sequence or complex (n = 8) hemifacial microsomia (Treacher-Collins syndrome, n = 3)In normal fetuses, the inferior facial angle was constant over the time span studied. The mean (standard deviation) value of the inferior facial angle was 65.5 (8.13) degree. Consequently, an inferior facial angle value below 49.2 degree (mean - 2 standard deviations) defined retrognathism. All the fetuses with syndromes associated with mandible pathology had inferior facial angle values below the cut-off value. Using 49.2 degree or the rounded-up value of 50 degree as a cut-off point, the inferior facial angle had a sensitivity of 1.0, a specificity of 0.989, a positive predictive value of 0.750 and a negative predictive value of 1.0 to predict retrognathia. In normal fetuses, the mandible width/maxilla width ratio was constant over the time interval studied. The mean (standard deviation) value was 1.017 (0.116). Consequently, a mandible width/maxilla width ratio < 0.785 defined micrognathism. Mandible width/maxilla width ratio values were below this cut-off point in eight and in the normal range in four fetuses with syndromes associated with mandible pathology.Retrognathia and micrognathia are conditions that can be separately assessed. The use of inferior facial angle and mandible width/maxilla width ratio should help sonographic recognition and characterization of fetal retrognathic and micrognathic mandibles in utero.
