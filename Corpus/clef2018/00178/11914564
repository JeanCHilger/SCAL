Second-trimester maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein a and inhibin a levels in fetal trisomies. The aim of this study was to determine whether fetal trisomy is associated with altered levels of second-trimester maternal pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and inhibin A.Maternal serum PAPP-A and inhibin A concentrations were measured at 15-17 weeks of gestation in 14 singleton pregnancies with fetal trisomy and in 56 matched pregnant controls.PAPP-A levels in the trisomy group were significantly lower than in controls. The inhibin A level with fetal trisomy 21 was slightly higher than the control group, but levels were not different between trisomies 18 and 13 and controls.Fetal trisomies 21, 18, and 13 are associated with a reduction in second-trimester maternal PAPP-A levels trisomies 18 and 13 are not associated with increased inhibin A levels, unlike trisomy 21.
