Judgment, 15 December 1989. In France, the plaintiff spouses brought an action against the defendant medical laboratory after the wife gave birth to a child suffering from Down's Syndrome.  The laboratory had analyzed the results of an amniocentesis performed on the wife during the pregnancy and stated incorrectly that the fetus was not afflicted with Down's Syndrome.  The court ruled that the laboratory had been negligent in not warning the couple that there was a small chance that the test results would be incorrect. It held that the couple had suffered damage in not being able to abort the fetus and awarded them lump-sum damages of 45,000 francs as well as a 7,500 franc monthly payment for the upkeep of the child until it died.  The court also held that provisions of French law allowing abortions did not conflict with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to life of all persons. It concluded that the Convention does not confer on the fetus a right to be born.
