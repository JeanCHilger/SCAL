Paternal alcohol exposure and Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy that occurs as a result of a non-disjunctional error in meiosis I or anaphase lag however, the aetiology of this disorder remains unknown. Anecdotal evidence suggests that paternal alcoholism may play an unidentified role in the aetiology of TS. Accordingly, the primary objective of this study was to determine the potential association between paternal alcohol exposure and TS.The questionnaire was designed to solicit information about the parents' health and lifestyle habits occurring 1 year prior to and throughout the pregnancy of their daughter with TS. Alcohol dependence was assessed by the Brief Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (BMAST). The study population was solicited from the Turner's Syndrome Society of Canada and included any parent(s) having a child with TS who was of any age.

Six of the fathers (3.6% n = 166) and six of the mothers (3.6%Our study has suggested there is no association between paternal or maternal alcohol consumption and TS.
