The effect of image size on nuchal translucency measurement. To assess the effect of altering image size on the absolute nuchal translucency (NT) measurement.NT was measured at three image magnifications (60%, 100% and 200%) in 120 singleton pregnancies.The mean +/- SD NT measurements were 1.52 +/- 0.57 mm, 1.35 +/- 0.53 mm and 1.18 +/- 0.48 mm at 60%, 100% and 200% magnification, respectively (p = 0.00001).The measurement of NT decreases significantly with increasing image size. Optimisation of NT as a method of screening will require agreed standardisation of image magnification.
