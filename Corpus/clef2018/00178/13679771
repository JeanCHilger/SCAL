Colon cancer in pregnancy. Colon cancers arise only rarely in the course of a pregnancy. Yet colon obstruction, perforation and metastatic spread seem to occur more frequently in this setting than with the average colon cancer. Perhaps this is due to the immunotolerance which accompanies pregnancy. No case of epidermoid (squamous cell) cancer of the colon has been previously described in a pregnant woman. This conjunction has a catastrophic prognosis: the diagnosis of colon tumor is delayed since symptoms are masked by the pregnancy, and epidermoid colon cancer is a particularly aggressive lesion. A major sub-diaphragmatic surgical procedure can be performed with reasonable safety to mother and fetus. Radiotherapy is contraindicated. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy can be administered although the risks to the fetus are not well known. During the first trimester, a therapeutic abortion can be proposed to optimise the treatment of the mother. During the second and third trimesters, treatment of the mother exposes the fetus to the risk of malformations or premature delivery delay in maternal treatment in hopes of prolonging the pregnancy in order to obtain a viable neonate diminish the chances of maternal survival.
