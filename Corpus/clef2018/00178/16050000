Ethnic variation of fetal nasal bone length between 11-14 weeks' gestation. We sought to compare the fetal nasal bone length (FNBL) between different ethnic groups at 11-14 weeks' gestation.FNBL and the FNBL/CRL ratio were measured in patients undergoing first trimester ultrasound for nuchal translucency (NT) and the ethnicity of the patient was recorded under four categories: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Chinese.Two hundred and one patients were included in the study. Measurement of the FNBL could not be obtained in nine patients (4.5%) and foetal nasal bone was absent in one fetus. Comparing the four groups, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian, there were no statistical differences in crown-rump length (61 +/- 14 mm 68.6 +/- 15 mmIf the FNBL is to be introduced into first-trimester screening, it should be adjusted for ethnicity.
