Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome due to 11p15.5 paternal duplication associated with Klinefelter syndrome and a "de novo" pericentric inversion of chromosome Y. We report on an infant who had been prenatally diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome associated with a "de novo" pericentric inversion of the Y chromosome. A re-evaluation at 3 years of age suggested that he was also affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Karyotype was repeated and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis revealed trisomy for 11p15.5-->11pter and a distal monosomy 18q (18q23-->qter). Parental cytogenetic studies showed that the father carried a balanced cryptic translocation between chromosomes 11p and 18q. Furthermore, the child had an extra X chromosome and a "de novo" structural abnormality of chromosome Y. Thus, his karyotype was 47,XX, inv (Y) (p11.2 q11.23), der(18) t (1118) (p15.5
