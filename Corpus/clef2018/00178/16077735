Forty-two supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) in 43,273 prenatal samples: chromosomal distribution, clinical findings, and UPD studies. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed on supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) detected in 43,273 prenatal diagnoses over a period of 11 years, 1993-2003. A total of 42 pregnancies with SMC were identified, indicating a prevalence of one in 1032. A total of 15 SMCs were endowed with detectable euchromatin (prevalence, 1/2884), including six SMCs containing the cat eye critical region (CECR) on chromosome 22q11.21 (1/7212). De novo SMCs were found in 29 pregnancies (1/1492), including 14 euchromatic SMCs (48.2%). Follow-up studies were available for 24 cases. Nine pregnancies (37.5%) were terminated two children (8.3%) were born with Pallister-Killian syndrome and cat eye syndrome (CES), respectively
