Preimplantation genetic diagnosis reduces pregnancy loss in women aged 35 years and older with a history of recurrent miscarriages. To determine whether preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and transfer of euploid embryos would decrease spontaneous abortion rates in recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients.Controlled clinical study.In vitro fertilization centers and PGD reference laboratory.Recurrent-miscarriage patients with three or more prior lost pregnancies with no known etiology.Biopsy of a single blastomere from each day 3 embryo, followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis.The rate of spontaneous abortions in RM subjects undergoing PGD were compared with [1] their own a priori expectations and [2] a comparison group of women undergoing PGD for advanced maternal age (> or =35 years).Before PGD, RM patients had lost 87% (262/301) of their pregnancies, with an expected loss rate of 36.5%. After, they only lost 16.7% pregnancies. This difference was mostly due to reduction in pregnancy loss in the > or =35-years age subgroup, to 12% from an expected 44.5%.Preimplantation genetic diagnosis aneuploidy screening has a beneficial effect on pregnancy outcome in RM couples, especially those in which the woman is aged > or =35 years. Our data indicate that PGD reduces the risk of miscarriage in RM patients to baseline levels.
