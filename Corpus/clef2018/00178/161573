Pericentric inversions: studies in 47 cases. The authors report 47 cases of pericentric inversion. Eleven of them involve the chromosomes No. 2, 11 and 9. It appears that the risk of malformations and/or encephalopathy is obviously increased either by "position effect", aneusomie de recombinaison" or "interchromosomal effect". Prenatal diagnosis is therefore indicated. Thirty six cases involve the secondary constriction of chromosome No. 9. In such cases the risk is not enough increased to justify the prenatal diagnosis.
