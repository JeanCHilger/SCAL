Prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis: first 1,000 successful cases. From February 1969 to August 1976, we studied 1,048 amniotic fluids. Of these, 958 (91.4%) were primarily for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. Cytogenetic studies were attempted in 1,021 cases the diagnosis was successful in 1,000 of these. The failure rate of obtaining a diagnosis from the amniotic fluid cell culture of the first amniocentesis was 5% (50 cases)
