First trimester screening for Down syndrome in multiple pregnancy. The incidence of twins, triplets, and high-order multiples has increased substantially in the last two decades secondary to fertility treatments and to delayed childbearing. Prenatal diagnosis in these patients is challenging. Options for screening tests are limited. First trimester screening for Down syndrome in patients with multiples appears promising. This paper will review the advantages of first trimester screening in this high-risk patient population.
