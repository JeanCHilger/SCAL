Proteomic analysis of amniotic fluid in pregnancies with Down syndrome. Proteomic analysis is widely used for the detection of diagnostic markers. In the present study amniotic fluid supernatants (AFS) from pregnancies with Down syndrome (DS) fetuses and from chromosomally normal fetuses in the 17th week of gestation were analyzed by 2-DE. Gel comparison revealed significant differences in the two groups. Spots with different expression levels were excised and proteins were identified by MALDI-MS and nano-ESI-MS/MS. Splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 4 (SFRS4 Q08170) was present only in AFS from DS fetuses and completely absent in the control group. Quantitative differences were detected for alpha-1-microglobulin (AMBP
