Co-occurrence of birth defects and intellectual disability. This study used population-based databases to ascertain birth defects and intellectual disability (ID), defined as full IQ < 70, in children born in Western Australia during 1980-99. Of the children surviving to 1 year (n = 474 285), 4.9% had birth defects and 1.3% ID. ID was identified in 7.9% of children with birth defects. After adjusting for sex, mother's age, race, parity, plurality, birthweight and gestational age the prevalence ratio (PR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for ID in children with birth defects compared with those with no birth defects was 7.6 [7.2, 8.0]. Those with chromosomal anomalies comprised 3.2% of the group with birth defects. The percentage ID (and PR [95% CI]) in specific categories were: Down's syndrome 97% (84.5 [79.4, 90.0]), sex chromosome anomalies 30.3% (31.0 [23.8, 40.3]), other chromosomal anomalies 64.2% (54.2 [47.2, 62.3]). Birth defects were categorised according to system in the 96.8% of children with non-chromosomal anomalies. The percentage with ID (and PR [95% CI]) for birth defects in each system were: spina bifida 18.8 (16.7 [12.2, 23.0]) nervous (except spina bifida) 38.6 (33.4 [30.3, 36.9])
