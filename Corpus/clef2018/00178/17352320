Management of twin pregnancy. The epidemic of multiple pregnancies continues albeit in a different form with twin pregnancies predominating. Determination of chorionicity is the key to management and regular monitoring by ultrasound is a hallmark of quality care. All multiple pregnancies should be offered first trimester screening by nuchal translucency for aneuploidy. Monochorial twins should be scanned at fortnightly intervals to allow complications such as twin-twin transfusion or IUGR to be detected and referral made to a fetal medicine centre.
