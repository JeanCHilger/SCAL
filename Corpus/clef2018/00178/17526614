The value of repeated evaluation after initial failed nuchal translucency measurement. The purpose of this study was to assess the value of reattempting the nuchal translucency (NT) measurement after an initial failure.Women undergoing NT measurements by NT-certified sonographers within a combined screening program over an 18-month period were categorized as "desiring" screening (all women), "eligible" (live fetus with crown-rump length of 45-84 mm), and "defaulters" (failed to keep a visit after a failed NT measurement attempt). If the NT measurement was unobtainable, patients with live fetuses and a crown-rump length of less than 84 mm were offered reexamination.Nuchal translucency measurement success rates at the initial visit for those desiring (n = 837) and eligible (n = 767) were 73.3% and 80.0%, respectively. Composite NT measurement success rates for up to 3 visits were significantly greater than for only 1 visit for those desiring screening (84.8% P < .0001), eligible for screening (86.6%Reattempting NT measurements significantly increases the overall NT measurement success rate and detects additional aneuploidies at constant screen-positive and invasive prenatal diagnosis rates.
