Parents' perspectives on the unforeseen finding of a fetal sex chromosomal aneuploidy. To investigate the parental perspectives of being confronted with an unforeseen fetal sex chromosomal aneuploidy (SCA), in light of the fact that this accidental finding is avoidable by rapid aneuploidy detection (RAD).Exploratory qualitative interview study. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with parents who decided to continue pregnancy after the unforeseen finding of a fetal SCA.The communication of the unforeseen finding of SCA the informed decision-making process concerning the pregnancy follow-up and the child and its future were the extracted themes. Parents were not prepared to accidental findings in routine prenatal diagnostics. All started an unguided search on the Internet. It is not at all clear whether parents have preference for an RAD test with X and Y probes Parents were satisfied with the post-test professional information they received to make an informed decision, whereas after birth questions still remained to be answered.Parents' perspectives may serve as major contributors to research on the question whether or not the X and Y probes should be standard included for purposes of RAD. The fact that RAD has the possibility to avoid accidental findings of SCAs, brings up the question whether any benefits outweigh the potential harms.
