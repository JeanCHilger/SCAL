A familial polymorphic variant of chromosome 5. Two male fetuses and their mothers, referred for amniocentesis because of high levels of AFP in their blood, were found to carry an anomalous chromosome 5 with a large heterochromatic segment in the long arm. One of the fetuses had an additional ring chromosome.
