The modern indications for abortion (author's transl). Within the Swiss legal code, somatic and psychiatric indications for interruption of pregnancy are very well indicated and codified.  These days, however, only 8% of indications for abortion are based on purely medical reasons the great majority of indications are "modern", a clear manifestation of a slipping away from classical indications toward a much more liberal intervention which often has nothing to do with the corporal integrity of the mother, but with that of the child, or which simply takes into consideration the future quality of life of everybody involved.  This evolution is a reflection of the new role of women in society, and also the result of the recent progresses of the science of neonatology.  Such enlarged indications for abortion are accepted by most doctors concerned with these problems, and they include such different reasons as IUD failure, hormonal contraception failure, very young or too old age, exposure to X-rays, divorce and exposure to chemotherapy.
