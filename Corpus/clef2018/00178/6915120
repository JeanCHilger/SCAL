Fetal diagnosis and medical ethics. The remarkable progress and development made in perinatal medicine accompanied the question of medical ethics surrounding fetal diagnosis.  One such example was a 40-year old American woman who requested fetal diagnosis for early detection of a possible case of Down's syndrome.  Ultrasonic diagnosis identified dizygotic twins.  The results of amniocentesis performed on 2 fetuses separately showed 1 fetus to be normal and the other to have Down's syndrome.  After discussing with the patient and her family, the doctor decided to terminate the life of the fetus with Down's syndrome by piercing its heart with the aid of ultrasonography.  Consequently only 1 normal healthy baby was born at fullterm.  This case was subject to controversy because of the basic human right of the fetus with chromosome aberration involved, although abortion performed at the request of parents in such cases was legal in the US.  In Japan legalized abortion does not accommodate fetal condition but solely maternal condition at the moment, but sooner or later we shall have to face the same question of medical ethics in connection with fetal diagnosis.  We shall have to deal with each case individually with extreme caution because of its social implications.
