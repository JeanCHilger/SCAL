First trimester fetal nuchal translucency. This review examines the development of a new method of screening for Down's syndrome based on the combination of fetal nuchal translucency thickness, maternal age and maternal serum biochemistry at 10-14 weeks of gestation. This method can potentially identify more than 80% of affected fetuses for a false-positive rate of less than 5%.
