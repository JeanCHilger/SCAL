Adjustment formulae for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated oestriol to maternal weight and smoking. Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and unconjugated oestriol (uE3) were measured in serum samples of 4131 non-smoking and 1018 smoking women during the second trimester of pregnancy. The levels of all three analytes decreased with increasing body weight. The AFP median was significantly increased in smokers in a dose-response association hCG decreased by 21 per cent and uE3 decreased by 3 per cent in smokers in a non-dose-related fashion. Regression functions for adjustment of serum levels for weight and smoking should be considered in risk estimation for Down syndrome in order to give a woman's individual risk more precisely.
