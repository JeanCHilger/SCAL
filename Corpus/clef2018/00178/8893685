Preimplantation embryo chromosome analysis by primed in situ labeling method. To present the use of primed in situ labeling method in preimplantation diagnosis.Double- and triple-primed in situ labeling were performed on 10 morphologically abnormal preimplantation embryos, using combinations of specific primers for chromosomes 9, 13, 16, 18, 21, X, and Y.Embryos were obtained from patients at the Montpellier University Hospital.Seven women undergoing IVF at the Montpellier University Hospital.Isolated interphase nuclei from poor quality preimplantation embryos were prepared for primed in situ labeling technique.Numerical abnormalities assessed by primed in situ labeling analysis.Using directly fluorescent-labeled nucleotides, the labeling reaction for three chromosomes did not exceed 2.30 hours. Only three analyzed embryos appeared to be chromosomally normal. Mosaicism, aneupoidy, and haploidy were observed in the seven other embryos.The primed in situ labeling method offers a simple and reliable screening tool for gender determination and aneuploidy detection. The use of this technique may contribute to significantly improve the procedure of preimplantation diagnosis.
