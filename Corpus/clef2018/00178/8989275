The maternal insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and IGF-binding protein response to trisomic pregnancy during the first trimester: a possible diagnostic tool for trisomy 18 pregnancies. Many lines of evidence point to an important role for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in embryonic and fetal growth in human pregnancy. The bioavailability of IGFs is modulated by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6), whose permissive or inhibitory actions are regulated in part by posttranslational modification. In second and third trimester pregnancies, maternal IGFBP-1 is elevated in preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. In the first trimester, trisomic pregnancies result in derangement of maternal serum levels of peptides, including hCG beta and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A. Trisomy 18 is characterized by growth failure in the first trimester, whereas trisomy 21 is not thus, if maternal serum levels of IGFs and IGFBPs reflect fetal growth, changes specific to trisomy 18 may be expected. We report maternal serum levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-1,-2, and -3
