Combining ultrasound and biochemistry in first-trimester screening for Down's syndrome. Data on pregnancies with and without Down's syndrome between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy were used to determine the performance of combined ultrasound and biochemical markers in prenatal screening for Down's syndrome. We used three datasets: one published by Pandya et al. (1995) on nuchal translucency measurement in 86 Down's syndrome pregnancies one published by Wald et al. (1996a) on free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) in 77 affected pregnancies and 385 unaffected pregnancies
