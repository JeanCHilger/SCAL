Biochemical markers of trisomy 21 and the pathophysiology of Down's syndrome pregnancies. Using biochemical and immunocytochemical methods, we have investigated endogenous levels of various markers in tissues obtained from 67 Down's syndrome pregnancies after therapeutic abortion in the second trimester and in corresponding tissues from unaffected abortuses. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), intact and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), pregnancy-specific beta-1 glycoprotein (SP-1), placental alkaline phosphatase (PALP), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were investigated in placental tissue AFP and GGT in fetal liver
