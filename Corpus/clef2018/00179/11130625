Effect of maternal smoking and coffee consumption on the risk of having a recognized Down syndrome pregnancy. To evaluate the possible effects of maternal smoking and caffeine or coffee consumption on the occurrence of a recognized pregnancy with Down syndrome, the authors analyzed data from a case-control study of 997 liveborn infants or fetuses with Down syndrome ascertained in California from 1991 to 1993 and 1,007 liveborn controls without a birth defect. Interviews with mothers covered demographic information, pregnancy, and medical history, with detailed questions on the use of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages. All analyses were age-adjusted. High alcohol consumption (> or =4 drinks/week) in the first month of pregnancy was associated with reduced risk for a recognized Down syndrome conceptus (odds ratio (OR) = 0.54 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34, 0.85). Maternal smoking during the periconceptional period was not associated with risk of recognized Down syndrome (OR = 1.04
