The single umbilical artery in a high-risk patient population: what should be offered? To determine whether fetal echocardiography is warranted in cases of single umbilical artery in a population at risk for aneuploidy.All cases of fetal single umbilical artery identified over a 2-year period were reviewed for other sonographically detected abnormalities, fetal echocardiographic results, and karyotype.Sixty-five cases of single umbilical artery were diagnosed on the basis of initial sonograms. Five were subsequently shown to have 3-vessel cords (8% false-positive diagnosis incidence, 1.2%). Excluding 3 from twin gestations, 57 cases formed the study population. Thirty-one fetuses (54%) were initially thought to have isolated single umbilical arteries, and 26 (46%) had nonisolated single umbilical arteries. Fetal echocardiography was performed in 29 cases (51%), 24 (83%) with normal findings and 5 (17%) with abnormal findings. Four (50%) of 8 nonisolated single umbilical arteries had abnormal echocardiographic findings versus 1 (5%) of 21 apparently isolated single umbilical arteries (P < .05The rate of cardiac malformations seen with apparently isolated single umbilical arteries is significant, and fetal echocardiography should be performed.
