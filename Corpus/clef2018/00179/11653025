The choices women make about prenatal diagnosis. Despite the rapid advancement and increasing utilization of prenatal diagnostic technologies, there has been a paucity of investigation into the psychological, socioeconomic, and demographic features associated with the choices women make about both the uptake of services, and the actions taken after fetal abnormalities are discovered. From 1986 through 1991 we have completed four studies initiating a proposed comprehensive evaluation of these factors. The first two studies concentrated on patient features influencing uptake of prenatal diagnostic procedures in both a priori 'high risk' pregnancies (advanced maternal age) as well as in previously 'low risk' pregnancies which had become 'high risk' by virtue of abnormal maternal alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening. The second two studies evaluated features influencing abortion decisions after the discovery of either chromosomal anomalies, or non-aneuploid ultrasonographically detected structural abnormalities. Data suggested that (1) older and more highly educated women tended to choose CVS over amniocentesis (2) perceptions of genetic risk within couples was most influenced by attributes of their partners
