Pregnancy after 34 years: risks and evolution of risks. A study of the risks of late pregnancy for mothers and their children indicates that there is still excess risk for mothers over age 35 but the difference is decreasing relative to the general population.  National surveys of pregnancy and delivery conducted in France in 1976 and 1981 were the major source of data, supplemented by records of women giving birth in the Clinic Baudelocque, a university clinic in Paris, and by foreign data.  Maternal mortality in France among women 35 and over declined from 71.7/100,000 in 1975 to 39.6/100,000 in 1983, at the same time that maternal mortality in the general population declined from 19.9 to 15.5/100,000.  The risk of mortality for mothers over 34 was 3.6 times higher in 1975 and 2.6 times higher in 1983 than for the general population.  In a series of 3858 pregnancies overall and 544 among women over 34, the rates of hypertension were 9.2% for all mothers and 12.3% for older mothers, while the rate for diabetes was 1.1% for all mothers and 2.4% for older mothers.  Rates of proteinuria and urinary infection were about the same for the 2 groups.  Rates of stillbirth in 1983 were 13.0/1000 for children of mothers 35 and over 7.6/1000 for the population at large.  The frequency of trisomy 21 is very closely related to age, but the excess risk due to age is declining as result of more frequent antenatal diagnosis among older mothers.  By 1976, the risk of prematurity of low birth weight was almost the same for infants of older mothers as for the population at large.  Rates of prematurity were 5.6% for the general population and 5.9% for older mothers, while rates of birth weight under 2500 g were 5.2% for the general population and 5.6% for older mothers.  The number of prenatal visits increased more for mothers over 34 years old than for the general population between 1976-81 in 1981, 46.4% of older mothers but only 32.3% of the general population had more than 7 prenatal consultations.  The proportion of older mothers in the labor force and with university education increased considerably between 1976-81.  2 factors appear to have played a role in the improved health of older mothers and their children, improved prenatal surveillance and changes in the characteristics of the older mothers themselves.  Data for England indicate that risk of prenatal mortality varies as a function of the father's occupation.  The excess risk for infants of older mothers in England tends to disappear for children of the highest social classes.
