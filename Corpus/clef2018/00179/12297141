Detection of mosaicism in lymphocytes of parents of free trisomy 21 offspring. Down syndrome (DS) resulting from free trisomy 21 (FT21) has been largely associated with advanced maternal age. However, approximately 60% of FT21 cases are born to young couples. Thus, the etiological factors responsible for these FT21 children must differ from those proposed for maternal age-related FT21. These factors have not been defined. In this study, we analyzed the chromosomes of peripheral blood lymphocytes from three groups of couples aged < or =35 years, to identify chromosomal trisomies: Group I included 5 couples with normal offspring Group II included 22 couples with one FT21 child
