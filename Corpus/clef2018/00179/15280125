The changing face of gastroschisis and omphalocele in southeast Georgia. To document trends in the clinical characteristics of gastroschisis and omphalocele in southeast Georgia, USA, from 1994 to 2002.All babies with an abdominal wall defect in a 19-county region were referred to one Perinatal Center for genetic counseling, level II ultrasound scans, pregnancy follow-up and delivery. Karyotyping was offered for omphalocele, advanced maternal age, family history predisposing to aneuploidy, and gastroschisis with an additional anomaly.There were 64 patients, 34 with gastroschisis and 30 with omphalocele. From 1994 to 2002, the birth prevalence of gastroschisis was 1:3600 and omphalocele 1:3400, but from 2000 to 2002, gastroschisis increased to 1:1667, while omphalocele increased to only 1:2709. Gender distribution was different: for gastroschisis the M:F ratio was 1:2.1 for omphalocele the ratio was 1.7:1. In the patients with omphalocele, 90% had an amniocentesis and 9/27 were aneuploid: five had trisomy 18, three had trisomy 13 and one had trisomy 21. Seventy-six per cent of the patients with omphalocele had associated anomalies, but only 17.6% of those with gastroschisis. Mothers whose babies had gastroschisis showed a trend to progressively younger age, while no such trend was observed among mothers whose babies had omphalocele.The birth prevalence of abdominal wall defects in general is increasing, but more notably for gastroschisis. Maternal age continues to decrease for gastroschisis. In the study population, gender distribution showed a statistically significant variation between the defects.
