The significance of screening tests for aneuploidies in populations at low and high maternal-age-related risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of the triple test and the screen test in maternal populations at low and high maternal-age-related risk for fetal aneuploidy.As a whole, 9,680 pregnant women at low risk and 627 at high risk underwent the triple test 2,780 pregnant women at low risk and 408 at high risk underwent the screen or combined testThe triple test showed a detection rate of 75% in the low and 83.3% in the high risk population with a difference (P<0.003) for detection of trisomies 21 and 18 between the 2 populations the screen test had a detection rates of 100% and 90% in the 2 populations, respectively, with a difference (P<0.005) between the 2 tests.Both tests are reliable for screening aneuploidies in the low risk population, the screen test having better performance in the high risk population, the number of invasive procedures can be reduced by 78% with the triple test and by 84% with the screen test.
