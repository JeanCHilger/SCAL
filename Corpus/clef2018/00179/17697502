Candidate epigenetic biomarkers for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. This report describes the first identification and characterization of three chromosome-21-specific DNA sequences (and reference sequences from other chromosomes) that are differentially methylated between peripheral blood and placental tissue, with the aim of providing epigenetic biomarkers for quantifying cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma. To select sequences to be screened for differential methylation, three strategies were adopted: (i) investigating promoters of highly differentially expressed genes (ii) choosing 'random' promoter regions
