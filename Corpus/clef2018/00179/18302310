First-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome: prediction of low birth weight, small for gestational age and pre-term delivery in a cohort of non-selected women. To establish the relationship between the first-trimester screening markers [pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), free human chorionic gonadotrophin-beta (beta-hCG), nuchal translucency (NT)], the Down syndrome (DS) risk estimate, and the adverse outcomes such as low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA) and pre-term delivery.A retrospective cohort study including 1,734 non-selected singleton pregnancies consecutively enrolled into the programme of first-trimester combined screening for DS in a 12-month period at a single centre. Data from the Prenatal Patient Registry in ASTRAIA were combined with the Danish National Newborn Screening Registry and Danish Birth Registry.There was a significant relation between low PAPP-A MoM, low beta-hCG MoM, increased risk estimate for DS and low birth weight and SGA. Low PAPP-A MoM and increased NT showed a significant relation to pre-term and spontaneous pre-term delivery. Low PAPP-A MoM showed a significant relation to early pre-term delivery.First-trimester screening markers exhibited a significant relation to low birth weight, SGA and to some extent, to pre-term and early pre-term delivery. The screening performance of individual markers was poor.
