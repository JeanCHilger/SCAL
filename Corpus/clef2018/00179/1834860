Sonographic recognition of major malformations and aberrant fetal growth in trisomic fetuses. Structural malformations and growth retardation are commonly observed in chromosomally abnormal newborns. This study assesses the sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting aberrant fetal growth patterns and chromosome-related major malformations. The study population consisted of 74 trisomic fetuses (trisomy 13, 9 trisomy 18, 22
