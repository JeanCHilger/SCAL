The important role of secondary prevention of congenital defects in decreasing early fetal losses in the Czech Republic in 1989. The secondary prevention (SP) of congenital defects (CDs) is an unplanned factor in infant mortality.  The department of medical genetics (DMGs) is the tool for achieving the possible lowest mortality of infants by such unplanned measures.  However, the functioning of this service is seriously limited by the insufficient number of workers and technical equipment.  For instance, in 1987 in Prague there were 6.9 medical genetics positions/1 million inhabitants and in other provinces as low as 1/1 million, averaging 3.2 in the Czech Republic.  85% of these positions are filled in Prague and only 12% in Southern Moravia, averaging 40%.  The situation is similar with positions requiring higher education and middle-level education.  73% and 99%, respectively, of these are filled in Prague vs. 12% and 21%, respectively, in the Northern Czech province.  Starting in 1985, an SP effort made strides against early losses of infants, and perinatal mortality decreased to under 10/1000.  By 1990, at least 270-280 defective births of fetuses were prevented, a rate of 9.4/1000, close to the European peak.  DMGs screened abnormal phenotypes starting 1985 there were 67 such SP cases equaling .49/1000 live births.  In 1987, the number was 115 or .88/1000 neonates.  By 1989, it was 209 or 1.63/1000.  Out of the 209 aborted fetuses there were 42 anencephalic, 38 sublethal defects of the central nervous system, 20 sublethal and lethal defects of the urinary system, 13 cases of omphalocele, 30 cases of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and 26 aneuploids.  Out of 128,356 births in 1989 there were 209 unborn fetuses or a rate of 1.63/1000.  At least 120 but more than 140 of these would have been born dead or died, within hours or within a few days after birth producing a rate of .94-1.09/1000.  Without DMGs, prenatal mortality in 1989 would have been 10.3 or 10.4/1000 instead of 9.4/1000.
