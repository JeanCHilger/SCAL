Inheritance of a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 16 in a family with recurrent miscarriages and a newborn with Down syndrome carrying the same translocation. Reciprocal translocation carriers have reduced fertility, increased risk of spontaneous abortion or unbalanced karyotype in their offspring. Here, we report the inheritance of a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 16 in a family with recurrent miscarriages and a newborn with Down syndrome carrying the same translocation. Chromosomal analysis from fetal amniotic fluid and peripheral blood lymphocytes from the family were performed at the Cukurova university hospital in Turkey. We assessed a family in which the translocation between chromosomes 12 and 16 segregates one of the eight progenies with the karyotype 47,XY,+21,t(12
