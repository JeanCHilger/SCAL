Maintaining quality assurance for sonographic nuchal translucency measurement: lessons from the FASTER Trial. To evaluate nuchal translucency measurement quality assurance techniques in a large-scale study.From 1999 to 2001, unselected patients with singleton gestations between 10 + 3 weeks and 13 + 6 weeks were recruited from 15 centers. Sonographic nuchal translucency measurement was performed by trained technicians. Four levels of quality assurance were employed: (1) a standardized protocol utilized by each sonographer (2) local-image review by a second sonographerDetailed quality assessment was available for 37 018 patients. Nuchal translucency measurement was successful in 96.3% of women. Local reviewers rejected 0.8% of images, and the single central physician reviewer rejected a further 2.9%. Multivariate analysis indicated that higher body mass index, earlier gestational age and transvaginal probe use were predictors of failure of nuchal translucency measurement and central image rejection (P = 0.001). Epidemiological monitoring identified a drift in measurements over time.Despite initial training and continuous image review, changes in nuchal translucency measurements occur over time. To maintain screening accuracy, ongoing quality assessment is needed.
