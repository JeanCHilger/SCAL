Preimplantation genetic screening for aneuploidy of embryos after in vitro fertilization in women aged at least 35 years: a prospective randomized trial. To test the hypothesis that patients with advanced maternal age (AMA) have a higher implantation rate (IR) after embryo transfer of embryos with a normal chromosomal pattern for the chromosomes studied with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) compared with patients who had an embryo transfer without PGS.Prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT).Academic tertiary setting.Patients with AMA (> or =35 years).In an RCT, the clinical IR per embryo transferred was compared after embryo transfer on day 5 or 6 between the PGS group (analysis of chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y) and the Control group without PGS.No differences were observed between the PGS group and the Control group for the clinical IR (15.1% 14.9%In this RCT, the results did not confirm the hypothesis that PGS results in improved reproductive outcome in patients with AMA.
