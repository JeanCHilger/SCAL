Profound teratospermia does not influence sex chromosomal aneuploidy rate in in vitro fertilization-preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles. Because spermatocyte meiotic error results in embryonic sex chromosomal aneuploidy, it is speculated that teratospermia correlates with increased embryonic sex chromosomal abnormalities. Our findings contradict this theory, suggesting that morphology does not correlate with sex chromosomal genotype.
