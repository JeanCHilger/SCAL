Accurate single cell 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening using whole genome amplification and single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. To develop and validate a whole genome amplification and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray protocol for accurate single cell 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening.Prospective, randomized, and blinded study.Academic reproductive medicine center.Multiple euploid and aneuploid cell lines were obtained from a public repository and blastomeres were obtained after biopsy of cleavage stage embryos from 78 patients undergoing IVF.Accuracy of copy number assignment and consistency of individual SNPs, whole chromosomes, and single cell aneuploidy status were determined.None.Single cells extracted from karyotypically defined cell lines provided 99.2% accuracy for individual SNPs, 99.8% accuracy for whole chromosomes, and 98.6% accuracy when applying a quality control threshold for the overall assignment of aneuploidy status. The concurrence for more than 80 million SNPs in 335 single blastomeres was 96.5%.We have established and validated a SNP microarray-based single cell aneuploidy screening technology. Clinical validation studies are underway to determine the predictive value of this methodology.
