Using population-based data to predict the impact of introducing noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome. To compare the number and types of chromosome abnormalities prenatally diagnosed and the number of invasive procedures between current prenatal testing pathways and a pathway where noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome replaces Down syndrome screening tests.Numbers and types of chromosome abnormalities for each referral category were extracted from prenatal diagnostic testing reports routinely collected in Victoria, Australia, in 2006 and 2007. These data were then applied to the proposed implementation strategy.If noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome had replaced Down syndrome screening tests in 2006 and 2007, in Victoria, there would have been 25 (7%) additional Down syndrome diagnosed, 6896 (84%) fewer invasive procedures, and 231 (56%) non-Down syndrome chromosome abnormalities no longer detected. These include trisomy 13, trisomy 18, sex chromosome abnormalities, balanced and unbalanced rearrangements, polyploidy, and mosaic results.The potential loss of information about chromosome abnormalities other than Down syndrome with noninvasive prenatal diagnosis compared with full karyotyping with traditional prenatal diagnosis should be considered when planning for the implementation of new technologies.
