A three-year follow-up on a child with low level trisomy 8 mosaicism which was diagnosed prenatally. We report on a case of trisomy 8 mosaicism detected prenatally in a single clone of amniotic fluid culture, and confirmed on fetal blood and on peripheral lymphocytes after birth. A follow-up was performed over 3 years, showing a clinically normal female with cognitive, neuropsychological, and linguistic development in a normal range.
