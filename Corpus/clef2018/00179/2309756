Chromosome abnormalities in older women by maternal age: evaluation of regression-derived rates in chorionic villus biopsy specimens. Maternal age-specific rates of chromosome abnormalities in women undergoing chorionic villus sampling (CVS) were evaluated. These were rates derived from regression equations of the form rate = ln(b[age] + c) where age varied from 35 to 48 years and b and c are parameters. For Down syndrome (47, + 21), b = 0.29 and c = -15.53
