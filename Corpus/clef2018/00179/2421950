Determination of cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid. Uses in prenatal diagnosis and quality control. The determination of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been shown to be as specific as alphafetoprotein (AFP) for the prenatal detection of open neural tube defects although AFP remains the method of choice. This paper describes a semi-automated technique for the analysis of acetylcholinesterase in amniotic fluid that: A) reduces the cost of the procedure B) allows for a larger number of samples to be run at a time
