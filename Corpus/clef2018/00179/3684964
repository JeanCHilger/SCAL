Normal development in two six-year-old boys born after prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 20 mosaicism. Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 20 mosaicism was made in two pregnancies by chromosome analysis of cultured amniotic fluid cells. In both cases, the pregnancy continued to term and a healthy male infant was delivered. Regular assessments up to the age of 6.5 years revealed normal physical and intellectual development in both children.
