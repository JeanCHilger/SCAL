Antenatal diagnosis of structural chromosome anomalies. 226 cases (author's transl). A series of 226 antenatal diagnoses of chromosome structural re-arrangements in 181 couples has shown the usefulness of such diagnosis for couples including a genitor carrying a balanced anomaly. Analysis of the data has elicited major variations in the incidence of unbalanced anomalies in foetal cells and has provided information which can usefully be applied to genetic counselling.
