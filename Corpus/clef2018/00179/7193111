Translocation dicentric chromosomes in prostaglandin E2 induced abortuses and possible aneusomy through asynchronous centromeric divisions. The literature shows reports of whole chromosome or chromosome arm trans-locations in both normal and abnormal liveborns.  Often the abnormal phenotypes cannot be explained by the genetic defeats of the specific chromosome findings.  It is hypothesized that the developmental disturbances occur as epigenetic effects mediated by genetically imbalanced cells produced by the cells with the whole chromosome translocations.  168 abortuses induced by midtrimester PG (prostaglandin) E2 administration were examined at the Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital, the Alexandria Hospital, and the Toa Payoh Hospital in Singapore.  20 cases (11.9%) of mainly euploid aberration were found among the abortuses.  1 case was a numerical aberration, 12 were genetically balanced chromosome rearrangements, 2 were deletions of short arms of acrocentric chromosomes which should have no obvious phenotypic effects, and 5 were only minor delections of chromosome arms.  The cells karyotyped were usually from 1-week-old cultures of the kidneys of the abortuses.  More detailed information is provided for 4 cases of whole chromosome translocations among these 20.  Chromosomal diagrams illustrate the discussion.  Even a small proportion of genetically abnormal cells of poor viability could have profound effects.  It is possible that PG induces chromosomal abnormalities.
