A randomised trial of three methods of giving information about prenatal testing. To test the effect of extra non-directive information about prenatal testing, given individually or in a class.Antenatal clinics in a district general hospital and a university hospital.Randomised controlled trial participants allocated to control group or offer of extra information individually or in class.1691 women booking antenatal care before 15 weeks' gestation.All participants received the usual information about prenatal tests from hospital staff. Individual participants were offered a separate session with a research midwife in which prenatal screening was described in detail. Class participants were offered the same extra information in an early prenatal class.Attendance at extra information sessions uptake rates of prenatal testsAttendance at classes was lower than at individual sessions (adjusted odds ratio 0.45 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.58). Ultrasonography was almost universally accepted (99%) and was not affected by either intervention. Uptake of cystic fibrosis testing, high in controls (79%), was lowered in the individual group (0.44Ultrasonography is valued for non-medical reasons and chosen even by fully informed people who eschew prenatal diagnosis. The offer of extra information has no overall adverse effects on anxiety and reduces uptake of blood tests when background uptake rate is high (but not when it is already low). High uptake of prenatal blood tests suggests compliant behaviour and need for more information.
