Fluorescent in situ hybridization and second-trimester sonographic anomalies: uses and limitations. The critical need for rapid and reliable karyotype analysis can be no greater than in the setting of sonographic fetal anomalies. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) directly applied to interphase chromosomes can decrease the time required to identify the common aneuploidies. Our retrospective study reviewed 50 consecutive patients with sonographic fetal anomalies who underwent FISH. Within this high risk group, nonmosaic chromosomal aneuploidies were present in 16% of the fetuses (8 of 50), and 2 additional fetuses had cytogenetic abnormalities: 1 case, 46,XY,-12,+der(12)t(1213)(p13
