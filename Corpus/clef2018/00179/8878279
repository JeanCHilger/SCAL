The outcome of pregnancies with confined placental chromosome mosaicism in cytotrophoblast cells. Cytogenetic findings and outcome of pregnancy are reported in 108 cases in which confined placental mosaicism (CPM, n = 101) or generalized mosaicism (n = 7) was found at or after first-trimester chorionic villus sampling. In all samples, a (semi)direct cytogenetic analysis of cytotrophoblast cells was performed. Two pregnancies with CPM ended in a spontaneous abortion before 28 weeks (1.9 per cent). In 15 cases the pregnancy was terminated: eight cases were shown to be examples of CPM seven cases can be considered as examples of generalized mosaicism. A normal cytogenetic result was obtained after follow-up amniocentesis in 88 of the remaining 91 cases. In three cases, no amniocentesis was performed but confirmation of a normal karyotype was obtained in other cells. One of the 91 pregnancies was nevertheless terminated for psychosocial reasons. One child died perinatally and another on the seventh day after birth. The birth weight is known for 89 children
