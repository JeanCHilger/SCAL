Genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta caused by paternal mosaicism. In a family with recurrent osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) caused by paternal mosaicism, prenatal diagnosis was made using restriction enzyme analysis for a mutation in COL1A2. Parental mosaicism is important to consider in genetic counselling for OI. Prenatal diagnosis of OI is available currently by means of collagen or gene analyses in the first trimester or by ultrasonography in the second trimester.
