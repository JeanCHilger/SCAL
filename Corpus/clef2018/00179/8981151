Oocyte donation to women of advanced reproductive age: pregnancy results and obstetrical outcomes in patients 45 years and older. We analysed the results of oocyte donation to women of advanced reproductive age (> or = 45 years old) and followed their pregnancies through to delivery in order to assess obstetrical outcomes. Patients (n = 162) aged 45-59 years (mean +/- SD 47.3 +/- 3.4 years) underwent 218 consecutive attempts to achieve pregnancy. Oocytes (16.2 +/- 7.2 per retrieval) were provided by donors < or = 35 years old. Cleaving embryos (8.2 +/- 4.8 zygotes/couple) were transferred transcervically (4.5 +/- 1.1 per embryo transfer) to recipients prescribed oral micronized oestradiol and intramuscular progesterone. Following oocyte aspiration there were six instances of non-fertilization (2.8%) and 212 embryo transfers. A total of 103 pregnancies was established for an overall pregnancy rate (PR) of 48.6%, which included 17 preclinical pregnancies, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 74 delivered pregnancies (clinical PR 40.6%
