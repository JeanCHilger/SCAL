Frequency of parvovirus B19 infection in nonimmune hydrops fetalis and utility of three diagnostic methods. The rate of parvovirus B19 (PV) infection in cases of "idiopathic" nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is reported to be approximately 16% with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Antibodies for use in paraffin-embedded tissue have not been systematically compared with PCR or with the presence of inclusions at varying gestational ages. All autopsy cases of NIHF and those with effusions of multiple serous membranes examined between 1991 and 1996 (n = 29) were evaluated for the presence of PV DNA by PCR analysis of paraffin-embedded liver tissue. PCR-positive cases and "idiopathic" cases were examined for the presence of inclusions in routine histological sections and for PV protein using a monoclonal antibody (NovoCastra R92F6). Among the four clinically idiopathic cases, one (25%) was positive for PV using PCR. The three negative idiopathic cases had no inclusions and were negative for PV by PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) all were third-trimester gestations (28, 31, and 32 weeks). Identifiable risk factors for NIHF other than PV in the remaining 25 cases included cystic hygroma, seven (three 45,X
