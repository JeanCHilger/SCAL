The biochemical marker dynamics of the maternal serum in different chromosomal disorders of the fetus. The reasons for false-positive results of Down syndrome screening have been analysed. It has been found that the family pericentric inversions of chromosome 9 in fetus are accompanied by AFP and HCG changes equal to Down syndrome pregnancies. The average marker's levels in cases of per inv (9) were: AFp-0.51 MoM, HCG-3.71 MoM. The dynamics of markers in amniotic fluid has been studied. Clinical significance of per inv (9) in medicogenetic consultation were discussed.
