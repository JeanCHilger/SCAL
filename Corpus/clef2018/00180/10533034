Postnatal structure of the sella turcica in Down syndrome. The purpose of this study was to analyze the shape of the sella turcica in a group of patients with Down syndrome and compare the findings with those made earlier in human fetuses with Down syndrome. Profile radiographs from 78 patients (age 4 months to 50 3/12 years) were analyzed. A tracing was made of each sella turcica, and the shape was compared with that of a normal sella, including the normal growth pattern from childhood to adulthood. Sella turcica structure could be classified into three morphological types, defined as: type I, almost normal appearance type II, deviations in the anterior wall
