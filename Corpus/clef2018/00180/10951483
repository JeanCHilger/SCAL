Second trimester levels of maternal serum inhibin A in pregnancies affected by fetal neural tube defects. Inhibin A is effective as a second trimester maternal serum marker for Down syndrome screening. In the present study, inhibin A levels were measured in second trimester maternal serum samples from 28 pregnancies affected with open neural tube defects 12 associated with open spina bifida and 16 associated with anencephaly. Each measurement was expressed as a multiple of the median (MoM) for control singleton pregnancies (n=1464) of the same completed week of gestation. Inhibin A levels were not significantly altered in cases of open neural tube defects
