Maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A in twin pregnancies in the first trimester. To determine the levels of free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) in twin pregnancies in the first trimester.Serum samples were obtained from 67 pregnant women with twin pregnancies and maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A concentrations were compared with those of 4279 singleton controls between the 8th and 13th weeks of gestation.The geometric means of chromosomally normal twin pregnancies were 1.85 MoM for free beta-hCG and 2.36 MoM for PAPP-A. There were no cases affected by Down syndrome in either group.Twin pregnancies secrete more PAPP-A than expected on the basis of singleton controls whereas free beta-hCG production is not increased. The results of the present study can be used to establish normal reference values when introducing first trimester Down syndrome screening in prenatal care.
