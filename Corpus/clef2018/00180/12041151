Hickman v. Group Health Plan, Inc. The parents of a Down's syndrome baby brought suit against their obstetrician and health plan on the grounds that neither had offered the mother the option of amniocentesis testing.  The defendants invoked a Minnesota statute prohibiting wrongful life and wrongful birth actions.  The parents challenged the constitutionality of the statute, arguing that it restricted the mother's right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade, violated her due process and equal protection rights, and deprived her of a remedy for rights vested at common law.  The Supreme Court of Minnesota upheld the statute, noting that the real issue was not the mother's right to an abortion, but rather the legislature's right to decide what conduct by one person is actionable by another.
