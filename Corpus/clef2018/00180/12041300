Wilson v. Kuenzi. The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the Circuit Court's dismissal of wrongful life and wrongful birth claims brought against a physician who failed to advise a pregnant woman of the availability of the amniocentesis test for Down's syndrome.  The Supreme Court ruled that the Missouri statute precluding actions for wrongful life and wrongful birth does not apply retroactively.  However, the Court refused to recognize the validity of wrongful life or wrongful death actions.  The wrongful life action brought by or on behalf of a child is improper because of the difficulty in assessing damages, and the wrongful birth action brought by the child's parents is invalid because of the absence of traditional tort causation, the derivative nature of the cause of action, and the uncertainty in determining whether the mother would have chosen to abort.
