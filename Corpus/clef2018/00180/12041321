Azzolino v. Dingfelder. Ruling that a five-year old boy with Down's syndrome could maintain an action for wrongful life against the doctor and the clinic from which his mother had received prenatal care, the North Carolina Court of Appeals partly affirmed and partly reversed a Superior Court ruling.  The parents, who had brought a wrongful birth claim of their own for negligence, asserted that the mother would have undergone amniocentesis and availed herself of genetic counseling if she had been properly advised and that she would have aborted her pregnancy if she had known the fetus had Down's syndrome.
