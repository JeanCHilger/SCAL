Azzolino v. Dingfelder. This appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court arose from a medical malpractice action brought by a child born with Down's syndrome and his parents and siblings.  The appeal alleges that the physician's negligent failure to advise the parents properly of the availability of amniocentesis and genetic counseling prevented the termination of the mother's pregnancy by abortion and thereby resulted in the child's birth.  Dismissing the child's wrongful life action, the Supreme Court of North Carolina remarked that life, even life with severe defects, is not an injury affording a legal remedy.  The court also refused to recognize the parents' and siblings' wrongful birth claims on the grounds that the physician cannot be said to have caused the defect and that the legislature is better suited to address the issues arising from such claims.
