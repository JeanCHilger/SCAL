Partial gonadal dysgenesis in a patient with a marker Y chromosome. We evaluated a patient with partial gonadal dysgenesis including a right dysgenetic testis and a left streak gonad with rudimentary fallopian tube and uterus. She had ambiguous external genitalia and was raised female. Although her height is normal (25th centile at age 12 years), she has some findings of Ullrich-Turner syndrome. Her karyotype was reported to be 46,X,+marker subsequent molecular investigations showed the marker to be the short arm of the Y chromosome. Genomic DNA, isolated from leukocytes of the patient and her father, was digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases and subjected to Southern blot analysis. A positive hybridization signal was obtained with probes for the short arm of the Y chromosome (pRsY0.55, SRY, ZFY, 47Z, pY-190, and YC-2) in DNA from the patient, indicating the presence of most if not all of the short arm, while long arm probes (HinfA and pY3.4) indicated that at least 75% of the long arm of the Y chromosome was missing. The gene responsible for testicular determination (TDF) is on the distal portion of the short arm of the Y chromosome
