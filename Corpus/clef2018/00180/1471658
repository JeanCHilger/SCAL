Rapid prenatal diagnosis by fluorescent in situ hybridization of chorionic villi: an adjunct to long-term culture and karyotype. This series was designed to assess in a pilot study the feasibility of using fluorescence in situ hybridization on chorionic villi.We constructed probes derived from specific subregions of human chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y that give a single copylike signal when used in conjunction with suppression hybridization.In a blind series of 47 samples all, including one trisomy 21, were correctly identified. The samples were correctly classified as disomic for five chromosomes.The combination of chromosome-specific probe sets composed primarily of cosmid contigs and optimized hybridization and detection allowed accurate chromosome enumeration in uncultured human chorionic villi these results are consistent with those obtained by traditional cytogenetic analysis and suggest a use for fluorescence in situ hybridization as an adjunct to karyotyping when rapid results are needed.
