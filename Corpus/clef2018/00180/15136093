Parental karyotype and subsequent live births in recurrent miscarriage. To compare the subsequent live birth rate in recurrently miscarrying women with and without parental balanced chromosomal aberrations.Retrospective comparative cohort study.Tertiary referral unit in a university hospital.Nine hundred sixteen patients with 3-16 miscarriages before 20 weeks: 99 patients with and 817 patients without chromosomal aberrations.None.Outcome of the subsequent pregnancy in terms of live births or repeat miscarriage.Of the 916 patients, 661 subsequently conceived, 73 (73.7%) with parental chromosomal aberrations and 588 (71.9%) without aberrations. In patients with and without chromosomal aberrations, 33 of 73 pregnancies (45.2%) and 325 of 588 pregnancies (55.3%), respectively, resulted in live births. The difference is not statistically significant. There was a similar prevalence of aberrations in primary, secondary, and tertiary aborters. The prevalence of aberrations was not related to the number of previous miscarriages. Translocations, inversions, and mosaicism were followed by a similar live birth rate.Patients with parental chromosomal rearrangements do not have a significantly lower live birth rate than patients without aberrations. Parental karyotyping might not be a good predictor of the outcome of subsequent pregnancies.
