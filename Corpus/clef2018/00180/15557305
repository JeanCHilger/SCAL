Phenotypic characteristics of absent and hypoplastic nasal bones in fetuses with Down syndrome: description by 3-dimensional ultrasonography and clinical significance. To determine the frequency and clinical significance of bilateral and unilateral hypoplastic nasal bones for the detection of Down syndrome by 3-dimensional ultrasonography.Thirty-seven volumes of the fetal skull from fetuses with Down syndrome and 37 from fetuses without abnormalities were analyzed by 1 investigator blinded to fetal karyotype. The maximum intensity projection algorithm was used to reconstruct nasal bones. Ossification patterns were identified in anteroposterior and profile views. Sensitivity, false-positive rates (FPRs), and likelihood ratios (LRs) for detection of Down syndrome were calculated.After exclusions (coronal acquisition [n = 11], hand in front of the face [n = 4], poor imaging [n = 2], incomplete follow-up [n = 2], and anomalies detected after delivery [n = 2]), 53 volumes were analyzed (26 fetuses with Down syndrome and 27 without abnormalities median gestational age, 21 6/7 weeks [interquartile range, 19 6/7-25 2/7 weeks]). Rendered profile views revealed absent nasal bones in 18.9% (10 of 53) of the fetuses, and, among these, 90% (9 of 10) had Down syndrome (sensitivity, 34.6% [9 of 26]Absence of nasal bones is associated with the highest risk of Down syndrome. Delayed ossification is associated with a lower risk of Down syndrome than absent nasal bones. These ossification patterns may be indistinguishable on 2-dimensional ultrasonography.
