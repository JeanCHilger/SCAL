Prenatal diagnosis of common chromosomal aneuploidies on uncultured amniotic fluid cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization. To evaluate the feasibility of using fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) for the detection of a few common chromosome aneuploidies on interphase nuclei of uncultured amniotic fluid cells.Amniotic fluid samples were taken from 55 women at 16-32 weeks of pregnancy interphase FISH was performed for diagnosing Down syndrome and aneuploidies of other four chromosomes 13, 18, X and Y. Then the karyotypes from standard cytogenetic analysis after percutaneous umbilical blood sampling(PUBS) were compared to the FISH results.Each of the 55 uncultured amniotic fluid samples tested with FISH was enumerated 200 nuclei. Fifty-three samples were normal. Two samples were found to have trisomy 21(one is a case of standard trisomy 21 with three signals in all 200 nuclei, the other is a mosaic trisomy 21).Interphase FISH analysis of uncultured amniotic fluid cells is a rapid, accurate and very sensitive method. It could be used in the prenatal cytogenetic laboratory.
