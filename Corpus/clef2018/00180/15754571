Anterior abdominal wall defects--retrospective analysis of fetuses diagnosed in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology of the Postgraduate Center of Medical Education between 1997 & 2002. Our objectives were to determine the risk of aneuploidy and anatomic anomalies in fetuses with different kinds of abdominal wall defects.We retrospectively studied ultrasound reports of the fetuses with abdominal wall defects.We analyzed 108 cases diagnosed during the last five years in our center. All fetuses underwent a detailed ultrasonographic survey and in majority of cases (78.8%) antenatal karyotyping was performed. We also analyzed gestational age at the first examination.35 cases presented gastroschisis, 60 omphalocele, 7 ectopia cordis and 6 limb-body wall complex. Associated anomalies were detected in 48.1% of all cases. It was 22.9% in gastroschisis group, 58.3% in omphalocele group, 42.9% in ectopia cordis group and in all fetuses with limb-body wall complex. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 13% of all cases in 2.9% of gastroschisis group, 20% of omphalocele group, 16.7% of limb-body wall complex group and none of the fetuses with ectopia cordis. The median gestational age at the first examination was 24 weeks.In fetuses with abdominal wall defects detailed ultrasonographic survey and in majority of cases prenatal karyotyping should be done. Furthermore patients with fetus with such a defect should be diagnosed as early as possible in the referral center.
