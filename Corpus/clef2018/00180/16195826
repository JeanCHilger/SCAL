Comparison of growth rates of fresh and frozen-thawed embryos according to chromosomal status. To report a comparison of growth rates between fresh and frozen-thawed embryos on day 3 and 4 according to chromosomal status during PGD.Embryos were biopsied on day 3, fluorescent in situ hybridization performed for aneuploidy detection and growth rates monitored.Based on 241 egg pick up-PGD and 133 frozen embryo transfer-PGD cycles. The development rate of embryos despite their chromosomal status was similar on day 3, however, overall, fresh embryos showed a significantly improved development (> or =6 cell stage 85.7%) compared to frozen embryos (77.0%Cryopreservation slows embryo development regardless of the chromosomal status. However, chromosomal status did not influence the chance of embryo implantation which was the same for fresh and thawed embryos.
