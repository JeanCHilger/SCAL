Integrated serum screening for Down syndrome in primary obstetric practice. Integrated serum screening for Down syndrome is potentially more effective than current second-trimester screening. We report results of an intervention trial of integrated serum screening that involved 229 primary prenatal care practitioners throughout Maine.Women provided a first-trimester serum (for PAPP-A) followed by a second-trimester serum (for AFP, uE3, hCG, and DIA). These five marker measurements were used to calculate a Down syndrome risk in the second trimester. Screen-positive women (risk > or = 1:100) were managed according to standard practice.During 24 months' enrollment, 11 159 women provided a first-trimester sample (61% of women receiving screening services). Nine thousand seven hundred twenty-three women also provided a second-trimester sample 8773 women satisfied gestational age criteria for testing in both trimesters. Integrated serum screening detected 14 of 16 Down syndrome cases (87%) and 79% after adjustment for trimester-of-ascertainment bias. The initial false-positive rate was 3.2% and was 2.7% when restricted to ultrasound-dated pregnancies. Performance was better than any combination of second-trimester markers. Implementation challenges included initial samples being collected too early and sample matching.Integrated serum screening for Down syndrome was successfully implemented in primary care settings screening performance was consistent with predictions. It provides an accessible and acceptable alternative to screening protocols that require nuchal translucency measurements.
