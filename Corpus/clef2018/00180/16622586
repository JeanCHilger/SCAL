Microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-based prenatal diagnosis for chromosome abnormalities using cell-free fetal DNA in amniotic fluid. Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in the supernatant of amniotic fluid, which is usually discarded, can be used as a sample for prenatal diagnosis. For rapid prenatal diagnosis of frequent chromosome abnormalities, for example trisomies 13, 18, and 21, and monosomy X, using cffDNA, we have developed a targeted microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) panel on which BAC clones from chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y were spotted. Microarray-CGH analysis was performed for a total of 13 fetuses with congenital anomalies using cffDNA from their uncultured amniotic fluid. Microarray CGH with cffDNA led to successful molecular karyotyping for 12 of 13 fetuses within 5 days. Karyotypes of the 12 fetuses (one case of trisomy 13, two of trisomy 18, two of trisomy 21, one of monosomy X, and six of normal karyotype) were later confirmed by conventional chromosome analysis using cultured amniocytes. The one fetus whose molecular-karyotype was indicated as normal by microarray CGH actually had a balanced translocation, 45,XY,der(1421)(q10
