Risk factors associated with neonatal tumors. Experience of a pediatric environmental health specialty unit in Valencia (Spain). Neonatal tumors (NT) result from a variable combination of constitutional and environmental determinants. Multiple risk factors (RF) are involved in their development, although most are unknown.To document the constitutional, environmental, preconceptional and transplacental RF associated with the development of NT with greater or lesser scientific evidence.We investigated known RF in NT diagnosed at La Fe University Children's Hospital from January 1990 to December 1999, using a questionnaire completed by parents in a personal interview, either at the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU-Valencia) or at their home. RF associated with NT and childhood cancer were identified through a literature review of the last 25 years through Medline, Cancerlit, Science Citation Index, and Embase.The questionnaire was completed in 59 of 74 NT diagnosed during the period studied. All patients were Caucasians born in Spain. Constitutional-genetic factors were identified in 13.6 %: dominant hereditary syndromes in 5 (familial retinoblastoma in 1 and tuberous sclerosis in 4), and non-hereditary chromosomal syndromes in 3 (trisomy 21). Notable environmental factors were: a) ionizing radiation: preconceptional exposure in 32.2 % and in utero exposure in 6.8 % b) non-ionizing radiationThe hypotheses formulated in this observational study, which should be analyzed in future case-control and cohort studies, are: a) to scientifically document genetic-constitutional RF in the etiopathogenesis of NT b) to determine the frequency and etiology of prior miscarriage and its possible association with NT
