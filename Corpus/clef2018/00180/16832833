Identifying Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in conjunction with prenatal screening for Down syndrome. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a rare hereditary disorder of cholesterol metabolism. We examine the feasibility of identifying SLOS as a part of a routine prenatal screening and evaluate diagnostic testing in maternal urine (or serum), in addition to amniotic fluid.Our SLOS risk algorithm utilized three Down syndrome screening markers (estimated 62% detection rate 0.3% screen-positive rate). Fifteen North American prenatal screening programs implemented this algorithm.SLOS risk was assigned to 1 079 301 pregnancies 3083 were screen-positive (0.29%). Explanations were found for 1174, including 914 existing fetal deaths. Among the remaining pregnancies, 739 were screen-positive only for SLOSAlthough SLOS occurred less often than previously reported, many other major abnormalities were detected. Implementing the algorithm as an adjunct to Down syndrome screening may be feasible.
