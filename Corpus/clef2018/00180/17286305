Complete discrepancy between QF-PCR analysis of uncultured villi and karyotyping of cultured cells in the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 in three CVS. To investigate complete discrepancies in the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 between QF-PCR analysis of uncultured villi and karyotyping of cultured cells in three chorion villus samples.Clinical details were obtained from all three patients. Follow-up studies were undertaken where possible by evaluation of chromosome 21 copy number with QF-PCR, interphase FISH, MLPA and karyotyping, and by post-mortem examination.Case 1: severe oligohydramnios and microcephaly on scan. QF-PCR: trisomy 21 MLPA: trisomy 21QF-PCR analysis of uncultured villi and cultured karyotyping may rarely show complete discrepancy in the prediction of fetal trisomy 21 in CVS. Within-biopsy sample mosaicism, together with the testing of different cell populations, provide an explanation for these results. Practical ways to minimise the risk of such discrepancy are proposed.
