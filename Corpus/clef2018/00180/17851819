Maternal anxiety about first trimester nuchal translucency screening and impact of positive screening results. To assess pre- and post-procedural maternal anxiety about nuchal translucency thickness screening for Down syndrome in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the psychological impact of positive screening results.A total of 172 women whose screens were positive for excess fetal nuchal translucency thickness, and 180 women whose screens were within normal limits (controls) were recruited. Anxiety levels were measured with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory just before screening, 1 week after screening, at 22 weeks' gestation, and 6 weeks after delivery. After delivery, all women were asked to respond using a Likert-type scale regarding their attitudes toward fetal nuchal translucency screening.Women with positive screening results reported significantly greater psychological distress on state-anxiety scores after the full report was received. The trait- and state-anxiety scores before screening, at 22 weeks' gestation, and after delivery did not differ between groups. Both groups of women were strongly positive about nuchal translucency screening, both in the current pregnancy and in future pregnancies.Women with positive screening results did not have a sustained increase in anxiety and remained supportive about the value of screening. Clinician concerns about causing maternal anxiety should not be an impediment to screening.
