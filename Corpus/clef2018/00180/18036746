Amniocentesis practice assessment of the south-west Francilian network during 2003. To assess amniocentesis practice of a network during one year.In a retrospective multicenter study of the south-west Francilian network, we have enrolled 2400 patients who underwent amniocentesis, from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003.The rate of amniocentesis was 9.5%. The most frequent indication was a positive maternal serum screening test result (44%). The rate of global fetal losses (spontaneous miscarriage and intrauterine death) was 1.4%. Once the fetuses with aneuploidy and lethal pathology excluded, the rate of global fetal losses potentially related to amniocentesis was 1.21%. The rate of premature rupture of the membranes was 1.12% and prematurity affected 6.5% of the living births.Our study has highlighted several practices of amniocentesis within the network. Overall, amniocentesis potentially induces 1.12% of fetal losses. Screening tests are currently used sequentially, which leads to an increase number of amniocentesis and to an increase number of losses of "a priori" healthy fetus. Only the use of a combined screening could lower the frequency of amniocentesis without decreasing the detection rate of chromosome abnormalities.
