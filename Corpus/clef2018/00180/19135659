Outcome of twin babies free of Von Hippel-Lindau disease after a double-factor preimplantation genetic diagnosis: monogenetic mutation analysis and comprehensive aneuploidy screening. To increase the embryo implantation rate, a double-factor preimplantation genetic diagnosis (DF-PGD) was performed, selecting for transfer potentially euploid evolved embryos free of the mutation responsible for Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL).Case report.Medical university center and a private IVF center.A patient carrier of the R161Q mutation on the VHL gene.After first polar body (1PB) biopsy, it was analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization (1PB-CGH). On day +3, mutation detection using minisequencing and short tandem repeat analysis was performed in multiple displacement amplification products of a single blastomere per embryo.Transfering embryos free of the disease and originating from euploid oocytes.Nine of the twelve oocytes obtained were successfully analyzed using 1PB-CGH. One of them was aneuploid (1PB #1: 29XX,+2,+10,+12,+17,+19), and the rest were euploid. All of the oocytes were fertilized and became evolved embryos. Six of the embryos were VHL unaffected and had good quality. Five (83%) of them were potentially euploid. According to cytogenetic results, two of the evolved and healthy embryos were transfered, achieving the birth of healthy twin babies.The DF-PGD can be a useful tool to increase implantation of transfered embryos in PGD for monogenic diseases.
