Prenatal genetic study of fetuses with congenital heart diseases. To investigate the genetic abnormalities of fetuses with congenital heart diseases (CHD), and to provide guidance for the management of pregnancy and genetic counseling.Eighty-one fetuses with CHD detected by fetal echocardiography were analyzed by karyotyping after amniocentesis, cordocentesis or chorionic sampling. Then 22q11.2 deletion/duplication was detected by a competitive fluorescent multiplex short tandem repeat assay in 47 CHD fetuses without chromosomal abnormalities. With fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using LSI dual color DNA probe, the deletion/duplication status was confirmed.Thirty-four of 81 CHD fetuses had chromosomal anomalies, and 1 of the 47 CHD fetuses without chromosomal anomalies had duplication at chromosome 22q11. The incidence of aneuploidy associated CHD was 43.2%. The rate of chromosomal anomalies is higher in the cases associated with extra-cardiac anomalies than in that with isolated CHD (64.5% versus 28.0%). In the 35 fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities, 19 (54.3%) were trisomy 18.Chromosomal abnormalities occurred in 43.2% of CHD cases and trisomy 18 is the most common aneuploidy. The likelihood of chromosomal anomaly increases when there is extracardiac involvement. Testing for the 22q11.2 microdeletion/duplication is recommended in all CHD fetuses without chromosomal anomalies. It is important for the further management of pregnancy and genetic counseling.
