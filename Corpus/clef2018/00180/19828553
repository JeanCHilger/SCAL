Cytogenetic analyses of human oocytes provide new data on non-disjunction mechanisms and the origin of trisomy 16. Nowadays, oocyte donation is an extended practise in IVF programmes. However, to date, little information on aneuploidy frequency in oocytes from donors is available. Aneuploidy is one of the major causes of embryo and fetal wastage as well as of congenital mental and developmental disabilities. It is known that most aneuploidies are due to non-disjunction events occurring in the maternal germ line. Linkage studies have associated abnormal patterns of meiotic recombination to the origin of the non-disjunction event in many aneuploid conditions.In the present study, we analyse the frequency of chromosome imbalances in a series of metaphase I (MI n = 44) and metaphase II (MIIIn the present study, we report the finding of a considerable frequency of aneuploidy in oocytes from young donors, with the frequency of PSSC being higher than the frequency of whole-chromosome non-disjunction. In addition, we report vulnerable patterns of meiotic recombination in chromosome 16 that may be at risk of leading to a non-disjunction event. This gives new data on the susceptibility of the control population to conceive a trisomic 16 embryo.
