First trimester screening for Down syndrome: five years prospective experience. First trimester screening for Down syndrome is yet to become the first intention strategy in France. This screening program at 11-14 weeks of gestation using maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency, maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A has already been validated for a long time by many international studies. It seems to improve detection rate and decrease false positive rates. We report here five years prospective experience.
