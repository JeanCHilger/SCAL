Ultrasonographic findings in spontaneous miscarriage: relation to euploidy and aneuploidy. To evaluate a possible correlation between transvaginal ultrasound findings in miscarriages and cytogenetic analyses from chorionic villi obtained by dilatation and curettage.Prospective, population-based study.University-based hospital.Five hundred seventy-six women with spontaneous miscarriage diagnosed between 6 and 12 completed pregnancy weeks.Transvaginal ultrasonography and dilatation and curettage.Cytogenetic analyses and ultrasound measurement of embryonic pole.The mean gestational age was 9.5 weeks. Chromosomal analyses were successful in 259 cases, 159 with cytogenetic abnormalities and 100 euploidy. Empty gestational sacs were equally often found in euploidy and aneuploidy, whereas small embryonic or fetal poles were significantly more often associated with aneuploidy.A smaller than expected fetal size when a miscarriage is diagnosed during the first trimester is significantly associated with a chromosomal aberration.
