Fetal hepatosplenomegaly in the third trimester: A sign of leukemia in fetuses with Down syndrome. Risk for leukemic conditions increases in individuals with Down syndrome. We report a third trimester antenatal diagnosis of leukemia in a Down syndrome fetus. The third trimester ultrasound examination revealed a hepatosplenomegaly, which may suggest a myelopoiesis disorder. A review of the literature of eight cases described antenatally and 14Â cases in the immediate neonatal period is presented.
