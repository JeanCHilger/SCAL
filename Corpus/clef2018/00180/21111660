Combined screening for Down syndrome in Marseille multidisciplinary prenatal centers. Combined screening for trisomy 21 (CS) is established since January 2010 in multidisciplinary centers for prenatal screening in Marseille. Our work investigates its implementation. To date, the false positive rate is 3.5% and the coverage of the SC after six months is 5.7% in our low-risk population.
