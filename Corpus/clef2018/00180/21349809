A man with 47,XYY karyotype, prolactinoma and a history of first trimester recurrent miscarriages in his wife. The clinical and laboratory features as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of men with XYY syndrome have not been fully described. A 41-year-old infertile man was diagnosed as having a 47,XYY karyotype and a micro-prolactinoma. His 32-year-old wife had a history of five spontaneous pregnancies, all resulting in first trimester miscarriages. Three in-vitro fertilization (IVF) attempts were made with no biochemical pregnancy. During the third attempt, a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was performed by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique. Only one out of six (16%) embryos had normal karyotype.(1) Karyotypic analysis of both partners is a sine qua non investigation for recurrent miscarriages (2) the XYY syndrome results in high frequency of embryo aneuploidy
