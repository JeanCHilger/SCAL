Maternal age-specific rates of 47,+21 and other cytogenetic abnormalities diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy in chorionic villus biopsy specimens: comparison with rates expected from observations at amniocentesis. Results are presented on chromosome analyses made on 4,481 embryos or fetuses studied through chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in whom there was no known bias to presence of a chromosome abnormality except advanced parental age. We excluded from the analysis most cases in which mosaicism was diagnosed or in which there were cytogenetic discrepancies among samples obtained from the conceptus. There remain 48 cases of 47,+21, 39 cases of other nonlethal abnormalities, and 12 lethal abnormalities diagnosed in 4,481 studied. A regression analysis (restricted to the 3,848 cases diagnosed in the 35-49-year maternal age interval) was done on rates of (1) 47,+21, (2) other abnormalities excluding lethals or (3) including them, and (4) all abnormalities excluding lethals or (5) including them. The model used was y = exp(bx + c), where y is the rate of abnormality, x is maternal age at time of CVS (the modal age of the procedure was 10 gestational weeks from the last menstrual period), and b and c were, respectively, (1) 0.288 and -15.527 (2) 0.272 and -15.173
