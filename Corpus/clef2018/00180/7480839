Development and implementation of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the experimental steps that led to the development of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and its application in the human. ICSI has become the most successful micromanipulation procedure for treating male infertility. A total of 355 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles utilizing ICSI are described 180 couples were previously treated in 509 IVF cycles but achieved no fertilization and 175 couples could not be treated by IVF because of extremely poor semen parameters. Of the 3063 metaphase II (M II) oocytes retrieved, 2970 were injected with a survival rate of 93.6%, yielding 1917 bipronuclear zygotes (64.5%). In 148 patients, a foetal heart was evidenced by ultrasound
