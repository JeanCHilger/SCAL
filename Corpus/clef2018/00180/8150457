A comparative study of flow cytometry and histopathologic findings in thyroid follicular carcinomas and adenomas. As a possible diagnostic aid in the often difficult histopathologic distinction of thyroid follicular carcinomas from adenomas based on invasion most flow cytometry studies have indicated a higher aneuploidy incidence in carcinomas. However, these reports often are difficult to analyze mainly due to nonuniformity of pathologic diagnostic criteria. The present study compares the flow cytometry results of 65 follicular tumors with pathologic findings based on the World Health Organization's specific diagnostic and staging criteria. Aneuploidy was significantly higher in the 28 cancers than in the 27 hypercellular (fetal and embryonal) adenomas (57% v 22% P = .02). There was a high percentage of aneuploidy (75%
