Prenatal diagnosis by analysis of fetal cells in maternal blood. The data accumulated thus far indicate that fetal NRBCs are the target cell type of choice in maternal blood for most investigators, although some groups continue to work with the trophoblast. Reports of persistent circulation of hematopoietic stem cells, lymphoid/myeloid progenitors, and lymphocytes mandate that removal of these cell types must occur before clinical diagnosis of the current pregnancy can be made. In selected cases, accurate detection of fetal aneuploidy has been made from fetal cells in maternal blood the clinical evaluation sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will determine the sensitivity and specificity of cytogenetic diagnosis in a larger group of pregnant women, but this information will not be available for several years. At present, detection of uniquely fetal, paternally inherited gene polymorphisms or mutations such as the Rh(D) antigen is possible only because the mother lacks these genes
