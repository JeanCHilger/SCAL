Serum screening in pregnant women for Down syndrome and open neural-tube defects testing against the Health Council criteria for genetic screening. To check whether serum screening for Down syndrome and open neural tube defects satisfies the criteria set by the 'Committee Genetic screening' of the Dutch Health Council.Theoretical evaluation.Serum screening (the combined serum assessment of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotrophin and unconjugated oestriol, taking into consideration maternal age) was assessed against the Dutch Health Council criteria. The absolute criteria could be subdivided into a group of general conditions not related to a particular screening programme, and a group of programme-specific conditions.Population serum screening satisfied some of the absolute criteria, while the programme-specific conditions should be realised in an actual screening programme. Psychological and community consequences of such a screening have not yet been investigated in the Dutch population.
