The use of second-trimester genetic sonogram in guiding clinical management of patients at increased risk for fetal trisomy 21. To test the efficacy of ultrasound in detecting fetuses with trisomy 21.From November 1, 1992, to December 31, 1995, a second-trimester genetic sonogram was offered to all women with singleton fetuses at increased risk (at least 1:274) for trisomy 21, who had either declined genetic amniocentesis or chose to have a sonogram before deciding whether to undergo an amniocentesis. In addition to standard fetal biometry, the following ultrasound markers for aneuploidy were evaluated: structural anomalies (including face, hands, and cardiac [four-chamber view and outflow tracts]), short femur, short humerus, pyelectasis, nuchal fold thickening, echogenic bowel, choroid plexus cysts, hypoplastic middle phalanx of the fifth digit, wide space between the first and second toes, and two-vessel umbilical cord. Outcome information included the results of genetic amniocentesis, if performed, or the results of postnatal pediatric assessment and follow-up.Five hundred seventy-three patients had a genetic sonogram between 15 and 23 weeks' gestation: 378 patients had advanced maternal age (at least 35 years), 141 had abnormal serum biochemistry, and 54 had both. The majority (495, or 86.3%) had a normal genetic sonogram (absence of abnormal ultrasound markers) 51 (9%) had one marker present, and 27 (4.7%) had two or more markers present. Outcome was obtained on 422 patients (the remaining were ongoing pregnancies or were lost to follow-up). Twelve of 14 fetuses with trisomy 21, one fetus with trisomy 13, and one fetus with triploidy had two or more abnormal ultrasound markers presentSecond-trimester genetic sonogram may be a reasonable alternative for patients at increased risk for fetal trisomy 21 who wish to avoid amniocentesis. In experienced hands, this approach may result in a high detection rate of trisomy 21 (93%), with an amniocentesis rate of less than 20%.
