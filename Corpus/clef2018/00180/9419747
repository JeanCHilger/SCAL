Positive serum screening for fetal Down syndrome does not predict adverse pregnancy outcome in absence of fetal aneuploidy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether false-positive maternal serum screening for fetal Down syndrome is predictive of poor pregnancy outcome.The pregnancy outcomes of 99 women having positive serum screening for fetal Down syndrome (study group)--based upon maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), hCG, and maternal age--were compared to the outcomes of matched control patients having negative serum screening results (control group). The outcome indices analyzed were fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preeclampsia, and fetal anomalies.Between the study group and the control group, there were no statistically significant differences in pregnancy outcome with respect to fetal death, IUGR, preeclampsia, or fetal anomalies.Our findings demonstrate no apparent increase in the adverse perinatal outcomes analyzed in women having unexplained positive serum screening for fetal Down syndrome. Although further investigation is needed, these results provide no evidence to support increased antepartum surveillance in such patients.
