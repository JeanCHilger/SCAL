A study of early amniocentesis for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. A prospective pilot study for early amniocentesis was conducted over 4 years including 279 early amniocenteses (EAs at 10-14 weeks' gestation) and 181 mid-trimester amniocenteses (MAs at 15 weeks upwards). The study was performed with EA and MA utilizing the same proceduralists, techniques, and cytogenetics laboratory. Patients were offered either procedure and the cytogenetics laboratory was not prospectively informed of the gestational age of each sampled pregnancy. In the early amniocenteses, less fluid was sampled and there were trends for (i) less cells and clones being available for analysis, less successful cultures, and a slightly longer reporting time (ii) more multiple insertions (12.9 per cent of specimens vs. 9.9 per cent) and more bloody fluids (5.4 per cent specimens vs. 4.4 per cent)
