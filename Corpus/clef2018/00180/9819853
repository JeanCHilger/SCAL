Three-dimensional ultrasound evaluation of fetal tooth germs. A total of 126 genetic syndromes are associated with oligodontia or anodontia. The most frequent of these are ectodermal dysplasias, all types of facial cleft and Down's syndrome. With the advent of three-dimensional ultrasonography, accurate assessment of many fetal abnormalities has become possible. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of three-dimensional ultrasonography in the visualization of fetal tooth germs.We examined 45 women with singleton pregnancies between 16 and 36 gestational weeks who were undergoing routine ultrasound check-ups for fetal tooth germs with conventional two-dimensional ultrasonography, followed by three-dimensional ultrasonography using multiplanar reconstruction.In the 45 fetuses studied, fetal tooth germs were visualized at the first attempt in 36 cases (80%). In the group of fetuses aged between 19 and 36 weeks of gestation, the overall detection rate in both jaws was at least 86% for three-dimensional ultrasonography, compared to at least 56% for two-dimensional ultrasonography.Three-dimensional ultrasonography was clearly superior to conventional ultrasonography in the visualization and evaluation of fetal tooth germs. Three-dimensional ultrasonography therefore has a potential for enhanced visualization of fetal tooth germs and may aid in the antenatal detection of syndromes associated with oligodontia or anodontia.
