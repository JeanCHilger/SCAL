Bisegmental rotational fracture dislocation of the pediatric cervical spine. A case report. A case of a bisegmental rotational fracture dislocation in the pediatric cervical spine is presented.To highlight the problems in the diagnostics and surgical management of this rare type of injury.Fractures of the cervical spine are relatively uncommon in childhood. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a bisegmental rotational fracture dislocation in the pediatric cervical spine managed by a combined anteroposterior approach.A 6-year-old girl was hit by a car as a pedestrian. In addition to an open fracture dislocation of the Lisfranc joint in the right foot, she sustained a bisegmental fracture dislocation at the lower cervical spine (C3-C5) with no neurologic deficit. The complete diagnosis of a locked rotational fracture dislocation could be established only by using computed tomography scans with three-dimensional reconstructions. The injury was managed with a combined anteroposterior open reduction and a bisegmental anterior fusion.Implant removal was performed after bony fusion 6 months after surgery. At follow-up assessment 2.5 years later, the girl had a good radiologic result and a full and pain-free functional recovery.Bisegmental rotational fracture dislocations in pediatric cervical spines are not easily diagnosed and may require three-dimensional computed tomography scan reconstructions for complete assessment. In such rare cases, a combined anteroposterior surgical procedure may be indicated, with a bisegmental anterior fusion providing a good functional result.
