Occipital pain in osteoid osteoma of the atlas. A report of two cases. Two cases of occipital pain caused by an osteoid osteoma of the atlas are presented.To describe the management of occipital pain in two young patients.Osteoid osteoma is a benign lesion mostly affecting the long bones. A spinal location is uncommon. To the authors' knowledge, there are only five other reports of an osteoid osteoma located in the atlas.Occipital headache, which was relieved by salicylates, was the major symptom reported by the two adolescents. In the first patient, a lesion of C1 was seen on plain radiographs. In the second patient, the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma was suggested by scintigraphic imaging and subsequently by computed tomography.Pain disappeared in both cases after surgical excision of the lesion. Histologic examination disclosed characteristic features of osteoid osteoma.Occipital pain in adolescents, which is relieved by aspirin, should raise suspicion about the possibility of an osteoid osteoma of the atlas. If standard cervical spine radiographs are negative, isotope scanning and computed tomography can help to establish the diagnosis. Complete excision eliminates the lesion and produces immediate relief for the patient.
