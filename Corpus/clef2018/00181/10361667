Seat belt fracture with late development of an enterocolic fistula in a child. A case report. A case report of a 9-year-old boy treated at a pediatric trauma center for a flexion-extension spiral fracture with late development of an enterocolic fistula subsequent to a high-velocity motor vehicle accident.To increase the awareness of possible delayed bowel complications associated with flexion-distraction injuries of the spine in children.Flexion-distraction fractures of the spine in children wearing lap seat belts, so-called "Chance" fractures, are an increasingly common result of high-velocity collisions. This type of fracture, referred to as a seat-belt fracture, is often associated with duodenal or jejunal tears. Although such intra-abdominal injuries are common in such fractures secondary to this type of trauma, the occurrence of an enterocolic fistula has never been reported.A review of all pediatric Chance fractures managed at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, as well as a literature review of all reported series of flexion-distraction injuries to the spine in children, were performed.The subtle and prolonged symptomatology of this lesion and its similarity to a cast syndrome is emphasized.Because the orthopedic surgeon is usually the primary care-giver for children with this type of seat-belt trauma, an appreciation of the possibility of a delayed onset enterocolic fistula with its symptomatology is essential to avoid prolonged morbidity.
