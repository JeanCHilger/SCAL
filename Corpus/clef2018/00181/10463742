Osteochondroma with compression of the spinal cord. A report of two cases. We report two cases of vertebral osteochondroma. In one patient a solitary cervical lesion presented as entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerve and in the other as a thoracic tumour associated with hereditary multiple exostoses producing paraplegia. We highlight the importance of an adequate preoperative evaluation in such patients.
