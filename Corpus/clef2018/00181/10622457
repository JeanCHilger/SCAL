Extended extradural spinal arachnoid cyst: an unusual cause of progressive spastic paraparesis. A 15-year old girl presented with a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis since the age of 12. Creatine kinase was slightly increased. Muscle biopsy carried out during tendon surgery for severe toe-walking showed 'myopathic' changes. Subsequent neurological evaluation and radiological studies revealed a large extradural arachnoid cyst extending from the 11th thoracic vertebra to the first lumbar vertebra. Her condition improved after operation. The 'myopathic' features turned out to be the result of chronic spinal compression. MRI is the method of choice to examine patients with non-hereditary progressive spastic paraparesis. Muscle biopsy and tendon surgery should not be performed, without careful neurological examination.
