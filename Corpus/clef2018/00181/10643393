Value of MRI in traumatic disco-ligament instability of the lower cervical spine. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for traumatic discoligamentous instabilities of the lower cervical spine was evaluated. MRI findings were correlated with the intraoperative findings. Fifteen patients were included in the study (11 males, 4 females, 33 years old on average). Indication for surgery was established with dynamic a.p. instability under fluoroscopy. In the operation, all patients showed complete traumatic rupture of the intervertebral disc. In contrast, MRI sequences revealed only eight mild and four severe disc lesions. Intraoperatively ruptures of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments were verified in 7 patients each. MRI studies depicted only five ruptures of the anterior and three ruptures of the posterior longitudinal ligaments. In three cases MRI demonstrated no pathological findings (3 of 15 false-negative results). MRI and intraoperative findings showed no statistical correlation. MRI is of only limited value in diagnosing traumatic discoligamentous instabilities of the lower cervical spine.
