Hartshill rectangle: failure of spinal stabilisation in acute spinal cord injury. A high rate of failure of the internal fixation of unstable spinal fractures in complete cord injured patients was noted in patients referred to the Salisbury Spinal Centre who had been stabilised with a Hartshill rectangle. This prompted a review of the operative notes, radiographs and clinical outcomes of all patients referred to the centre with a Hartshill rectangle in situ. All patients identified with a complete spinal cord injury and Hartshill rectangle were identified. Forty-three such patients referred from 13 different centres were found. Pre- and postoperative radiographs were assessed for fracture pattern and for spinal correction. Operative outcome in terms of pain and complications relating to surgery were identified. The most recent radiographs were assessed for signs of loss of reduction or stabilisation. Follow-up averaged 84 months (range 36-132 months). Of the 43 identified patients, 19 were found to have unsatisfactory stabilisation. Persistent pain, broken implants and worsening kyphosis were the main complications. The failure to use bone graft at the time of stabilisation was significantly (P < 0.001) related to risk of failure. The application and use of the Hartshill is not a technically challenging procedure however, if the system is to be used, it must be used correctly. Failure to correctly apply the rectangle and to use bone graft will lead to an unacceptably high rate of failure.
