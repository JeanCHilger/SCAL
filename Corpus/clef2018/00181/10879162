Craniocerebral trauma from bullets: the correlation between computed tomography, the clinical picture, neurosurgical treatment and the long-term sequelae. To demonstrate the usefulness of CT findings in the planning of brain neurosurgery in gunshot victims, for prompt and successful treatment.Thirty patients with brain gunshot wounds were examined with CT over 5 years. The patients were 27 men and 3 women whose mean age was 33 years (range: 17-56). Brain CT was carried out with thin (5-mm) slices and 10-mm gap dynamic scanning (3-mm interscan time) was used especially in case of posterior fossa involvement and diffuse brain damage. The examination was integrated with cervical scout views to detect bullets in the neck and cervical dislocation. CT follow-up was carried out in 20 patients 24 hours postoperatively and every 6 hours in 9 patients in a severe postoperative coma.Twelve intracranial hematomas and 9 subdural hematomas, 3 of them bilateral, were treated and hemorrhage was resolved in 8 lacerocontusive foci. Skull plastic surgery was carried out in 5 cases. Surgical maneuvers were most difficult in the 5 crash bone injuries with wedged splinters postoperative subarachnoid hemorrhage followed in 3 cases. Blood effusion in ventricles was drained in 6 casesIn our series the mortality rate of firearm wounds of the skull base was 34% higher than that of the hemisphere this is due to carotid hemorrhage and midbrain damage. Such traumas require emergency radiological diagnosis and neurosurgical treatment because of their severity and early irreversible complications. Complex operations and skilled surgeons may prevent disabling postoperative sequels. CT findings are indispensable and must be correctly interpreted. The radiologist and the neurosurgeon must collaborate closely and both must consider several diagnostic and prognostic factors affecting surgical planning.
