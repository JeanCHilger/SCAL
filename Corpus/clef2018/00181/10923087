Nuchal fibrocartilaginous pseudotumor in a 10-year-old girl. We report a case of a 10-year-old girl who, 4 years after a trauma to the neck, developed a soft tissue mass in the midline at the C5-6 level. The lesion was not attached to the bone and was composed of fibrocartilaginous tissue, similar to the nuchal fibrocartilaginous pseudotumor, a rare, recently reported condition that has been described in the medical literature in only 4 cases, all of them adults.
