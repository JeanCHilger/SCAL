Syringomyelia discovered in the course of peridural anesthesia. Neurological symptoms after epidural anaesthesia suggest complications due to anaesthetic procedure. We report the case of a child who underwent perineal surgery in a gynaecological position under general and epidural anaesthesia, who experienced the day after surgery hypoesthesia of the whole left lower limb without any motor deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging excluded spinal compression, but revealed syringomyelic cavity extending from T9 to T11. Electromyogram evaluation was normal. Clinical signs completely vanished within 24 hours. This case emphasizes that the apparition of neurological signs after central nerve blocks is not only a complication of regional anaesthesia, but may reveal unknown neuropathy or result from surgical position or surgical procedure. Meticulous neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging and electromyogram are immediately required.
