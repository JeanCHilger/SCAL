Clinical course and diagnosis of the acute craniocervical injury. Combined observation and treatment of 126 patients (80 men, 46 women) aged 15-67 years were carried out in the acute period of craniocerebral trauma of mild or moderate severity. Diagnostic methods including neurological examination, manual testing and X-ray investigation are discussed. The conclusion is made that craniocerebral trauma should be considered as craniocervical trauma as an indirect damage of the neck was revealed in each case in the form of myofascial syndrome pronounced in different degree cervical syndrome of vertebral artery was also frequent. These data must be taken into consideration in pathogenetic treatment of patients with craniocerebral trauma.
