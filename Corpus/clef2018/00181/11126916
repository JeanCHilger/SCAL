Congenital absence of a cervical pedicle: report of two cases and review of the literature. The congenital absence of a cervical pedicle is a rare clinical entity. Patients with this anomaly tend to present with cervical pain or after a traumatic incident. Initial evaluations with conventional radiography frequently lead to misinterpretation and misguided intervention. We report two cases of absent cervical pedicles and describe the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of these patients. Moreover, we review the literature on this clinical entity.The first patient was a 4-year-old boy who presented with neck pain after falling off a trampoline. His neurological examination did not reveal any focal abnormalities, but radiographs were thought to be consistent with a right, C4-C5, unilateral, jumped facet. The second patient was a 27-year-old woman who presented with severe neck, back, and left upper extremity pain and paresthesias after an alleged incident of spousal abuse. Her neurological examination results were remarkable for left upper extremity weakness and hemibody sensory changes. Conventional radiographs were thought to reveal a left, C3-C4, unilateral, locked facet.For both patients, reduction attempts were made with Gardner-Wells tongs and traction. After failure to achieve adequate reduction, evaluations using two-dimensional computed tomography confirmed congenitally absent cervical pedicles. Both patients were ultimately treated conservatively and experienced resolution of their presenting symptoms.The congenital absence of a cervical pedicle is a rare entity that is frequently misdiagnosed. Diagnoses can be accurately confirmed with two-dimensional computed tomography. Conservative treatment resulted in successful management of this clinical entity.
