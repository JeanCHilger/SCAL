Neuroblastoma producing spinal cord compression: rapid relief with low dose of radiation. Symptomatic spinal cord compression requires emergency treatment to alleviate symptoms and to avoid irreversible damage. We describe a successful decompression by low dose radiation to a progressing neuroblastoma in a child. Magnetic resonance imaging post radiation should be performed to assess the response of the tumor to radiation.
