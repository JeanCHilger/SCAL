Up-regulation of E2F-1 in Down's syndrome brain exhibiting neuropathological features of Alzheimer-type dementia. We studied the expression of the apoptosis-related protein, E2F-1, in Down's syndrome (DS) brains. The immunoreactivity for E2F-1 was detected in the pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex from DS brains exhibiting the neuropathological features of dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), in accordance with the amyloid beta protein (A beta) deposition in the neuron. Therefore, the implication is that A beta deposition may trigger E2F-1-mediated neuronal apoptosis in DS brains with DAT.
