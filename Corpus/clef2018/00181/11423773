Pneumocephalus secondary to a neck stab wound without neurologic injury in a 13-year-old girl. Pneumocephalus is usually caused by injury that damages the brain meninges and thus allows air to enter the intracranial cavity. Our intention was to establish the importance of considering a stab wound in the neck as a possible cause of traumatic pneumocephalus. The paper presents the case of a 13-year-old girl who was accidentally stabbed in the neck with a kitchen knife by her brother. She had no neurological deficit but had developed headaches. An examination showed cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the neck wound and a CT scan revealed the pneumocephalus. Following surgical treatment, the patient's clinical symptoms regressed. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of the manifestation of pneumocephalus as the result of a neck stab wound in a child overall, there are only three reported cases of pneumocephalus caused by a neck stab wound.
