Efficacy and safety of ethanol injections in 18 cases of vertebral hemangioma: a mean follow-up of 2 years. The clinical records and radiographs of 18 patients with vertebral hemangiomas treated with ethanol vertebroplasty were reviewed to evaluate the usefulness of this method.To assess, after a mean 2-year follow-up, the complication rate, results, and patient satisfaction with ethanol injection into vertebral hemangioma.There is controversy about the safety of ethanol injections in the treatment of vertebral hemangiomas.Twenty-four patients with vertebral hemangiomas were prepared for ethanol vertebroplasty. Eighteen patients were treated with ethanol vertebroplasty (average age, 49 years range, 18-77 years) with a mean follow-up of 2 years (range, 1-4 years). The rest of the patients were not treated with ethanol vertebroplasty because in a pretreatment test injection the contrast medium was not retained by the hemangioma.Intralesional injections of alcohol did not cause clinical complications in any of the cases.This study shows that intralesional alcohol injections can be considered a safe technique for vertebral hemangiomas. However, a careful technique is required.
