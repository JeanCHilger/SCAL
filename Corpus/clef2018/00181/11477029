The kick with the stick. To investigate the incidence and type of severe microscooter related injuries in adults.Data were collected between January and September 2000 from the University Hospital Berne, the only referral centre for major trauma in that city, using the software package Qualicare, which connects clinical data with categorised keywords, allowing the immediate localisation of patient groups with defined diagnosis or other clinical information.Only 0.2% of the patients treated had suffered a microscooter accident. There were five head injuries: three facial lacerations, one fractured mandible, and one cerebral concussion. One patient showed clinical signs of a cervical whiplash injury without radiological findings. There were also two cases of finger laceration and two of muscular contusions of the lower extremities.Although only a small proportion of the trauma cases were the result of riding microscooters, a system of injury surveillance should be started. Furthermore, protective gear should be worn particularly when microscooters are ridden in the street.
