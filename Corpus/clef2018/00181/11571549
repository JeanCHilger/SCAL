Paediatric absorbed doses from rotational panoramic radiography. To determine the paediatric doses in rotational panoramic radiography with film/screen and photostimulable phosphor receptors.A paediatric anthropomorphic head and neck phantom was used. Absorbed doses were measured for two panoramic systems, the Orthophos (Sirona Dental Systems, Bensheim, Germany) and the PM 2002 CC (Planmeca Oy, Helsinki, Finland), with and without programmable child settings, using both screen/film and photostimulable phosphor receptors.Absorbed doses to the eye ranged from 5 to 24 micro Gy. Doses to the dental arches with the Orthophos unit ranged from 50 to 555 micro Gy with the adult and from 27 to 436 micro Gy with the child program using the PM 2002 CC unit, doses ranged from 56 to 1040 micro Gy using the adult settings, and from 60 to 890 micro Gy with the paediatric settings. The paediatric exposure settings reduced doses at most locations for both panoramic systems. The highest doses were measured near the rotational axes of the X-ray beam. Paediatric settings with the Orthophos P10 resulted in the dose reduction more than 50% to the thyroid but not with the PM 2002 CC. When lower kVcp or mA settings were used, absorbed doses were effectively reduced for all combinations of machines, programs and detectors.Specific program settings for children reduced the absorbed doses from panoramic radiography irrespective of the machine or receptor used.
