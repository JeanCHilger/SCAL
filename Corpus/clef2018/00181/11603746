Trauma to the thoracic and lumbar spine in the adolescent. During adolescence the spine undergoes rapid growth and changes in anatomy and biomechanical properties. Fractures of the adolescent spine are relatively uncommon but may give rise to serious problems. This review describes thoracolumbar fractures in adolescents with respect to epidemiology, anatomy, mechanisms of injury, clinical and radiologic assessment, and nonoperative and operative treatment. The treatment of these injuries follows many of the same principles as spinal fractures in adults but nonoperative treatment is used more frequently because there is less spinal instability and better tolerance of bed rest and spinal immobilization in this young population.
