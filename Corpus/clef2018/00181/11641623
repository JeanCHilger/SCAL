Clinical significance of cervicomedullary deformity in Chiari II malformation. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a difference in the caudal extent of brain stem herniation and the degree of cervicomedullary deformity between symptomatic and asymptomatic Chiari II patients.Magnetic resonance imaging and the clinical presentation of 14 symptomatic and 59 asymptomatic patients were analyzed. The level of the cervicomedullary deformity below the foramen magnum was measured in both groups. The level of the deformity was identified by the cervical vertebral body or disc space level.Review of our results shows no obvious relationship between the level of cervicomedullary deformity and the presenting symptoms or the outcome after surgical decompression. We conclude that the level of herniation and the cervicomedullary deformity is not a reliable marker to determine which patients may become symptomatic and require decompression or to determine prognosis.
