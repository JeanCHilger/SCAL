Posterior cranial fossa dermoid in association with craniovertebral and cervical spinal anomaly: report of two cases. Two patients, a 12-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy, with congenital craniovertebral anomaly and Klippel-Feil syndrome also had a posterior cranial fossa dermoid. The association of these two discrete pathological lesions in the same individual is extremely rare. As both lesions are related to an embryological disorder, issues regarding the possible stage of dysgenesis are analyzed. The treatment options in such cases are discussed.
