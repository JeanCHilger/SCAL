Antenatal diagnosis of mirror-image dextrocardia in association with situs inversus and Turner's mosaicism. We describe the antenatal diagnosis of a fetus with mirror-image dextrocardia, complete situs inversus and Turner's mosaicism (45,XO/46,XY) that was artificially terminated at 19 weeks. Autopsy confirmed our initial findings. This case represents an unusual combination of anomalies rarely encountered in clinical practice.
