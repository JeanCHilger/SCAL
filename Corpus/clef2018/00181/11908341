Cervical spondylodiscitis: a rare complication of phonatory implants. Cervical spondylodiscitis is described more often in children than in adults. Many cases occur after cervical or facial surgery, usually as a complication after difficult intubation, endoscopy or foreign body extraction. We report the first case of cervical spondylodiscitis occurring subsequent to secondary tracheoesophageal puncture for implantation of a phonatory prosthesis. Signs were not specific leading to difficult diagnosis and treatment. We discuss the impact of bacterial contamination during tracheoesophageal puncture.
