Ultrasonography in trauma. The aim of this paper is to report on the possibilities of ultrasonography of the musculoskeletal system following traumatic injuries. Subsequent to clinical and radiologic examination, ultrasonography is able to confirm the primary diagnosis by dynamic comparison with a minimal expenditure of time and costs. The size, extent, and anatomic topography of tissue lesions are depicted. This paper focuses especially on the diagnosis of fluid within joints and soft tissues, the identification of foreign bodies, the diagnosis and follow-up of fractures, the diagnosis of infections (possibility of sonographically guided puncture), and musculotendinous injuries. Furthermore, the use of ultrasonography for the evaluation of postoperative pain and complications, the preoperative planning of metal removals, and its performance during spinal surgery are discussed. This paper deals with indications and technical tips for sonography as well as methodological limitations and sources of error in the evaluation of ultrasonographic findings.
