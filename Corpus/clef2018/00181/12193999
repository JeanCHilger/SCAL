Cotrel Dubousset instrumentation in occipito-cervico-thoracic fusion. There are today several techniques available for cervical fixation - all with inherent limitations and risks. In view of the drawbacks of wiring and screw fixation, which both presuppose good bone quality for stabilization, there is a need for a stable and safe fixation system that can also be used in osteoporotic bone. The objective of the present retrospective study was to assess the usefulness and safety of Cervical Cotrel Dubousset Instrumentation (CCDI), based on sublaminar hooks. The material comprises 60 consecutive patients, 28 men and 32 women, with a mean age of 57.3 years (range 17-84 years), operated on with CCDI. The diagnosis was trauma in 17 patients, rheumatoid arthritis in 16 patients, tumor in 20 patients and miscellaneous diagnoses in 7 patients. The material was dominated by severe pathologies, with neurological impairment in 17 patients (28%). Complications, subjective outcome and Frankel classification of neurological status pre- and postoperatively was documented. The patient outcome evaluation was excellent in 46%, good in 34%, fair in 10%, and poor in 10%. The physician's assessment was similar: 56% excellent, 27% good, 10% fair and 7% poor. Two patients improved by two Frankel grades, 7 by one and 47 patients had the same Frankel grade as preoperatively. Two patients deteriorated by one Frankel grade, one by three grades and one patient by four Frankel grades. Except for a 10% deep wound infection rate, there were few complications, with no evidence of neurological injury from the hooks in the spinal canal. The results of this study show that the cervical CDI system can be safely used for stable cervical fixation without need for external support in severe pathologies of the cervical spine.
