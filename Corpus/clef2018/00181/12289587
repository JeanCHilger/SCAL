Wilson v. Kuenzi, 17 May 1988. The parents of a child born with Down's Syndrome brought a wrongful birth action on their own behalf and a wrongful life action on the behalf of their child against their physician, claiming that he had failed to advise the mother of the availability of amniocentesis, thus precluding her from having an abortion to prevent birth.  The Court dismissed the actions, ruling that no such actions were recognized in Missouri in 1983, the time that the negligence of the physician was alleged to have occurred.  In 1988, other US courts held as follows with respect to wrongful birth, wrongful life, and wrongful pregnancy actions: 1) no recovery allowed for costs of rearing a healthy child born as a result of failed sterilization or abortion (Marciniak vs. Lundborg, Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, 15 November 1988 [147 Wis.2d 556]) (Johnson vs. University Hospitals of Cleveland, Court of Appeals of Ohio, 14 January 1988 [1988 Ohio App. Lexis 228])
