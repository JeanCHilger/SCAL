Management of the hyperextended fetal head. Hyperextension of the fetal head in utero is readily detectable by roentgenography and ultrasound scan. Management is determined by presentation of the fetus. There are three types of presentations: face presentation, star-gazing breech presentation, and the flying fetus presentation. Undiagnosed hyperextension of the fetal head is frequently associated with cervical cord injury.
