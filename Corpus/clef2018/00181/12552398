SCIWORA-syndrome. Case report and review of the literature. The SCIWORA-syndrome was firstly described by Pang and Wilberger in 1982 [11]. It is characterized by a neurological injury without radiological appearance. Since the standardized use of MRI in spinal cord diagnosis, the number of the "real" SCIWORA-syndromes decreases. By the case report of a 14 years old boy falling down from a wall of 2 meters height with a complete paraplegia from Th12 without radiographic abnormality (even in MRI) we will give a short review of the literature.
