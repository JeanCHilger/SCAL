Emergency department presentations of a rare tumor--extraosseous cervical paraspinal Ewing's sarcoma. We report the case of a 9-year-old boy who presented to our community-based Pediatric Emergency Department with complaints of neck pain, stiffness and upper extremity weakness. The symptoms were later identified to be due to cervical extraosseous paraspinal Ewing's sarcoma. The patient had a fatally aggressive clinical course. Cervical extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma is rarely reported in pediatrics. Ewing's sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with complaints of unremitting or recurring non-specific back or neck pain or neurological deficits. Appropriate diagnostic evaluation and treatment should be actively pursued.
