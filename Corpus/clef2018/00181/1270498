The management of thoracic and thoraco-lumbar injuries of the spine with neurological involvement. The results of treatment of injuries of the thoracic and thoraco-lumbar spine with neurological involvement have been reviewed in a retrospective study of 115 patients, of whom eighty-nine received conservative and twenty-six surgical treatment. Operation was reserved, in general, for patients with irreducible dislocations and incomplete neurological lesions, open reduction and internal fixation being the commonest procedure. Only three patients required a delayed spinal fusion for suspected instability after a period of conservative treatment. On the other hand, ten patients, eight of whom had been treated surgically, were left with severe chronic spinal pain. Of the patients treated conservatively, 35% showed significant neurological improvement compared to 38% of those treated surgically, but the latter group contained a much higher proportion of incomplete lesions with a far better prognosis. It is concluded that the place for early operation might be still further restricted.
