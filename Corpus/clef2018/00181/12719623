Age-related outcomes in persons with spinal cord injury: a summary paper. Etiology and level of injury often discriminate between age groups for persons with spinal cord injury, complicating the understanding of what role age actually has on outcomes. The age of the patient is sometimes used as a factor in determining the appropriateness of a referral to inpatient rehabilitation. When role of age is unclear or misunderstood, though, the referral and admission decision is subject to discrimination and ageism. This paper presents information that may assist in making more appropriate decisions. By reviewing the results of four studies examining the role of age-at-injury on the outcomes of persons with spinal cord injury, including such factors of functional improvement and discharge disposition, the overall effects of age can better be understood and more appropriate conclusions drawn.
