Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare, inflammatory, skeletal disease of unknown origin, which mainly affects children and adolescents in terms of cleido-spondylo-metaphysal skeletal inflammation. Only 10% of the patients are older than 20 years. To date, only about 200 cases have been reported in the literature. In the course of the disease, the initial radiological signs are osteolysis followed by sclerosis and hyperostosis in the end stage. The histological investigations reveal chronic inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes and hyperostosis. Although the prognosis of CRMO, to our current understanding, is self limiting, serious complications have been reported such as pathological fractures and compression fractures of the spine. A recently recommended therapy scheme is based on the administration of azithromycin combined with calcitonin. We present the case of a 25 year old female patient who has suffered from CRMO for 1.5 years with the cervical spine and the manubrium sterni being affected. The current state of diagnosis, therapy, and prognostic outlook of this rare disease are discussed.
