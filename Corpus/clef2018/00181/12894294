Cervical epidural haematoma with clivus fracture: case report. Clivus fractures are rare and severe entities, usually associated with vascular or cranial nerve lesions and frequently diagnosed postmortem. Cervical epidural haematomas can be traumatic or spontaneous, manifested in acute or chronic form, and are treated surgically in the majority of cases, although the conservative treatment also can be indicated to patients with incomplete and non-progressive deficits. The authors report the case of a female patient, 8 years old, victim of trampling in public way by a high velocity motorized vehicle, admitted in Glasgow 7, anisocoric pupils (left pupil midriatic), whose radiological investigation showed a transverse fracture of the clivus, cervical epidural haematoma and diffuse axonal injury. The patient was submitted to intracranial pressure monitorization, sedation and conservative treatment with dexamethasone, with good outcome. The authors also present a literature review.
