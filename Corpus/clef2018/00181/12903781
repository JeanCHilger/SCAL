The operative treatment of spinal fracture-dislocation without neurologic deficits. To evaluate the results of operative treatment of spinal fracture-dislocation without neurologic deficits.Eighteen patients with spinal fracture-dislocation were neurologically intact at the time of injury, and all were treated operatively. The fracture sites were: 8 cases in cervical spine, 3 cases in thoracic spine, and 7 cases in lumbar spine. Eight patients with cervical injuries had variant degrees of forward slide and kyphotic deformity. Of the 10 thoracic and lumbar fractures, one had lateral dislocation, 4 cases with kyphotic deformities, 5 cases with spinal canal compromise averaged 50% (ranging from 40% to 70%).The average period of follow-up was 4.4 years with a range of 11 months to 13 years. All the patients returned to full-time work. No patient developed neurologic deterioration. Kyphotic deformity was corrected in the 4 cases, and no progressive kyphosis was noted. There was no operation-related complication. The averaged post-operative hospitalization time was 13 days.Despite the rare incidence of spinal fracture-dislocation without neurologic deficits, we suggested that kind of fracture be considered unstable fracture because of its potential risk of delayed neurologic deterioration and kyphotic deformity, and be treated operatively to restore the sagittal alignment and the stability of the spine.
