Randomised trial of acupuncture compared with conventional massage and "sham" laser acupuncture for treatment of chronic neck pain - range of motion analysis. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of acupuncture on active motion of the cervical spine in patients with chronic neck pain with those of "sham" laser acupuncture and massage.177 patients with chronic neck pain were included in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. The patients were allocated by external randomization to five treatments over three weeks with acupuncture, massage and "sham" laser acupuncture. The range of active motion was measured by means of a 3D ultrasound real time motion analyzer.The analysis of cervical motion in three directions showed the largest increase in range of motion 14 days after acupuncture. Compared to massage, a significant improvement in total range of motion was seen in those patients treated by acupuncture immediately (p = 0,03) and one week (p = 0,03) weeks after therapy. There was no significant difference in those patients treated by sham laser acupuncture.The results of the study indicate that acupuncture is superior to conventional massage for improving active range of motion in patients with chronic neck pain. Because of its positive effects, its acceptance among patients and the lack of severe side effects, acupuncture can be recommended for the treatment of chronic neck pain, although there was no significant difference in results between "sham" laser acupuncture and acupuncture.
