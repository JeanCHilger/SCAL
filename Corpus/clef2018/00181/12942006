Effectiveness of titanium mesh cylindrical cages in anterior column reconstruction after thoracic and lumbar vertebral body resection. A retrospective cohort study with cross-sectional outcome analysis of patients who underwent anterior column reconstruction with a titanium mesh cage after single-level or multilevel thoracic or lumbar vertebrectomy.To radiographically evaluate the ability of titanium mesh cages to maintain alignment and facilitate osseous fusion after thoracolumbar vertebrectomy. Secondary objectives assessed complications and patient outcome.Titanium mesh cages with cancellous autograft bone for postvertebrectomy reconstruction of the thoracolumbar spine avoid some of the potential problems associated with the acquisition or use of structural autograft or allograft. There is little in the literature that describes the efficacy or outcomes of using cylindrical mesh titanium cages for postvertebrectomy reconstruction.The degree of kyphosis and the subsidence of the cage in relation to the vertebral endplates were measured in 43 of 57 (75%) patients available at a minimum of 2 years following titanium mesh cage reconstruction. Health-related quality of life and disability were assessed with various cross-sectional outcome measures.The average kyphosis of 25.4 degrees before surgery was reduced to 7.5 degrees immediately after surgery, and at final follow-up was measured to be 10.4 degrees. Cage subsidence averaged 0.28 and 0.20 cage fenestrations at the cephalad and caudal endplates, respectively. Osseous union (Grade 1 or 2) was identified in 93% of radiographs at the final follow-up. Thoracic reconstructions were significantly more likely to require surgical revision because of mechanical failure than thoracolumbar or lumbar reconstructions.The cylindrical mesh titanium cage is a successful adjunct in restoring and maintaining sagittal plane alignment after thoracolumbar vertebrectomy and, in this context, provides an effective method for anterior column reconstruction.
