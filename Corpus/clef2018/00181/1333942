The Askin tumor. The Askin tumor, a primitive malignant small-cell tumor of the chest wall, is mostly seen among children and adolescents. It is closely related to Ewing's sarcoma of the same location, both tumors showing a chromosomal translocation t(1122). Its origin from neuroectodermal cells is deducted from several ultrastructural details and from the expression of specific markers like NSE. Pain and deformation of the chest wall are the cardinal clinical signs of the tumor. Chest X-rays will frequently show destruction of ribs and pleural effusions. Effective therapy consists of radical surgery, local radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. This multimodal concept allows minority of patients to remain disease-free but the overall outcome is rather unfortunate.
