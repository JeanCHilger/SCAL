Disk herniations associated with compression instrumentation of lumbar flexion-distraction injuries. Flexion-distraction injuries are often treated by open reduction and fusion using compression instrumentation. Three cases that were complicated by disk herniation at the injured level, with an acquired neurologic deficit, are reported. Middle-column failure through the annulus fibrosis (Gertzbein and Court-Brown Type A) appeared to be a common feature. This may be a permissive condition for this complication as compression is applied across the torn annulus. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postreduction myelography may identify such herniations. Acquired neurologic deficits after reduction and instrumentation demand emergent evaluation and treatment.
