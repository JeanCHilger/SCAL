Neck range of motion and use of computer head controls. Head controls provide an alternative means of computer access. This study determined whether neck movement limitations are associated with reduced performance with such head controls. This study also identified features of the cursor movement path that could aid in assessing computer access limitations. Fifteen subjects without disabilities and ten subjects with disabilities received neck range of motion evaluations and performed computer exercises using head controls. Reduced neck range of motion was correlated with reduced accuracy (R2 = 93.5%) and speed (R2 = 79.5%) in icon selection. A model was developed with the use of cursor positioning time and number of velocity peaks to identify when a person was having difficulty with target acquisition (kappa = 0.81). Models such as this may allow head controls to adapt to a user's needs, accommodating difficulties resulting from neck range of motion limitations.
