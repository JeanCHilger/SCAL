The Executive summary of the federal report on available evidence for management of chronic central neuropathic pain following traumatic spinal cord injury is presented. This report is one in a series of technology assessment monographs commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services to define current state of the art in important health care issues. A comprehensive literature search led to conclusions about the diagnosis, assessment and natural history of central neuropathic pain.
