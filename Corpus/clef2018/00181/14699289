Congenital formation of an intraspinal osseous vertebral ring causing spinal cord compression. A unique case of the congenital formation of an intraspinal osseous vertebral ring causing spinal cord compression is reported.To our knowledge, such an osseous ring has not yet been described. The authors detail the clinical presentation, imaging, and treatment of the intraspinal osseous ring.There are two traditional categories of congenital vertebral anomalies, that of failure of formation and of segmentation. The authors propose that this ring may not fit into either of these categories and may represent a new category of failure of migration.Surgical decompression using a costotransversectomy approach was performed. Adequate decompression the spinal cord was achieved. Anterior and posterior fusions with instrumentation were used to stabilize the spinal cord.An intraspinal osseous vertebral ring is a unique anomaly that, to our knowledge, has not been reported to date. The authors discuss the pathology, imaging, and treatment of this unique condition.
