Spinal injuries in polytrauma patients. In about 30% of all multiple trauma patients, spinal injuries are found. The diagnostic and therapeutic procedure follows the five-step program for acute multiple trauma patients. Only in cases of open lesions or secondary deterioration of neurologic symptoms do we indicate an urgent operative treatment in step 3. All other patients should only be operated on after normalization of vital functions in step 5. The high risk for further complications is represented by the combination of thoracic spine lesions and lung contusion.
