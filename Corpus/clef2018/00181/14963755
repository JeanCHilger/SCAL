Spontaneous resolution of a Chiari I malformation associated syringomyelia in one child. A child with complete spontaneous resolution of a Chiari I malformation associated Syringomyelia without surgical intervention is presented. The child was followed clinically by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and remains neurologically stable after 8-years of follow-up. To our knowledge, only 6 pediatric cases with spontaneous resolution of a spinal cord syrinx documented by MRI without surgical intervention have been reported. This case is of interest in the light of the postulated theories to explain spontaneous resolution of syringomyelia.
