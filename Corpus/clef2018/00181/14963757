Spinal epidural rhabdomyosarcoma. We report an extremely rare case of rhabdomyosarcoma in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine. The MR imaging appearance of the lesion was nonspecific, and different from the one previously reported. The majority of the tumor was removed surgically less than a month from the onset of symptoms. Treatment was continued with spinal irradiation and chemotherapy, however diffuse leptomeningeal metastases were found six months later.
