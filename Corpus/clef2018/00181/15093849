A child with isolated Horner's syndrome after blunt neck trauma. Horner's syndrome is the triad of miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis that results from disruption of the sympathetic pathways between the brain and the eye. Although the individual signs of Horner's syndrome do not constitute an emergency, their presence makes any Horner's syndrome a potential vascular emergency due to the proximity of the internal carotid artery to the sympathetic ganglia. We present a case of Horner's syndrome in a 5-year-old child after blunt trauma to the neck, and discuss the management and implications of a potential carotid artery injury.
