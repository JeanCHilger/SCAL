C(1-2) posterior transarticular screw fixation (Magerl's technique) for patients with incompletely-reduced atlantoaxial dislocation. To assess the feasibility of performing the C(1-2) transarticular screw fixation (Magerl's technique) for patients whose C(1-2) dislocation could not be reduced completely.Nineteen consecutive patients (from 2001 Feb. to 2003 Jan.) underwent bilateral C(1-2) transarticular screw fixation, 8 of which had an incompletely-reduced atlantoaxial dislocation. The patients' clinical outcomes within- and after-operation were evaluated, and the screws position and fixation conditions were studied by postoperative CT.All the patients' symptoms had some improvement, no severe complications, such as injury of nerve or blood vessels, especially the vertebral arteries, were encountered. The screws were placed precisely, and purchased enough bone substance. Firm fixation obtained, no vertebral artery lesion occurred.For the patients who have atlantoaxial dislocation that could not be reduced completely, if there is enough bone to contain the screw, performing bilateral transarticular screw fixation (Magerl technique) is still feasible and safe.
