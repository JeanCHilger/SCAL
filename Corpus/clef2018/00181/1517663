The relationship between extended periods of immobility and decubitus ulcer formation in the acutely spinal cord-injured individual. Several variables may influence the development of decubitus ulcers during the acute treatment phase following spinal cord injury. Three independent variables were studied: level of injury, completeness of injury and length of time immobilized. Of these, length of immobilization exceeding 6 hours was associated with subsequent development of a sacral or occipital decubitus at a statistically significant level (p = .0094). The presence of a complete injury was associated with decubitus formation at a noticeable but statistically insignificant level (p = .0759). Cervical injuries were not associated with an increased rate of decubitus formation. Results suggested that initial treatment of acute spinal cord injuries should include the use of pressure relieving maneuvers or devices as soon as possible, especially in patients with anticipated extensive immobilization. Recognizing that risk of decubitus formation increases with immobilization time, the period of time involved in initial diagnosis and intervention should be kept to a minimum. This is particularly true in patients with complete spinal cord injuries.
