Interdisciplinary treatment strategy of aneurysmal bone cyst. In this report the management of an aneurysmal bone cyst in the cervicothoracic region of an 13-year-old girl is described. Aneurysmal bone cyst is a histologically benign lesion that is often extremely vascular. In the spine, it can cause extensive bone destruction and compress neural structures and this can result in high-grade tetraparesis. In the treatment a three-stage operation with radical total removal of the cyst from two posterior approaches and one anterior approach for osteosynthetic stabilisation gave an excellent result. The value of preoperative embolization to reduce tumor vascularity, allowing total excision without neurological deficits to the patient, is demonstrated.
