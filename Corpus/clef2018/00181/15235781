Traumatic vertebral artery dissection in an 8 year old boy. Dissections of extracranial brain supplying arteries are a common cause of ischemic strokes in young patients. Accidents are often accountable for that. We report the case of an 8 year old boy with traumatic vertebral dissection after he was bumped while playing football. He developed an ischemia on both sides of the thalamus which was caused by a bilateral system of the vertebral artery. He showed motor eye and progressive neuropsychological deficits. The CT and MRI scan confirmed the diagnosis. The symptoms ameliorated under anticoagulation treatment with intravenous heparin. At the end of the hospital stay, neuropsychological deficits persisted. Doppler ultrasound showed recanalization of the vertebral artery. Further treatment consisted of anticoagulation with marcumar for 6 months.
