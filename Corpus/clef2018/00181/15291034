Anterior atlas fracture following suboccipital decompression for Chiari I malformation. Report of two cases. Chiari I malformation, a congenital disorder involving downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, is often treated surgically by performing suboccipital craniectomy and C-1 laminectomy. The authors report two cases in which fracture of the anterior atlantal arch occurred during the postoperative period following Chiari I decompression and C-1 laminectomy causing significant neck pain. The findings indicate that interruption of the integrity of the posterior arch of C-1, iatrogenically or otherwise, confers increased risk of anterior arch fracture. A C-1 fracture should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior cervical pain in patients who have previously undergone decompression for Chiari I malformation.
