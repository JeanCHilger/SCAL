Factors associated with self-worth in young people with physical disabilities. Having a positive sense of self is associated with success for children and adults, with and without disabilities. This article reports on a cross-sectional study examining the correlates of global self-worth for 85 young people (ages eight to 23) with spina bifida (a condition present at birth) or spinal cord injury (an acquired condition). Significant correlations were found between perceptions of self-worth and age, perceived social support of close friends, and perceived social support from parents. Regression analysis revealed that perceived social support from parents was a stronger predictor of self-worth than gender, age, or diagnosis (onset of disability). Implications of this study for social work practice are discussed.
