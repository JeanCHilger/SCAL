A survey of current rehabilitation trends for burn injuries to the head and neck. Burn injuries to the face and neck present a unique challenge to the burn team and must be treated with considerable care and vigilance by the rehabilitation team to prevent potential contractures that may occur. Standard guidelines for treatment of the head and neck have not been established. This article presents the results of a comprehensive survey that examined the similarities and differences in the rehabilitation techniques used in various burn centers for the treatment of these injuries. The results obtained from the survey responses demonstrate several similarities in treatment throughout the continuum of care, revealing the potential for the development of a uniform rehabilitation protocol for the treatment of burn injuries to the face and neck.
