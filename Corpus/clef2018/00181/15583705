Indicators of psychological distress in postacute spinal cord injured individuals. Consecutive inclusion of spinal cord injured patients admitted for postacute rehabilitation from June 2000 to January 2002.Assessment of prevalence of indicators of psychological distress in the subacute and early chronic stages after acute-onset spinal cord injury (SCI).A Swedish rehabilitation center.In all, 36 patients participated. Psychological assessment was obtained at admission, discharge and 6 months follow-up by psychological measures based on the DSM-IV (ie Beck's Depression Inventory, SPIFA, SCID-screen, AUDIT) and clinical interview. Ongoing psychotropic medication was noted.Clinical depression was infrequent. However, ongoing psychotropic medication was common, possibly indicating a relatively high incidence of underlying depressive and anxiety disorders. In all, 25% of the sample showed indicators of high alcohol consumption. Few patients had a previously diagnosed personality disorder. By contrast, there was frequent occurrence of personality traits outside normal ranges.Medication of psychological problems commonly occurs after SCI, especially for depression and anxiety. There are indications of alcohol overconsumption in a substantial minority of SCI patients. The study raises the question of whether suppression of psychological symptoms by drug therapy is the optimal treatment of such problems in a rehabilitation process.
