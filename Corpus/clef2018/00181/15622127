Validation of an adaptive signal enhancer in intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials monitoring. The conventional approach of ensemble averaging in intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) monitoring requires more than 500 trials to extract a reliable waveform for neurologic diagnosis. Previous studies showed that an adaptive signal enhancer (ASE) could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of input signals. This study assessed the accuracy and efficiency of the ASE in the extraction of neurologic normal human and abnormal rat SEP. Cortical and subcortical SEP were taken from 16 subjects undergoing scoliosis surgery. SEP extracted by ASE were compared with those obtained with 500-trial averaging in terms of peak latency, amplitude, and waveforms using correlation coefficients. An animal study composed of 18 rats was used to test the ASE in detecting abnormal SEP changes due to spinal cord compression. The results demonstrate the accuracy of ASE by showing very high correlations between ASE-processed SEP and ensemble averaging-processed SEP in waveforms, peak latencies, and amplitudes. The results also show the efficiency of the ASE in extracting SEP waveforms from 50 input trials, which provided waveforms of sufficiently high quality and latency/amplitude measurements equivalent to those obtained in 500 trials of conventional ensemble averaging. Because of its fast extraction ability, adaptive signal enhancement could be an appropriate alternative to conventional ensemble averaging in intraoperative spinal cord monitoring.
