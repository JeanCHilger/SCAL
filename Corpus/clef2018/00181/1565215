Intracranial lipomas. Intracranial lipomas are very rare tumors, mostly being localized in the midline and often asymptomatic. We report on three children with intracranial lipomas (one with extension to the cervical spinal cord) diagnosed by CT and/or MR. All three had different symptoms and neurological signs. We summarize the case reports in the literature since the CT-era.
