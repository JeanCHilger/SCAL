Spinal cord compression due to vertebral osteochondroma: report of two cases. Osteochondroma, or exostosis, is the most common of all benign bone tumors. Spinal osteochondromas are uncommon but may cause neurological compromise. We report two cases of spinal cord compression by osteochondromas. One patient was a 17-year-old man with hereditary multiple exostoses who was presented with spastic paraparesis, a sensory level at T3-T4, and a pyramidal syndrome. Vertebral exostosis was suspected by magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed by histological examination. Surgical decompression was followed by complete resolution of the neurological impairments. The other patient was a 19-year-old man with spastic paralysis of the right lower limb and a pyramidal syndrome. Whereas magnetic resonance imaging suggested a neurofibroma, histological features were those of osteochondroma. Nine months elapsed from symptom onset to surgery. This delay led to residual neurological impairments, which resolved almost completely after rehabilitation therapy. Vertebral osteochondromas contribute only 1.3-4.1% of all osteochondromas. The lesion may be solitary or a manifestation of hereditary multiple exostosis. Magnetic resonance imaging shows the exact location of the lesion, most notably with relation to neighboring neurological structures. Spinal cord compression is uncommon and usually has a favorable outcome provided surgical decompression is performed before major neurological damage develops.
