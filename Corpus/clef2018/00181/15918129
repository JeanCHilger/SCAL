Discomforts and injuries of the spine and medical examinations in young talented female gymnasts. The distribution of pain and injuries in gymnasts is dependent on the quality of training, but also on sport-medical supervision. In a retrospective analysis 41 female gymnasts aged 11 +/- 2.8 years training 14 h/week filled in a questionnaire on pain and injuries as well as on frequency of sports medical and spine specific examinations. 14 reported partly recurring pain mainly in the lumbar spine and 10 injuries mainly in the cervical spine. Medical treatment needed 6 after recurring pain and 6 after the injuries. Except 3 gymnasts all had been investigated medically at least once, in the mean 1.5 years, after beginning with intensive training. The clinical investigation included an investigation of the spine in 64 % out of which (2/3) received additional x-ray diagnostics. Only among the older participants scoliosis and spondylolisthesis where found twice each. Though no connection between pain or injury was found in relation to previous medical investigation, a thorough clinical and in case of doubt additional radiological investigation of the spine should be performed before intensive training.
