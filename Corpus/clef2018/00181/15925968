Treatment of traumatic rotatory atlanto-axial subluxation in childhood. Case report and literature review. Cervical spine injuries are rare in children. They tend to occur predominantly in the region of atlanto-axial articulation. Even traumatic rotatory atlanto-axial subluxation (AAD) has been described in the literature, however, there is no consistent therapeutic protocol. We report on a 4 year old girl with an acute traumatic rotatory atlanto-axial subluxation treated with closed reduction and retention in a hard-collar. Control CT scans and physical examination after 6 weeks revealed an excellent outcome without any signs of recurrence. As there is a correlation between outcome and increasing length of the dislocation-therapy interval, optimal management of acute rotatory atlanto-axial subluxation depends on early diagnosis with plain radiography and CT scans. Timely diagnosed cases may be treated successfully with closed reduction and cervical immobilisation in a hard-collar. Failure to obtain reduction and recurrence are an appropriate indication for surgical intervention.
