Juguler vein gunshot injury from blank cartridges. Blank cartridge guns, which are produced for self-defence needs and considered harmless, can be easily purchased by adults due to lack of legal regulations. We present this case because injuries caused by gunshot from blank cartridges may be fatal and are rarely encountered in emergency departments. A 3-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department since he had a wound on his neck caused accidentally by gunshot from blank cartridges. He had a moderate general condition and pale appearance. There was an irregular-edged, defective wound 2 cm above the sternal notch in midline localization with a dimension of 3 x 4 cm. Computed tomography of the thorax revealed contusion in the apex of the left lung. A 2-mm plastic piece embedded in the left internal jugular vein was removed during the operation. A mass education on danger and harm of these guns as well as legal regulations for restricted use seem to be necessary. Also, physicians should keep in mind that blank cartridge guns can cause fatal injuries.
