Reduced cold pressor pain tolerance in non-recovered whiplash patients: a 1-year prospective study. Whiplash injury and chronic whiplash syndrome represent major health problems in certain western communities, pain being the main symptom. Sensitization of the nociceptive system may play a role for non-recovery after whiplash injury.This study examined if tolerance to endure pain stimuli may predict outcome in whiplash injury. In a prospective fashion, 141 acute whiplash patients exposed to rear-end car collision (WAD grade 1-3) and 40 ankle-injured controls were followed and exposed to a cold pressor test, respectively, 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the injury. VAS score of pain and discomfort was obtained before, during and after immersion of the dominant hand into cold water for 2 min. The McGill Pain Questionnaire showed that ankle-injured controls had higher initial pain scores than the corresponding whiplash group, while whiplash-injured subjects had higher scores at 6 months pain scores being similar at other time points. No difference was found in cold pressor pain between recovered whiplash patients and ankle-injured subjects. Non-recovery was only encountered in whiplash injury. Eleven non-recovered whiplash patients (defined as: handicap after 1 year) showed reduced time to peak pain from 1 week to 3 months (P<0.001), 6 months (P<0.01), but not 12 months after the injury. A larger pain area was seen in non-recovered vs. recovered whiplash-injured subjects during the entire observation period (P<0.001). Non-recovery after whiplash was associated with initially reduced cold pressor pain endurance and increased peak pain, suggesting that dysfunction of central pain modulating control systems plays a role in chronic pain after acute whiplash injury.
