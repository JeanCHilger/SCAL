Usefulness of computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstructions in visualization of cervical spine malformation of a child with Sprengel's deformity. The Sprengel's deformity is a congenital anomaly of the shoulder girdle with an elevation of the scapula and limitation of movement of the shoulder. Sprengel's deformity is frequently associated with cervical spine malformations such as: spinal synostosis, spina bifida and an abnormal omovertebral fibrous, cartilaginous or osseus connection. The diagnosis of Sprengel's deformity is based on a clinical examination and radiological procedures. In every case of Sprengel's deformity plain radiography and computed tomography should be performed. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions allow to visualize precise topography and spatial proportions of examined bone structures. 3D reconstruction also enables an optional rotation of visualized bone structures in order to clarify the anatomical abnormalities and to plan surgical treatment.
