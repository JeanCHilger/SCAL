Radiological features during and following treatment of spinal tuberculosis. A retrospective study was performed in order to document the sequence and time scale of radiological changes occurring during the healing of spinal tuberculosis. 28 episodes occurred in 26 patients, of whom only two were Caucasian. All demonstrated good response to conventional chemotherapy. Soft-tissue masses increased in size for up to 1.5 months and took about 12 months to resolve. Bone destruction was seen in all cases and progressed in 70% of patients, whilst on treatment. There was loss of vertebral body height in 79%, which progressed for up to 14 months any recovery of height was a very late feature. Sclerosis was seen at presentation in 52% and developed in most of the remaining patients within 5 months of instigating treatment. It progressed for up to 14 months and took, on average, 31 months to return to normal. Reduction in disc height was commonly seen and the vertebrae fused in three-quarters of those affected, the time of onset of fusion being very variable. To manage patients with spinal tuberculosis, an appreciation of the variability of radiological changes that can occur during treatment is necessary.
