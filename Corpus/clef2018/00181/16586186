Effects of vibratory stimulation on sexual response in women with spinal cord injury. Women with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) have predictable alterations in sexual responses. They commonly have a decreased ability to achieve genital sexual arousal. This study determined whether the use of vibratory stimulation would result in increased genital arousal as measured by vaginal pulse amplitude in women with SCIs. Subjects included 46 women with SCIs and 11 nondisabled control subjects. Results revealed vibratory clitoral stimulation resulted in increased vaginal pulse amplitude as compared with manual clitoral stimulation in both SCI and nondisabled subjects however, these differences were not statistically significant. Subjective levels of arousal were also compared between SCI and nondisabled control subjects. Both vibratory and manual clitoral stimulation resulted in significantly increased arousal levels in both groups of subjects
