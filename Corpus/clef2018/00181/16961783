Cervical spine joint hypermobility: a possible predisposing factor for new daily persistent headache. The objective of this study was to suggest that joint hypermobility (specifically of the cervical spine) is a predisposing factor for the development of new daily persistent headache (NDPH). Twelve individuals (10 female, 2 male) with primary NDPH were evaluated by one of two physical therapists. Each patient was tested for active cervical range of motion and for the presence of excessive intersegmental vertebral motion in the cervical spine. All patients were screened utilizing the Beighton score, which determines degree of systemic hypermobility. Eleven of the 12 NDPH patients were found to have cervical spine joint hypermobility. Ten of the 12 NDPH patients had evidence of widespread joint hypermobility with the Beighton score. Based on our findings we suggest that joint hypermobility, specifically of the cervical spine, may be a predisposing factor for the development of NDPH.
