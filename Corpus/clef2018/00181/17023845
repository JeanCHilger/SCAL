Rare bilateral C6 spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in an adolescent athlete: evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging and multidetector computerized tomography. Case report.To show a rare case of cervical spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis secondary to bilateral stress fractures at the pedicle laminar junction of C6 in a 16-year-old athlete playing high school baseball.The patient presented with 3 months of neck pain and intermittent right arm radicular symptoms.Plain radiographs and multidetector computerized tomography (CT) of the cervical spines.Plain radiographs revealed loss of lower cervical lordosis. Multidetector CT indicated bilateral C6 spondylolysis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral marrow edema at the pedicle laminar junction of C6.
