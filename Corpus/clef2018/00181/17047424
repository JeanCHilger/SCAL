A lateral cervical lipomyelomeningocele associated with diplomyelia. We report a case of a neonate with complex spinal dysraphism and associated anomalies of the axial skeleton. Based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, and recent advances in the understanding of human embryogenesis, we formulate a hypothesis that such a presentation is the result of failure of normal gastrulation. A 1-day-old male neonate presented with multiple right-sided anomalies, including hypoplastic right face and decreased movement of the right upper extremity. Radiographic studies demonstrated absent right cervical hemivertebrae, right cervical lipomyelomeningocele, and cervical diplomyelia with right hemicord terminating in a blind pouch. Anterior and posterior cervical and thoracic fusion with instrumentation was performed at the age of 3 years, and on follow-up the patient had improvement in right upper extremity strength. Complex spinal dysraphism is a pathological process that occurs during different stages in human development. We describe a case involving a rare lateral lipomyelomeningocele in the cervical-thoracic area.
