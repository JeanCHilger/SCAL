Hematologic abnormalities within the first week after acute isolated traumatic cervical spinal cord injury: a case-control cohort study. Case-control cohort study.To evaluate 1) the hematologic abnormalities within the first week following isolated acute cervical spine trauma or spinal cord injury (SCI) and 2) the influence of age, sex, and severity of SCI on these hematologic abnormalities.Given that autonomic nervous system has a critical role in the regulation of the hematopoietic system, we sought to evaluate the potential association between hematologic abnormalities within the first week posttrauma and the severity of SCI.All consecutive individuals with isolated acute cervical spine trauma admitted to our institution from 1998 to 2000 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria included preexisting medical comorbidities and polytrauma. The study population was divided into a SCI group and a control group (individuals with spine trauma without neurologic impairment). The SCI group was subdivided into patients with motor complete SCI (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] Grades A/B) and individuals with motor incomplete SCI (ASIA Grades C/D).There were 21 SCI individuals (15 male, 6 female ages 17-83 yearsOur results indicate that patients with isolated cervical SCI have significantly greater frequency of RHC, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia than controls during the first week posttrauma. The degree of RHC and lymphopenia was significantly associated with the severity of SCI. While the mechanisms underlying these clinically important hematologic consequences of SCI remain undetermined, evidence from the literature suggests that acute autonomic denervation of the hematopoietic system could play a key role.
