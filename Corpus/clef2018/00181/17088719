Operative treatment of complex lombosacral fracture dislocation: L5 chance fracture with trans S1-S2 dislocation. Sacral fractures are uncommon injuries that are often diagnosed late, the transverse fracture dislocation of the sacrum at the S1-S2 level associated with a L5 Chance fracture has never been reported. The purpose of this report is to describe operative treatment of transverse fracture dislocation of the sacrum at the S1-S2 level associated with a L5 Chance fracture. A 17-year-old woman sustained multiple injuries in a road accident and presented with hypovolumic shock. Radiological assessment demonstrated transverse fracture dislocation of the sacrum at the S1-S2 level associated with a L5 Chance-fracture. Neurologic examination demonstrated L5 root deficit and perineal hypoesthesia. Operative treatment was undertaken. The procedure consisted of laminectomy of L5, S1, and S2 and osteosynthesis of L3-L4 - S3-S4 (in sacral alae). Attempts to reduce dislocation failed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. One year after operative treatment the patient presented no neurologic deficit and had resumed normal activity. Follow-up radiological imaging demonstrated consolidation of fracture zones. Management for uncommon lumbrosacral junction injuries must take into account various parameters including hemodynamic condition, neurologic status, and stability of the spinal lesions. Decompression of neural impingement and stabilization of fractures by osteosynthesis appear to be a useful alternative that allows patients to stand again and begin rehabilitation quickly.
