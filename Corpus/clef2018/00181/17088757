Transverse sacral fracture in children: a case report presenting with neurological injury and review of the literature. Transverse fractures of the sacrum are exceptional in children. We report a case in a 10-year-old girl. The patient presented an isolated flexion fracture of the sacrum in Denis zone III (transverse "U" fracture) of S1-S2 with neurological signs at the initial examination: sensorial deficit in the perineum and sphincter dysfunction. Treatment consisted in laminectomy and bone resection to relieve compression causing the neurological injury. Orthopedic treatment led to correct bone healing. Outcome was favorable with complete resolution of the neurological deficit and stability at three years. Eight cases of transverse sacral fracture before the age of 18 years have been reported in the literature. The diagnostic elements are similar to those in adults, but can be missed in children who rarely present sacral fracture. The therapeutic approach has varied, both for children and adults. We advocate surgical treatment in the event of neurological complications and orthopedic treatment of stable bone lesions.
