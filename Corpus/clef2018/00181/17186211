The dorsal spondylodesis of rotationally unstable thoracic fractures. Is additional ventral stabilization necessary?. A total of 60 patients with solely dorsally reconstructed type C fractures of the thoracic spine admitted between January 2000 and December 2003 were retrospectively evaluated. Stability was determined by measuring kyphosis of the vertebral body, the operated segments and of lateral bending on the basis of plain films and computed tomography immediately postoperatively and after 2 and 19 months.There were 48% C2, 38% C1 and 13% C3 fractures. Of the injuries, 28% were caused by motorbike accidents, 25% by car accidents, 23% by falling from a height, 13% by suicidal jumps, 3% by ski accidents and 3% for other reasons. A total of 92% of the patients had severe thoracic trauma as attendant injuries, 42% further vertebral fractures, 35% a head injury, 30% an extremity fracture, 15% a clavicle fracture, 8% an abdominal trauma and 7% a fractured pelvis. At 19+/-12 months postoperatively, the angle of the operated segments increased by 4.7 degrees +/-4.0 degrees and that of lateral bending of the operated segments by 0.7 degrees +/-1.8 degrees compared to the immediate postoperative values.In spite of the high instability of the injured spine, the collective examined had no relevant postoperative loss of correction and no increase in lateral bending. Therefore, a solely dorsal reconstruction is sufficient, reasonable and economical.
