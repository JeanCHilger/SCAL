Unusual presentation of cervical spinal intramedullary arachnoid cyst in childhood: case report and review of the literature. The authors report a 7-year-old girl who presented with progressive quadriparesis which had started a month before admission. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine revealed an intramedullary cystic lesion extending from C(2) to C(4). After performing a C(2-5) laminectomy, the cyst was drained and anatomically fenestrated with the subarachnoid space by a 1-cm vertical median myelotomy without using a stent. The histopathological findings revealed arachnoid cyst. In the first month after operation, the neurological deficits disappeared gradually, except for a slight left upper paresis. Cervical spinal intramedullary arachnoid cyst is extremely rare and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intramedullary cystic lesions in childhood. Recovery is possible after subtotal excision and fenestration of the cyst to allow communication with the subarachnoid space even if neurological deficits are present for a long time.
