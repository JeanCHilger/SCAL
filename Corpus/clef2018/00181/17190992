Dumbbell-shaped paraganglioma of the cervical spine in a child. Paragangliomas are tumors arising from extra-adrenal paraganglia and account for 0.3% of all neoplasms. The carotid body and temporal bone are the most frequent sites of paraganglioma, though it has been reported to occur in almost every part of the body. Spinal paragangliomas are uncommon and mainly take the form of intradural compression of the cauda equina or thoracic cord. Extradural paragangliomas are still rare only few cases involving the dorsolumbar spine have been reported. We are reporting an interesting case of a dumbbell-shaped primary extradural paraganglioma of the cervical spine in an 8-year-old boy that presented with progressively increasing spastic quadriparesis.
