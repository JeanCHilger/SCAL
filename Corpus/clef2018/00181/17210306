Treatment of intramedullary spinal cysticercosis: report of 2 cases and review of literature. NCC, Taenia solium involvement in the central nervous system, is one of the most common parasitic diseases. Spinal IMC is one of the rarest forms of NCC.We report 2 cases (an 8-year-old child and a 35-year-old woman) of spinal IMC. Both cysts were dorsal in location. MRI was diagnostic in both cases. One case was treated surgically because of acute presentation. The other cyst healed with treatment with albendazole. Both patients had good clinical outcomes.With medical management, IMC may take 1 year to resolve on MRI.
