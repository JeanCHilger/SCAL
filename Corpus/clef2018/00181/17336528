Management of cervicomedullary compression in patients with congenital and acquired osseous-ligamentous pathologies. We present our experience in the diagnosis, surgical management and long-term follow-up of congenital and acquired osseous-ligamentous abnormalities or pathologies of the craniovertebral junction. The purpose of this study was: (i) to determine the incidence and degree of cervicomedullary compression in pediatric and young adult patients with congenital and acquired abnormalities, and (ii) to correlate cervicomedullary compression with other imaging and clinical factors to determine to what extend cervicomedullary compression is successfully treated with a posterior decompressive procedure, transoral decompression, and medical management. Between January 1995 and December 2004, 26 cases were managed in our department. These patients had: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (3) traumatic injury (2)
