Preimplantation genetic screening as an alternative to prenatal testing for Down syndrome: preferences of women undergoing in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment. Although the primary goal of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) is to increase pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment, it has been suggested that it may also be used as an alternative to prenatal testing for Down syndrome.Trade-off questionnaires.Two university centers for reproductive medicine.Two hundred forty-four subfertile women.Scenarios with different pregnancy chances after PGS and with different risk reductions of a Down syndrome pregnancy were presented.Willingness to have PGS performed in the various scenarios.In case PGS would discover all Down syndrome embryos without affecting pregnancy chances, 83% of the women would have PGS performed. If PGS lowered pregnancy chances from one in five to one in seven, 36% of the women preferred to have PGS performed. If PGS reduced the chance of a Down syndrome pregnancy with 80% without affecting pregnancy chances, 75% of the women would have PGS performed, and 31% of them would refrain from prenatal testing afterward.Most women favor PGS for Down syndrome screening, even if it is not 100% sensitive. The acceptability depends on the effect PGS has on pregnancy chances, and, to a lower extent on its sensitivity to detect Down syndrome embryos.
