Dexmedetomidine for conscious sedation in difficult awake fiberoptic intubation cases. Currently used methods of sedation for fiberoptic intubation such as benzodiazepines, propofol, or opioids have their limitations. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has been used clinically for its sympatholytic, analgesic, and sedative properties. We report on 4 patients with particularly difficult airways who underwent successful awake fiberoptic intubation with DEX. Dexmedetomidine was used to provide a moderate level of conscious sedation without causing respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability during fiberoptic intubation.
