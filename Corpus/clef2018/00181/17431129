Acute cervical traumatic spinal cord injury: MR imaging findings correlated with neurologic outcome--prospective study with 100 consecutive patients. To prospectively evaluate whether quantitative and qualitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging assessments after spinal cord injury (SCI) correlate with patient neurologic status and are predictive of outcome at long-term follow-up.The study included 100 patients (79 male, 21 female mean age, 45 yearsPatients with complete motor and sensory SCIs had more substantial MCC (P=.005), MSCC (P=.002), and lesion length (P=.005) than did patients with incomplete SCIs and those with no SCIs. Patients with complete SCIs also had higher frequencies of hemorrhage (P<.001), edema (P<.001), cord swelling (P=.001), stenosis (P=.01), and STI (P=.001). MCC (P=.012), MSCC (P=.014), and cord swelling (P<.001) correlated with baseline ASIA motor scores. MSCC (P=.028), hemorrhage (P<.001), and cord swelling (P=.029) were predictive of the neurologic outcome at follow-up. Hemorrhage (P<.001) and cord swelling (P=.002) correlated significantly with follow-up ASIA score after controlling for the baseline neurologic assessment.MSCC, spinal cord hemorrhage, and cord swelling are associated with a poor prognosis for neurologic recovery. Extent of MSCC is more reliable than presence of canal stenosis for predicting the neurologic outcome after SCI.
