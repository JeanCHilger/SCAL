Technique of the double nerve transfer to recover elbow flexion in C5, C6, or C5 to C7 brachial plexus palsy. In C5, C6, or C5-to-C7 root injuries, many surgical procedures have been proposed to restore active elbow flexion. Nerve grafts or nerve transfers are the main techniques being carried out. The transfer of ulnar nerve fascicles to the biceps branch of the musculocutaneous nerve is currently proposed to restore active elbow flexion. Recovery of biceps muscle function is generally sufficient to obtain elbow flexion. However, the strength of elbow flexion is sometimes weak because the brachialis muscle is not reinnervated. Therefore, the transfer of 1 fascicle of the median nerve to the brachialis branch of the musculocutaneous nerve may be proposed to improve strength of the elbow flexion. We describe the technique of this double transfer to restore elbow flexion. The results concerning 5 patients are presented.
