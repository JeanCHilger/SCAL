Non-missile penetrating injuries of the spine. Non-missile penetrating injuries of the spine accounted for 7% of all spinal injuries admitted to this Institute during the last 10 years. Young males were most commonly affected and 73% of the injuries involved the upper dorsal und cervical spine. They presented with varying degrees of neurological deficit. Plains x-rays revealed the bony injury and/or the retained foreign body satisfactorily. Myelography (with or without CT scan) was performed in patients with progressive neurological deterioration and those not responding to conservative therapy. Surgery remained the mainstay of treatment and improved neurological function in 7 out of 9 cases. Conservative management resulted in complications such as persistent CSF fistula, uncontrolled fulminant meningitis and septicaemia, with 100% mortality. Early surgical intervention is, therefore, recommended in all penetrating injuries of the spine.
