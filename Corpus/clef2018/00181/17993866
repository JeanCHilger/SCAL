Cervical spine fractures associated with maxillofacial trauma: an 11-year review. Although cervical spine injury is rarely associated with maxillofacial trauma, it should be suspected when injuries above the clavicle occur, as suggested in the Advanced Trauma Life Support Manual. A retrospective study of 2482 patients with maxillofacial trauma, who were admitted to the Maxillofacial Surgical Division of Turin University between 1996 and 2006, conducted to identify concomitant fractures of the cervical spine and establish a treatment protocol. Twenty-one patients (0.8%), consisting of 17 males and four females ranging in age from 15 to 70 years, had amyelic cervical spine fractures. In 90% of the cases, the cervical spine injury was caused by a road accident. Cervical spine injuries were diagnosed using lateral x-rays in three cases and with computed tomography in the remaining patients. Although an association has been reported between mandibular fracture and cervical spine injury, we did not observe a preferential association between injuries of the upper third of the face and spinal injury. Cervical spine immobilization should never be removed until cervical spine injury has been excluded using a lateral x-ray of the cervical spine. In males with significant blunt craniomaxillofacial trauma caused by high-energy impact accidents such as car and motorcycle accidents, computed tomography is the radiologic examination of first choice to exclude cervical spine injuries. Lastly, the presence of a cervical spine injury did not result in modified or delayed treatment of maxillofacial fractures, with the exception of one patient who had a fracture of the odontoid process.
