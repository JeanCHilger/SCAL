On the predictive value of radiological signs for the presence of dural lacerations related to fractures of the lower thoracic or lumbar spine. The predictive value of radiological signs for the presence of lacerations of the thoracolumbar dura in spine-injured patients could represent an important adjunct to the rationale for the optimal management, owing to the possible onset of early or delayed complications of these lesions. Occurrence of signs assumed to be related to dural tears, such as separation of the pedicles, fractures of the laminae, and encroachment of the spinal canal, was analyzed in a consecutive series of 25 patients submitted to surgical reduction and stabilization of the fractured lower thoracic or lumbar spine in a 24-month period. No statistically significant correlation was found between dural lacerations and any of the examined signs. Leaks of cerebrospinal fluid through traumatic breachs of the meninges were found in 16 of the 25 cases. The high rate of occurrence of dural lesions associated with fractures of the lower thoracic or lumbar spine adds a further argument to the aggressive approach to these injuries.
