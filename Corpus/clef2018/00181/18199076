Cervical column morphology in patients with skeletal open bite. To examine and compare the cervical column morphology in adult patients with skeletal open bite with the cervical column morphology of an adult control group with neutral occlusion and normal craniofacial morphology.A retrospective case-control study.Thirty-eight open bite patients, 27 women, aged 17-39 years, and 11 males, aged 18-40 years were compared with 21 controls, 15 females, aged 23-40 years, and six males aged 25-44 years from profile radiographs.From each individual a visual assessment of the cervical column and angular measurements of the craniofacial dimensions were performed on profile radiographs.In the open bite group 42.1% had cervical column body fusion, and 13.2% had posterior arch deficiency. The fusion always occurred between C2 and C3. Cervical column deviations occurred significantly more often in the open bite group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Associations were found between fusions of the cervical column and maxillary retrognathia (p < 0.05), large maxillary inclination (p < 0.05) and large cranial base angle (p < 0.05). Associations were also found between posterior arch deficiency and maxillary retrognathia (p < 0.05) and cranial base angle (p < 0.05). The craniofacial parameter most important for the fusions and posterior arch deficiency was the maxillary retrognathia (p < 0.01, R (2) = 0.20 p < 0.05, R (2) = 0.26, respectively).- New associations between skeletal open bite and cervical column deviations are described. It is suggested that this knowledge is incorporated in future diagnostic and orthodontic treatment planning.
