Traumatic spinal cord injury: accidental versus nonaccidental injury. A 21-month-old boy with steroid-dependent asthma presented to the emergency room with Glascow Coma Score (GCS) 3 and retinal hemorrhages. He was found to have subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage on computed tomography plus findings of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The caretaker history was thought to be inconsistent with the clinical and imaging features, and the patient was diagnosed with nonaccidental injury (NAI) and "shaken baby syndrome." The autopsy revealed a cranial impact site and fatal injury to the cervicomedullary junction. Biomechanical analysis provided further objective support that, although NAI could not be ruled out, the injuries could result from an accidental fall as consistently described by the caretaker.
