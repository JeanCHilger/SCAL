L2-L3 flexion-distraction injury treated by posterior fusion using ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene tape in a 7-year-old boy. A 7-year-old boy was sitting in the back seat of a car wearing a lap seatbelt when the car was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. Radiographs revealed mild scoliosis, anterior column compression of L3 and enlargement of both the intervertebral foramen and interspinous distance between L2 and L3. Computed tomography revealed bilateral L2-L3 facet joint disruption with fracture of the L2 spinous process. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed rupture of the posterior ligamentous complex. An open reduction and posterior fusion with autologous bone graft using 5-mm-wide ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene tape sublaminar wiring was performed. Three months after surgery, bony fusion of L2-L3 was observed. At 6 months after surgery, the patient was asymptomatic and had resumed previous activities.
