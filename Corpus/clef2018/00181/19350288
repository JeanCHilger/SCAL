The relationship between the type of destructive spondyloarthropathy and its 10 years ago cervical spine alignment. The objective of this retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between the type of destructive spondyloarthropathy (DSA) and its 10 years ago cervical spine alignment. DSA was reported as a serious complication of long-term hemodialysis. Although previous reports in regard to risk factor of DSA dealt with the period of hemodialysis and the patient's age upon commencement of hemodialysis, we could not find any reports of the relationship between the type of DSA and its 10 years ago cervical spine alignment. In 96 DSA patients who were the subjects of our study, 8 patients were defined as stage 1, 39 patients as stage 2, 5 patients as stage 3 type A, 11 patients as stage 3 type B, and 33 patients as stage 3 type D. The C2/C7 angle of stage 3 type B was statistically low. The number of the abnormal local cervical alignment was larger in stage 3 types A and B. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk factors of stage 3 types A and B were the C2/C7 angle and the existence of local abnormal alignment. Fifty-four patients were symptomatic due to DSA and treated at our hospital. Forty-four patients were treated conservatively with medications, physiotherapy, or wearing cervical brace. Ten patients underwent surgical treatment. The loss of physiological lordosis of cervical spine promoted the progression of DSA. Furthermore, the number of the abnormalities of local cervical alignment was statistically larger in stage 3 types A and B they were the crucial factor promoting the progression of DSA stage 3 types A and B.
