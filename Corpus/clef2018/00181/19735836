Prenatal diagnosis of a large, cervical, intraspinal, neurenteric cyst and postnatal outcome. Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital anomalies derived from the notochord and located in front of the spinal column, mostly at the cervical level. They consist of an intraspinal cystic component that is connected to a mediastinal or thoracic cyst. A case of a cervical, intraspinal, neurenteric cyst, diagnosed at 28 weeks of gestation and operated on at 3 and half months after birth, is reported. Herein, we discuss important features of this case including its rare occurrence, intrauterine diagnosis, and early surgical intervention. In conclusion, the nature of prenatal intradural cysts should be fully evaluated and differentiated between neurenteric cyst and other types of cysts with fetal ultrasonography. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of this potential cyst in fetal ultrasonography in utero. Neurenteric cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cervical intradural cystic lesions. In infants, successful surgery provides a cure in patients with cervical neurenteric cysts.
