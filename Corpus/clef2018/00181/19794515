Cortical activity and hand function restoration in a patient after spinal cord surgery. Following a motorcycle accident, a 9-year-old boy experienced a complete right-sided (dominant) arm and hand paralysis with total sensory loss, Horner syndrome and severe constant pain. This study assessed the long-term outcome of spinal cord surgery undertaken on the patient, focusing on the restored hand function and related cortical activity. The study follows on from previous reports on the same patient.Clinical functional and electrophysiological examinations. Functional MRI of cortical activity.Complete brachial plexus (C5-T1) avulsion from the spinal cord.Spinal cord surgery to restore motor trajectories.
