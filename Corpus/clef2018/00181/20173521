Atlantoaxial transarticular screw fixation: update on technique and outcomes in 269 patients. Transarticular screw (TAS) fixation is our preferred method for stable internal fixation of the atlantoaxial joint because of its excellent outcomes, versatility, and cost-effectiveness.In this article, we update our series of patients who have undergone TAS fixation, with attention to surgical technique, planning, complication avoidance, and anatomic suitability.We retrospectively reviewed 269 patients (150 women, 119 men average age, 52.9 yearsFusion was achieved in 99% of 198 patients monitored until fusion or nonunion requiring revision, or for 2 years. Forty-five patients had a complication, for a rate of 16.7%. Five early patients had vertebral artery injuries, 1 of which was bilateral and fatal. No recent patients had vertebral artery injuries. Other complications did not result in neurologic morbidity. Review of all atlantoaxial fusions by the senior author (R.I.A.) revealed that the TAS fixation technique could be successfully applied in 86.7% of sides considered. The main reasons for inapplicability were anatomic (recognized on preoperative planning) in 77% and abandonment secondary to concern about possible vertebral artery injury on the first side attempted in 13.8%.The placement of TASs is safe and effective for stabilizing the atlantoaxial articulation. Refinements in technique, such as 3-dimensional stereotactic workstation for trajectory planning, have reduced the rate of serious complications. Clinical outcomes are excellent, with nearly 100% of patients achieving stable bony union.
