Characteristic linear lesions and longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions in Chinese patients with neuromyelitis optica. To investigate the characteristics of the linear lesions and longitudinally extensive spinal cord (LESC) lesions in Chinese patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO).The medical records and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 29 patients with NMO were reviewed. The frequencies and distributions of linear and LESC lesions were compared against those displayed by 22 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Furthermore, the association of lesions with aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) antibody was investigated.The NMO patients had significantly more linear lesions than MS patients (48.3 vs 0%, p<0.001). In the NMO group, linear lesions were found in the medulla in 34.5% (10/29) of patients, across the medullospinal region in 10.3% (3/29) and in the spinal cord in 13.8% (4/29). LESC lesions can be seen more frequently in NMO than MS (72.4 vs 22.7%, p<0.001). In 93.1% (27/29) of the NMO cases, the axial section of the spinal MRI showed lesions on the central gray matter only, whilst the spinal lesions in MS were usually located in the peripheral white matter (72.7%, 16/22). The AQP4-IgG antibody was found to be associated with both linear and LESC lesions in NMO cases.High frequency of linear lesions and LESC lesions were found in Chinese patients with NMO and linear lesions were correlated with AQP4-IgG antibody.
