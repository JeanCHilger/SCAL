Treatment of thoracolumbar fractures by rehabilitation exercise using knee pads on the orthopedic traction bed. To discuss the clinical effectiveness in treating thoracolumbar fractures adopting the rehabilitation exercise utilizing knee pads on the orthopedic traction bed.From June 1996 to June 2006, we studied the clinical effectiveness of thoracolumbar fractures utilizing knee pads on the orthopedic traction bed for rehabilitation exercise. The cases surveyed total 209, 163 of which had full data. There were 98 males and 65 females with the age from 17 to 74 years (mean, 14.5 years). Consulting time after injury from 30 min to 7 days. Fracture site in T11 had 8 cases, in T12 24 cases, in L1 73 cases, in L2 33 cases, in L3 8 cases, in L4 3 cases, in T12 and L1 14 cases. Compression degree of vertebral anterior border: full compression had 1 case,more than 4/5 had 23, more than 2/3 had 67, more than 1/2 had 40, in 1/3 had 46.Among them, 8 cases with legs paresis no recovery in nerval function or stopping recovery changed methods, and underwent surgical treatment. Others 155 cases were followed up from 2 to 12 years with an average of 3 years and 4 months. The average height of vertebral anterior borders of the 169 injured compressed had increased from 1.55 cm before treatment to 2.70 cm after treatment with an average of 1.15 cm. The height of the injured vertebral anterior borders had recovered from 50.5% (1.55/3.07) before treatment to 89.4% (2.70/3.02) after treatment. Kyphosis angle of the injured vertebral bodies had recovered from 13.25 degrees to -1.6 degrees in average. Twenty-three cases associated with dislocation basic reduction.Rehabilitation exercise using knee pads on the orthopedic traction bed can obtain satisfactory clinical effect in treating thoracolumbar fractures, the method is easy. At 3, 7, 10 days after treatment, the height of bed should be adjusted according X-ray.
