Complete transection of the pelvi-ureteric junction in an adult. We present a unique case report of a 41-year-old man involved in a hit-and-run accident. The patient suffered a complete disruption of the pelvi-ureteric junction along with a fracture of the L3 transverse process. Occasionally seen in children, we believe this to be the first reported adult case. The report details the presentation and symptoms, with subsequent radiology. This case also demonstrates how using an effective multidisciplinary team approach and the ATLS principles, uncommon injuries can be identified and managed successfully. We revisit the classification of ureteric trauma and the accepted best surgical management.
