Can MRI of the neck compete with clinical findings in assessing danger to life for survivors of manual strangulation? A statistical analysis. The aim of the study was to examine the clinical forensic findings of strangulation according to their ability to differentiate between life-threatening and non-life-threatening strangulation, compare clinical and MRI findings of the neck and discuss a simple score for life-threatening strangulation (SLS).Forensic pathologists classified a continuous sample of 56 survivors of strangulation into life-threatening cases by clinical history and examination alone. Subjective, objective and radiological signs were evaluated for discriminating the two groups.In 27% of the cases life was in danger. The most significant signs of danger to life were congestive petechial hemorrhage in the face (eyes) hematoma of the neck and loss of consciousness. The radiological score could compete with the clinical scores.Clinical forensic findings differ significantly in non-life-threatening and life-threatening manual strangulation. Thanks to MRI a rather objective test for life-threatening strangulation can be added to a SLS.
