Injuries to the cervix in sexual assault victims. Little research has addressed the types and meaning of genital injury in sexual assault victims. An even smaller amount of research exists documenting injury to the cervix in sexual assault victims. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of cervical injuries in women following sexual assault, the types of injuries seen, the mechanisms that are related to the injuries, and the types of injuries related to each mechanism. A retrospective chart review was conducted. A total of 538 charts were examined, with a final sample size of 114. Within this sample, 87.8% (n= 100) presented with no injury to the cervix, and 12.3% (n= 14) had documented injury. All statistical analyses were nonsignificant however, clinical implications are noted. Recommendations for future research are made.
