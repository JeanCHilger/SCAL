Neuroblastoma in an adult: case report. Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid malignancy in children but rarely described in adults, being 10% of all cases diagnosed after the first decade of life. We report a 23 year-old black woman with a mass at paravertebral region of T3-T5, multiple lesions in vertebral bodies and expanding skull-brain lesion at the right parietal region. Immunohistochemical analysis (negative for CD99, CD20, CD3 and desmin and positive chromogranin, synaptophysin and NB84) confi rmed the diagnosis of neuroblastoma. The patient was submitted to 12 cycles of chemotherapy receiving VAC (vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) interspersed with ICE (ifosfamide/mesna/etoposide) and doxorubicin was replaced by actinomycin in the 7th cycle. She had good tolerance to this therapy, and has been clinically stable.
