Comparison of the diagnostic value of X-ray versus MRI in paediatric spine injuries. The evaluation of paediatric thoracic or lumbar compression fractures can be challenging. The anatomy of the growing spine often makes a correct diagnosis by plain radiography difficult. The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic reliability of X-Ray and that of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of acute compression fractures of the paediatric spine.From January to December 2008 20 patients (12 boys, 8 girls) who were treated because of clinically suspected compression fractures of the vertebra were included in our study. The average age was 8.3 years. In all cases a radiograph in two planes and an MRI of the lumbar and thoracic spine were obtained. Two orthopaedic surgeons and one radiologist retrospectively assessed the radiographs. The results were compared with the MRI findings.In six cases the MRI was normal, in one case there was only a bone bruise without compression of the vertebra. 13 children had two or more than two minor compression fractures (29 fractures altogether). The 5th and 6th thoracic vertebra predominated. In only two cases there was a corresponding result of all three physicians and the MRI. In 4 cases the observers agreed on the localisation of the fracture. There was no agreement about the number of fractured vertebrae.An exact evaluation of minor compression fractures of the pediatric spine with plain X-ray was not satisfactory.
