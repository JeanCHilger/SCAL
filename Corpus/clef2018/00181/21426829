Comparison of the grafting technique in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures:transpedicular intracorporeal versus posterolateral. To retrospectively investigate the outcome of transpedicular intracorporeal grafting and posterolateral grafting in treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.Forty-six patients treated with transpedicular intracorporeal grafting from January 1999 to December 2009 and followed up for 19-119 months (average 67 ± 13 months) were reviewed retrospectively, and were compared with 18 patients who had underwent posterolateral fusion during the same period through radiographic analysis. Radiographic measurements included Cobb angle, vertebral wedge angle (VWA), ratio between anterior and posterior vertebral height (APHR), upper inter-vertebral angle, lower inter-vertebral angle on X-ray, CT and MRI.In transpedicular intracorporeal grafting group, the VWA was corrected from 27.2° ± 6.5° to 7.0° ± 3.0° and the APHR from (53.3 ± 11.8)% to (92.3 ± 2.4)%. In posterolateral fusion group, the VWA was corrected from 23.9° ± 4.4° to 8.8° ± 2.1° and the APHR from (60.7 ± 10.0)% to (88.5 ± 3.3)%. Transpedicular intracorporeal grafting group showed better postoperative correction results than posterolateral fusion group (P < 0.05), and had less loss of correction of Cobb angle, VWA and APHR at final follow-up (P < 0.05).The transpedicular intracorporeal grafting can improve injured vertebral body morphology recovery better than posterolateral bone grafting, but can not prevent the late loss of correction after implant removal.
