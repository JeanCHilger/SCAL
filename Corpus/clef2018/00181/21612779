Injuries sustained in noncombat motor vehicle accidents during Operation Iraqi Freedom. To examine injuries sustained in noncombat motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) during Operation Iraqi Freedom by injury type, site, and severity.Three hundred and forty-eight military personnel injured in noncombat MVAs from March 2004-June 2007 were identified from clinical records completed near the point of injury.On average, personnel suffered two injuries per accident. The most frequent MVA mechanism was non-collision due to loss of control (30%). Overall, 16% were injured in a collision accident and 19% in a rollover accident. Rollovers were associated with more severe injuries. A greater proportion of drivers sustained head/neck/face injuries, whereas gunners and pedestrians had higher percents of extremity injuries.This analysis provides a thorough overview of injuries incurred in nonbattle MVAs in the combat environment. Future research should combine injury data with accident reports to elucidate areas for improvements in vehicle safety.
