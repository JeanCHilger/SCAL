Giant cell bone tumor of the thoracic spine presenting in late pregnancy. We report a case of a large giant cell tumor of the thoracic spine presenting with spinal cord compression during pregnancy.A 24-year-old woman presented at term with lower back pain, bilateral lower extremity weakness, numbness, and bowel and bladder incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spinal soft tissue mass compressing the spinal cord. The patient delivered a healthy girl by cesarean then underwent a T8-T9 laminectomy, posterior spinal decompression, and instrument fusion. Two days later, she had a thoracotomy, corpectomy of the vertebral body, and anterior tumor debulking. Ultimately, the patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation with improved lower extremity strength and returned bowel and bladder function.Obstetricians should be vigilant regarding progressive neurologic symptoms during pregnancy.
