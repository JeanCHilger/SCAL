Incidental findings from a retrospective study of 318 cone beam computed tomography consultation reports. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a three-dimensional radiographic technique used in planning implant therapy to help clinicians determine the volume and dimension of bone available for implant placement, and CBCT images potentially depict coincident findings.Three hundred eighteen patients received CBCT scans prior to receiving implants, which were interpreted by blinded board-certified oral and maxillofacial radiologists. All incidental findings were defined as non-tooth-related pathologies or abnormalities. These findings were categorized and analyzed using descriptive statistics.The patients ranged in age from 16 to 91 years (mean age for men, 64.73 ± 15.05 years for women, 62.47 ± 15.83 years). Controlling for age, men were 2.13 times more likely to have sinus pathology than women. Patients over age 65 were 5.01 times more likely to demonstrate vascular pathology (eg, carotid artery calcification) than patients ages 41 to 65CBCT scans frequently reveal non-tooth-related pathologies and/or abnormalities in the head and neck region. Therefore, comprehensive review of the entire CBCT image set is necessary.
