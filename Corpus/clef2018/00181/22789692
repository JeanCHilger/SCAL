An unusual cause of recurrent falls in an older gentleman. The authors present the case of an 82-year-old gentleman who was admitted through Accident & Emergency with a history of increasingly recurrent falls. A thorough history and examination led to the provisional diagnosis of cervical cord compression. Subsequent investigations confirmed an erosive abnormality around the odontoid peg, with an adjacent soft tissue mass. The patient underwent a partial odontoidectomy and the histological examination of the pannus revealed a basophilic crystalline arthropathy, consistent with pseudogout.
