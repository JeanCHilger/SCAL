Thoracic spine translocation without cord injury. We report three cases of thoracic spine translocation without neurological deficit. In each case bilateral pedicular fractures, demonstrated by computed tomography, produced 'floating arches' which account for the sparing of the cord. If computed tomography demonstrates adequate canal dimensions, these patients may be treated conservatively, but the treatment of choice at specialist spinal centres is operative stabilisation.
