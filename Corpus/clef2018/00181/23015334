Clinical results of surgical management in type II odontoid fracture: a preliminary report. This study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of     surgical approaches in type II odontoid fracture.In a     retrospective study in Mashhad university, 15 patients with anterior screw     fixation technique (ASF) and 31 patients with posterior approaches (PA) were     reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, length of hospital stay,     operation time, injury severity score (ISS), Preinjury Charlson comorbidity     index, fusion rate and surgical complications were analyzed in these two groups.Neck pain was the most common clinical presentation in these two groups     (89.7%). There were no significant differences in ISS and mean length of     hospital stay and Comorbidity index between the two groups. The operation time     was different between these two groups (65 minutes in ASF versus118 minutes in     PA, P < 0.05). Bone union was documented in 13 patients (87%) with ASF and 28     patients (90%) with PA.The outcome of surgery with anterior or     posterior approach in the patients are potential candidates for surgery is good.     In our patients, the operation time is different in the two groups but     differences in fusion rate, length of hospital stay, comorbidity index and     postsurgical complications are not considerable.
