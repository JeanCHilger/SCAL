Early mobilization with customized TLSO brace in thoracolumbar burst fractures. This study aimed to research the effectiveness of customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis treatment for stable burst type thoracolumbar vertebral fractures without neurological deficits.The study included 26 patients (14 males, 12 females mean age: 46.03 yearsMean pain and functional scores were 1.65 and 1.15 points, respectively, at the final follow-up. Twenty patients returned to their pre-trauma work and activities completely and six patients with small limitations. Mean period for returning to work was 3.64 (range: 2 to 6) months. Local kyphosis angle, sagittal index and height loss percentage values increased significantly at follow-up (p<0.05).The conservative treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures is widely accepted. Early mobilization with customized TLSO brace appears to produce effective functional results despite loss of vertebral body height.
