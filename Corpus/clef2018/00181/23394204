Finite element modelling of the cervical spinal cord injury -- clinical assessment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of Finite Element Method (FEM) modelling of the clinical cases of traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). The study population consisted of 28 patients suffering from traumatic cervical spine injury with (study group) and without (control) neurological deficits. A numerical simulation of the trauma event was performed, based on validated 3D FEM model. All the results obtained underwent statistical analysis. Statistically significant differences between both groups were found in severity of bony and neural structure damage as well as in stress and strain ratios. The highest values of tensile stress and deformation were noted in the sagittal (Y) axis. The maximum stress and strain were found in anterior spinothalamic, lateral spinothalamic and dorsal columns. It was also found that stress and strain in each segment and axis of the spinal cord model were positively correlated with the severity of the cervical spine injury (R-Spearman 0.39 to 0.64) and neurological symptoms of SCI (R-Spearman: 0.43 to 0.82). It is possible to create a clinical numerical model of the SCI with the use of FEM. The correlations between the mechanical force and neurological deficits show tendencies which require further studies based on an improved model and a greater number of patients.
