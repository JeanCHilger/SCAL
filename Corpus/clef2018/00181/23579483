Pediatric arrowshot injury to cervical spinal cord-sagittal cord transection with no neurological deficit and good outcome: case report and review of literature. Penetrating spinal cord injuries (PSCI) in cervical region are extremely rare in children. They mostly occur in a mechanism of a gunshot or a stab injury with the use of sharp objects. Gunshot injuries are usually fatal or end up with tetraplegia. Stab wounds may be less severe and result in partial neurological syndrome. In the management of PSCI in children, reliable diagnostics and history of the patient are the most valuable for further decisions, which include early or delayed exploration either nonsurgical treatment. There exist no clear algorithm for antibiotic use in pediatric population--it depends on the site of an injury, presence of pathological secretion from the wound, and nature of the trauma. The use of steroids is controversial. The most common complications related to surgery include infections, edema, and hemorrhage. They may also be associated with the migration of small residual microtraumatizing agent. The literature lacks algorithms for management in children.In this paper, an unusual case of almost total sagittal cervical cord transection is reported. The patient had no neurological symptoms and recovered with no complications. Diagnostic imaging on admission included X-ray and computed tomography. The patient underwent early surgical intervention with removal of foreign body from the cord and subsequent dural suturing. In the paper, the role of detailed history taking, adequate imaging, and drugs administration is discussed. The choice of distinct strategies is analyzed, and a revised literature review is presented in order to unify the management algorithm for pediatric PSCI.
