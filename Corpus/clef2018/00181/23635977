Rapid physical assessment of the injured child. Traumatic injuries that involve the dentition and maxillofacial region may occur as isolated events in pediatric patients but are often associated with multisystem injuries and traumatic brain injuries. The primary trauma survey serves to identify and treat life-threatening injuries. The secondary trauma survey is a complete examination of the patient after the stabilization of physiological parameters. Frequent neurologic and physical assessments of the injured child are crucial to preventing deterioration. The role of the dental professional is to identify and refer for medical evaluation patients who present with concerning neurologic signs and symptoms after traumatic injuries to the maxillofacial region.
