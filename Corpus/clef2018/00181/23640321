Training effects of combined resistance and proprioceptive neck muscle exercising. To investigate training effects of two different resistance and proprioceptive exercising concepts of neck muscles.Twenty-six healthy women participated in a randomized pilot trial. The test persons were randomized to two different neck-training programs (resistance training (RT) and proprioceptive resistance training (PRT)). They performed a standardized training program for the duration of ten weeks two times weekly. The neck strength, the cross-sectional area of three neck muscle groups (1. sternocleidomastoid muscles 2. multifidus and semispinalis cervicis musclesStrength gain did not differ significantly between the two resistance training groups (PRT group: 8.2% to 29.3% RT group: 1.4% to 19.8%). Change of hypertrophy of all neck muscle groups was significantly (p< 0.001 to p=0.013) greater in the PRT group (18.9% to 32.3%) than in the RT group (1.5% to 12.9%). The DJRE deteriorated with 35% in the RT group and did not change in PRT group (-2.0%).In combination with resistance training, proprioceptive training led to a significantly higher muscle hypertrophy and didn't effect a significant deterioration of the proprioceptive capability compared to isolated resistance training.
