Robotic loading during treadmill training enhances locomotor recovery in rats spinally transected as neonates. Loading on the limbs has a powerful influence on locomotion. In the present study, we examined whether robotic-enhanced loading during treadmill training improved locomotor recovery in rats that were spinally transected as neonates. A robotic device applied a force on the ankle of the hindlimb while the rats performed bipedal stepping on a treadmill. The robotic force enhanced loading during the stance phase of the step cycle. One group of spinally transected rats received 4 wk of bipedal treadmill training with robotic loading while another group received 4 wk of bipedal treadmill training but without robotic loading. The two groups exhibited similar stepping performance during baseline tests of bipedal treadmill stepping. However, after 4 wk, the spinally transected rats that received bipedal treadmill training with robotic loading performed significantly more weight-bearing steps than the bipedal treadmill training only group. Bipedal treadmill training with robotic loading enhanced the ankle trajectory and ankle velocity during the step cycle. Based on immunohistochemical analyses, the expression of the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin, was significantly greater in the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord of the rats that received bipedal treadmill training with robotic loading. These findings suggested that robotic loading during bipedal treadmill training improved the ability of the lumbar spinal cord to generate stepping. The results have implications for the use of robotic-enhanced gait training therapies that encourage motor learning after spinal cord injury.
