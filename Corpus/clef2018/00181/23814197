Aneurysmal bone cyst of thoracic spine: case report and brief review of literature. A 16-year-old girl was admitted with insidious onset, gradually progressive spastic sensori-motor paraparesis, with a sensory level at D10 dermatome without bowel or bladder involvement for the last 2 months following trivial trauma on the lower back. MRI of the spine showed a low-to-intermediate signal intensity, heterogeneous mass with multiple fluid levels. A diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst was made. A D8-D9 laminectomy with near total excision of mass was performed. Histopathology of the mass showed cyst cavity filled with haemorrhage surrounded by bony trabeculae confirming the diagnosis. Following excision the patient had excellent recovery. We report this case owing to its rarity and to emphasise the importance of surgery if there is cord compression.
