Traumatic L5-S1 spondylolisthesis in a 15-year-old: a case report. Traumatic spondylolisthesis is a rare injury resulting from complex trauma and high-energy mechanisms. We present a case report of traumatic spondylolisthesis at the L5-S1 disc space of a patient who was buried after a wall fell on his back. In the physical examination, bilaterally decreased muscle strength was observed. Examination images indicated a 90% slip at L5-S1. Surgical treatment was provided with a posterior and anterior approach using pedicle fixation and an anterior cage. After 4 months, there was significant recovery of muscle strength in the lower limbs.
