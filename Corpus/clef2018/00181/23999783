BLADE sequences in sagittal T2-weighted MR imaging of the cervical spine and spinal cord--lesion detection and clinical value. Using the BLADE (PROPELLER) technique for T2-weighted MR imaging of the cervical spine has proven to be a reliable tool for reducing artifacts typically for this region. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the application of BLADE sequences has an impact on the detection of small or low contrast spinal cord and epidural lesions.A standard TSE and a BLADE sequence were compared in 33 patients with 46 spinal cord and epidural lesions for T2-weighted sagittal imaging of the cervical spine. Image sharpness, visualization of the dura, reliability of spinal cord depiction as well as lesion contrast were evaluated by two independent readers. Additionally two experienced neuroradiologists selected in consensus the sequence they would prefer for diagnostic purposes. Statistical evaluations were performed using the sign and the Ï‡2 test.BLADE was significantly superior to TSE regarding image sharpness, visualization of the dura and reliability of spinal cord depiction. Regarding lesion contrast there was a positive trend towards the BLADE sequence. In 17 of 46 lesions, BLADE was judged superior to TSE, while TSE was favored in 10 lesions. In consensus reading both neuroradiologists preferred BLADE for overall image quality in 27 of 33 patients and for lesion contrast in 10 and TSE in 14 of the 33 patients, but 3 TSE sequences were rated as non-diagnostic regarding this criterion.For the detection of even small and low-contrast spinal cord lesions, BLADE is at least equivalent to TSE, yielding better overall image quality and fewer non-diagnostic images.
