Transient neurologic deficits associated with thoracic and lumbar spine trauma without fracture or dislocation. Two categories of persistent posttraumatic neurologic deficits of the spinal cord without evidence of a spinal fracture or dislocation have been described previously. Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCI-WORA) is seen in children. In the elderly, hyperextension injuries causing neurologic deficits without bony injury have also been described. The purpose of this report is to review mechanisms by which transient neurologic deficits occur in the absence of bony disruption. The authors describe four cases in which transient neurologic deficits occurred after blunt trauma to the thoracic or lumbar spine. Their experience indicates that, when neurologic deficits after trauma occur without fracture or dislocation, there is often an underlying structural susceptibility of the axial skeleton.
