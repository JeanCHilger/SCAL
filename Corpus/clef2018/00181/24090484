Measuring the impact of the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score among 458 consecutively treated patients. The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) was proposed to improve injury classification and guide surgical decision-making of thoracolumbar spinal trauma (TLST), but its impact on the care of patients has not been quantified.Retrospective study.Analysis of 458 patients treated for TLST trauma from 2000 through 2010 at a single center. Outcome measures Neurological status - ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS), failure of conservative treatment, and surgical complications.Clinical and radiological data were evaluated. Patients were grouped according to the period before (2000-2006) and after (2007-2010) utilization of the TLICS.From 2000 to 2006, 148 patients were initially treated conservatively (C) and 66 were surgically (S) treated. In the C group, the TLICS ranged from 1 to 7 (median 1 mean 1.57). In the S group, the TLICS ranged from 2 to 10 (median 2After introduction of the TLICS, there was a trend towards more successful conservative treatment with fewer conversions to surgical treatment.
