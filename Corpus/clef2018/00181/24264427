Outcome and morbidity of surgical resection of primary cervical and cervicothoracic neuroblastoma in children: a comparative analysis. Primary cervical (CN) and cervicothoracic neuroblastoma (CTN) is generally associated with good outcome however, surgical resection can be challenging and not without morbidity. The aim of this study is to assess the overall outcome and compare the clinico-radiological features, treatment, and complications of CN and CTN.Sixteen consecutive patients, (CN = 9, CTN = 7) treated between November 2006 and December 2012 were selected from the prospective database for this analysis.The 2-year overall and event-free survival of entire cohort is 100 and 72 %, respectively. Respiratory symptoms due to compression of airway and intraspinal extension were common in CTN. Gross total resection was feasible in all patients with CN in contrast, incomplete excision along with significantly longer duration of surgery and more blood loss occurred in CTN. Postoperative morbidity was seen in three patients with CN and only one patient with CTN. The extent of surgery did not affect the overall and event-free survival of CTN (p = NS).CN and CTN have characteristic clinico-radiological presentation and surgical specification. However, both have a favorable outcome, even though with a distinct but acceptable morbidity. The favorable outcome in CTN is unrelated to the extent of surgical excision.
