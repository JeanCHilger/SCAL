Activity-based therapy for recovery of walking in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury: results from a randomized clinical trial. To examine the effects of activity-based therapy (ABT) on neurologic function, walking ability, functional independence, metabolic health, and community participation.Randomized controlled trial with delayed treatment design.Outpatient program in a private, nonprofit rehabilitation hospital.Volunteer sample of adults (N=48 37 men and 11 womenA total of 9h/wk of ABT for 24 weeks including developmental sequencing resistance trainingNeurologic function (International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury) walking speed and endurance (10-meter walk test, 6-minute walk test, and Timed Up and Go test)Significant improvements in neurologic function were noted for experimental versus control groups (International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury total motor score [5.1±6.3 vs 0.9±5.0 P=.024] and lower extremity motor score [4.2±5.2 vs -0.6±4.2ABT has the potential to promote neurologic recovery and enhance walking ability in individuals with chronic, motor-incomplete SCI. However, further analysis is needed to determine for whom ABT is going to lead to meaningful clinical benefits.
