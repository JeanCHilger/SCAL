X-ray symptomatology and differential diagnosis of functional obstruction of the digestive tract in children induced by birth injuries of the spine and spinal cord. In 60 mixed-breed white rats and 60 puppies we simulated birth traumas of the cervical spine, the spinal medulla and spinal arteries with ischaemia of the cervical medulla. Clinical, neurological and roentgenological complex investigations of 174 children with similar birth injuries revealed pathogenetic relations between birth trauma of the spine, the medulla and the functional obturations of the intestinal tract as pylorospasms, spastic-hypotonic dyskinesia of the ileum and gastroesophageal reflux. Frequent complications were aspiration pneumonia, reflux oesophagitis, oesophageal stenosis and the development of intestinal invagination due to dysrhythmic iliac peristalsis.
