Diagnosis and conservative treatment of compression syndrome in lumbar osteochondrosis. The studies conducted provided evidence for a beneficial effect of long-term (1.5 -- 6 mos) combined conservative therapy for severe compression syndrome in lumbar osteochondrosis. There was no direct relationship between the degree of functional recovery and morphologic defect. Discal hernias located most frequently at the level LIV -- LV (26.3%) and LV -- SI (56.4%) of lumbar spine and were associated with vertebral canal 17 -- 55% stenosis and polyradicular lesions in the majority of cases.
