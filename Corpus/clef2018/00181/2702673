Cervical spinal deformity following craniotomy and upper cervical laminectomy for posterior fossa tumors in children. Spinal deformity is not usually regarded as a potential complication of posterior fossa tumor resection. After cervical subluxation had been recognized in 2 children following removal of posterior fossa tumors, a review was carried out to determine the incidence of this complication. Of the 72 children who had undergone resection of a posterior fossa tumor, 4 patients, including the original 2, developed a cervical spinal deformity. Factors that predisposed to this complication included laminectomy of C2 or lower, local wound complications and possibly post-operative neck weakness. It is important to be aware that cervical subluxation can occur after resection of posterior fossa tumors, when laminectomy extending below C1 has been performed. Patients at risk should be followed closely.
