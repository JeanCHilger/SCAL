Configuration of the cervical part of the spinal column in various age periods. In order to estimate pathological deformities of the spinal column, it is necessary to know its normal configuration during various age periods. For this 240 men and women in age groups from 15 up to 60 years and older, having not any complaints, have been investigated. Each patient is subjected to a standard x-ray examination of the cervical part of the spinal column in 2 projections with a subsequent roentgenography In the roentgenograms (lateral projection) angles between ventral bodies CII and CVII are measured, as well as angles in every segment. Indices of the cervical lordosis for every age group in men and women are estimated. The form of the cervical part of the spinal cord in men and women is not equal and changes in different age periods. During the middle age lordosis decreases both in men and women and again increases in the elderly age.
