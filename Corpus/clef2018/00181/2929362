Non-tropical pyomyositis in children--with report of severe neurological complications. Pyomyositis appears to occur rarely in temperate climate areas, compared with the incidence of the disease in the tropics. Three young adults with pyomyositis have previously been described in Israel, two of them were newly arrived Ethiopian immigrants. We report three Israeli children with pyomyositis, who presented initially with nonspecific abdominal pain in one child the course was complicated by spinal cord compression due to extension of the infected mass into the spinal canal. All three patients attained full recovery after antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. Computed tomography was most valuable in establishing the diagnosis and defining the extent of the process.
