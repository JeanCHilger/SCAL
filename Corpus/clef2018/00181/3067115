Collet-Sicard syndrome after minor head trauma. Occipital condyle fractures are rare and are usually associated with severe head and cervical spine injury. A 71-year-old man developed unilateral palsies of the 9th through 12th cranial nerves (Collet-Sicard syndrome) due to a fracture of the occipital condyle, which was diagnosed by computed tomography. He was treated conservatively and made a good recovery.
