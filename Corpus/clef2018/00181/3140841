The value of the ice water test in the management of the neurogenic bladder. Ice water tests (IWT) and gas cystometrograms were performed on 30 consecutive spinal cord injury in-patients on an intermittent catheterization program over a 6-month period. The tests were used to determine the presence of bladder reflex activity. A three-step grading system was formulated to clinically determine the degree of detrusor reflex activity on IWT. A 3+ IWT was used to indicate the expulsion of the catheter from the bladder and urethra following instillation of recently thawed ice a 2+ IWT meant voiding around the catheter after instillation of 90 ml of ice water
