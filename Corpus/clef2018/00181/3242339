Transverse syndrome in aneurysmal bone cyst. Among the patients of the Hospital for Neurosurgery in Leipzig treated in the period from 1952 to 1986 66 per cent of 570 patients operated on because of spinal cord tumours showed a benign and 34 per cent a malignant nature of the tumours. The rate of primary bone tumours amounted to 6.5 per cent and that of secondary bone tumours was 5.8 per cent. The preoperative diagnostical and the differential-diagnostical as well as therapeutical problems were dealt with on the basis of the only case of an aneurysmal bone cyst.
