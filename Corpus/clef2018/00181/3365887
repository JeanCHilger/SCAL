A modified technique for cervical facet fusions. Posterior facet fusion of the cervical spine has been described in the literature as a method of obtaining fusion when posterior elements are deficient because of previous laminectomy or trauma. The technique, as originally described, includes anchoring autologeneic struts of corticocancellous bone to the cervical spine with wires passed through drill holes in the inferior articular facets around the struts of bone graft. When long facet fusions are required, however, it may be impossible to obtain adequate length and shape of the grafts to bridge the desired fusion area. A technique is described that eliminates this problem by substituting thin Harrington compression rods for the autologeneic corticocancellous struts, and using cancellous and corticocancellous bone graft to achieve fusion.
