Spinal cord stimulation for the control of spasticity in patients with chronic spinal cord injury: II. Neurophysiologic observations. We sought neurophysiologic evidence that spinal cord stimulation could modify the behavior of spinal reflexes in 15 chronic SCI patients who showed the beneficial effect of SCS on spasticity. We studied the behavior of passive stretch, clonus, cutaneous touch, plantar reflex irradiation, and the response to the neck flexion reinforcement maneuver during spinal cord stimulation by use of surface PEMG recordings. Fifty-five percent of the responses were changed during spinal cord stimulation, but with widely varying patterns of response in individual patients. Exceptional patients showed changes in most or all responses most showed changes in two or three. Thirty of seventy-five responses showed a reduction in motor unit activity in the recordings. Eleven of seventy-five responses were increased. Excessive stimulation strength enhanced spasticity in patients in whom another stimulus setting suppressed spasticity. We conclude that spinal cord stimulation could modify segmental reflexes but that the effects were selective, probably dependent on the preserved segmental structures and ascending and descending pathways.
