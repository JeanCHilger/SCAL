Intervertebral disc calcification in children. Calcification of cervical intervertebral discs in children is due to an uncommon, but distinct, disease of unknown etiology. Signs and symptoms of nerve root or spinal cord compression are unusual and acute symptoms are followed by a benign course and spontaneous recovery. We describe a 5-year-old patient with symptomatic cervical disc calcification and discuss the relevant clinical and radiographic features.
