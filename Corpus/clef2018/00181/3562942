Spinal complications encountered in Larsen's syndrome. Apropos of 3 cases. The authors report 3 cases of Larsen's syndrome in which the spine was involved. There was one instability between C1 and C2 and another between C2 and C3. These two cases were treated by posterior grafting. All three cases presented with a severe thoraco lumbar kypho-scoliosis which was treated conservatively, but one of the scolioses had to be grafted later. It is concluded that cervical instability may be missed and needs to be looked for. The kypho-scoliosis appeared to be particularly progressive.
