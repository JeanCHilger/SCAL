Long-term results of surgically treated congenital intradural spinal arachnoid cysts. The authors report long-term results in 17 patients with surgically treated congenital intradural spinal arachnoid cysts. Comparison between the immediate and long-term results demonstrates that surgical removal of the cyst allowed a significant neurological improvement in all cases, but clinical worsening of various degrees was observed later. The authors attempt to explain the results in terms of mechanical and vascular factors.
