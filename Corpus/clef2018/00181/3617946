Torticollis--a harmless symptom?. Acquired non-traumatic torticollis may be due to a variety of causes. Presumably it may arise from inflammatory diseases and tumours of the neck as well as the central nervous system. Three cases of acquired torticollis due to osteomyelitis, retropharyngeal carcinoma and subluxation of the spine are presented and the variety of possible underlying diseases is demonstrated. Persistent torticollis should provoke an aggressive search for a specific aetiology by all means, especially CT scans or even biopsy.
