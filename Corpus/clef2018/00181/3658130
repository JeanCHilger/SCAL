Three-dimensional computed tomography in the diagnosis of vertebral column pathological conditions. Three-dimensional computed tomographic scanning is a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis and treatment of disease processes involving the spine. We present our experience with this noninvasive radiological diagnostic technique in 32 patients with vertebral column abnormalities ranging from craniovertebral junction disorders to fractures of lumbar vertebrae. The three-dimensional CT images often demonstrate pathological conditions and occult lesions that are not adequately defined by conventional radiographic means.
