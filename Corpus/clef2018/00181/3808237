Burning hands syndrome revisited. The burning hands syndrome of spinal cord injury was first described in 1977. The syndrome is characterized by burning dysesthesias and paresthesias in the hands and may be associated with either cervical fracture/dislocation or no detectable cervical spine abnormalities. A case of burning hands syndrome without cervical spine injury is presented in which somatosensory evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging were used to delineate the pathophysiology of this syndrome.
