Tracheal rupture in closed cervicothoracic injuries. Two cases are reported of tracheal fracture occurring during blunt cervico-thoracic trauma. The first case emphasized the impossibility of passing a tracheal tube below the fracture preoperatively, without the fibreoptic or rigid tracheoscope which has the added advantage of making an accurate diagnosis of the fracture. The clinical and paraclinical signs could only lead to a suspicion of the diagnosis, but not its confirmation. The second case showed the use of different ventilatory means during and after surgery (separate lung ventilation, jet ventilation, high frequency ventilation) in case of proximal fractures. The monitoring of intratracheal pressure should be used so as to have the best ventilation for the lowest pressures in the suture zone.
