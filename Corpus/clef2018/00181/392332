Spinal metastasis: current status and recommended guidelines for management. An overview of the current status of various aspects of spinal metastasis, including pathology, diagnosis, and management is presented. The cell type of the tumor, particularly with reference to its radiosensitivity, seems to be positively correlated with treatment outcome, regardless of the treatment modality. Because pretreatment neurological status also seems to influence prognosis, early identification of spinal involvement in patients at risk is important therefore, a high index of suspicion in patients known to have cancer is necessary. The most useful warning of impending spinal cord or nerve root compression is spinal or radicular pain, which usually precedes neurological deficit by days to years. An aggressive diagnostic evaluation of pain symptoms is therefore warranted
