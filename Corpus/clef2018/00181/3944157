Changes in the cervical spine in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. One hundred and twenty-one patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis were studied clinically and roentgenographically for evidence of disease of the cervical spine. None of the fifty-seven patients with pauciarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis had cervical symptoms or signs, and only one had minor roentgenographic changes of disease in the cervical spine. In contrast, clinical stiffness and roentgenographic changes in the cervical spine occurred commonly in the fifty-one patients with polyarticular-onset disease and in the thirteen patients with systemic-onset disease. Despite extensive roentgenographic involvement of the cervical spine, however, pain in the neck was not a common complaint. Neither severe pain in the neck nor torticollis, occurring either separately or concomitantly, is frequently found in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and its presence may suggest an intercurrent problem such as a fracture or infection. As patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis rarely have disease in the cervical spine alone, the patient should be carefully examined for involvement of multiple joints.
