Chronic traumatic aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta (19 cases). From 1973 through 1983, 19 cases of chronic traumatic aneurysms (CTA) were observed. Initial trauma was well documented in every case. Patients mean age at time of trauma was 22 mean age at time of surgery was 34. Sixty per cent of patients had no apparent thoracic injury at time of trauma. Ninety-five per cent had associated injuries. Ten/nineteen were asymptomatic. Eighteen were operated on. Rupture was complete in 11, partial in 7. One of the partial ruptures was a simple scar on the aorta. Eighteen were located at the site of the aortic isthmus, one was at level T8-T9. Seventeen had a prosthetic dacron graft sutured from inside the aneurysm. The case where a simple scar was found had a dacron wrapping. Spinal cord protection was used in all cases except in one who was already paraplegic preoperatively. Various shunts were used in 12 cases
