Clinical role of magnetic resonance imaging in the neurosurgical patient. The results of magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation in 18 patients with common neurosurgical problems, including cerebrovascular lesions, intracranial tumors, and craniovertebral junction pathological conditions, are presented. The results are compared with those of routine diagnostic studies. Overall, MR imaging was equivalent or superior to computed tomography in 16 of 18 cases. In 2 cases, MR demonstrated pathological changes when standard diagnostic imaging procedures failed to demonstrate the lesion responsible for the patient's deterioration. MR is a versatile, noninvasive imaging technique that is capable of demonstrating a wide range of disease processes, without exposure to ionizing radiation or contrast agents.
