Confirmation of the posterolateral technique to decompress and fuse thoracolumbar spine burst fractures. A posterolateral technique to decompress retropulsed bone from the spinal canal has been employed in nine patients, confirmed with intraoperative canal inspection and pre- and postoperative computed axial tomographic (CAT) evaluation. This technique has allowed reduction of retropulsed bony elements from the spinal canal, assessment of canal decompression and reestablishment of vertebral body alignment. The approach permits posterior fusion at the same operation. If the postoperative CAT scan continues to show spinal cord embarrassment from anterior bony elements, an anterior approach can be performed for additional decompression and fusion. The posterolateral approach does not necessarily improve neurologic function. However, when compared with posterior instrumentation alone, it does help ensure canal reduction and alignment, which may aid recovery and hasten rehabilitation.
