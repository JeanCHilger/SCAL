Wildervanck syndrome--the external appearance and radiologic findings. Wildervanck syndrome is a combination of congenital anomalies characterized by deafness, Klippel-Feil deformity, and an unusual ocular motility disturbance called Duane retraction syndrome. This syndrome is seen infrequently in the general population and may not be recognized since the external appearance of the ears may be normal, and the unusual form of strabismus may not be obvious to the non-ophthalmologist. Patients with the full extent of this triad have a unique appearance. CT examination in these patients delineates the cervical anomalies as well as the inner ear deformity.
