Computed tomography with metrizamide myelography to define the extent of spinal canal block due to tumor. In five patients with complete spinal block due to tumor, CT was used to show the upper level of the block. In each case metrizamide myelography demonstrated the lower level of the block, but not enough metrizamide leaked past the block to allow myelographic identification of the upper level. However, the subarachnoid space both below and above the level of the block was clearly outlined by metrizamide on CT in each case.
