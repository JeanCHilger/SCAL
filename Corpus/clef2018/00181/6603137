Thoracic and lumbar spine fusion: postoperative radiologic evaluation. A retrospective review of 206 consecutive thoracic and lumbar fusions revealed a variety of surgical procedures performed for instability and malalignment after severe trauma. Stabilization procedures included insertion of 103 Harrington distraction and 15 Harrington compression rods, 84 Weiss spings, six Luque rods, and 10 miscellaneous plates and wires as single or multiple devices in combination with anterior and/or posterior fusions. Complications of surgical fusion included nine unhooked rods, six fatigue fractures of rods and springs, five overdistractions of vertebrae, four cases of severe kyphosis, and two failures of reduction. A meaningful postoperative radiologic evaluation can be accomplished only when indications for surgical techniques, their radiologic appearance, and possible complications are known.
