Relation between atlas position, prognathism and prognathous jaw anomalies. The position of the 1st cervical vertebra is investigated in relation to special anomalies of the craniofacial morphology. Two extremely different types like prognathism and progenia are chosen to demonstrate an interdependence. The latter is probably caused by a different head posture which in itself is influenced by the maxillo-facial anomalies. With the aid of the literature the findings can be explained on a functional basis.
