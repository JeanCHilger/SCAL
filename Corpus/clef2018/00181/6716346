Computed x-ray tomographic evaluation of cervico-brachial neuralgia with intravenous injection of contrast media. Investigation of the cervical epidural space by a CT scan is facilitated by its filling following intravenous injection of a contrast medium. The spinal ganglia and nerve root sheaths are visualized as negative images in the intervertebral foramen. A herniated disc is seen as a focal protrusion of the anterior epidural space presenting a clearer center (60 to 80 HU) than at the periphery (100 to 120 HU). Disco- osteophytic protrusion is seen as an arthritic hypertrophy of the uncus and a more widespread overlapping of the disc, often with a posterior body osteophytosis. The spinal cord and subarachnoid space are also visualized more clearly than when injections are not given. This technique is proposed as the initial examination after standard films, for preoperative investigation of a resistant cervicobrachial neuralgia .
