Associated sternal and spinal fractures. Case reports. Fractures of the upper thoracic spine due to flexion-compression trauma may be associated with sternal injuries of a specific type. The sternal or spinal component of such injuries may easily be overlooked, as illustrated by the 2 case reports presented. Sternal injuries due to direct and indirect trauma are described with particular reference to the anatomy of the manubriosternal joint. The importance of routine radiographic examination of the thoracic spine in the presence of sternal injury --and vice versa--is emphasized.
