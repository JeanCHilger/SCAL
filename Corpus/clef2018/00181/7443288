Lumbo-sacral spinal cord injuries. Thirty-three cases of spinal cord complications in thoraco-lumbar junction injuries were studied, classified in four groups according to the gravity of the lesion and the clinical and electromyographic neurological signs. An original system of graphic representation was used. The spinal lesion was probably secondary to the interruption of arterial vascularisation in the lumbo-sacral spinal cord in two groups and symptomatic of previous contusions in the others. Finally some correlations were established between types of spinal lesions and functional vesico-recto-sphincter and sexual repercussions.
