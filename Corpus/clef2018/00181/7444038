The effect of unilateral dominance of the cerebral hemispheres on the radiographic appearance of the cervical spine (author's transl). The results of dynamic radiographic studies of the cervical spine following isometric exercise of the shoulders and the upper extremities appear to indicate that the commonly seen asymmetries of the joints in the craniocervical and cervicothoracic junction are due to asymmetry in the function of the muscles. The obvious dominance of the muscles on the right side demonstrates the dominance of the muscles of the left cerebral hemisphere. The clinical importance of this is pointed out.
