Experimental studies of the load capacity of the supravital cervical spine. The relative bearing power of fresh cervical vertebrae was found out in 105 single examinations. The vertebrae were descended from 21 vertebral columns of 11 male and 10 female individuals. A plane-parallel embedding of the vertebrae was necessary for the pressure experiments. The investigations were put through with a tester from the VEB Pr√ºfmaschinen-werk Leipzig The tester was fitted out with a 200 kp measuring box. The transducer was a semi-conductor with a key tack. The relative bearing power of fresh cervical vertebrae lay between 32,1 kp/cm2 and 89,7 kp/cm2. The statistic analysis was carried out with a microprocessor. It was found out a relation between relative bearing power and height. The further analysis took place in 3 groups which were determined by the height. We pointed out that the vertebrae of cervical vertebral column binding have a different bearing power. The vertebrae of the inferior cervical column in men with more than 1,80 m height have a higher relative bearing power but in men under 1.69 m the vertebrae of the middle vertebral column have the higher relative bearing power.
