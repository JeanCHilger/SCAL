The value of various lung changes in death by strangulation. Subsequently to previous investigations the value of the parameters lung weight and alterations of pulmonary vessel contents is demonstrated in a group of 106 fatal strangulations including all important subtypes of compressing force against the neck. The mean combined lung weights were generally elevated in a distinct way in all fatalities due to strangulating force (average: 1201 g) exhibiting a great interindividual variability and a slight dependence upon age with lower values in older persons. Significant differences between the various types of strangulation could not be observed. A detailed analysis of the material revealed, that intravascular pulmonary cell accumulations--apart from individual cases with massive concomitant blunt force injuries--in the first place are a correlate for protracted agony courses (shock equivalents). Both pulmonary parameters investigated cannot prove the diagnosis "death due to strangulation".
