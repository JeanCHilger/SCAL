A quantitative analysis of cerebrospinal fluid flow in post-traumatic syringomyelia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the syrinx in post-traumatic syringomyelia was studied by cardiac-triggered phase images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the relationship between CSF flow in the syrinx and patients' symptoms.
