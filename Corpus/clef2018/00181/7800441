Sonographic evaluation of traumatic spinal cord lesions in the newborn infant. We present a case of spinal cord injury due to birth trauma and assess the value of sonography for diagnosis, lesion characterization, and follow-up. Sonography is a non-invasive and easily reproducible imaging method for examining a ventilated child, and its initial sensitivity is comparable to that of MRI. Sonography is the method of choice for guiding diagnosis in this type of traumatic lesion to the newborn.
