Childhood ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine. Two paediatric cases of acquired ossification of the cervical anterior longitudinal ligament are described. This has not been previously reported in childhood. The first was associated with corrosive ingestion requiring oesophagectomy and colonic interposition and the second with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia initially presenting as idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Possible mechanisms are discussed.
