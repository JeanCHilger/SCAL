Complete atlanto-axial dislocation associated with type II odontoid fracture: a report of two cases. Two cases of complete atlanto-axial dislocation with associated Type II odontoid fracture are reported. In one case, the instability associated with this injury was treated with primary odontoid fixation. In the second case, the patient had full cardiac arrest associated with this injury. Due to the extreme instability present with this fracture sub-type and the potential for neurological compromise, early recognition of this fracture pattern by the treating physician is imperative to prevent fatal spinal cord injury.
