Multiple noncontiguous spinal fracture. Twenty-seven cases of multiple noncontiguous spinal fracture were reported. The injury located mostly at thoracolumbar levels, and primary injuries occurred in thorax (n = 13, 50%), second injuries occurred in lumbus (n = 14, 53.8%). The cord function of 12 patients were Frankel A, 5 were C and 4 were D five patients were normal (Frankel E). The incidence of neurologic injury was significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and contiguous spinal fractures (P < 0.01). There were 17 followed-up cases. Eight were recovered with Frankel 1 degree, 2 with 2 degree and 4 without change. The importance of correct diagnosis is emphasized and it is recommended that total spine radiography be performed as soon as possible.
