Unstable fracture of thoracolumbar spine treated with pedicle screw plating. A report of 90 cases. Ninety cases of unstable fracture of thoracolumbar spine treated with a modified Roy-Camille type of pedicle screw plating are reported. They were followed up for an average of 2 years and 5 months. Comparing the pre- and postoperative X-ray films for the angles of kyphosis, degrees of compression of anterior vertebral height and degrees of displacement, the results were quite satisfactory. A complete reduction was obtained in 74% of the unstable fractures at the levels between the T11 and L3 vertebrae. This kind of internal fixation has been proved to be strong and safe allowing for early mobilization with few complications. The operative technique is described and the causes of complication are analyzed.
