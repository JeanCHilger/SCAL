Myelopathy and cervical spino-stenosis. From 1986 through 1990, among the cases of traumatic myelopathy of the cervical spine admitted in our hospital, 31 cases complicated with sagittally narrowed vertebral canal were reviewed. The stenotic cervical canal would be susceptible to spinal cord damage, such as a very minute trauma or violent hyperextension motion of the neck in the aged patients would lead to the cord damage. This type of cord injury was characterized by very little symptoms and signs in the neck, normal or only minimal bony damage seen on roentgenograms or CT scans, even though the spinal cord damage was very severe. With non-operative treatment the recovery chance was frequently very poor or rather, it would be getting worse gradually. Surgical treatment such as expansion canal laminoplasty could give a better result.
