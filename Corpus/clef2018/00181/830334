Scintigraphic detection of osteoid osteoma. Bone scanning with 99mTc-diphosphonate disclosed a solitary focus of intense activity in a cervical vertebra of a 17-year-old youth with persistent unexplained neck pain. Surgery subsequently demonstrated a well-circumscribed osteoid osteoma. This experience is further evidence of the efficacy of radionuclide skeletal scintigraphy in the evaluation of benign bone disease.
