Somatosensory evoked potentials during spinal orthopedic surgery in adult patients. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded in 165 patients from 185 operations for scoliosis and major spinal distortions, lumbar or cervical stenosis, post-traumatic malunions, or tumors. They were obtained by percutaneous stimulation of right and left median and tibial posterior nerves, and recorded on the scalp as recently, motor potentials (MPs) have also been obtained, by a trans-spinous stimulation rostral to the level of intervention. The protocol consists of pre- and post-operative recordings, as well as a continuous intra-operative monitoring. Neuromonitoring is justified in operations implying neurological risks, particularly scoliosis. A durable disappearance of SEPs and MPs was always associated with post-operative neurological disorders. Transient disappearances, not associated with neurological disorders, have been observed during certain manoeuvres such as vertebral traction, osteosynthesis, placing trans-pedicular screws or hooks, leading the surgeon to modify the operation. The role of medullary ischemia on the degradation of electrophysiological signals, obvious in cardiovascular decompensations, seems predominant in the post-operative occurrence of neurological impairment. During the post-operative period, SEPs allow one to discriminate between organic disorders and subjective complaints they help in diagnosing hematomas, and distinguish between radicular and spinal cord injuries.
