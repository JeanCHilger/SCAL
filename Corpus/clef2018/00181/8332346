Late post-tracheostomy airway complications in patients with central nervous system injuries. At decannulation or often weeks later some of the patients undergone long-term mechanical ventilation through tracheostoma reveal symptoms of airway stenosis. Posttracheostomy airway complications detected during the rehabilitation of 34 patients with central nervous system injury are presented. Endoscopic examinations (total 130) were performed with Olympus BF B3 and OES 20-type fiberscopes and Friedel-type rigid bronchoscopes under local or general anaesthesia. Stridor (20 cases) and possible decannulation (10 cases) were the main indications of the first endoscopic examinations. Stridor was caused by tracheal (12 cases) and laryngeal (8 cases) stenosis. With six patients decannulation was possible after the first endoscopy. Removal of granulomas and sutures was successful in 8 cases. Rigid bronchoscopic dilatations were temporarily successful in 7 cases, but in five of them it had to be repeated on emergency. Further therapeutic interventions were: recannulation (3 cases), retracheostomy (4 cases), implantation of silicon T-endoprothesis (5 cases), tracheal resection (4 cases). Three patients are discussed in details. Eliminating airway complications largely contributed to rehabilitation of the nervous and musculoskeletal system, improved the quality of life, and in acute cases it was a life-saving measure. In order to prevent the development of late airway complications or detect them in time, it is recommended to have an endoscopic protocol following every tracheostomy: 1. at the time of decannulation 2. at closing the trachea and 3. 2-3 months after decannulation.
