Eosinophilic granuloma of the spine with and without vertebra plana: long-term follow-up of six cases. Vertebral eosinophilic granuloma is a rare condition frequently associated with vertebra plana. In this paper we present six patients with eosinophilic granuloma of the spine three were without vertebra plana, which represents a diagnostic problem. The mean follow-up was 9 years, (range 2 to 23) and the mean age was 10.8 years at diagnosis. All complained of pain with no neurological deficit. The lesions were located on the vertebral bodies of C4, T9, T10, L1, L2, and L5, respectively. Histologic confirmation of diagnosis was obtained in all patients, two by puncture and four by open biopsy. The patients with vertebra plana (T10, L1, and L5, respectively) were treated conservatively. Long-term follow-up demonstrated total healing of the vertebral body in two and partial rebuilding 8 years after diagnosis in one. Patients without vertebra plana (C4, T9, and L2, respectively) underwent curettage and bone grafting. In the patient with T9 location, a T8-10 anterior arthrodesis with autogenous rib graft was performed. The outcome was satisfactory in all.
