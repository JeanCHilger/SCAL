The incidence of TMJ dysfunction in patients who have suffered a cervical whiplash injury following a traffic accident. Forty consecutive patients with a cervical whiplash injury were examined and compared with 40 matched controls. The incidence of signs and symptoms was high in both groups. Temporomandibular joint pain (P < .001), limitation of mouth opening (P < .01), and masticatory muscle tenderness (P > .01) were found significantly more frequently in the patient group, while the presence of joint sounds, deviation during mouth opening, and the overall presence of a symptom were not significantly different between groups. When asked whether they would seek treatment for the observed signs and symptoms, a significantly higher number of the whiplash group responded positively when compared to the control group. These findings warrant further study and suggest the benefit of a routine examination of the temporomandibular joint and masticatory system in patients with cervical whiplash injury.
