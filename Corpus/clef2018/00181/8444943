Imaging in children with spinal tuberculosis. A comparison of radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We compared the usefulness of radiography, CT and MRI in 25 children with spinal tuberculosis. Radiography provided most of the information necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Axial CT was the most accurate method for visualising the posterior bony elements. Sagittal MRI best showed the severity and content of extradural compression and helped to differentiate between an abscess and fibrous tissue. The main value of CT and MRI is in the preoperative evaluation of the small proportion of patients who require surgical treatment for paraplegia.
