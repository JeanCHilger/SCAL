Spinal epidural hematoma in a hemophilic infant. Although intracranial hemorrhage remains a leading cause of death in hemophilia, spinal epidural hematoma is seen rarely. Decompressive laminectomy has a high associated morbidity, and recent reports have suggested that patients can be treated conservatively without surgical intervention.We present a case of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma diagnosed by MRI scan in a 6-month-old hemophilic infant. Immediate treatment with factor VIII replacement was instituted.There was rapid and complete clinical and radiographic resolution.This case shows that selected hemophilic patients with spinal epidural hematoma can be spared surgical decompression by prompt medical attention.
