Initial axial computerized tomography examination in chest injuries. A total of 41 injured patients examined by both chest radiography and axial computerized tomography (CT) of the chest within the first 24 h after the accident were reviewed. In all, 10 patients died, eight from cerebral or cervical injuries, two from haemorrhage. Of the 27 cases with a haemothorax, 13 were seen on a chest radiograph. In only one case was a haemothorax seen on CT large enough to warrant intervention. CT revealed one minor pneumothorax. Nine patients already treated with a chest drain had some residual air demonstrated by CT, two being significant pneumothoraces. CT showed 28 cases of lung contusion as opposed to 23 on a chest radiograph. Of five cases with a mediastinal haematoma, three were seen on a chest radiograph, including the only patient with aortic rupture. Clinically important pathology was revealed in ordinary chest radiographs. Contusions, small pneumothoraces and minor effusions were sometimes overlooked. CT scan of the chest alone is rarely warranted in the injured patient, given a liberal indication for chest drainage and ready access to arch aortography.
