Intervertebral disc calcification in childhood. Nine children with calcified intervertebral discs are described. Seven were boys and 2 were girls. The average age at diagnosis was 8.6 years (range 5 to 14 years). Follow up was from 2 to 10 years. Only one child gave a history of trauma. In all twelve discs were involved with more than one disc being affected in 2 children there were 7 in the cervical spine, 4 in the thoracic and one in the lumbar spine. Every child with cervical calcification had an acute onset with pain and limited movement, and disappeared during the following months. The calcified discs in the thoracic and lumbar regions did not cause symptoms and did not change. Calcification of cervical discs is self-limiting and has an excellent prognosis.
