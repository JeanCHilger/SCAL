Hyoid bone and atlas vertebra in established mouth breathers: a cephalometric study. The position of hyoid bone and atlas vertebra in 29 established mouth breathers (17 boys and 12 girls) in the age group of 10-14 years were cephalometrically evaluated and compared with 23 nose breathers (11 boys and 12 girls). The children of both the groups were selected on the basis of history and clinical examination. The comparisons were made using univariate analysis for male and female groups separately as well as combined. It was observed that mouth breathers do maintain an extended head posture, which was evident from a decrease in distance between the occiput and dorsal arch of atlas vertebra. However the results of the present study did not reveal any distinct characteristics of hyoid bone and atlas vertebra that can be used to predict or associate the craniofacial pattern of mouth breathers.
