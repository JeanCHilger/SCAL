Thoracolumbar spine stabilization in fracture--dislocations. This study analyzed a series of 35 patients with unstable fractures, with and without neurologic deficit including complete paraplegia. The patients underwent spinal stabilisation using plates and screws after sustaining fracture dislocations. Very good results were obtained in 19 patients with non-complicated fractures operated on by dorsal stabilization using Meurig-Williams plates. Complete recovery of the neurologic deficit was achieved in five out of 13 patients with neurologic deficit two of whom were paraplegic. Use of stabilization operation accompanied by dorsal vertebrodesis and post-operative immobilisation provides a reliable posterior bone block with a restored spinal canal.
