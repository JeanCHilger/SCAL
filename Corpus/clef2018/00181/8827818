The shaken baby syndrome: diagnosis using CT and MRI. Head injuries are the leading cause of death in infants younger than 1 year old, and many of these injuries are the result of child abuse. Violent shaking is a form of child abuse that can cause severe head trauma, particularly to infants. This pattern of injuries is known as shaken baby syndrome (SBS). Although SBS can cause serious injuries such as retinal hemorrhage or subdural hematoma, it is difficult to diagnose because SBS often leaves no external evidence of abuse. This article reviews the most common cranial injuries associated with SBS, describes the mechanism of each injury and presents clinical signs and symptoms. It also investigates the use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to diagnose head trauma associated with SBS.
