The value of magnetic resonance imaging of the postoperative spine with titanium implants. Magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation was performed on patients with titanium spine implants. The objective was to determine the value of conventional MR for evaluating the postoperative spine with titanium implants. The value of MR imaging for evaluation of the postoperative spine without metal implants is well known. The results of MR evaluation of the titanium instrumented spine have not been explored. Thirty patients with titanium spine implants underwent MR evaluation. Indications included pain, neurologic deficit, decompression evaluation, and infection. The titanium implants caused only local MR signal void and did not interfere with the imaging of the adjacent soft tissues. This provided significant information and helped determine whether further surgical intervention was required. There is significant value of MR evaluation of the post-operative spine without compromise from titanium implants.
