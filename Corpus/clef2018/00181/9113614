Remodeling of the spinal canal deformed by trauma. Computed tomography (CT) examinations and functional scores were evaluated in 28 patients with thoracolumbar fractures with intraspinal fragments, of whom 20 underwent operation. The cross-sectional area and the sagittal and frontal diameters of the spinal canal were measured after the injury, postoperatively, and at follow-up (mean, 6 years). The operative reduction significantly increased both diameter and area of the spinal canal. During follow-up, a further significant increase of the sagittal diameter and the area was noted, in both surgically and conservatively treated patients. There was no difference in remodeling between the groups. Six patients in the surgically treated group had neurologic deficits at admission, five had improved, and one remained unchanged at follow-up. The presence or absence of intraspinal fragments should not influence the treatment strategy per se in cases without neurologic signs.
