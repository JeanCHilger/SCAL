The cervical spine in the skeletal dysplasias and associated disorders. The cervical spine is an especially important area, not only for the diagnosis of the skeletal dysplasias, but also for the management of the patient. By the "cervical spine" I refer not only to the vertebral bodies and posterior elements of this region, but also to the neural elements contained within, especially the cervical cord. The spine is supported by a group of ligaments both anteriorly and posteriorly, with special fixation of the odontoid and C2 by a ligament which normally affixes it firmly to C1. Multiple things may go wrong with the development of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal development of the "vertebrae" in this region, ranging from hypoplasia to developmental failure and/or abnormal ossification of the cervical vertebrae associated or unassociated odontoid hypoplasia
