A survey of pain during rehabilitation after acute spinal cord injury. There has been little research on pain in the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. This study surveyed the pain experience and management strategies in such patients. The subjects consisted of inpatients who were undergoing rehabilitation following their acute injury, and were assessed regarding the presence and type of any pain upon admission to the rehabilitation ward, and reviewed weekly during their stay. They were reassessed on reporting any new pain. Pain intensity was recorded on a Visual Analogue Scale. The maximum intensity of pain during admission was compared to that at discharge. All interventions directed at pain management were documented. Patients were reviewed one year after discharge regarding current pain experience. Almost all of the patients (n = 23 96%) experienced pain at some stage during their inpatient rehabilitation. Overall pain intensity for those patients with pain during inpatient admission decreased by the time of discharge. At the one year review however, pain intensity tended towards that seen on admission. The reasons for pain tending to increase after discharge were not apparent. Neuropathic and Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) were the most common types of pain experienced. A combination of pharmacological, interventional, physical and psychological approaches were used in pain management. At one year review, neuropathic pain remained common while MPS and orthopaedic pain had decreased. Pain is a common and significant problem for many SCI patients and is a challenge for the treating team to manage.
