The lower cervical spine in trauma: a study of false-negative and false-positive findings. Evaluation of roentgenographic studies of the lower cervical spine may be complicated by posttraumatic immobility, certain body types, and technical factors which produce equivocal findings. False-positive and false-negative findings are reported, with suggestions for additional views and more diagnostic evaluation.
