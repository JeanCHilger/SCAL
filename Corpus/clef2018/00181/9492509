Cervival spine movement during light-guided orotracheal intubation with lightwand stylet (Trachlight). We assessed the degree of movement of the cervical spine (C-spine) during light-guided orotracheal intubation using a lightwand stylet (Trachlight). Twenty ASA 1-2 patients were studied. Following induction of anesthesia and obtaining muscle relaxation, the cross-table lateral radiograph of C-spine was taken before and during the intubation with Trachlight. We measured the distance between the spinous processes of C1 and the occiput (delta C1-occiput), and the degree of displacement of C1 and C5 against C3 (delta C1 + C5) by tracing the standard and intubation films. The results showed that delta C1-occiput was larger and delta C1 + C5 was smaller with Trachlight than with conventional or McCoy laryngoscopy we had previously reported. We concluded that light-guided intubation technique using Trachlight needed less movement of the C-spine in contrast to direct laryngoscopy. We believe that Trachlight is an easy, alternative and beneficial device for patients in whom cervical spine movement is limited or undesirable.
