Post-traumatic syringomyelia and post-traumatic spinal canal stenosis: a direct relationship: review of 75 patients with a spinal cord injury. This study aims to demonstrate predictive factors for post traumatic syringomyelia (PTS), and in particular to correlate the role of insufficiency of reduction of a spinal fracture with the occurrence of syringomyelia. One hundred and twenty-eight spinal cord injured patients (SCI) were studied during the years 1992 and 1993. Among them, 75 underwent a complete and reliable evaluation including: review of the initial vertebral lesion, and of the surgery report, and a radiological study of the lesion site with standard X-rays, a CT scan, and an MRI. The CT Scan included slices in sagittal reconstructions and in the axial plane at the site of injury with the calculation of a percentage of canal stenosis in the two planes of the space. An MRI was carried out with T1 and T2 weighted images, including sagittal entire cord images in addition to sagittal and axial slices centred on the site of injury. A syrinx was diagnosed in 28% of the patients. The occurrence of a syrinx is significantly correlated with spinal canal stenosis in the sagittal plane (delta D) with a P < 0.001 and in the axial plane (delta S) (P < 0.05). This present study demonstrates the major role of the insufficiency of reduction of the vertebral lesion in the genesis of a syrinx. The quality of the initial treatment of the vertebral injury is the first step in the prevention of a syrinx. The treatment of a syrinx, besides techniques of drainage, must also take into account the spinal realignment.
