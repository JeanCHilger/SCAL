Second-trimester maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome: free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein, with or without unconjugated oestriol, compared with total HCG, alpha-fetoprotein and unconjugated oestriol. The aim of our study was to compare three protocols for second-trimester maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome in the same serum samples, using two triple tests [total human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated oestriol and free beta-HCG, alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated oestriol] and a double test (free beta-HCG and alpha-fetoprotein). The three protocols were compared in a series of 23 serum samples from Down's syndrome pregnancies and in a cohort of 2516 pregnant women receiving routine antenatal care between June 1992 and June 1993. Among the 23 affected cases, at a cut-off risk of 1:380, the detection rate of Down's syndrome was comparable with the double test (74%
