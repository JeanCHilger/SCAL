Age-specific incidences of chromosome abnormalities at the second trimester amniocentesis for Japanese mothers aged 35 and older: collaborative study of 5484 cases. The aim of this study was to calculate the expected incidences of chromosome abnormalities found at amniocentesis in Japanese women aged 35 and older. From four clinics in Japan, we gathered genetic amniocentesis data on 5484 pregnant women at risk only due to their advanced age, 35 years and older. We analyzed the data using the logistic regression model. Of the 5484 fetuses, 117 (2.1%) were diagnosed with a chromosome abnormality. The abnormal karyotypes included 42 cases of trisomy 21 13 of trisomy 18
