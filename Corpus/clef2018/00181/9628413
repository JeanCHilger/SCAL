Phase-dependent electromyographic activity of the lower-limb muscles of a patient with clinically complete spinal cord injury during orthotic gait. We examined the lower-limb electromyographic (EMG) activity from a patient with clinically complete spinal cord injury during orthotic gait. A newly developed gait orthosis was used to obtain bipedal locomotion. The surface EMG data during the gait together with the biomechanical variables were collected by way of a radio EMG system. A cyclic EMG activation pattern corresponding to the gait cycles were observed in each of the paralyzed lower-limb muscles during the orthotic gait. Although the EMG activation did not seem to contribute toward generating the gait, it showed some similarities to that of the infant stepping or immature gait. These results might be regarded as one of the indirect pieces of evidence that suggest the existence of a spinally originating motor mechanism underlying human locomotion.
