Nuchal cord changes in children with os odontoideum: evidence for associated trauma. We describe nuchal cord changes in four children with os odontoideum who had cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery. In these four children, nuchal cord changes consistent with previous trauma were seen. The presence of the nuchal cord changes supports the concept of trauma as an etiologic factor in these four cases. This study supports trauma as an associated factor in patients with os odontoideum.
