Endovascular treatment of arteriovenous vertebro-vertebral fistula. Vertebral arteriovenous fistulae are relatively rare, with limited experience in most centers. We report our experience in the treatment of a vertebral arteriovenous fistula treated by interventional method. A review of the literature is made and the etiology, presentation and treatment of this unusual lesion are discussed. The endovascular occlusion is now the treatment of choice of vertebral fistulae.
