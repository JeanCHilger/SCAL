Os odontoideum: a case report and review. There are five types of odontoid anomalies: os odontoideum, ossiculum terminale, hypoplasia of the odontoid, aplasia of the odontoid base and aplasia of the odontoid. All five anomalies may lead to atlantoaxial instability. Their clinical signs, symptoms and treatments are identical. Only radiographic findings are distinctive. The incidence of odontoid anomalies is uncertain. A 15-year-old boy was hospitalized with progressive numbness of his limbs on the right side for one month. Os odontoideum was confirmed by cervical radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. The lesion was stabilized with autogenous iliac bone fusion and Halifax interlaminar clamp fixation. Treatment with posterior fusion of the C1-C2 vertebrae proved successful. The clinical variations, etiology, diagnosis and surgical management of odontoid anomalies are discussed.
