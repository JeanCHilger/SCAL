Bochdalek hernia in adulthood: a case report and review of recent literature. A 37-year-old Filipino woman presented with a post road-traffic accident fracture of dorsal spine 12. Chest radiograph revealed evidence of loops of small bowel in the left lung field. She admitted to symptoms of respiratory insufficiency since birth and treatment for tuberculosis in childhood. A pre-operative diagnosis of left traumatic diaphragmatic hernia was not confirmed at laparotomy which revealed typical left congenital Bochdalek hernia with smooth edges and herniation of small bowel and spleen into the left pleural cavity. Following reduction and repair of the hernia, the patient made an uneventful recovery. Chest radiograph remains normal till now, eight years post-operatively.
