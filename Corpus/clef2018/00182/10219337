Long-term outcome of patients with intraspinal neuroblastoma. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical decompression with laminectomy are effective therapeutic options in the treatment of cord compression from neuroblastoma (NB). We report the long-term outcome of patients with intraspinal NB treated with or without laminectomy at two large pediatric oncology centers.We reviewed the medical records and radiographs of 26 children with intraspinal NB treated at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, between 1985 and 1994 or at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, between 1967 and 1992.Twenty-four of the 26 patients are alive and disease-free (follow-up of 2-29 years median, 10 years 2 months). Fifteen of the 23 patients with neurologic impairment underwent initial laminectomy. Nine of these 15 patients recovered neurologic function, including 3 patients who presented with paraplegia. Eleven of the 15 patients who underwent laminectomy have developed mild to severe spinal deformities. Eight patients with neurologic symptoms consequent to cord compression were treated with initial chemotherapy and/or surgery, but did not undergo laminectomy. Three patients with mild to moderate deficits recovered neurologic function. Four of 11 patients with intraspinal NB who did not undergo laminectomy have mild to severe scoliosis.A low incidence of neurologic recovery was seen in patients with long-standing severe cord compression regardless of treatment modality. For patients with partial neurologic deficits, recovery was seen in most patients following chemotherapy or surgical decompression with laminectomy. A higher incidence of spinal deformities was seen in the patients treated with initial laminectomy.
