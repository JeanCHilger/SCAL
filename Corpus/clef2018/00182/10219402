Cervical epidural lipoblastomatosis: changing MR appearance after chemotherapy. Lipoblastomatosis is a locally infiltrative tumor of embryonic fat. We describe the MR appearance of cervical lipoblastomatosis with epidural extension. The initial MR study showed features of a soft-tissue mass a subsequent MR examination, performed after chemotherapy, depicted the lesion as a typical lipoma of high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and of intermediate signal on T2-weighted sequences.
