Surgical treatment of vertebral metastasis. Spinal metastases may cause pain and neurologic dysfunction secondary to bone destruction and spinal cord compression. The new oncology therapy have prolonged life expectancy of many patients with different primary tumors. The treatment of metastases is frequently necessary to enhance quality of life. We reviewed 121 patients with spinal metastases of different primary tumors operated between 1982 and 1995. We employed different approach and instrumentation depending on particular case, metastases location and life expectancy. We analysed primary tumor location, spinal pain, neurologic function, pre and post surgical treatment, complications and development. Spinal stabilization and cord decompression gives excellent results for pain relief, neurological improvement and quality of life, always helping to medical treatment of a patient with metastatic disease.
