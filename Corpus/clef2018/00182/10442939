The relationship between chronic facial pain and a history of trauma and surgery. Because pain is the most commonly reported symptom of patients presenting to temporomandibular disorders clinics, it is important to identify factors that modify the perception or reality of such pain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that a patient with a history of trauma and/or non-temporomandibular joint surgery might be sensitized to pain and might report increased pain levels if a temporomandibular disorder later developed.This was a retrospective study of 778 consecutive patients seen over a 1-year period in an Orofacial Pain Clinic. Study parameters included gender, lifetime number of self-reported traumas, lifetime number of non-temporomandibular joint operations, and location, intensity, frequency, and type of temporomandibular disorder-related pain.There were significantly more women than men in the study (609 to 169). There was no relationship between numbers of previous traumas and non-temporomandibular joint operations and types of temporomandibular disorder. However, there were statistically significant relationships between the severity of facial pain and the frequency of facial pain as well as between the severity and frequency of joint pain and the number of traumas. There were also statistically significant associations between the severity and frequency of facial pain and the number of non-temporomandibular joint-related surgical procedures that the patient had undergone.There is a relationship between a patient's reported history of trauma and/or non-temporomandibular joint-related operations and the severity and frequency of facial and temporomandibular joint pain, should it develop. It is possible that such traumas and operations sensitize the patient in such a way that the pain of subsequent temporomandibular joint disorders is heightened.
