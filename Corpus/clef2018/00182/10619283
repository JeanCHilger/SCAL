Pseudoseizures as a complication of painful cervical ribs. An 8-year-old girl is described who presented with seizures. These were subsequently found to be pseudoseizures, with no EEG changes. They were provoked by pain from cervical ribs. This cause of pain-provoked pseudoseizures has not previously been described.
