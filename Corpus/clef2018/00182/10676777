Pediatric spinal injury. Spine injury in children thankfully is still a relatively rare injury. The incidence of pediatric spine injuries has been reported as 2% to 5% of all spine injuries. The biological differences of children make differences in fracture patterns and alter the management necessary for successful treatment. The other factors that affect fracture production and associated injuries are head size relative to the body size, flexibility of the spine and supporting structures, the growth plates, and the elasticity and compressibility of the bone. The majority of compression injuries in children are made up of falls from a height. Spinal injuries in children remain a challenge despite some technical changes in assessment and treatment.
