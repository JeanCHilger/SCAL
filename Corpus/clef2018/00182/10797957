Spinal neurinomas and neurofibromas in Senegal. Authors present 13 cases of spinal neurinomas and neurofibromas out of 418 non- pottic, non-traumatic medullary compression operated between 1965 and 1995. All cases were histologically documented. Neurinomas and neurofibromas represent 3.1% of all non pottic, non traumatic medullary compression and 12.8% of tumour medullary compression operated in our service. The illness started with radicular pains (6 cases) and spinal ache (5 cases) and most of the time, the medullary compression diagnosis is completed at the spasmodic paraplegia status. No patient has done any C.T. scan but in the other hand a myelography has been completed in all cases, resulting in the blockage of the contrast product which in 4 cases was of an epidural type, and in 2 cases of intra dural type. All patients were operated through a posterior approach, which ended in 10 cases to a total removal, and in 3 cases to a partial one. 7 extradural localizations were noticed and 3 neurinomas, 3 neurofibromas and 1 neurofibrosarcoma were histologically identified. A post operative follow-up was done on 11 patients and a satisfactory result was obtained on 6 of them. In 2 cases, the neurological status remained unchanged. In 2 cases a deterioration occurred and a patient with neurofibrosarcoma passed away.
