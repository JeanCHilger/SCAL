Morphology of young and old cervical spine intervertebral disc tissues. The intervertebral disc of the cervical spine undergoes degenerative changes during the aging process. Although many studies have reported the qualitative changes in the disc, methodology to quantify these changes is lacking. The present study was designed to quantify the geometrical variations of the nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus and uncovertebral joints. The age groups of specimens were classified as juvenile, adult and aged. Fresh intervertebral discs with adjacent vertebral bodies of the lower cervical spine of primates were isolated. The specimens were sectioned sequentially in a coronal plane. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Verhoeff's, Safranin O, and Trichrome methods to distinguish the nucleus, annulus and uncovertebral joints. Histological images were examined using light microscopy and processed using a computer imaging program to trace the boundaries of the disc components. Dorsal-to-ventral depth and medial-to-lateral width of the nucleus pulposus, and its relative location to the annulus pulposus were also obtained. In the juvenile and adult discs, the nucleus appeared as a light opaque region with scattered notochordal cells with a clear distinction from the annulus region. In contrast, in the aged discs, the nucleus appeared as a dense region of amorphous, irregular collagen materials with less distinction from the annulus region. With the progression of aging, the dorsal-to-ventral depth of the nucleus decreased considerably compared to medial-to-lateral width. The uncovertebral joints were clear in the adult discs. The joints were less distinct in the aged discs and their size decreased. Quantification of three-dimensional geometrical variations will assist in better defining the disc tissue in the mathematical models.
