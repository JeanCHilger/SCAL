Tuberculous spondylitis complicated by spinal disorders: diagnosis and treatment. Complex diagnosis using additional radiation procedures (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) for tuberculous spondylitis complicated by spinal disorders was made in 52 patients. It made the genesis of spinal cord disorders more clear. The genesis was due to epidural abscess, necrotic osseous tissue and bony compression of destroyed vertebrae. Spinal cord structural changes were detectable in the postoperative period. Hemosorption in combination with blood ultraviolet radiation was used in 25 (40%) patients for their indications, which allowed all the patients to be operated on. Surgical treatment of 60 patients by using radical interventions into the target site and extended corporolateral decompression of the spinal cord, by employing autograft spondylolodesis resulted in rehabilitation in 95% of cases.
