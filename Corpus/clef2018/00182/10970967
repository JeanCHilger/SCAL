Sub-occipital Pott's disease. Diagnostic imaging in 2 cases. Pott's disease is the most common form of bone and joint tuberculosis, notably in the thoracolumbar spine. The sub-occipital localization remains exceptional, raising a major risk of spinal instability and severe bulbo-medullary complications. We report 2 new cases of tuberculous spondylodiscitis at the cervico-occipital junction revealed by signs of spinal compression associated with torticolis and dysphagia. The diagnosis was provided by CT scan and MR imaging and was confirmed histologically on a transoral biopsy of the retropharyngeal abscess. The patients were successfully treated with antituberculosis drugs combined with external stabilization of the spine. The diagnostic aspects, notably the neuroradiological findings in this particular localization of Pott's disease are recalled.
