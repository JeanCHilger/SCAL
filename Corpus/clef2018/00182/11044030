Cervical radiography for trauma patients: a time-effective technique? The purpose of this study was to determine the time necessary to perform a six-view radiographic examination of the cervical vertebral column of trauma victims. In addition we compared the added examination times for 30 patients who underwent an additional helical CT examination of the cervical region immediately after cranial CT.Cervical radiography is a time-consuming procedure, which is a concern for trauma surgeons. A more efficient way for cervical evaluation of trauma patients needs to be adopted. Evidence now exists in the literature to suggest that helical CT can serve that purpose.
