Spinal contusion after trauma to the cervical spine--relevance of the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between spinal stenosis and cervical myelopathy. Furthermore it was to investigate whether there is a correlation between spinal stenosis and progression of neurologic symptoms?Using the Pavlov ratio method, we compared 14 patients with a contusio spinalis with 14 patients who suffered from a distortion of the cervical spine. This ratio is calculated by the sagittal diameter of the spinal canal with the anteroposterior width of the vertebral body.In eight patients with a contusio spinalis, there was a spinal stenosis, while there was none in the distortion group. The remaining patients with a contusio had severe degenerative changes in routine roentgenograms of the cervical spine. The Pavlov ratio was statistically significant reduced in the contusio group. After 8.5 days there was a complete regression of neurologic symptoms, whereas in 4 patients there was no full recovery.To conclude we demonstrated that a spinal stenosis promotes a contusio spinalis but there is no evidence that the Pavlov ratio allows statements concerning the progression of the injury.
