Chronic pain after SCI. A patient survey. A survey of chronic pain experience after spinal cord injury.To investigate the prevalence, severity and impact of chronic pain amongst spinal cord injury (SCI) patients in our region, and assess the need for additional resources to address the problem.A postal questionnaire was sent to 216 spinal cord injury patients (10% of the Yorkshire regional spinal injury database).Yorkshire region, UK.A response was received from 67% of the patients. Seventy-nine per cent of patients said they presently suffered with pain, with 39% describing it as severe. Comparison of pain and non-pain groups using chi-squared analysis showed that complete injury was significantly more likely than incomplete injury to result in chronic pain (P<0.05), and increased severity of pain (P<0.05). 43% of patients with pain said they required further treatment for it. Chronic pain had a significant impact on daily activities and was a major factor in causing unemployment (18%) and depression (39%).The study confirms that pain is a major problem in SCI patients which is not currently being adequately addressed. A multidisciplinary approach to management and prospective studies of treatments are required in order to reduce the prevalence and severity of pain in these patients.
