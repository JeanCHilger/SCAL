Upper cervical spinal cord injury in neonates: the use of magnetic resonance imaging. Neonatal upper cervical spinal cord injury is associated with rotational forceps delivery and presents with quadriparesis and diaphragmatic paralysis. The underlying pathology determines neurologic outcome but is difficult to assess clinically or with simple radiographic techniques. We report 4 cases in which early magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the extent and severity of the injury and guided management.
