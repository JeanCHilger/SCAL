Application of a new verification technique allowing craniospinal irradiation in supine position. To minimize anaesthesia related risks during craniospinal irradiation in children, treatment in supine position would be preferable. Verification especially of the cervical three-field junction causes problems, because direct visual control is not possible. We present clinical experiences with a new verification technique with all three fields exposed on one single film.
