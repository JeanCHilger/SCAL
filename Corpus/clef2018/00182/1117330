Value of gas myelography in early management of acute cervical spinal cord injuries. Gas myelography was carried out in 22 patients with acute cervical spinal cord injuries in whom oily contrast media seemed contraindicated. The authors believe this technique makes a valuable contribution to the basic decision regarding the surgical versus medical treatment of a specific patient with a cervical cord injury. They emphasize the importance of visualizing cord compression due to disc herniation in these cases and conclude that gases are the optimal contrast agents for visualization of the entire circumference of the spinal cord.
