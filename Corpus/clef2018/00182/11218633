Trauma sites and clinical features associated with acute hyperextension spinal cord injury without bone damage--relationship between trauma site and severity. To elucidate whether a relationship exists between the site of trauma and severity of acute hyperextension spinal cord injury without bone damage, we examined the clinical features of 25 male and 10 female patients aged 13 to 88 years. None of the patients had vertebral damage such as fracture and dislocation. The site of impact was classified as the buccal, forehead, or mandibular region. The neurological findings were assessed according to Frankel's classification at admission and at follow up after 3 months or more to assess outcome. Eleven patients suffered trauma in the buccal region, one patient in Frankel's grade B, three in grade C, and seven in grade D at admission. All 11 of these patients showed an improvement of one grade or more to an outcome of C in one patient, D in one, and E in nine. Trauma occurred at the forehead region in 18 patients, four in grade B, 10 in grade C, and four in grade D. Improvement was seen at follow up by one grade or more to C in one patient, D in 10, and E in seven. Trauma occurred at the mandibular region in six patients, four in grade B and two in grade C. Four of these patients showed improvement of one grade or more to grade B in one, grade C in four, and grade E in one. Overall, seven patients had poor outcomes, five of whom suffered trauma to the mandibular region, indicating that impact to the mandibular region tends to have an unfavorable clinical outcome. Our findings indicate that the site of trauma greatly influences the severity of hyperextension spinal cord injury.
