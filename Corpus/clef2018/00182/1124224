Trauma of the central nervous system in children. In summary, the care of the patient with head trauma is not dissimilar to any other acutely ill individuals. Careful, systematic observation and recording of changing factors and physical signs is necessary. Proper application and appropriate treatment in response to dynamic changes will provide a satisfactory result as in any other form of illness or trauma. The patient with multiple injuries may call for compromise in treatment, however with the exception of gross hemorrhage, the head injury should take precedence in the early period following injury for there are other factors that may prove fatal. Do not accept unnecessary delay in the treatment of other injuries on the grounds that the patient has had a head injury. The orthopedic surgeon can treat the fractured femur, the plastic surgeon-the face, and the general surgeon-the abdomen, without jeopardizing brain recovery. The treatment of the patient with head trauma, as treatment of any other individual in present day medical practice, has become more of a team effort, not only involving the neurosurgeon, but the pediatrician, the specialist in pulmonary physiology, and other expert groups.
