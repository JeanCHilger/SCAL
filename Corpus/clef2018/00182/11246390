Transarticular screw fixation for atlanto-occipital dislocation. A case report of traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation managed by transarticular screw fixation.To present a case with initial failed wire fixation but successful reduction and fixation with transarticular screw fixation and occipitocervical plate stabilization.Atlanto-occipital dislocation is generally a fatal injury, except when it occurs in children. Management of this injury is difficult because of multidirectional instability and the problems associated with technical stabilization.Intraoperative atlanto-occipital reduction was achieved and maintained by direct C0-C1 transarticular screw fixation. To protect this fixation, a posterior occipitocervical fusion at C0-C2 using a Y-plate was performed.The internal fixation and reduction were maintained, indicating a good surgical outcome, at examination 2 years after surgery. The initially severe neurologic deficit was reduced to some motor weakness of the right hand and weakness of oculomotor function.Anatomic reduction and reliable fixation with transarticular screws may provide satisfactory clinical results with important neurologic recovery in cases of atlanto-occipital dislocation.
