Traumatic T9 burst fracture in an 8-month-old infant: incomplete neurologic deficit and its recovery. Case report of a rare burst fracture of the ninth thoracic vertebra in an 8-month-old male infant.To describe a rare traumatic lesion in an infant.There are two reported cases of fracture-dislocation in an infant in the literature, both of which were managed surgically. However, this is the first reported clinical case of burst fracture in an infant.The patient was treated conservatively and observed for 40 months. His spine was examined by using roentgenography and magnetic resonance imaging. His neurologic condition was evaluated by clinical examination and somatosensory-evoked potential (SEP).The infant became ambulant with no need for support 2 years after injury. At that time, the burst vertebra was remodeling gradually and showed no spinal deformity.Fracture-dislocation of the spine with neurologic deficit requires surgical management. However, burst fracture can be managed conservatively, provided the neurologic condition improves.
