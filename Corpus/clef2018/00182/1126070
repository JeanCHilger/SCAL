Fracture of the axis arch. "Hangman's fracture" of the cervical spine. Fifteen patients with fracture of the axis arch ("Hangman's Fracture" of the cervical spine) reviewed with regard to the clinical features, mechanism of injury and management, present a relatively high rate of cord involvement (11 patients) and injuries around the jaw (5 patients). All of the injuries occurred in civilian accidents. The jaw injuries suggest the inclusion of an extension-distraction force. Treatment was conservative in all patients, even in those with severe displacement. Union generally occurred in about 3 months. The only complaint in those patients with union in the displaced position, was limitation of lateral rotation of the head.
