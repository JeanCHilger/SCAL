Cervical spinal cord injury following cephalic presentation and delivery by Caesarean section. We describe a term infant with an acute spinal cord injury following emergency Caesarean section. Foetal movements were normal on the day that the mother was admitted for postterm induction of labour. Caesarean section was performed because of foetal distress and failure to progress during labour. The initial clinical picture suggested acute birth asphyxia. The presence of a high cervical spine injury became more obvious as the clinical picture evolved over the next 7 days. A discontinuity of the cervical spinal cord at C4-5 was confirmed on MRI. Spontaneous respiration failed to develop and intensive care was withdrawn on day 15. No evidence of trauma, or a vascular, neurological, or congenital anomaly of the cervical spinal cord was found at post mortem. The absence of a similar case following cephalic presentation and Caesarean section made bereavement counselling of the parents especially difficult.
