The use of tomography in the diagnosis of skeletal disorders. Tomography has definite proven value as a technique in studying objects obscured by overlying shadows. It is an adjunct study to conventional radiographs when the necessary detail for diagnosis is lacking in the routine examination. Particularly in skeletal tumors, tomography can be helpful in disclosing lesions too small to be noticed in the routine radiograph or resolve details in question in the conventional film that are pertinent to the diagnosis. This technique has also been of great benefit in detailing the anatomic structures of the spine, temporomandibular joints and sternoclavicular articulations. It has been of particular value in the evaluation of fracture-healing or the presence of pseudarthrosis and arthritis affecting the larger joints of the body.
