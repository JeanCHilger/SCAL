Roentgenographic signs of cervical injury. The injured cervical spine may be completely examined without patient movement by positioning the X-ray tube relative to the injured patient.  The prevertebral soft tissue in the cervical area is extremely important in the evaluation of injury, and a thickness of 5 mm or more at the level of the anterior inferior border of the body of C3 is indirect evidence of osseous injury.  In hyperextension rotation cervical spine injuries the pillar view should always be taken.  Anterior displacement of one vertical body upon another may be normal or secondary to trauma.  Straightening or reversal of the cervical ordotic curve may be normal for the individual.
