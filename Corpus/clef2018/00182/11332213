Anterior screw fixation of fractures of the dens axis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the results of anterior screw fixation in the treatment of odontoid fracture.The clinical and radiographic records of the first 14 patients treated with anterior screw fixation for odontoid fracture were reviewed retrospectively.Satisfying stabilisation of the fracture was achieved in 10 patients (71%). In four patients, two of whom had severe osteoporosis, additional posterior C1/C2 fusion, owing to failure of screw treatment was needed. Two patients developed small occipital bedsores caused by preoperative treatment, but no further complications were observed.Although only a few patients were entered in the study, the results justify the use of anterior screw fixation as the treatment of odontoid fracture in selected patients.
