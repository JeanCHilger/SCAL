Use of magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating injuries to the pediatric thoracolumbar spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of acute thoracolumbar spinal injuries allows excellent evaluation of the neurologic and soft tissue structures. Owing to recent advances in imaging techniques that permit greater spatial resolution and more detailed imaging of tissue, MRI now affords effective visualization of injury to the ligaments, intervertebral disk, bones, and spinal cord after spine trauma. Cord changes have been classified into three patterns that are predictive of clinical outcomes in adults with cord injuries. The value of MRI in evaluating pediatric patients with thoracolumbar injuries or in predicting their clinical outcome has not been assessed. After retrospectively reviewing 19 pediatric thoracolumbar fractures associated with neurologic deficits from three level 1 trauma centers, we conclude that MRI is the imaging modality of choice in these patients because it can accurately classify injury to bones and ligaments and because the cord patterns as determined by MRI have predictive value.
