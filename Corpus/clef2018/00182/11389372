A comparison of fusion rates between single-level cervical corpectomy and two-level discectomy and fusion. A single corpectomy and strut grafting has been proposed as an alternative to performing two-level adjacent discectomies with multiple grafts to produce superior fusion rates. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic success of two-level discectomy and fusion with anterior cervical plate fixation compared with a single-level corpectomy. Fifty-two patients were treated with either a two-level adjacent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with cervical plating, or by a single-level corpectomy and plate. Thirty-two patients had two-level discectomies, whereas 20 had a single corpectomy and a strut graft (average follow-up was 3.6 years). One patient had a pseudarthrosis from a single-level corpectomy and required subsequent surgery to obtain an osseous union. The fusion rates between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.385). The clinical results of the surgeries were similar between the groups based on Odom's criteria. The addition of cervical plates to either two-level discectomies or single-level corpectomies yielded similar fusion and complication rates.
