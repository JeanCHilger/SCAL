An evaluation of discography in the localization of symptomatic levels in discogenic disease of the spine. On the basis of a review of 507 patients, discography was a reliable diagnostic procedure in determining the symptomatic level in discogenic disease of the cervical and lumbar spine. The value of discography of the spine is as both a functional and anatomical assessment. Its value in the cervical spine is largely as a functional assessment, with reproduction of the patient's specific pain pattern on a consistent basis at a particular level. It is a reasonably simple procedure, provided that adequate radiographic facilities are available, and strict adherence to aseptic technique is carriet out. The performance and interpretation requires a considerable amount of skill and experience. However, it is a useful adjunct to solving the perplexing problem of the surgical management of pain in discogenic disease of the spine.
