Cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility in patients with chronic, nontraumatic cervical spine pain. To investigate cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility (head repositioning accuracy to subjective straight ahead) in patients with chronic, nontraumatic cervical spine pain.A prospective, 2-group, observational design.An outpatient chiropractic clinic in the United Kingdom.Eleven patients (6 men, 5 women mean age +/- standard deviation, 41.1 +/- 13.3 yrCervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility was investigated by testing the ability of blindfolded participants to relocate accurately the head on the trunk, to a subjective straight-ahead position, after a near-maximal active movement of the head in the horizontal or vertical plane. The active cervical range of motion and the duration and intensity of neck pain were also recorded.Mann-Whitney U testing indicated that the patient (P) group was no less accurate in head repositioning than the control (C) group for all movement directions except flexion (median global positioning error [95% confidence interval], P = 5.7 degrees [5.03-9.10], C = 4.2 degrees [3.17-5.32] p <.05).Nontraumatic neck pain patients show little evidence of impaired cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility. These results contrast with studies of chronic cervical pain patients in which the origin was not controlled or involved a cervical whiplash injury.
