Cardiac arrest in a traumatized child from an unusual cause: atlanto-occipital luxation. We report the case of a trauma child who developed a cardiac arrest due to atlanto-occipital luxation of the cervical spine. The occurrence of a rapidly reversible cardiac arrest in a trauma patient should alert physicians about cervical trauma. Adequate resuscitation of these patients require endotracheal intubation with concomitant full immobilisation of the cervical spine, plasma expansion to prevent arterial hypotension and immobilisation of the cervical spine during transport. Thorough application of these resuscitation techniques should increase the survival rate on admission to trauma centres of paediatric patients presenting with such a severe condition. Nevertheless, atlanto-occipital luxation is a major cause of paediatric cervical trauma mortality and our patient did not survive this condition.
