The management of penetrating neck injuries. In recent years, there has been a major increase in patients with penetrating injuries to the neck admitted to the Johannesburg Hospital. Pressure on resources led to increasing delays for surgery, and a policy of selective conservatism emerged. In common with other centers, mandatory exploration of all wounds that breach the platysma was found to be no longer necessary as it became clear that many penetrating wounds to the neck were best treated conservatively. A policy of blanket investigation of all nonoperated cases also matured toward selective investigation, directed by careful clinical examination. A retrospective study was made of all patients undergoing exploration for gunshot wounds or stabs to the neck at the Johannesburg Hospital Trauma Unit between 1994 and 1998. An overall mortality rate of 9% was mostly a reflection of severe, associated injuries. The evolution of the nonoperative management of cervical penetrating wounds is a good example of the validity of the concept of "selective conservatism." A distillation of the experience at a busy, urban trauma center is presented, with guidelines to manage these potentially lethal injuries.
