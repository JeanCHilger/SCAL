Traumatic jejunal entrapment in a patient with Bechterew disease. We report an unusual case of incarceration of small bowel between the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae in a patient with rheumatoid spondylitis. Incarceration of the loop of jejunum within the fracture or between dislocated lumbar vertebrae is an uncommon entity. The cases of traumatic jejunal entrapment have been previously reported in the literature [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11]: 2 cases occurred in adults and 8 in children. There has been no report on this injury in patients with rheumatoid spondylitis (Bechterew arthritis).
