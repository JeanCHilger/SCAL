Injuries of the alar ligaments in children and adolescents. Cervical spine trauma most commonly involves the lower parts in adults. In children lesions of the cervical spine can predominantly be found in the region of C1/C2 including ligament injuries at this level. However such injuries are difficult to detect and only few data are available concerning therapy and prognosis of atlantoxial ligament lesions. We report on two children suffering from isolated rupture of the alar ligaments. Both injuries were proven by magnetic resonance imaging which is recommended as the resource of choice for the evaluation of the cervical spine soft tissues in children. Although the biomechanic properties of the alar ligaments remain unclear non-operative treatment for the rupture of these ligaments seems to be adequate. In order to avoid neurologic symptoms or long term complications an immediate diagnosis is indispensable.
