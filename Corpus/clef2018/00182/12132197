Grisel syndrome--a trauma surgery rarity. Atlanto-axial fixed subluxation (Grisel's syndrome) is an uncommon complication of upper neck inflammatory processes and head and neck surgery. We present the case of a 6 year old patient who developed a Grisel's syndrome after an upper respiratory infection. X-rays and CT scans demonstrated a fixed C1 and C2 subluxation which was treated with reposition and application of a Halofixateur. We give a review of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this rare syndrome.
