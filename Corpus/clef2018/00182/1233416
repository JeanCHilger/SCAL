Spinal cord injury in the newborn infant. Birth injury to the spinal cord secondary to traction forces during delivery is a common but frequently undiagnosed disorder. The injury usually affects the cervicodorsal junction, with both extradural hematoma and direct cord damage at that level. Clinical findings of a paraplegic infant with abdominal breathing are sometimes obscured by secondary pneumonia and/or hypoxia. Radiologic manifestations  include a bell shaped chest indicative of loss of the external muscles of respiration spinal roentgenograms are usually normal. Myelography in neonatal spinal injury demonstrates a block in the subarachnoid space
