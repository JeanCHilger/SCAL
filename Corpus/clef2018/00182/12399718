Thoracic spinal cord compression by radiation-induced exostosis: a case report and review of the literature. A 38-year old man developed compressive myelopathy due to radiation-induced osteochondroma at T7. The patient had been given radiotherapy at the age of 7 years for a lymphosarcoma situated at the lower part of the neck. Radiation is an exceptional cause of spinal compression which can be avoided by regular surveillance of patients given radiotherapy in the spinal area as children.
