The positional changes of hyoid bone in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the developmental changes of the hyoid bone position in children from deciduous dentition to early permanent dentition. There was no sexual dimorphism in hyoid bone positions. The growth of the structures around the hyoid bone began to decline from late mixed dentition stage. During growth, Go-H was almost equal to C3-H and the hyoid bone was located near and above the line that connected C3 and Me.
