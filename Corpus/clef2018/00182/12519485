Impact of comprehensive gynecologic services on health maintenance behaviours among women with spinal cord injury. Women with spinal cord injury (SCI) and other physical disabilities often lack access to appropriate gynecologic health care and may be at higher risk for preventable gynecologic diseases and other health problems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a women's health clinic that was established to meet the needs of women with SCI and other disabilities. Specifically, this study examined the effect of clinic participation upon the rate of preventive gynecologic health care behaviours and assessed the relationship between physical and emotional functioning in women with SCI and other disabilities.Participants (n =28) were women who completed surveys immediately prior to participation in the clinic, and at 3 and 12 month follow-ups.Results indicated a trend towards increased frequency of breast self-exam three months after initial participation in the clinic (p =0.11). Other rates of health promoting behaviours (exercise, diet and mammography) did not increase. Results also indicated that although physical functioning and life satisfaction were not related, women in this study did experience moderate to high levels of psychological distress.Results indicate that whole-woman health care may be important to increasing certain health behaviours among women with disabilities. Implications for comprehensive treatment are discussed.
