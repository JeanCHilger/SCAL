Penetrating neck injuries involving wooden foreign bodies: the role of MRI and the misinterpretation of CT images. A 12-year-old, boy fell in the bush and suffered a penetrating neck wound. Computed tomography(CT-scan) was performed, but no foreign body was detected inside the wound. The patient returned home after ordinary wound care. About 6 months after the accident, the patient visited hospital, because of inflammatory neck pain. A CT-scan was performed and the foreign body appeared as a high density. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the presence of a large foreign body. Under general anesthesia the wooden (bamboo) foreign body was removed. This case highlights the needs to be aware of the potential for misinterpretation of CT images, especially in acute wooden penetration injury. Its also demonstrates that MRI is a useful adjust to CT in the detection of non-metallic foreign bodies.
