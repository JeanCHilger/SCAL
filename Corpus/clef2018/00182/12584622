Sprengel deformity in a nine-year-old boy: diagnosis and therapy. Sprengel deformity is a congenital malformation with usually unilateral elevation and medial rotation of the scapula. An omovertebral bone is generally present. Associated skeletal malformations are frequently present. Though functional impairment is mild, the cosmetic and psycho-social impairment can be considerable. The prognosis of early surgical therapy is good. The presented case also justifies surgical correction in the older child.
