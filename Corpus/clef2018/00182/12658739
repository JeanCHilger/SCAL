Lipoblastomatosis of the neck causing hemiparesis: a case report and review of the literature. Lipoblastoma and lipoblastomatosis are rare pediatric adipose tumors that sometimes affect the neck or spinal cord. This case is the third report of lipoblastoma extending into the spinal canal, the first report of intradural tumor extension, and the first report of hemiparesis resulting from lipoblastoma compressing the spinal cord.A 13-month-old boy was seen by a pediatrician for a firm, supraclavicular neck mass on the left side. After being evaluated by CT and MRI scanning, the tumor was partially resected.Postoperative microscopic examination of the tumor showed adipose cells with mature nuclei and well-formed fat vacuoles interspersed with fibrovascular septa, a finding consistent with maturing lipoblastoma.Although lipoblastomatous tumors are treated with complete surgical resection when possible, location of these tumors in the neck may dictate partial resection to avoid intraoperative injury to the spinal cord.
