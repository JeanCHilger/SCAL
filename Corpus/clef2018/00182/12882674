Clinical diagnosis and treatment of Hangman's fracture. To investigate the mechanism of Hangman's fracture and its clinical manifestation and treatment.Ten patients with Hangman's fracture treated at our hospital from 1988 to 2001 were analysed.Patients were injured by motor vehicle accidents (7 patients), object hitting on the head (1), and fall (1). Injuries were classified as type I (1 patient), type II (5), type IIa (2) and type III (2).Motor vehicle accident and fall are major causes of Hangman's fracture with neurological deficits but limited motion and neck pain. Hangman's fracture is easily diagnosed using lateral cervical X-ray and CT. Hangman's fractures of types I, II and IIa can be treated conservatively, but those of type III or spinal cord injury require surgical stabilization.
