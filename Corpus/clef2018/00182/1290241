Eosinophilic granuloma of the cervical and thoracic spine in a child. A case of eosinophilic granuloma affecting a cervical vertebra, thoracic vertebra and pelvis in a child is reported. We present this case because multifocal eosinophilic granuloma lesions of the spine are rare and can present as this case did with both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. Preoperative diagnosis may be made by X-ray, isotope bone scan and needle biopsy, avoiding unnecessary surgical intervention.
