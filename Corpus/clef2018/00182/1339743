Treatment of unstable fractures of thoracolumbar spine with neurologic injury using a reduction fixation spinal pedicle screws system. Twenty-six patients with unstable burst fractures, chance fractures and fractures dislocations of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine were treated with a spinal pedical screw reduction fixation system (RF system). This system is a new device designed by Chinese scientists. In biomechanical testing, it provided three-dimensional reduction forces. The special design of angle pedicle screw provided accurate angle to restore the normal thoracic lumbar lordosis and to maintain it. The three-column spine in a lordotic position maximized the reduction and indirectly achieved a neurologic decompression in the spinal canal. All patients had an anatomical reduction by RF system except one case operated two weeks after injury, the spinal canal area increased over 30% by CT (P < 0.01). Except four cases with Frankle A out of twenty patients with neurologic deficits, all other patients had at least one grade progress. Of them one improved from A to D, ten from C and D to normal. These twenty patients were followed-up over six months. All of them maintained anatomical reduction by RF system. Bone grafting had successful fusion by follow-up X-ray examinations. There were no important complications after surgery. The system is of simple structure facilitation implantation and enable the patients beginning ambulatory movements early, therefore it gives more satisfactory results over conventional Harrington and other segmental spinal instrumentation systems.
