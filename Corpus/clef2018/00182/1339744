An anatomic study of transpedicular posterior fixation of spine and its clinical application. Intact anatomic specimens of spinal column from T8-L5 were obtained and the height and width of vertebral pedicles, the distance between the pedicle to the upper and lower borders of the vertebral body, the angle of inclination of the coronal surface of vertebral pedicles, and other parameters were measured. Simulating pedicle screw implant in operation, K-wires were inserted into the pedicles and after taking X-ray films the pedicles were sectioned transversely. A series of morphologic parameters of the pedicles were obtained. The distances between the two K-wires' entry and exit points, and between the two pedicles of the same or the adjacent vertebra were measured. The relationships of the sites of determining the pedicle screw site was evaluated also from roentgenograms. Twenty two patients of thoracolumbar fracture were treated. The vertebral body height, kyphotic deformity and the displacement were corrected obviously. After operation the neural functions from incomplete paraplegia were recovered. Several problems about the pedicle screw implant technique were discussed.
