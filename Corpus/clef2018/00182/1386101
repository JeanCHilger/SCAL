Lumbar apophyseal ring fractures in adolescents. Fracture of the vertebral ring apophysis in the lumbar spine is an uncommon condition that has been reported in adolescent patients presenting with low back pain. The pathophysiology is considered to be a fracture of the posterior ring apophysis in association with a herniated disc. The nature and the extension of the lesion is best established by computed tomography scan with sagittal reconstruction. We present three cases to illustrate the classic clinical and radiologic findings. Management of the condition is also discussed.
