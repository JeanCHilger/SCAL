Shoulder pain, range of motion, and functional motor skills after acute tetraplegia. To investigate (1) the prevalence and course of shoulder pain in acute tetraplegia and (2) its relationship with range of motion (ROM) and function and any associated risk factors.A longitudinal prospective study.Spinal injury unit in an Australian hospital.Inpatients with acute tetraplegia.Not applicable.Demographics, pain intensity, shoulder ROM, and functional motor skills.The prevalence of pain during rehabilitation was 85%. Risk factors associated with pain during rehabilitation included age less than 30 years or more than 50 years (F=8.892, P=.064), admission motor level at C2-5 (F=5.833, P=.016), admission sensory level at C2-5 (F=7.543, P=.006), lower left upper limb (P=.005 95% confidence interval [CI], -14.74 to -2.86) and total American Spinal Injury Association motor scores (P=.009Shoulder pain is common in acute tetraplegia and is associated with loss of shoulder ROM. Risk factors identified include age, injury level, and duration of bedrest. Areas for further study are identified.
