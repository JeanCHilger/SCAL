The role and limitations of computed tomographic scanning in the evaluation of cervical trauma. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records, plain films, CT scans and complex-motion tomographic studies (TOMOS) of 216 consecutive patients with cervical injuries to determine the uses and limitations of CT in the evaluation of cervical trauma and the indications, if any, for the continued use of TOMOS in evaluating cervical trauma. There were 453 fractures and 104 subluxations or dislocations of the cervical spine in the 216 patients. Plain films detected 58% (262 of 453) of the fractures and 93% (97 of 104) of the subluxations and dislocations and 94% (202 of 216) of the patients with abnormalities were identified. Computed tomographic scans detected 90% (406 of 453) of the fractures and 54% (56 of 104) of the subluxations and dislocations
