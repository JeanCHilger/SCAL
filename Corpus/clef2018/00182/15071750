Cervical lipoblastomatosis producing quadriparesis: case report of surgery with chemotherapy and 10-year follow-up. Cervical lipoblastomatosis is a rare spinal tumour. Management of recurrence and long-term outcome data are not well described.A 10-month-old infant presented with an upper extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural cervical spinal tumour. It was debulked and histopathology revealed it to be lipoblastomatosis. The infant improved postoperatively. However, 5 months later the patient deteriorated and developed quadriparesis. The patient was managed with a more extensive resection and had chemotherapy. Ten years post-presentation the patient is well having made a full recovery and is living a normal life. Recent MRI shows minimal residual quiescent tumour.The treatment of cervical lipoblastomatosis should involve the resection of as much tumour as possible at the first sitting as recurrence can be a problem. In cases of spinal recurrence we recommend aggressive decompression and adjuvant chemotherapy.
