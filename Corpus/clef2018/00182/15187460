Lumbar spine injuries in pediatric and adolescent athletes. During the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in sports participation by pediatric athletes. Spinal injuries thus have become a great concern.

In this review article, sports-related lumbar spine problems will be covered including overuse injuries, spondylolysis, pars stress fractures, spondylolysthesis, and lumbar disc herniation. Early identification of these problems will eventually minimize these injuries.
