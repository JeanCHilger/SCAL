Locked rotational dislocation of the cervical spine. There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for dislocations of single articular processes of the cervical spine. However, the data in our own series and a survey of the literature show that in this type of injury the primary diagnosis rate is low (around 50%), that closed reduction maneuvers can be neurologically hazardous, and that operative fusion prevents certain complications. Among the 20 patients treated at the authors' institution the injury was located in the lower cervical spine in all but one patients and it was caused by a high-speed traffic accident in 14 patients. Four patients had no therapy at all the others were fused by an anterior approach in 8, a dorsal approach in 6, and a combined method in 2 patients. There was one death due to intimal tearing of a vertebral artery. Closed reduction caused a transient neurological lesion in 2 patients. In 6 patients whose dislocation was neither reduced nor fused, 3 developed chronic instability. In our new treatment protocol dislocation of a single articular process is only reduced after a diskectomy to prevent extrusion of the disc. If reduction from the anterior approach fails or if it cannot be achieved due delayed treatment, the entrapped nerve root is decompressed. Fusion of the injured segments is carried out by bone blocks and plates or hooks.
