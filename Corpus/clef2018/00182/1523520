Neurologic recovery associated with anterior decompression of spine fractures at the thoracolumbar junction (T12-L1). Between 1981 and 1990, twenty-two patients with incomplete neurologic deficits after thoracolumbar junction fractures were treated by anterior decompression and stabilization. Two patients were unavailable for follow-up examination, eleven underwent spinal canal decompression within 48 hours of injury (Group A) and nine patients underwent surgical decompression in an average of 61 days after injury (Group B). Neurologic recovery was analyzed by a modified Frankel grading system, the ASIA motor point scale and conus medullaris function. Patients were followed for an average of 3.5 years (range, 6-92 months). No patients had any deterioration in neurologic function after surgery. Patients in Group A had a modified Frankel grade improvement with a median of two grades and a mean American Spine Injury Association motor point improvement of 21.1 +/- 4.1. Four of nine patients with conus medullaris deficits demonstrated complete functional bladder and bowel return postoperatively. Those patients in Group B had a modified Frankel grade improvement with a median of one grade and a mean ASIA motor point improvement of 7.6 +/- 1.7. None of the six patients with conus medullaris injuries showed complete improvement in bladder or bowel function postoperatively. The modified Frankel grade and ASIA motor point score improvements were significant when the two groups were compared (P less than 0.04 and P less than 0.01, respectively). In this series of patients, early anterior decompression for traumatic injuries at the thoracolumbar junction was associated with improved rates of neurologic recovery when compared to late decompression.
