Imaging diagnosis of thoracolumbar burst fractures. To review imaging use in the diagnosis of thoracolumbar burst fractures and to determine the diagnostic value of different imaging methods.One hundred and fourteen patients with 120 thoracolumbar burst fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Plain radiographs were available in all cases CT scans and MRI were obtained in 96 and 74 cases, respectively.A total of 27 burst fractures were misdiagnosed as other types of fractures on radiographs alone, and accounted for 22.5% of all fractures. The results indicated that plain radiographs often fail to delineate the pathological features of thoracolumbar burst fractures, leading to delay in diagnosis.In regard to thoracolumbar injury diagnosis, burst fractures should be differentiated from compression fractures. CT should be routinely indicated and MRI examination, when necessary, may be simultaneously considered.
