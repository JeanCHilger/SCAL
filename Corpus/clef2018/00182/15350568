The role of clinical examination in excluding vascular injury in haemodynamically stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck. A prospective study of 59 patients. To prospectively evaluate the safety and accuracy of physical examination in determining the management of stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck.Prospective study of 59 patients with gunshot wounds to the neck.Fifty-nine stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck managed between December 2001 and August 2003. All patients had a physical examination and routine angiography according to a written protocol approved by the research ethics committee. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of physical examination were assessed and compared with the angiographic findings.Thirteen patients with positive findings on physical examination (history of bleeding, haematoma, minimal bleeding, thrill, bruit and pulse deficit) and 10 patients without clinical signs of vascular injury had vascular injury. A sensitivity of 57%, specificity 53%, positive predictive value 43% and negative predictive value of 67% were calculated for physical examination alone in detecting vascular injury.Findings on physical examination are not good predictors of vascular injury in stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck. Our findings question the validity of physical examination alone, as a safe and accurate assessment of patients with gunshot wounds to the neck. Arteriography or ultrasonography is needed to identify vascular injuries.
