Severe strains of the cervical spine operated on by a posterior approach (author's transl). The authors have operated on 18 cases of severe strain of the cervical spine (six cases of C1-C2 and 12 cases of level cervical spine). They point out the difficulty of an accurate diagnosis in emergency. They emphasize the importance of flexion-extension X-rays when conventional X-rays are not strictly normal. After an analysis of the results they suggest that recent cases should be treated by posterior grafting at the level of C1 and C2, posterior plating at lower levels. Old and irreducible cases should be treated by osteotomy and anterior grafting: banding with grafting at C1 and C2, posterior screwed plating at the inferior cervical level.
