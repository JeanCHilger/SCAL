Neonatal cervical cord compression by a staphylococcal abscess. In a small for date premature newborn infant, septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus was observed on day 16. In spite of an appropriate antimicrobial therapy, proteins of inflammation serum levels remained elevated for 2 weeks. The occurrence of cervical cord compression which could be related to a staphylococcal abscess explained the persisting inflammatory process. After puncturing of the abscess, immobilization and prolonged antibiotic treatment, outcome was favorable. This case demonstrates the difficulty of preventing abscesses related to staphylococcal septicemias and reports a very unusual site of abscess which could be well localized using MRI.
