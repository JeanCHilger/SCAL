Urodynamics: the incidence of urinary tract infection and autonomic dysreflexia in a challenging population. Individuals with spinal cord injury and other neurologic disorders have conditions that affect their urologic systems and their ability to store and empty urine. Urodynamic tests evaluate this dysfunction, but they have added risks of urinary tract infections and autonomic dysreflexia. A descriptive study investigated the incidence of urinary tract infections and autonomic dysreflexia in a large neurogenic population receiving urodynamics using standardized protocols.
