Type I odontoid fracture--case report. A 17-year-old man presented with sleeping tendency, tenderness of the back of the neck, and left upper monoplegia after a motorcycle accident. Three-dimensional computed tomography on the 2nd hospital day clearly revealed a type I odontoid fracture. His injuries were treated conservatively and he was discharged on the 60th hospital day, with sequelae due to the cervical root avulsion injuries.
