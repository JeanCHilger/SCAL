The multiply injured child. The treatment of multiple traumas in children requires knowledge of common injury patterns, incidence, mortality, and the consequences and differences between these injuries in children and adult patients. However, epidemiological studies concerning pediatric multiple trauma are rare. To address this, data were collected and analyzed from 682 multiple trauma patients treated at a Level I trauma center. The patients were divided into four age-related groups (< 6 years, 6-12 years, 13-18 years, and 18-40 years) and were evaluated for trauma mechanism, injury distribution, and cause of death. Children aged 6 to 17 years mostly were injured as pedestrians and cyclists whereas infants, preschoolers, and adults more commonly were injured as car passengers. Pediatric patients suffered a significantly higher mortality than adults, with a threefold increased risk of death when injured as passengers in car accidents. Injuries to the head and the legs were most common. A lower incidence of thoracic (28% versus. 62%), abdominal (20% versus 36%), pelvic (22% versus 35%), and upper limb (32% versus 43%) trauma was observed in children (< 18 years) than in adults (18-40 years). Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen, and head were associated with a high risk of death in all groups. Spinal cord injuries, especially in the cervical region, also carried a high risk of mortality (36.8 in the group of patients younger than 18 years and 18.9 in the group of patients 18-40 years). Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries. The data show that there are important differences in incidence, mortality, and injury patterns between pediatric and adult patients with multiple traumas.
