Course of motor recovery in the zone of partial preservation in spinal cord injury. Thirty-nine C4 to C6 motor complete Frankel A or B spinal cord injured subjects were included in this prospective study to determine the course of recovery in the zone of partial preservation (ZPP) during the first 6 months postinjury. Subjects had initial manual muscle testing and neurologic examination between 3 and 7 days postinjury. Subjects whose most rostral key muscle in the ZPP had a motor power of grade 1 or 1+/5 (group 1, n = 22) were compared with subjects whose most rostral key muscle had a motor power of grade 2 or 2+/5 (group 2, n = 17). Subjects had manual muscle testing weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 6 months postinjury. Comparisons were made for recovery to: (1) grade 3/5 (2) grade 4/5
