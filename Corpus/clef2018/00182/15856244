Magnetic resonance signal alterations in the acute onset of heterotopic ossification in patients with spinal cord injury. The purpose of our study was to evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) signal characteristics of acutely forming heterotopic ossification (HO) in paralyzed patients. Fourteen patients with spinal cord injury (female n=2, male n=12, mean age 38.3 years) and acute onset of radiographically proven HO had contrast-enhanced 1.5-T MRI within 13.4+/-18.3 days of clinical onset of symptoms. MR signal alterations of affected muscles, fascia, subcutaneous tissue, skin and adjacent bone were evaluated. A diffuse T2-hyperintense signal of multiple muscle groups was seen in all patients (bilateral in 12) involving quadriceps (n=13, 93%), adductors (n=13, 93%) and iliopsoas (n=12, 86%) with contrast enhancement in n=11 (79%), n=8 (57%) and n=8 (57%) patients. All patients had nonenhancing areas (mean size 2 x 3.5 x 5.8 cm) within diffusely enhancing muscles. HO formation occurred around these nonenhancing areas in four patients with computed tomography follow-up. Other MR findings included fascial edema (n=14, 100%), fascial enhancement (n=13, 93%), subcutaneous edema (n=13, 93%), subcutaneous enhancement (n=12, 86%), bone marrow edema (n=5, 36%), and joint effusion (n=12, 86%). MRI reveals mostly bilateral edema and enhancement of muscles, fascia and subcutaneous tissue during acute onset of HO. HO develops in the periphery of well-defined areas of no enhancement.
