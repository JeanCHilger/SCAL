Segmental costovertebral malformation associated with lipomyelomeningocoele. We describe 2 patients with segmental costovertebral malformation, a form of spondylocostal dysostosis, associated with tethering of the conus to a lipomyelomeningocoele. Such an association is rare. In both these patients the defects occurred sporadically. The relevant literature is reviewed.
