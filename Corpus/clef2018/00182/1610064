Otolaryngologic manifestations of the mucopolysaccharidoses. A retrospective review of 45 children with mucopolysaccharidoses was performed to determine the frequency of complications related to the head and neck. In this series, every patient had at least one complication involving the head and neck region, and in over half, operative intervention by the otolaryngologist was required. Upper airway obstruction occurred in 17 (38%) and necessitated a tracheostomy in 7 (16%). Cervical spine instability occurred in 8 (18%), making airway management difficult. Recurrent respiratory infections occurred in 17 (38%), and chronic recurrent middle ear effusions were noted in 33 (73%). This review demonstrates that children afflicted with the mucopolysaccharidoses frequently have otolaryngologic-related complications that are common throughout their life span and often the primary management issue in their continuing care. The otolaryngologic management of these patients is outlined based on the results of this study and review of the relevant literature.
