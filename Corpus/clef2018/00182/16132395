A simplified method of opacifying and mixing acrylic cement for percutaneous vertebroplasty: a clinical and in vitro study. The objective of this study was to simplify the opacifying mixing process of the bone cement and contrast used for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). We performed a biomechanical study of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (Corinplast 3) using three different mixtures of PMMA, monomer, and contrast: group I, 2:1 group II, 3:2
