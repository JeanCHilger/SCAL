Osteoporosis at presentation of childhood ALL: management with pamidronate. Vertebral fractures at diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are an uncommon but recognized problem. Clinical issues associated with pathological fractures in these children include pain control and the potential for further treatment-associated fractures and long-term bony morbidity. The authors report the successful use of pamidronate in two children who presented with vertebral compression fractures at diagnosis of ALL. Both patients had pain and low bone mineral density at baseline. In addition to standard chemotherapy, pamidronate (1 mg/kg, IV) was given bimonthly. Initial rapid symptom relief and gradual improvement of bone mineral density was demonstrated in both patients.
