Management of acute traumatic atlas fractures. A prospective review of a clinical series was performed. The treatment features of atlas fractures with and without associated axis injuries were investigated.Twenty-nine patients were investigated.No displaced fractures were treated with a cervical orthosis. Patients with displaced fractures were managed with a halo vest immobilization 96.4% patients had a solid fusion at their last follow-up evaluations.Isolated not displaced or combined with not displaced axis fractures atlas fractures can be treated effectively with a rigid cervical collar alone. Isolated displaced fractures or not displaced but with concurrent displaced axis fractures require immobilization by the halo vest.
