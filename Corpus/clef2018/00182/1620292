The role of immediate operative intervention in severely head-injured children with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. In an attempt to improve and expedite the care of head-injured children, data have been published recommending burr hole exploration in lieu of computed tomography for children with signs of brain stem compression or with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. Exploratory burr holes revealed a high incidence of subdural hematomas, and removal of the hematomas improved survival. We are reporting 19 consecutive children with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 3. Coma score evaluation was confounded by intubation, sedation, pharmacological paralysis, and posttraumatic seizures. We found no radiographical or postmortem pathological evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, which would warrant operative intervention. A high incidence of multisystem injuries and high cervical spine injuries would have made early intervention both dangerous and inappropriate. Although there is a definite role for emergency trephination, routine exploratory burr holes for children with a Coma score of 3 is not justified.
