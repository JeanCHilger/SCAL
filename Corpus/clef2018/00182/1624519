Neurofibromatosis of the cervical spine. A report of eight cases. Eight patients with neurofibromatosis presented with symptoms of cervical spine involvement over a period of 17 years, five of them within the second decade of life. The symptoms included neurological deficit in five, a neck mass in four, and deformity in three only two complained of pain. Osteolysis of vertebral bodies with kyphosis of more than 90 degrees was the most common radiological feature. Posterior fusion failed in the one patient in whom it was performed. Good results were achieved by anterior fusion, alone, or combined with posterior fusion. Surgical complications included one death in a patient with a malignant neurofibroma, and one case of transient neurological deterioration.
