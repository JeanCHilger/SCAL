Traumatic spinal epidural hematoma-unusual cause of torticollis in a child. Traumatic spinal epidural hematoma is rare in children. The presentation could be nonspecific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. We present an infant who sustained an epidural hematoma after a "trivial" injury. The delay in diagnosis led to minor neurological deficit at 6-week follow-up. Irritability and torticollis after a neck trauma in an afebrile child should alert to the possibility of spinal cord compression. Early imaging and early decompression will minimize morbidity.
