Pain interference in persons with spinal cord injury: classification of mild, moderate, and severe pain. Pain intensity is commonly measured by patient ratings on numerical rating scales (NRS). However, grouping such ratings into categories may be useful for guiding treatment decisions or interpreting clinical trial outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine pain intensity classification in 2 samples of persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and chronic pain. The first sample (n = 307) rated the average intensity and activity interference of pain in general, and the second sample (n = 174) rated their worst pain problem. Pain intensity was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe using 4 possible classification systems analyses were performed to determine the classification system that best distinguished the pain intensity groups in terms of activity interference. In both samples, the optimal mild/moderate boundary was lower (mild = 1-3 on a 0-10 NRS scale) than that reported previously for individuals with other pain problems. The possibility that pain may interfere with activity at lower levels for individuals with SCI requires further exploration. The moderate/severe boundary suggested by previous research was confirmed in only one of the samples. Implications for the assessment of pain intensity and functioning in persons with SCI and pain are discussed.Although pain in individuals with SCI is common, more research is needed regarding its characteristics and treatment. This study sought to develop an empirically based classification system for mild, moderate, and severe pain that could be useful for applying clinical treatment guidelines and for interpreting the results of much-needed clinical trials.
