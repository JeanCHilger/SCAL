Prostate activity and prostate cancer in spinal cord injury. In addition to androgen, autonomic nerves may be involved in prostatic function. As patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) have impaired innervation of the prostate, the prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in patients with SCI may be different from those of healthy men. Experiments in rats with SCI indicate that neurogenic factors play an important role in prostate growth and function but the same phenomena may not occur in men with SCI because the current animal models differ from clinical results in humans in several respects. Although many of studies indicate the importance of intact peripheral innervation on the secretory function of the prostate, the effect of more central denervation such as occurs in complete SCI at the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar levels on prostatic function is unclear. In addition, the impact of central nervous system injury on prostatic secretory activity, and consequently on serum PSA levels, is also not clear. Furthermore, the impact of hormonal changes on prostate cancer development and prognosis observed in patients with SCI may also be affected by the level of injury and patient age at the time of injury, which have not been studied. In this article, we review prostate activity and prostate cancer in SCI and discuss how they may relate to neurogenic factors.
