Transient spinal cord injuries in the young athlete. Spinal cord injuries are be potentially devastating. Despite initial presentation, they may be permanent or transient. A small percentage of spinal cord patients with motor or sensory dysfunction recover rapidly and completely with no neurological sequelae. Cervical cord neurapraxia is a frequent cause of transient neurologic symptoms. This transient neurological phenomenon involves bilateral motor paralysis and/or sensory manifestations that appear in the absence of any structural deficiencies of the cervical spine as evidence by negative diagnostic imaging. All patients with any history of neurologic deficits should be assessed thoroughly and rendered care appropriately to avoid secondary injury. This article will present a case study of a 15-year-old high school football player who complained of motor and sensory deficits after tackling another player. Treatment was provided and his neurological symptoms resolved completely. The pathophysiology of cellular injury related to the spinal cord and cervical cord neurapraxia is reviewed. In addition treatment modalities such as high dose steroids to reduce secondary spinal cord injury are discussed.
