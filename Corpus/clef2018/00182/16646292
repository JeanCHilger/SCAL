Evaluation of upper cervical spine injury (C1-C2) with computed tomography. Cervical spine injuries are common and essential diagnostic problem. Diagnostic imaging is necessary for proper and effective treatment. Helical computed tomography (CT) and plain radiography are the basic diagnostic methods in cervical spine injuries. The purpose of this work was the comparison of CT examination of the upper cervical spine (CI-C2) with patients' clinical state. Twenty four patients (17 men and 7 women) were introduced into the study. The most common cause of cervical spine injuries were car accidents (48.5%). CT examination was performed in all patients. Six patients (25%) had multilevel injury, localized at C1-C2 level and in the lower part of cervical spine. The main pathology diagnosed by CT in the studied group was rotatory subluxation (66.6%). Eight patients (33.3%), with rotatory subluxation did not present any abnormalities in neurological examination performed immediately after the admission to the hospital. C1 and/or C2 fractures were diagnosed in 11 patients (45.8%), in some cases (in 3 patients - 12.5%) they were accompanied by rotatory subluxations. CT examination is the basic technique of diagnostic imaging in a case of cervical spine injuries. It enables quick, accurate and precise evaluation of bone structures and surrounding soft tissues. CT also enables multiplanar imaging and 3-dimentional imaging.
