Measuring change in arm hand skilled performance in persons with a cervical spinal cord injury: responsiveness of the Van Lieshout Test. To asses whether the Van Lieshout Test (VLT) is responsive to measure changes in arm hand skilled performance (AHSP) over time during active rehabilitation in persons with cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) and in different subgroups of persons with C-SCI according to lesion completeness and to lesion level.Longitudinal cohort study.Spinal Cord Injury Units in eight rehabilitation centres across the Netherlands.In the present study, data from a national SCI cohort study are used. Data from the VLT, the Grasp Release Test (GRT), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Quadriplegia Index of Function (QIF) were recorded at three moments during active rehabilitation: at the start of active rehabilitation (t1), 3 months after t1 (t2) and at discharge (t3). Data have been analysed using three responsiveness measures, that is, the standardized response mean, the effect size and comparison of test scores measured at different times.The VLT is responsive for the intervals t1-3, t1-2 and t2-3. The VLT can be used to measure changes in AHSP in persons with a C-SCI with an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A or B score or an AIS C or D score, as well as in persons with a C3-C6 lesion or a C7-T1 lesion. The responsiveness of the VLT is significantly correlated to the GRT, but not to the FIM and the QIF.The VLT is responsive in measuring changes in AHSP during rehabilitation in persons with C-SCI.
