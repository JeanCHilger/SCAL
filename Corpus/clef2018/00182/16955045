Cervical catheter tip placement for intrathecal baclofen administration. Intrathecal baclofen can reduce congenital and posttraumatic spasticity. Traditionally, the catheter tip for baclofen delivery is placed in a low thoracic position, which can result in a lumbar-to-cisternal cerebrospinal fluid baclofen concentration gradient. We investigated whether more rostral catheter placement was technically feasible, safe, and able to control upper extremity spasticity.The records of 48 patients with a baclofen pump were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cervically placed intrathecal catheters for baclofen administration. Twenty-three patients had a catheter located in a cervical position and 25 had a catheter in a thoracic position (control group). Complications, including baclofen overdose, mechanical failures, and infections, were noted. Pre- and postoperative Ashworth scores were determined by a physical therapist using a standardized protocol.The mean duration of the follow-up period was 10 months. The groups were not significantly different in patient age, baclofen dose, or duration of follow-up, but differed somewhat in the causes of spasticity. For patients with a cervical catheter tip position, upper extremity Ashworth scores decreased significantly from 4.0 +/- 0.8 (standard deviation) preoperatively to 3.0 +/- 0.9 postoperatively (P = 0.003). In both groups, lower extremity spasticity was significantly reduced. Postoperatively, one patient with a cervical catheter developed aspiration pneumonia, possibly because of sedation. Other complications included hardware infections, mechanical malfunctions, and pseudomeningoceles.In this series, placement of intrathecal baclofen catheters in the cervical region resulted in equal control of spasticity in the upper and lower extremities and did not increase complications related to the catheter position.
