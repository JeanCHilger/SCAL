Calcified disc herniation in childhood. Calcification of intervertebral discs is a rare occurrence in children. Although the etiology of the calcification remains uncertain, it is no related with degenerative diseases. The clinical picture is non specific with neck pain, muscle contractures and, sometimes, low-grade fever. These symptoms generally disappear spontaneously, and surgery rarely becomes necessary. In our review of the literature, we have found only seventeen cases requiring surgical management. Two of these children had been previously diagnosed with calcified intervertebral discs, but at the time no herniation had been ruled out with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report the case of a girl who was diagnosed, when she was ten years old, with intervertebral idiopatic calcifications. Four years later she presented with radiculopathy caused by the posterolateral displacement of a calcified cervical disc, which required operative management. We think that this case supports the theory of Heinrich et al. that considers that the calcified hernia is a complication of a previous pathology, namely intervertebral calcification. Clinical and therapeutic aspects of this entity are discussed.
