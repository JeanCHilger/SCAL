Domestic violence: an analysis of injuries in female victims. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of head and neck injuries in females based on complaints registered as bodily harm or cruel and unusual punishment at the Women's Defense Precinct in Araçatuba, São Paulo State, Brazil, in 2002. A total of 204 police inquiries were conducted in 2002, resulting in 33 police reports of bodily harm and cruel and unusual punishment to females. The police reports were examined as to victim's age and site of injury. The results showed that injuries are inflicted on various age brackets, with a higher prevalence in children and adolescents. In addition, the highest prevalence of injuries was in the head and neck, encompassing the area where dentists work and where they should be prepared to treat victims of such violence.
