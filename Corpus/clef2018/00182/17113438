A retrospective analysis of oral and maxillofacial injuries in motor vehicle accidents. To clarify the relations of the severity of oral and maxillofacial injuries from traffic accidents (TAs) to seating position and the use of restraint systems.Hospital records were reviewed for all patients who had sustained oral or maxillofacial injuries in TAs and then were admitted to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dokkyo University School of Medicine (Tochigi, Japan), from 1994 through 2003.A total of 201 patients, with a mean injury severity score (ISS) of 7.9 +/- 7.6, were included in this study. Although patients with any oral or maxillofacial injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 2 or more had extremely low ISSs, hospitalization was relatively long. The ISS and AIS score of the head or neck were significantly higher in unrestrained drivers (12.4 +/- 11.2, 1.2 +/- 1.4, respectively) than in restrained drivers (6.5 +/- 4.6, 0.4 +/- 1.0, respectively). However, AIS scores of the face were similar in unrestrained drivers (1.9 +/- 0.7) and restrained drivers (1.7 +/- 0.5). Furthermore, the incidence of maxillofacial fractures did not differ between the 2 groups.Because wearing seat belts cannot prevent all oral and maxillofacial injuries in motor vehicle occupants, both physicians and engineers must pay greater attention to the mechanisms of oral and maxillofacial injuries in TAs.
