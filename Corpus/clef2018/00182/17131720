Epidemiological analysis of posttraumatic cervical spine injury. The purpose of this study was epidemiological analysis of trauma causes and trauma effects including age and sex. 112 patients after cervical spine trauma, admitted in Emergency Room of Self-Financing Public District Hospital of Trauma Surgery at Piekary Slaskie were studied retrospectively. The following parameters were estimated: age, sex, cause of injury, type and localization of pathology. The mean age was 35.4 years. The largest age group consisted of patients 25-45 years old. Males predominated over females in all age groups. The most common cause of cervical spine injury was traffic accident with a patient as a car driver or as a car passenger (45.5%) The most common pathology was luxation and subluxation (36.6%). Luxations and subluxations were most often localized on C1-C2 level (50.6% of all luxations), and on C5-C6 level (19.8% of all luxations). Fractures were most often localized in C5 vertebra (24.8% of all fractures). These results suggest that causes and results of trauma and participation of both sex have changed.
