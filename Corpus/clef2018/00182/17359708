Anterior fusion for unstable lower cervical spine. To assess the clinical outcome of anterior fusion for unstable lower cervical spine.From October 2000 to October 2004, anterior fusion were performed for 67 cases with unstable lower cervical spine with corresponding clinical manifestations. There were 38 males and 29 females with an average age of 33 years. Instability of lower cervical spine was radiographically determined by sagittal plane displacement between 2 cervical vertebrae of more than 3.5 mm or relative sagittal plane angulation greater than 11 degrees on maximal lateral flexion and extension films. Anterior interbody fusion methods included bone grafting with plate fixation or cage. JOA rating system was used for spine cord function assessment.All patients were followed up for an average period of 14 months. Solid fusion was achieved for all operated levels. The majority of the patients got a satisfactory relief of preoperative symptoms. JOA scores for cord function improved from preoperative 10.15 to postoperative 14.95 with statistical difference (P < 0.05). Complications included screws loosing and backout in 2 cases. Revision surgery were performed with uneventful recovery.Satisfactory clinical outcome can be achieved by proper selection of anterior fusion methods for patients with unstable lower cervical spine.
