Myelographic and enhanced computed tomographic appearance of acute traumatic spinal cord avulsion. The neuroradiological findings that revealed spinal cord transection/laceration in 6 patients with acute, blunt spinal trauma are described. Four patients suffered cervical spine injuries, and two had thoracic injuries. Initially, all patients had complete neurological deficit at the level of injury. The deficit improved in only 1 patient. On the basis of clinical history and spinal radiographs, spinal hyperflexion with distraction was the predominant mechanism of injury in our patients. Computed tomography with intrathecal contrast was performed on all patients and was always diagnostic. Visualization of intrathecal contrast material accumulating within the cord or the absence of cord shadow within the contrast column established the diagnosis in all cases. A dural tear was noted in 3 patients. Thoracic myelography was performed in 2 patients and, in both, demonstrated contrast pooling within the spinal cord at the level of the laceration. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in 1 patient and revealed an irregular, low-signal-intensity, intramedullary region extending to the cord surface on T1-weighted axial images. The myelographic and enhanced computed tomographic appearances of acute, traumatic spinal cord avulsion/laceration, which have been infrequently reported in the literature, are described.
