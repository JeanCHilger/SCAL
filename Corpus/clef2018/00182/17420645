Penetrating neck injuries in children. Penetrating neck injuries are uncommon in children, and when they do occur, they can be a challenge to manage. Injuries can be cardiovascular, aerodigestive, and neurovascular. In the past, injuries were explored surgically to evaluate the extent of the injury studies are now showing that observation and less invasive studies have a positive outcome for the patient. Immediate surgical intervention remains mandatory for the clinically unstable patient, whereas stable patients have studies done that pertain to their signs and symptoms, thus having a conservative nonoperative approach to care.
