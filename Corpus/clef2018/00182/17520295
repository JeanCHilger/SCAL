Acute L5 pedicle fracture and contralateral spondylolysis in a 12-year-old boy: a case report. Acute unilateral L5 pedicle fracture associated with a pre-existing contralateral spondylolysis is a rare lesion. We report a case in a non-competitive 12-year-old boy. We present the clinical, radiological and specific management of this rare condition. The clinical and radiological draft of this patient was reviewed. The follow-up was 30 months after fracture healing. Some cases reported in the literature were analyzed and our clinical findings and therapeutic strategy was compared and discussed. Non-operative treatment was done including full-time bracing in a modified Boston brace incorporating one thigh for 3 months. Plain radiographs and computed tomographic (CT)-scan performed at 3 and 6 months showed progressive healing of the pedicle fracture and no modification of the contralateral isthmic spondylolytic lesion. At final follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and resumed all his activities. In skeletally immature patients, we think that conservative treatment should be considered as a treatment option for this unusual injury.
