Emergency department management of blunt cervical tracheal trauma in children. A case history of a young girl who sustained a small posterior laceration of her cervical trachea after blunt trauma is presented. She was brought to the emergency department (ED) by her parents roughly two hours after the incident with only minor symptoms. While in the ED, she developed significant airway compromise over a span of minutes. Orotracheal intubation was performed to secure her airway, and she responded to conservative management of her laceration. Her signs and symptoms, resolved, and she was discharged after five days. This case illustrates the importance of urgent evaluation and careful observation of patients with possible tracheal damage, as even very small tears have the potential to cause life-threatening airway compromise.
