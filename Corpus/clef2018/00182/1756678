Fracture of the posterior arch of the atlas. The authors analyzed the results obtained in 10 fractures of the posterior arch of the atlas treated nonsurgically. There was consolidation in all of the cases at the end of treatment. According to the authors the element which most characterizes this fracture is constituted by its radiological diagnosis which principally makes use of lateral projection. In particular cases, when patients are characterized by multiple trauma, the fracture may go unrecognized.
