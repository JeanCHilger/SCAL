Os odontoideum. Between January 1981 and December 1985 at the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute 8 patients affected with atlo-axial instability secondary to os odontoideum were submitted to surgery: all of the patients were characterized by persistent cervical pain and neurological deficit, which was still at an initial stage in 5 cases, and more severe in the remaining 3 (severe spastic tetraparesis). All of the patients were submitted to a similar treatment protocol in three stages: 1) preoperative reduction in halo-plaster, 2) surgical stabilization of C1-C2 by posterior vertebral fusion (limited to C1-C2 in 6 cases and extended as far as the occiput in the remaining 2), 3) postoperative immobilization in halo-plaster for an average of 12 weeks. At follow-up obtained after an average of 4 years and 2 months there was consolidation of the fusion in all of the cases treated: in 1 case, however, revision of the fusion was required 3 and 1/2 months after surgery, whereupon fusion was finally obtained. The total regression of pain was obtained in all 8 of the cases treated and there was evident neurological recovery in the 3 patients who had been characterized by severe spastic tetraparesis prior to surgery. The treatment protocol used in this series of patients proved to be a reliable one. Thus, it was possible to avoid the onset of chronic atlo-axial instability and its severe neurological sequelae in those cases where neurological deficit was still at an initial stage furthermore, effective recovery was obtained in patients in whom neurological deficit was severe.
