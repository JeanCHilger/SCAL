Management of cervical root fracture using orthodontic extrusion and crown reattachment: a case report. Root fractures involve damage to pulp, cementum, dentin, and periodontal ligaments. These injuries affect 0.5% to 7% of permanent teeth. Cervical root fractures are less frequently seen and have a worse prognosis compared with the fractures in the apical or middle third of the root. This case report describes the treatment of a cervical root fracture in a maxillary central incisor. After removal of the coronal fragment, the root was filled temporarily with calcium hydroxide and orthodontic extrusion was initiated. The remaining root portion was elevated above the epithelial attachment and a successful coronal restoration was made using the natural crown of the traumatized tooth.
