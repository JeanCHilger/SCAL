Diagnosis of anterior cervical spinal epidural abscess by US and MRI in a newborn. A 10-day-old girl who initially presented with fever developed over five days a complete paresis of both upper arms and swallowing difficulty. After emergency drainage of a retropharyngeal abscess, cervical US demonstrated a cervical anterior epidural mass compressing the cord. MRI confirmed the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess secondary to C4-C5 spondylodiscitis. Surgical removal of the abscess was followed by complete disappearance of the neurologic symptoms after six months of follow-up. This is the first case of spinal epidural abscess in a newborn to be diagnosed by US and MRI preoperatively. The advantages of these non-invasive imaging modalities are discussed, and compared to myelography.
