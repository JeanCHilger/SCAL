Correlation of back pain and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine in elite horse vaulters. A connection between morphologic lesions of the spine and specific sport disciplines incorporating torsional and hyperextension forces has been found. Although vaulting incorporates a significant amount of figures known from gymnastics, little is known about the influence of this sport on the lower back. The aim of our study was to assess to what extent vaulters suffer from back pain and whether these symptoms correlate to findings in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine.20 high level vaulters ( [see text] age 21.95 [15 - 36] years) were included in the study. Using a standardised questionnaire biometric data, training intensity, localisation as well as intensity of back pain (VAS) was assessed. 12 of these vaulters agreed to an MRI scan of their lumbar spine. Scans were evaluated for morphologic changes using a semiquantative score and the results were correlated to clinical symptoms.17 / 20 (85 %) reported of back pain of which 15 (75 %) had daily pain, the remaining 2 only occasionally. The average pain intensity on the visual analogue scale (VAS) was reported to be 3.76 +/- 0.53. The MRI scans revealed only slight degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. Statistical analysis of the data (Spearman's rank test) could not show a significant correlation between clinical symptoms and morphologic MRI-changes.Vaulters, compared to riders of other disciplines, seem to suffer from recurrent back pain to a greater extent. Despite the fact that the lumbar spine is confronted with repetitive torsional and hyperextension forces, vaulters do not show undue early degenerative changes or marked lesions of the lumbar spine. Recurrent back pain in the vaulter is most likely due to functional problems. It seems unlikely that is based on manifest morphologic changes of the lower back.
