Prophylactics of urological complications in patients with a vertebro-spinal trauma.

A comparative analysis of the results of treatment of patients using ordinary methods and that developed by the authors has shown considerable advantages of the latter: less number of complications such as urethritis, urinary bladder calculi, pyelonephritis.
