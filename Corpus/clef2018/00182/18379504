Evoked potentials in patients with myofascial pain syndrome in the late residual period of natal cervical trauma. Evoked potentials (EP), including short-latency brainstem auditory and somatosensory EP, have been studied in 80 patients with myofascial pain syndrome. Brainstem dysfunction, predominantly on the ponto-mesencephalic level, and conduction delay in the somatosensory pathway on the supraspinal level have been found in patients with natal trauma of cervical spine, being most significant in patients with severe myofascial pain syndrome. EP findings showed impairments of afferent structures of nervous system and inefficiency of antinociceptive system of supraspinal level in this group of patients that could cause the development of persistent brain syndrome.
