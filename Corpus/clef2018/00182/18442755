Vertebral Fracture Assessment: the 2007 ISCD Official Positions. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) is an established, low radiation method for detection of prevalent vertebral fractures. Vertebral fractures are usually not recognized clinically at the time of their occurrence, but their presence indicates a substantial risk for subsequent fractures independent of bone mineral density. Significant evidence supporting VFA use for many post-menopausal women and older men has accumulated since the last ISCD Official Position Statement on VFA was published. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry considered the following issues at the 2007 Position Development Conference: (1) What are appropriate indications for Vertebral Fracture Assessment (2) What is the most appropriate method of vertebral fracture detection with VFA
