Osteoid osteoma of a cervical vertebral body. We report a very rare case of 5-year-old boy with osteoid osteoma of the cervical vertebral body. The patient presented with a 6-month history of neck pain with radiation into the shoulder and arm on the left side, which was relieved by ibuprofen. Neurological examination and plain radiographs of the cervical spine were normal. CT scan and bone scintigraphy, rather than MRI suggested the pathological diagnosis, which was confirmed on histological examination. The patient underwent excision of the lesion via an anterior approach with complete resolution of the pain postoperatively.
