Exercise testing using upper extremity ergometry in pediatric spinal cord injury. To describe an upper extremity ergometer test for children with spinal cord injury (SCI) and examine differences based on injury level for peak heart rate (HR peak), oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak/kg), and peak power output per kilogram (W peak/kg).Twenty-nine children with motor complete SCI participated. Nine had low cervical (C7, C8), 9 had upper thoracic (T1-T4), and 11 had mid/low thoracic (T5-T11) SCI. HR peak, VO2 peak/kg, and W peak/kg were compared based on these 3 injury level groupings.HR peak (p = 0.013), VO 2 peak/kg (p = 0.041), and W peak/kg (p = 0.001) differed between groups. The mid/low thoracic group had the highest values for each variable.The differences in HR peak, VO 2 peak/kg, and W peak/kg were consistent with exercise effects reported for adults with SCI. Further research is needed to develop an appropriate standardized ergometric test for children with SCI.
