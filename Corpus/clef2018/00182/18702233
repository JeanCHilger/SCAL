Massive diminution of the cervical spine: one case report. The authors report a 13-year-old female with shunted hydrocephalus who when evaluated for neck pain, was found to have not only fusion of cervical vertebrae but significant diminution of the cervical spine. Following our review of the classification of KFA and our case report, the current interpretation of Klippel and Feil's original description of KFA should be re-evaluated, and/or a new class of KFA used, that of complete or partial cervical vertebrae agenesis and associated abnormalities, should be considered in the classification of this anomaly.
