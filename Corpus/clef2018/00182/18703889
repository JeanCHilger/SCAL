Successful multimodal therapies for a primary atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in the cervical spine. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) occurring in the central nervous system is a high-grade malignant tumor, and its prognosis is poor for patients younger than 3 years of age. In this article, we present a case of infant AT/RT in the cervical spine and its successful treatment by intensive chemotherapy. The patient, a 1.75-year-old girl, developed an acute, progressive tetraparesis. MRI revealed a large, intradural mass in the cervical spine.Total surgical resection was performed, and the specimen was diagnosed as AT/RT. Continuously, she received intensive chemotherapy using thiotepa with autologous bone marrow transplantation. At the age of nearly 3 years, she received radiation therapy to the local tumor bed and craniospinal axis. She is now 4 years old and has been maintained in complete remission with a good clinical course and no neurological deficit. The success of this treatment for the patient was that we could prevent tumor recurrence until she was able to receive radiotherapy.
