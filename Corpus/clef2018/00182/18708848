Quality of life of people with spinal cord injury in Northern India. This is a prospective longitudinal descriptive study to prospectively evaluate quality of life (QoL) in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population in Northern India and identify any association between clinical variables and QoL and, finally, to see the impact of remedial measures taken to improve QoL over time. Fifty persons with SCI were surveyed for medical problems, neurological status and social adjustments in Northern India. QoL was determined on the Global QoL scale (Visual Analogue Scale) and follow-up assessment was performed 6 months later to examine the impact of remedial measures over time. Thirty-six (72%) men and 14 (28%) women participated. Mean age and duration of injury were 37.7 and 3.7 years, respectively. Bladder problems (44%), bedsores (36%), gastrointestinal problems (56%), neuropathic pain (42%) and spasticity (60%) were the most common medical problems. Age, education, marital status and duration of injury were not associated with significant difference on QoL scores. Female sex, employment, mobility, autonomy, cordial partner relations and good social adjustment were associated with higher scores of QoL. Mean Global QoL scores were 54.3 and 63.7 at the initial survey and at the 6-month follow-up survey, respectively. In a community-based sample of SCI in Northern India, a good-to-fair QoL was found. It is reasonable to believe that understanding and taking appropriate remedial measures through more comprehensive rehabilitation programmes will play a vital role in enhancement of QoL in persons with SCI.
