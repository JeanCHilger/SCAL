Indications and results of kypho- and vertebroplasty. The best currently available evidence based treatment reduces vertebral fracture risk but does not totally prevent osteoporotic and malignant follow-up fractures. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are options of a causal treatment to reduce pain by internal stabilization of fractured vertebrae. The indication for these minimal invasive procedures requires an interdisciplinary discussion of the individual case to guarantee technical feasibility, to increase the likelihood that these procedures will indeed reduce pain and to embed these procedures into the long term therapeutic concept of every single patient. In addition to internal stabilization of a painfully fractured vertebra kyphoplasty also seeks to restore lost vertebral height which appears promising in acute vertebral fractures. Due to the procedure there are more cement leakages after vertebroplasty. Available controlled prospective studies demonstrate only for kyphoplasty a long-term benefit for the patient in terms of pain reduction, increased mobility and improved quality of life.
