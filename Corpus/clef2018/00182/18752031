Trans-upper-sternal approach to the cervicothoracic junction. From August 1999 to February 2006, 11 patients with cervicothoracic lesions (eight males, three females age range, 17-77 years) were surgically treated using the trans-upper-sternal approach. Combined cervicothoracic incision and upper sternotomy facilitated exposure for tumor resection, partial or subtotal removal of the involved vertebrae, and spinal cord decompression. The spinal column then was stabilized. Neurologic status was assessed using the Frankel classification. Followup for a minimum of 10 months (mean, 31 monthsLevel IV, therapeutic study.
