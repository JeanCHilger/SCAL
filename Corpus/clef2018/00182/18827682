Reference data for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging properties of meniscoids in the cervical zygapophyseal joints. Prospective in vivo study of meniscoids in the cervical zygapophyseal joints.To generate reference data for in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging properties of meniscoids in the cervical zygapophyseal joints.Meniscoids, also called synovial folds, are tiny anatomic structures within the zygapophyseal joints. It has been suggested that pathologic conditions of meniscoids may be a potential source of cervical pain. Prior studies were limited to in vitro observations. To identify pathologic conditions of the meniscoids, it is necessary to obtain reference data of basic in vivo MR imaging properties of meniscoids in a healthy population.Fifty-six healthy volunteers (33 women, 23 men mean age 42.0 +/- 17.1 years) were investigated in a 3.0 Tesla MR scanner using high resolution isotropic 3-dimensional sequences. Presence, size, location, and signal intensity of the meniscoids were assessed, and their dependence on sex, age, body mass index, and degenerative changes were analyzed by t test and correlation analysis.There was no significant difference in presence (20.3 +/- 4.8 vs. 19.7 +/- 4.8) and size (3.8 +/- 0.7 mm vs. 4.1 +/- 0.5 mm) of meniscoids between women and men. Presence of meniscoids decreased with increasing age (r = -0.38, P = 0.004). Size of meniscoids did not significantly depend on age (r = 0.02, P = 0.91). Meniscoid entrapment (location) was a rare condition (0.4%). Tissue composition (signal intensities) of the meniscoids was 61.6% mainly fatty, 15.8% mainly fibrous, and 22.6% mixed.Basic data about in vivo MR imaging properties of cervical meniscoids in a healthy population have been successfully generated. Subsequent studies may use these data as reference for the identification of meniscoid pathologies.
