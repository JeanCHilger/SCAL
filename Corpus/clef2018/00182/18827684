Spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality in an infant with delayed presentation of symptoms after a minor injury. We present a very rare case of an infant with delayed presentation of spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) after a minor injury.To emphasize the importance of spinal evaluation with MRI in selected cases, even after minor injuries, especially in infants.SCIWORA arises mainly in infants and children during accidental trauma or after sport injury. However, it has been very rare for a 6-day-delayed infant SCIWORA after a minor injury.An infant presented with transient nausea and vomiting after falling from a baby-rocking horse of less than 30-cm height. The patient demonstrated right hemiparesis 6 days later. Plain cervical radiographs and brain and cervical spine computed tomograms (CT) were normal, but the cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a high signal in the T2-weighted image of the lower cervical cord, and a neck collar was applied.A follow-up cervical MRI 1 month later showed that the high signal of the lower cervical cord had disappeared. Another follow-up cervical MRI 12 months later also showed normal radiographic findings but there still remained mild weakness of the right lower extremities.The authors present a rare case of infant SCIWORA who developed delayed neurologic symptoms 6 days after a minor injury and suggest that spinal evaluation with MRI could be warranted in the selected case even after minor injuries, especially in infants.
