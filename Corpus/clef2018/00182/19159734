Traumatic cervical spine injuries: characteristics of missed injuries. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning has mostly replaced x-rays as an imaging modality, but concerns exist because of excess radiation, missed injuries, and whether it is the definitive procedure for intubated patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize missed cervical spine injuries (CSIs).All pediatric (<18) trauma patients from 2004 to 2006 were analyzed. Age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), mechanism, time, and missed injuries were reviewed. Flexion/extension views were used in patients with prolonged intubation. Descriptive statistics, chi(2), Student's t test, and bivariate correlation were used.There were 1307 pediatric trauma patients admitted with 318 imaged for potential CSI. Computed tomography was the sole imaging study in 200, x-rays in 64, and both in 54. Time to C-spine clearance was similar for all modalities (P > .05). For CT, 34 (10.7%) were initially positive for CSI with 7 false-positives (FPs) and no false-negative (FN). There were 18 patients with CSI identified by x-ray, with 5 FPs and 5 FNs (missed injuries). The 5 FNs missed by x-ray were all positive by CT scan and required no intervention. None of the flexion/extension views revealed an additional injury. Sex, intubated patients, ISS, age, type, and injury location were not predictive of a missed injury (P > .05).The sensitivity of CT scan was 1.0, specificity was 0.976, and the positive predictive value was 79.4%. The sensitivity of plain x-ray was 61.5%, the specificity was 1.6%, and the positive predictive value was 61.5%.Our data suggest that CT scans should be the primary modality to image a CSI. Flexion/extension views did not add to the decision making for C-spine clearance after CT evaluation.
