Intra-rater agreement of the anorectal exam and classification of injury severity in children with spinal cord injury. Intra-rater reliability study, cross-sectional design.To report on the intra-rater agreement of the anorectal examinations and classification of injury severity in children with spinal cord injury (SCI).Two, non-profit children's hospitals specializing in pediatric SCI.180 subjects had at least two trials of the anorectal examinations as defined by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the agreement. ICC>0.90=high agreement ICC between 0.75-0.89=moderate agreementWhen evaluated for the entire sample, agreement was moderate-high for anal sensation and contraction and injury classification. When evaluated as a function of age at examination and type of injury, agreement for anal sensation was poor for subjects with tetraplegia in the 12-15-year age group (ICC=0.56) and 16-21-year age group (ICC=0.70) and for subjects with paraplegia in the 6-11-year age group (ICC=0.69). Agreement for anal contraction was moderate for subjects with tetraplegia in the 16-21-year age group (ICC=0.81) and subjects with paraplegia in the 12-15-year age group (ICC=0.78) and poor for subjects with paraplegia in the 6-11-year age group (ICC=0.67). Agreement for injury classification was poor for subjects with tetraplegia in the 12-15-year group (ICC=0.56) and 16-21-year group (ICC=0.74) and paraplegia in the 6-11-year group (ICC=0.11) and 12-15-year group (ICC=0.63). Anorectal responses had high agreement in subjects with tetraplegia in the 6-11-year group and moderate to high agreement in subjects with paraplegia in the 16-21-year group.The data do not fully support the use of anorectal examination in children. Further work is warranted to establish the validity of anorectal examination.
