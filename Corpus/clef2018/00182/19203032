Strategy of the treatment for dislocation of cervical vertebra. To study the strategy of the treatment for dislocation of cervical vertebra.The clinical data of 39 cases with dislocation of cervical vertebra were analyzed. Among them,29 were male and 10 were female. The average age was 40 years old (range from 6 to 74 years old). Segment of dislocation: 15 cases in C(1,2), 1 case in C(3,4), 9 cases in C(4,5), 9 cases in C(5,6), 5 cases in C(6,7). Spinal injury according to Frankel grade, 9 cases were A grade,8 were B, 5 were C, 8 were D, 8 were E, 1 case had radicular symptom. Thirty-two cases were early and rapidly treated with traction (progressive weight). Seventeen cases were treated with operation.Traction-reduction was successful in 90% of patients. According to Frankel grade, 32 cases averagely improved 0.63 grades. Six cases of severe spinal injury accompany with interlocking of zygopophysis died.Inspecting weight of traction is important in rapid traction-reduction for dislocation of cervical vertebra. The choice of surgical treatment depends on the degree of reduction, the result of MRI,the grade of spinal trauma and the status of patients.
