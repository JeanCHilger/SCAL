Spondylocostal dysostosis associated with methylmalonic aciduria. Spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by vertebral segmentation and formation defects associated with changes of the ribs. Autosomal dominant and recessive modes of inheritance have been reported. Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is an inborn error of propionate or cobalamin metabolism. It is an autosomal recessive disorder and one of the most frequent forms of branched-chain organic acidurias. Here we report on a case of a Brazilian boy with both diseases. As we know, it is the first case in the literature with the occurrence of both SCD and MMA--the first a skeletal disease and the latter an inborn error of metabolism.
