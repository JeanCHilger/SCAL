Comparison of heart rate response to tennis activity between persons with and without spinal cord injuries: implications for a training threshold. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) to reach a training threshold during on-court sport activity. Monitors collected heart rate (HR) data every 5 s for 11 wheelchair tennis players (WCT) with low paraplegia and 11 able-bodied controls matched on experience and skill level (ABT). Average HR was determined for time spent in practice (e.g, drills) and game (i.e., a competitive set), and the ability to surpass 50% peak HR (HRpeak) and 64% HRpeak in each condition was evaluated. Average exercise intensity (%HRpeak) was not significantly different between the groups during practice (M WCT = 68.18, SD = 7.53%, M ABT = 68.78, SD = 5.44% t = .22, p = .83) or game (M WCT = 68.17, SD = .17%, M ABT = 71.55, SD = 4.75%
