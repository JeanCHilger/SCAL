Scaphoid nonunion in break-dancers: a report of 3 cases. Most injuries resulting from break-dancing are minor, such as sprains and strains, but there is great potential for dance participants to sustain severe and life-threatening conditions, such as cervical cord injuries. Break-dancing carries many of the risks of conventional dance and gymnastics, but unlike those forms of activity, it is usually performed without trained supervision, as is supplied by coaches in other sports. It is necessary for clinicians to inquire more thoroughly into the nature of the activities that result in both unusual and common injuries in break-dancers and to educate break-dancers about the hazards of these activities. The pleasure of break-dancing carries with it the responsibility of proper and thorough preparation. It is essential that break-dancers wear protective devices and perform proper warm-up and cool-down exercises. Break-dancing has become a popular youth subculture. Its complex acrobatic moves, such as splits, handstands, spins, and tumbling, have important medical implications. We report 3 cases of scaphoid nonunion in a break-dancer, the first such report in the English literature to our knowledge. Accordingly, we believe that the clinician must inquire more thoroughly into the nature of patients' activities that result in both unusual and common injuries and educate those who are break-dancers about the hazards of this activity. Careful screening, instruction, and coaching of break-dancers will help prevent injuries.
