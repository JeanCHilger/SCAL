Vertebral body hyperostosis as a presentation of Pott's disease: a report of two cases and literature review. Vertebral body tuberculosis has numerous forms of presentations. We present two patients of Pott's disease, in whom vertebral body hyperostosis was the radiological presentation. Both the patients had massive hyperostosis of vertebral bodies leading to the obliteration of the spinal canal and neurological deficits. The first case had associated lupus vulgaris, while the second patient had milliary mottling of lungs and calcified bilateral psoas muscles. Surgical decompression, followed by full-dose chemotherapy, remains the hallmark of management of this disease.
