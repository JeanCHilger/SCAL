The course of symptoms for whiplash-associated disorders in Sweden: 6-month followup study. To describe symptom patterns and the course for recovery in persons with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) over 6 months after a car collision, and to investigate associated gender differences.The study population was based on insurance claimants, 18-74 years of age, who reported WAD after a collision, between January 2004 and January 2005. At baseline and again 6 months later they were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions about presence and severity of pain and other possible WAD symptoms. It also included measurements of posttraumatic stress as well as anxiety and depression.A total of 1105 persons were studied. The most common symptoms at baseline after neck pain were reduced cervical range of motion (in 83.9% of men, 82.2% of women), headache (61.0% and 69.3%, respectively), and low back pain (35.9% and 36.1%). Some symptoms were already transient at baseline and symptoms such as neck pain, reduced cervical range of motion, headache, and low back pain decreased further over the 6 months. Baseline prevalence of depression was around 5% in both women and men, whereas posttraumatic stress and anxiety were more common in women (19.7% and 11.7%, respectively) compared to men (13.2% and 8.6%). The majority of all reported associated symptoms were mild at both baseline and followup.Our findings support that the symptom pattern of WAD and the prevalence for many of the symptoms decreased over a 6-month period.
