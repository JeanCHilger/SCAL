Gillette Gait Index in adults. Gillette Gait Index (GGI) is a very useful tool to assess gait abnormalities. However, it seems that it has only been validated in children with cerebral palsy. Nevertheless, the parameters used to compute GGI are not specific to children population. Our aim is to demonstrate that GGI could also be used to evaluate adults gait abnormalities. 44 adults (25 healthy and 19 pathological) participated to this study. Pathological subjects had a diagnosis of central nervous system pathology (6 with spinal cord injury and 13 with brain injury). We first, compared the kinematic parameter values of our healthy adult group to healthy children group in previous studies. It appears that those parameters' variability is a bit lower in adults, which makes the GGI more sensitive. Moreover, the GGI in adults is too much dependent on one parameter among the 16 proposed by Schutte et al. (2000), the "Time of Peak Flexion". Finally, the Edinburgh Visual Gait Score (EVGS) is correlated to GGI in children. To emphasize the relevance of GGI in adults, we have evaluated the correlation between EVGS and GGI in our pathological group. Those two parameters are indeed highly correlated. All these results allow us to conclude that the GGI computed with the 15 remaining parameters is a useful tool to assess gait abnormalities in adults.
