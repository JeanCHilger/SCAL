The natural history of burst fractures at the thoracolumbar junction. Conservative management of 54 patients with thoracolumbar (T12 and/or L1) burst fractures was investigated. The fractures were subdivided according to the Denis classification and a modification was suggested. Most type A and B fractures showed good results regarding reduction and neurological improvement. However, severe type B (with anterior column compression and spinal canal narrowing exceeding 50%), D, and E fractures were to a large extent complicated by intractable low back pain, neurological involvement, and signs of instability. This study suggests predictors for complications in patients with burst fractures in the thoracolumbar junction. These are (a) compression rate of the anterior column exceeding 50%, (b) narrowing of the spinal canal exceeding 50%, (c) signs of rotational malalignment in fracture level, and (d) level of the injury (L1 fractures).
