Paediatric ganglioglioma of the conus medullaris. Gangliogliomas of the conus medullaris are very rare, with only 12 patients reported so far. We report a 6-year-old male who presented with a painless numbness of the left lower limb and with bladder dysfunction. MRI revealed an intramedullary lesion at the T11-T12 vertebral levels. The tumour was subtotally removed. Histopathological examination demonstrated ganglioglioma.
