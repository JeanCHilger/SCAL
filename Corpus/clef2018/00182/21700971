MDCT of variations and anomalies of the neural arch and its processes: part 2--articular processes, transverse processes, and high cervical spine. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review the variations and anomalies of the neural arch and its processes with a focus on the articular and transverse processes. We also discuss variations and anomalies of the neural arch at the high cervical spine.Variations and anomalies of the neural arch and its processes may be identified on MDCT studies. Familiarity with their MDCT appearances is required for characterization and may help evaluate their potential clinical relevance.
