Subarachnoid-pleural and subarachnoid-mediastinal fistulae. Subarachnoid-pleural fistula and subarachnoid-mediastinal fistula are rare complications of chest trauma. One case each of subarachnoid-mediastinal fistula and subarachnoid-pleural fistula is described. Both patients were young children who suffered severe longitudinal distraction injuries to their thoracic spine and exhibited complete cord transection without radiographic evidence of vertebral column injury. Progressive mediastinal widening and enlarging pleural effusion in the absence of angiographic evidence of aortic injury suggested the diagnosis of an intrathoracic cerebrospinal fluid fistula. Myelograms identified the site of spinal cord rupture and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The diagnosis, management, and outcome of these rare fistulae are discussed.
