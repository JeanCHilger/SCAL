Can cervical spine computed tomography assist in detecting occult pneumothoraces? Screening CT often detects posttraumatic pneumothoraces that were not diagnosed on a preceding supine anteroposterior chest radiograph (occult pneumothoraces (OPTXs)). Because abdominal CT imaging misses OPTXs in the upper thorax, the objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of cervical spine (C-spine) CT screening for diagnosing OPTXs.A dual-institution (Foothills Medical Centre and Grady Memorial Hospital) retrospective review of consecutive OPTXs was performed. The accuracy of various CT screening protocols in detecting OPTXs was compared.OPTXs were detected in 75 patients. Patient demographics and injury characteristics were similar between centres (65% male 97% blunt mechanismOPTXs were evident on thoracic (and not abdominal) CT in 17% of severely injured patients. For patients who also underwent C-spine imaging, all OPTXs isolated to thoracic CT could be diagnosed by using the pulmonary windows setting of their C-spine CT imaging protocol. All OPTXs, regardless of intra-thoracic location, could also be detected by combining C-spine and abdominal CT screening.
