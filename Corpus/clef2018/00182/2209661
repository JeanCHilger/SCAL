Herniation of calcifying discopathy in childhood: report of three cases. Herniation of the calcified nucleus pulposus through the fibrous annulus is unusual in childhood. We present three cases and have surveyed 32 cases in the literature. Most herniations are located in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine. Herniation is usually symptomatic. Usually calcification decreases after some months. For most children conservative therapy with bedrest and analgesics is sufficient.
