Multi-detector row CT angiography of the neck in blunt trauma. Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is uncommon but potentially catastrophic 80% are caused by vehicle collisions. Ischemic events secondary to untreated BCVI are common, with high injury-specific mortality. This has led to implementation of screening programs based on mechanism of injury, clinical presentation, and injury patterns identified on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) imaging. The standard of reference for diagnosis is four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Given its availably in trauma service institutions, use of multidetector CT angiography has increased. This article presents the evidence and the controversies surrounding its use. Available protocols, injury description, and grading, as well as potential pitfalls are reviewed.
