25 years or more after spinal cord injury: clinical conditions of individuals in the Florence and Stockholm areas. Retrospective analysis and retrospective follow-up.Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients have today a nearly normal lifespan. Avoidance of medical complications is key to this end. The aim of the study was to analyse health in individuals surviving 25 years or more after traumatic SCI in Stockholm and Florence, and compare medical complications.Data from the databases of the Spinal Unit of Florence and from the Spinalis, Stockholm were analysed. Patients included were C2-L 2, American Spinal Cord Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) A-C, and â‰¥25 years post traumatic SCI. Patients underwent a thorough neurological and general examination, and were interviewed about medical events during those years. Analysed data include: gender, age at injury, current age, neurological level, AIS, cause of injury, presence of neuropathic pain (NP), and spasticity and medical complications.A total of 66 Italian patients and 74 Swedish patients were included. The only statistical difference between the groups was cause of injury due to falls was higher in the Florence group (P<0.01). Male/female ratio was 4:1. Traffic accidents were the most common cause of injury. In all, 60% were paraplegics. Pressure ulcers (PU) occurred in nearly 60% and 32% experienced NP. Respiratory complications (RC) occurred in 25% among tetraplegics. Neurological deterioration occurred in 14%.PU, bony fractures, spasticity and NP are important problems after SCI. RC are of clinical importance in the tetraplegics. Complications occur during all periods after injury. Many patients are otherwise healthy 25 years or more after SCI.
