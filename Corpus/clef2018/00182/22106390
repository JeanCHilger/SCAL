Disorders of the cervical spine. The cervical spine is composed of 7 vertebrae that support the head, surround and protect the spinal cord and spinal nerves in the neck, and provide attachment sites for muscles and ligaments. Although the cervical spine remains immature at birth and continues to develop during childhood, some severe congenital anomalies are discovered early in life, while other anomalies cause gradual degeneration and may not be detected until the second decade of life or later. Some of these anomalies can cause deformity, organ disease, paraplegia, or even death. This article discusses congenital development of the cervical spine, congenital spinal anomalies, cervical spine instability, and degenerative cervical spine disorders. Diagnosis, treatment options, and imaging studies also are examined.
