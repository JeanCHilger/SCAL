The influence of walking with an orthosis on bone mineral density by determination of the absolute values of the loads applied on the limb. Spinal cord injury is damage to the spinal cord that results in loss of mobility and sensation below the level of injury. Most patients use various types of orthoses to stand and walk. It has been claimed that walking and standing with orthosis reduces bone osteoporosis, improves joint range of motion and decreases muscle spasm. Unfortunately, there are discrepancies regarding the clinical effects of walking and standing on bone mineral density. The aim of this research was to find the absolute values of the loads transmitted by body and orthosis in walking with use of an orthosis. 5 normal subjects were recruited to stand and walk with a new design of reciprocal gait orthosis. The loads transmitted through the orthosis and anatomy was measured by use of strain gauge and motion analysis systems. It has been shown that the loads applied on the anatomy were significantly more than that transmitted through the orthosis. Moreover, the patterns of the forces and moments of the orthosis and body completely differed from each other. As the most part of the loads applied on the complex transmitted by anatomy in walking with an orthosis, walking with orthosis can influence bone mineral density.
