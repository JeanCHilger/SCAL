Comparative analysis of assessment of the craniocervical equilibrium through two methods: cephalometry of Rocabado and cervical range of motion. There are several instruments of evaluation of the craniocervical equilibrium the most reliable are the radiographies. This study used the cephalometric analysis of Rocabado to measure the sensibility and specificity of the Cervical Range of Motion (CROM), a goniometer designed to assess cervical movements in degrees, and measure the forward head position in centimeters. This instrument frequently used, has been tested as a reliable instrument to evaluate the cervical movements but not the forward head. The sample consisted of 30 volunteers, 18 females, 12 males, mean age of 24.63 years. All participants were evaluated with CROM and radiographies in the resting head position and in erect head position. The values considered by the cephalometry consisted in the angle made between the McGregor plane and the vertical line formed by the base of the odontoid process to its apex30% of the subjects had forward head posture, according to de cephalometry of Rocabado (decreased space between C0-C1, C1-C2) and 43,3% according to CROM. 16,6% had decreased posterior-inferior angle, and 13% had the hyoid triangle facing up. ROC curve of identifying forward head posture yielded area under the curve of 0,778 (95% confidence interval 0,596-0,960). The sensibility of CROM was: 77%. The specificity 71%.This study suggests that CROM has a moderate sensibility and specificity, useful for clinic use, but not for research.
