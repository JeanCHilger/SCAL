Bilateral fractures of transverse processus: a diagnostic sign of overrun? Injuries caused by traffic accidents can be complex and extensive. Due to the highly dynamic course of actions, reconstructive questions may be challenging to investigators. Differentiation of a single collision from an overrun is a central question. We hypothesized that the existence of spine fractures such as spinous and transverse processus fractures may be helpful to distinguish both. The postmortem CT-data of pedestrian fatalities were analyzed in a retrospective manner. A group finally assessed as being overrun (n=13 7 m, 6 f, 18-86 y, mean 65 y) and a control group being hit but not overrun (n=11
