Impaired bone health and asymptomatic vertebral compressions in fracture-prone children: a case-control study. Frequent fractures in children may be a sign of impaired bone health, but it remains unestablished when and how fracture-prone children should be assessed. This prospective study elucidated skeletal characteristics and predisposing factors in children with recurrent fractures. Findings were used to establish guidelines for screening. During a 12-month period we recorded fracture history for all children (n = 1412) treated for an acute fracture at a large university hospital. All apparently healthy children over 4 years of age, who had sustained: (1) at least one vertebral fracture (2) two long-bone fractures before age 10 years
