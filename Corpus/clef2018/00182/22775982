Using virtual reality driving simulators in persons with spinal cord injury: three screen display versus head mounted display. Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new technology that is currently utilized in a wide variety of settings to test and train individuals in specialized skills. This study examines methods for improving driver retraining protocols for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).We compared a VR driving simulator, under two different display conditions, a head mounted display (HMD) and a three screen display (TSD) to identify the best method for retraining driving skills following SCI.Although there was minimal evidence for driving performance difficulties in the HMD condition relative to the TSD condition (e.g. greater number of times for being off course and longer stopping latencies for the HMD condition), rates of simulator sickness did not differ between display conditions.Taken together, findings suggest that both the HMD and the TSD are reasonable simulator options for driver retraining in SCI.
