Congenital rubella syndrome associated with calcific epiphyseal stippling and peroxisomal dysfunction. An infant girl had the clinical and immunologic findings of congenital rubella syndrome but also had arthrogryposis multiplex and calcific epiphyseal stippling. Spastic quadriparesis developed, and both physical and behavioral development were slow. Increased spasticity of the legs at 5 1/2 years was related not to progressive rubella encephalomyelopathy but to spinal cord compression by abnormal cartilaginous tissue. The presence of a peroxisomal disorder was demonstrated by a greatly increased level of phytanic acid and slightly increased levels of hexacosanoate in serum and by reduced activity of peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase and a slightly increased ratio of cytosolic to peroxisomal catalase activity in cultured fibroblasts. A reduction in the number and size of peroxisomes was demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts, and a needle biopsy specimen of the liver also showed the peroxisomes to have a smaller diameter than usual. We recommend that any child with epiphyseal stippling be assessed for peroxisomal disease and that the potential for spinal cord compression by dysplastic bone or cartilage be recognized. The association of peroxisomal dysfunction with congenital rubella has not been described previously. The interaction between rubella virus infection and peroxisomal function may need further investigation.
