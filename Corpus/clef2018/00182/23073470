Database of movement control in the cervical spine. Reference normal of 182 asymptomatic persons. In this study, the first normative database of movement control in the cervical spine has been established. For this purpose the Fly Test was used, which is a reliable and valid clinical test capable of detecting deficient movement control of the cervical spine in patients with neck pain and its associated disorders. One hundred and eighty-two asymptomatic persons, eighty-three men and ninety-nine women, aged 16-74 years, divided into six age groups, were recruited. The Fly Test, using a 3-space Fastrak device, recorded the accuracy of cervical spine movements when tracking three incrementally difficult movement patterns. Amplitude accuracy (AA), directional accuracy (DA), and jerk index (JI) were compared across patterns and age groups. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant effect for age (p < 0.001) but not gender (p > 0.05). Lower accuracy for AA and DA in all three movement patterns was observed in the groups of subjects aged 55-64 and 65-74 years, and also for JI in the easy and medium patterns. Knowledge of normative values for the Fly Test is important and useful in identifying impaired movement control and monitoring the effectiveness of treatment interventions in patients with neck pain of traumatic and non-traumatic origin.
