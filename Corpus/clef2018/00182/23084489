Congenital high scapula (Sprengel's deformity): four cases. We report a series of four cases of congenital high scapula (or Sprengel's deformity) diagnosed and followed in our establishment. The main feature of this very rare congenital malformation of the pectoral girdle is an abnormally high, more or less dysmorphic scapula. A congenitally high scapula is often discovered in young children, when consequences for aesthetics, and sometimes functional difficulties, are brought to light. When surgical treatment is envisaged, imaging is recommended to diagnose a supernumerary structure, ossified (an omovertebral bone) or not (a fibrous and/or cartilaginous connection), extending from the scapula to the cervical spine. This needs to be resected. A CT scan is essential for detecting an omovertebral bone and the vertebral bone abnormalities that are often associated with it. MRI and ultrasound are very useful for assessing any fibrous and/or cartilaginous components. An ultrasound examination has the undeniable advantage of being quick and easy in these young children.
