Cochlear implant patients underwent successful MRI examination after local bandaging: a case report. A female patient, now 6 years old, received cochlear implant in the right ear at the age of 2 (February, 2006). In August 16, 2010, a cervical spine MRI examination was required due to the cervical spine injury in order to confirm the diagnosis. Considering the cochlea coil may interfere with the MRI examination results, a local bandaging around the ear was given to isolate cochlear magnetic field. The results of cervical spine MRI examinations showed no obvious disturbance, which suggests that we could further explore this method clinically.
