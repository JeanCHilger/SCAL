Magnetic resonance imaging of spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality. A 3-year-old girl with spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) is reported. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an abnormal intensity of the spinal cord at the level of C7 to Th1 in the acute stage and severe atrophic change in the chronic stage. This is the first report of SCIWORA with positive diagnostic imaging. The mechanism of SCIWORA is discussed based on the positive MRI findings.
