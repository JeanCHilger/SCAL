Distractive flexion injuries of the subaxial cervical spine treated with a posterior procedure using cervical pedicle screws or a combined anterior and posterior procedure. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with distractive flexion (DF) injuries of the subaxial cervical spine who had undergone a posterior procedure using cervical pedicle screw (CPS) fixation with those who had undergone a combined anterior and posterior procedure. Recommendations for the surgical treatment of DF injuries of the subaxial cervical spine remain controversial. There are few clinical reports of posterior CPS fixation for DF injuries. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and radiographs of 50 consecutive patients with DF injuries of the subaxial cervical spine treated at the Imakiire General Hospital. Group 1 consisted of 24 patients who underwent posterior wiring fixation and fusion with additional anterior decompression and fusion. Group 2 consisted of 26 patients who underwent posterior decompression and fusion with CPS fixation. Group 1 had a significantly longer operation time (295.4 minutes) than Group 2 (163.3 minutes). Group 1 had significantly higher blood loss (689.1g) than Group 2 (313.7 g). No patient in Group 1 or 2 developed postoperative neurological worsening. The mean loss of kyphotic correction was 1.6° and 0.1° in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, and the loss of kyphotic correction in Group 2 was significantly less than that of Group 1. We suggest that posterior procedures with CPS fixation are reasonable for the management of cervical DF injuries.
