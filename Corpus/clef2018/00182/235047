Injuries of the cervical spine. In connection with 44 patients, who suffered injuries of the cervical spine, the types of the fracture and dislocation of the cervical spine are discussed. The injuries of the cervical spine--with or without injury of the spinal marrow--signify hard tast in respect of therapy. The conservative (extension) treatment of surgical intervention are even nowadays much debated themes in the neurosurgery. The introduction of Crutchfield tongs was a definite advance in the latter years. With this treatment method the restitution of the form, continuity and stability of the cervical spine is possible. In the opinion of the authors, surgical intervention (laminectomy) is necessary only in the case of progressive symptoms of compression of the cervival marrow (liquorstop). The survival of the patients depends often on the quick and proper treatment. The prevention of complications and the quick elimination are of great importance. Safeguarding of the physical and psychical conditions of the patients is the essential requirement of their rehabilitation after injuries of the cervical spine.
