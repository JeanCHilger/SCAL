Management of animal and human bites in the head and neck. Management of bites requires both local wound and systemic considerations. The authors will highlight their experience in 32 cases. Interestingly in this series, human bites were more common than animal bites. The bacteriology, antimicrobial therapy, and surgical treatment of human and animal bites will be reviewed. A management protocol that we use is based on whether the bite was inflicted by a human, dog, or other animal. The discussion will include cases demonstrating immediate and delayed reconstruction. Long-term follow-up was possible for a number of these patients.
