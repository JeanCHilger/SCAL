Percutaneous interbody osteosynthesis in the treatment of thoracolumbar traumatic or tumoural lesions. A review of 51 cases. The authors describe a technique of percutaneous interbody osteosynthesis applicable to the dorsal and lumbar spine. 51 patients were so treated for different aetiologies: traumatic conditions (35 cases) and tumoural lesions (16 cases). The material used consisted of special instruments that are positioned in double obliquity by a percutaneous posterolateral approach. A posterior approach limited to the pathological focus was used jointly whenever a graft or a decompression was necessary (19 cases). Several types of anaesthesia were used (local, local-regional, general, neuroleptanalgesia). The patients benefited by the advantages that usually accompany percutaneous techniques. The advantages and limitations of the method are discussed.
