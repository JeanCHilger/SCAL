Cervical column posture and airway dimensions in clinical bruxist adults: a preliminary study. The aim of this study was to compare the cervical column posture and the upper airway dimensions between sleep bruxist and non-bruxist young adults. Twenty-three sleep-grinders and 22 asymptomatic subjects, selected according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria (report by a sleep partner and the presence of dental wear, according to Wetselaar et al.), were evaluated. The mean age was 23·8 years (range 18-30). All the subjects had complete permanent dentition and skeletal and occlusal class I. A digital cephalometric radiograph with natural head posture was performed for each subject. The craniocervical posture was traced and evaluated according to Solow and Tallgren, and the airway dimensions of the oropharynx and nasopharynx were evaluated in agreement with Sayinsu. The data were analysed with independent-samples t-tests and Mann-Whitney U-test. Significance was set at P < 0·05. Sleep bruxist young adults presented more forwarded cervical column posture and narrower measures of the oropharynx, when compared with controls (P < 0·05). As in children, anterior cervical column posture was found to be associated with sleep bruxism.
