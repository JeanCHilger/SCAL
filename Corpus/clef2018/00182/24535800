Extradural spinal arachnoid cyst occurring in a child: a case report. Extradural archnoid spinal cysts are rare lesions. Their localization is usually the thoracic spine. Clinically, they are a cause of spinal cord and/ or nerve roots compression. The diagnosis is made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pathophysiology is not well known and seems to be different from intradural lesions. The best treatment is surgery. We report the case of a 5-year-old girl with spinal cord compression symptoms who was treated by open surgery. We performed dural defect repair. The outcome was good in the immediate post operative period without complication and total recovery.
