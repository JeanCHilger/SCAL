Delayed diagnosis of neurological bladder following spinal cord injury without radiological abnormality. Spinal cord injuries are a well-known cause of neurological bladder and a well-known complication of high-velocity trauma. They can, however, be difficult to diagnose in young children, in whom the absence of initial neurological symptoms and normality of the radiological workup can be falsely reassuring. Management of associated injuries can further delay diagnosis. We present 2 cases of spinal cord injuries without radiological abnormality revealed by delayed bladder retention.
