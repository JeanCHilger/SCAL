A cone beam CT investigation of ponticulus posticus and lateralis in children and adolescents. To determine the prevalence and pathogenesis of ponticulus posticus (PP) and ponticulus lateralis (PL) in children and adolescents.Cone beam CT scans of 576 patients were examined for PP and PL. The patients were divided into three age groups: 10 years and younger, 11-13 years and 14 years and older. Ponticulus formation was categorized as absent, partial or complete. Gender, race and location (right, left or bilateral) were recorded. Data were analysed with the χ(2) test, with significance at p < 0.050. Institutional review board approval was granted.Overall prevalence of PP was 26.2%, with complete lesions in 10.4%. The frequency of PP was greater in patients aged 14 years and older (p ≤ 0.038). The occurrence of complete PP was greater in patients aged 11 years and older (p = 0.028). Lesions were more common in males (p = 0.014) and in blacks compared with other non-white races (p = 0.035). Bilateral PP was more common than right-sided lesions (p = 0.008) and more frequent in the oldest cohort (p = 0.006). Overall prevalence of PL was 6.1% (3.0% complete), with no differences between age groups, genders, races or by location.PP is not uncommon even in the first decade and increases in frequency, completeness of calcification and numbers in mid-adolescence. It appears to be more common in males and in blacks. PP may be a congenital osseous anomaly of the atlas that mineralizes at various times. PL is less frequent with no demographic predilections.
