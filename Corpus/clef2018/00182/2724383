Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality in children--the SCIWORA syndrome. Spinal cord injury in children frequently occurs without fracture or dislocation. The clinical profiles of 55 children with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormalities (SCIWORA) are reported in detail to illustrate features of this syndrome. No patient had vertebral fracture or dislocation on plain films and tomographies. There were ten upper cervical (C1-C4), 33 lower cervical (C5-C8), and 12 thoracic cord injuries of these, 22 were complete or severe lesions and 33 were mild lesions. The mechanism of the neural injury probably relates to the inherent elasticity of the juvenile spine, which permits self-reducing but significant intersegmental displacements when subjected to flexion, extension, and distraction forces. The spinal cord is therefore vulnerable to injury even though the vertebral column is spared from disruption, and this vulnerability is most evident in children younger than 8 years. All but one of the 22 children with profound neurologic injuries were younger than 8 years (p less than 0.000001), whereas 24 of 33 children with mild injuries were older. Younger children were also more likely to have severe upper cervical lesions (p less than 0.05)
