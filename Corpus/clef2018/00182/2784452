Hereditary multiple exostoses and cervical cord compression: CT and MR studies. Hereditary multiple exostoses usually involve the long bones, but occasionally the spine. When the spine is involved, serious neurologic deficits may occur. We report a case of a 12-year-old girl with an exostosis in the cervical spine (C5), which caused a spastic quadriplegia.
