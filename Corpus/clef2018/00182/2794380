Rigid spine syndrome and rigid spine sign in myopathies. We studied eight patients with rigid spine syndrome aged 8 to 20 years at the time of first examination. Muscle weakness, rigid spine, and flexion contracture of elbows and ankles were noted in the first 6 years of age. Radiological study of the cervical spine revealed considerable reduction not only of flexion, but also of extension, of the neck. The "alligator sign" was demonstrated. Progression of scoliosis and of contractures reduced the functional capacity in six patients. A restrictive ventilatory syndrome was observed in all, while central apneas with oxygen desaturation were shown in two. Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in four. We suggest that a distinction should be made between myopathic rigid spine and rigid spine syndrome. Myopathic rigid spine is a clinical sign which is rarely sought but is present in several types of well-defined myopathies, meaning the myopathic involvement of the extensor muscles of the spine. Rigid spine syndrome is an axial myopathy with peculiar clinical and radiographic signs and a characteristic natural history.
