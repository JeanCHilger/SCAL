Spinal neurofibromas: a report of 66 cases and a comparison with meningiomas. A series of 66 spinal cord neurofibromas was analyzed for history, signs, surgical approach, and outcome. The tumors presented primarily with sensory symptoms. Plain films were abnormal in 1/2 of cases and 1/2 had a complete block. They were primarily intradural, and primarily thoracic. A conservative exam system was used for follow-up and 85% with pain had complete relief 50% with motor loss had normal motor function, and 88% had normal sensation who had prior sensory loss. In comparison to meningiomas, the principal differences were that neurofibromas had an even sex distribution, a lower incidence of cord signs and symptoms, more frequent findings on plain x-rays, and higher cerebrospinal fluid protein. Surgical outcome was similar. Sacrifice of the involved root during removal usually did not produce a deficit. The series is compared with a similar series of meningiomas from the same institution over the same time period.
