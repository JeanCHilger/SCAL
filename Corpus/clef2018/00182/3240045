Neonatal spinal cord injuries and magnetic resonance imaging. Two cases of spinal cord injury involving the lower cervical region are reported. In both, the delivery of a breech presentation was difficult. Severe hypotonia, areflexia and autonomic nervous system disturbances suggested a spinal cord injury. The evidence, type, and location of the cord lesion were given by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
