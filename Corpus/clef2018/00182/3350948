Spinal cord injury without osseous spine fracture. Sixteen patients with spinal cord injury without osseous spine fracture and 55 patients with spinal cord injury with osseous spine fracture aged from birth through 18 years were studied. Those without osseous fracture were younger (mean age 6 years) than were those with osseous fracture (mean age 16 years). Extravasation of myelographic dye from the spinal canal was a poor prognostic sign. All three in the group with this finding without osseous fracture had complete spinal cord lesions. Those without osseous fracture should be followed for the development of late spinal deformity that may require orthotic support or surgical stabilization.
