Anatomo-clinical aspects of traumatic spinal cord lesions. A comprehensive clinical (150 patients), pathological (6 autopsied spinal cords) and experimental (17 animals) investigation of the spinal cord posttraumatic affections was conducted. The afferent and efferent spinal nerve fibers degeneration was compared and its spatial distribution assessed. Transsynaptic and immediate connections between spinal structures and cranial nerve nuclei are shown to be the major determinants of the intercentral integration and CNS plasticity.
