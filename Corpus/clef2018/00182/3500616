The role of MR imaging in evaluating metastatic spinal disease. Fifty-eight patients with suspected epidural metastases were evaluated with MR imaging. Six patients were examined on two separate occasions. MR was judged to be diagnostic in 60 of the 64 examinations. Twenty-two patients also underwent myelography. MR was as diagnostic as myelography in all cases of epidural metastases. In addition, MR offered several advantages over myelography in the evaluation of metastatic spinal disease, including demonstration of paravertebral tumor extension, identification of additional osseous metastatic lesions, and visualization of areas of spinal cord compression occurring between areas of myelographic blocks. We conclude that MR imaging is the examination of choice for evaluating suspected metastatic spinal disease.
