Not-always-apparent abuse: the shaken baby syndrome. The authors report 3 cases of infants presenting with cerebral lesions related to violent head shaking. They emphasize the diagnostic difficulties when the classical signs of the battered child (marks of blows, fractures) are lacking. The traumatism is rarely recognized: only the negativity of the usual medical causes of subdural hematoma, meningeal or retinal hemorrhage and a peculiar familial history lead to the possible diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. The value of skull CT-scan is major, showing intracranial lesions which could not be found before. Because of the observed lesions, evolution is often severe.
