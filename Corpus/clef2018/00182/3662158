A radiographic comparison of prehospital cervical immobilization methods. Three methods of prehospital cervical immobilization were studied radiographically and compared to the short board technique (SBT). The methods were California Stif-Neck Immobilizing Collar (CSC), Kendrick Extrication Device (KED), and Extrication Plus-One (XP-One). Forty-five volunteers were immobilized in the short board (SB) and one of the test devices studied. Cervical movement in the sagittal and frontal planes was measured radiographically. Movement in the horizontal plane was measured directly. Two-tailed, paired t test analysis was performed comparing test devices to the SBT. The SBT proved to be significantly better (P less than .05) in the following comparisons: the CSC in extension and lateral bending the KED in lateral bending
