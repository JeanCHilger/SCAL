Legal aspects of emergency treatment of the neurologically injured patient. Brain and spinal cord injuries are medicolegally hazardous for the emergency department staff and prehospital emergency care personnel to handle.

They may develop immediately after the injury, or they may develop at an unpredictable time minutes to hours thereafter.
