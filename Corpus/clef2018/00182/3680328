Anterolateral decompression for neural involvement in thoracolumbar fractures. A review of 78 cases. Of a total of 905 patients with fracture or fracture-dislocation of the thoracolumbar spine admitted from 1969 to 1982, a neurological deficit was present in 334 (37%). All unstable injuries were initially treated by reduction and posterior fusion. In 79 of these patients, an anterolateral decompression was undertaken later because of persistent neurological deficit and radiographic demonstration of encroachment on the spinal canal. One patient died of pulmonary embolism 78 were reviewed after a mean period of four years. Of these 78 patients 18 made a complete neurological recovery while 53 appeared to have benefited from the procedure
