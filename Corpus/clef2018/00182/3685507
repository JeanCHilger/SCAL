High resolution surface coil magnetic resonance imaging of the spine: normal and pathologic anatomy. In a brief two year period, magnetic resonance imaging of the spine has developed from a single slice, low signal/noise ratio, extremely time consuming technique to a multiplanar, high resolution examination that can be performed in a time frame similar to that of CT imaging. MR has already assumed a primary imaging role in myelopathic states. It is premature to evaluate its place vis-a-vis CT and myelography in many other disease states of the spine, but clearly, MR is assuming an ever expanding role. As technical improvements continue, it is perhaps realistic to predict that magnetic resonance will, in the near future, assume a dominant role in the imaging of the spine for the demonstration of most types of spinal disease.
