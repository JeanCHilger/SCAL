Functional recovery after decompressive operation for thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. A series of 105 operative cases of thoracic and lumbar spine trauma is presented. All patients underwent an anterior decompression and fusion via the lateral extracavity approach with or without an accompanying posterior internal stabilization procedure (modified Weiss springs or Harrington distraction rods). All patients were allowed to plateau neurologically before reconstructive spine surgery was performed. The patient's neurological grade at the time of surgery and after recovery was assessed according to a seven-grade scale presented herein. None of the 34 patients with a motor and sensory complete myelopathy recovered any function below the level in injury. Of the 10 motor-complete patients with some sensory perception, 4 improved neurologically however, only 1 of these improved to a state of limited ambulation. The rest remained nonambulatory. Of the 33 patients with significantly disabling incomplete motor and sensory myelopathies, 17 improved to a level of minimal neurological deficit
