0.6 T MR imaging of the cervical spine: multislice and multiecho techniques. During a 6 month period, 50 patients with signs and symptoms referable to the cervical spine were studied with a 0.6 T superconducting magnetic resonance (MR) imaging unit. The last 23 of these 50 patients were studied with combined multislice and multiecho techniques. In 38 of the 50 patients, abnormalities were demonstrated on MR images. Intramedullary lesions included syringomyelia (three cases), primary tumors (two), metastatic neoplasm (one), cord atrophy secondary to trauma (one), and multiple sclerosis (one). Intradural, extramedullary lesions included two neurofibromas and two Chiari malformations. The rest of the lesions were extradural: degenerative changes (10), spinal stenosis with cord compression (five), disk degeneration and/or herniation (five), postoperative changes (four), metastases to bone/epidural disease (three), and neurofibromatosis (one). Two patients had more than one abnormality. The MR findings were compared with available routine radiographs, computed tomographic (CT) scans with and without metrizamide, and myelograms. MR imaging was consistently better than routine CT scanning in the detection of lesions of the spinal cord and in directly imaging the effects on the spinal cord of extrinsic abnormalities such as spinal stenosis. Metrizamide-enhanced CT scanning detected all cases of syringomyelia, but it involved an invasive procedure. Myelography alone was slightly less sensitive and considerably less specific than MR in detecting intramedullary lesions and in distinguishing cord neoplasms from syringomyelia. Multislice, multiecho techniques with up to 240 msec echo times (TEs) were particularly helpful in the detection and characterization of extradural processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
