Radiological aspects of the vertebral components of osteochondrodysplasias. Analysis of the individual components of the vertebrae permits the radiologist to identify and understand the fundamental physio-pathologic growth mechanisms affecting shape, size and architecture which operated during development. The achievement of this goal is facilitated by systematically paying attention to changes of the vertebral end-plates, anterior and posterior aspects of the vertebral body, the vertebral rim, neurocentral junction and interpedicular distance. The dynamic changes noted in follow-up studies of the spine in certain dysplasias may reveal the developmental history of the vertebral complex. The dimension of time is an important factor, which the radiologist has a unique opportunity to exploit. Vertebral configuration permits radiological analysis and diagnosis.
