Neonatal spinal cord injury. In this review of the prognosis of patients having neonatal spinal cord injury, findings in 3 patients and 11 case histories from the literature are evaluated as to obstetric complications, clinical and pathologic examinations, and follow-up data from 2 to 12 years, or until death of the child. Eight of the 14 patients died: 4 at less than 3 months of age, 3 between 3 months and 1 year of age, and 1 at 3 1/2 years of age. Six children survived for more than 2 years for follow-up examination. Survival is dependent on the level of the lesion, with cervical lesions being almost incompatible with life. The quality of survival for those with levels of C8-T1 and below depends on the child's multiple medical complications.
