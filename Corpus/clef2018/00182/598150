Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine. Four cases of cervical osteoid osteoma occurred predominantly in the adolescent age group with either pain, pain with scoliosis, or radicular pain usually without neurological signs. The initial X-rays did not demonstrate the lesions but a high index of suspicion led to additional roentgenographic as well as tomography examinations and eventually an accurate diagnosis. The lesions were located in the posterior elements in all 4 cases. Treatment consisted of excision in 3 cases and excision and fusion in one case and resulted in cure with no recurrence.
