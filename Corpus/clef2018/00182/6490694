Postoperative neurological deficits in segmental spinal instrumentation. A study using spinal cord monitoring. We retrospectively analyzed the postoperative neurological complications in 137 patients who underwent a posterior spine fusion for scoliosis and had concomitant somatosensory cortical evoked-potential spinal-cord monitoring. The patients were divided into three specific operative groups: group 1, forty-nine patients who had a Harrington rod with segmental wiring (segmental spinal instrumentation) group 2, twenty patients who had Luque segmental spinal instrumentation
