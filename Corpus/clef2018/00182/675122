Value of myeloscintigraphy in the detection of intraspinal compressions. The authors report their experience of myeloscintigraphy summarizing the 120 examinations made during the years 1975 and 1976, in the department of rheumatology of the regional hospital centre of Clermont-Ferrand. The technique uses serum labelled with technetium 99 introduced by the lumbar route. Schematically 3 pathological patterns can be determined : complet block, segmental block, and partial block. The examination is particularly reliable at the dorsal and high lumbar levels, where only one "false negative" was found, and even that debatable. In this situation it has a valuable role in regard to both the presence and the level of a compression. In the cervical and low lumbar levels, its reliability seems definitely inferior, especially in the case of lateral disc herniations. Tolerance has always been excellent whatever the age of the patient. We have thus an investigation that is simple and well tolerated, and its valuable role in the early detection of myelo-radicular compressions should assure it a place of choice alongside other methods of paraclinical investigation of the spinal canal.
