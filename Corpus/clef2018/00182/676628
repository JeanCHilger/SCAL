Hemodynamic changes during the orthostatic test in patients with spinal cord damage at different levels. Hemodynamics were studied during orthostatic load on a special orthotable in 54 patients with different levels of spinal cord interruption. With the patient in a horizontal and then in a vertical position, the arterial pressure, pulse, volume rate of blood flow in the forearm, and the cardiac output were recorded every minute. The total resistance of the vessels was calculated. Absence of constrictor reactions in the lower half of the trunk was revealed in patients with a high level of spinal cord damage, due to whicorthostatic collapse developed within the first minutes after they had been placed in a vertical posture. The orthostatic stability of such patients may be somewhat improved by producing additional external pressure to the lower part of the trunk (with special suits) and by means of other forms of special training. Patients with the spinal cord damaged at a low level (below the sixth thoracic vertebra) tolerate a 10-minute orthostatic load quite satisfactorily.
