Paraplegia in osteogenesis imperfecta. A case report. Paraplegia occurred in an adolescent girl with osteogenesis imperfecta after chiropractic manipulation. The child had been able to walk freely out of doors. Complete motor paralysis with sensory sparing resulted due to anterior compression of the cord by spondyloptotic cervical vertebrae. Reconstructed computerised tomography was very helpful in demonstrating the abnormality. Anterior and then posterior decompression relieved the tethered spinal cord and were supplemented with bone grafting. Early diagnosis and surgical treatment will prevent similar neurological accidents.
