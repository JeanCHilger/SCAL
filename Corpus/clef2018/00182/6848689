Jefferson fractures in children. Case report. Jefferson fractures in children are exceedingly rare. A case in a 2-year-old is reported, and the other only case in the literature is reprinted. The mechanism of fracture is probably separation of the lateral masses by a force transmitted from the vertex. Because these fractures are not usually associated with neurological deficits, and because of the poor detail obtained with conventional radiography in a child, these fractures may be overlooked. Computerized tomography provides superb definition of this lesion. The preferred mode of treatment is immobilization.
