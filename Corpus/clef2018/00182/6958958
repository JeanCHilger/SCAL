Metastatic epidural tumors in children. Spinal cord compression is a rare but serious complication of malignant diseases in children. Epidural cord compression was noted in 81 patients within the past 17 years at this center. The complication developed at different times during the course of the primary disease. For 29 of our patients, cord dysfunction was one of the initial signs of cancer--Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin disease, and malignant lymphoma. By contrast, for most of the patients with osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, it appeared later in their clinical course. The treatment outcome of patients who were paraplegia with complete loss of sensory function for greater than or equal to 48 hours was poor. Only four of 22 in this group became ambulatory. Ten patients with osteosarcoma did not undergo laminectomies because they all had multiple metastases and terminal disease. Paraplegia developed in all ten. There was no difference in ambulatory rates among other patients, with or without laminectomies.
