Management of odontoid fractures. Fifty-one adults with odontoid fractures were treated between 1966 and 1979. Approximately 50% had additional trauma over half of the patients were younger than 40 years old. Three patients presented with myelopathy: 1 was complete at C-2 and the others recovered. Cervical roentgenograms were initially considered normal in 4 patients. The fracture was through the base of the odontoid process (Type 2) in 49 patients and was into the body of C-2 (Type 3) in 2 patients. Thirty-four patients underwent early posterior cervical fusion, whereas the others were treated initially with external immobilization. Only the 2 patients with Type 3 fractures healed in Minerva casts. All 15 Type 2 fractures initially treated conservatively failed to heal and were fused. There were no age, sex, or radiological characteristics (other than fracture location) peculiar to the nonunion group. Two patients died after operation, and there was 1 minor infection in an iliac crest donor site. All patients who were operated upon demonstrated evidence of fusion within 6 weeks after operation
