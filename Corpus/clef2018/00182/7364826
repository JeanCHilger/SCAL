The cervical spine after halo-pelvic traction. An analysis of the complications of 83 patients. This retrospective study assesses the complications affecting the cervical spine after halo-pelvic traction in 83 patients who were followed up for a minimum of five years. Forty-four patients (53 per cent) had significant cervical complications such as radiological degenerative changes, avascular necrosis of the dens, loss of movement, pain or spontaneous fusion. The most important predisposing factors were a long period in the halo-pelvic apparatus, tuberculous kyphosis, stiffness of the spinal deformity and an age of 15 years or more at the time of application.
