The tracheal intubation of children suffering from congenital cranio-facial anomalies. Pre-operative anticipation of its technical problems (author's transl). In order to anticipate the technical problems of the tracheal intubation of children suffering from congenital cranio-facial anomalies, the authors suggest, in addition to the routine examination of the nasal and buccal cavities, different clinical and radiological measurements such as mandible angle, maxillo-pharyngeal angle and the mouth opening. These parameters explore the extent of the mandibular asymmetry and hypoplasia, the limits of the mouth opening and the cervical spine extension. Three data are reported, showing the interest of the scheme of examination proposed.
