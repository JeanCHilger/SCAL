Osteochondroma with spinal cord compression: report of three cases. Multiple osteochondromatosis is the most common of the bone dysplasias, but neurological complications are rare. Osteochondromas of the spine usually arise from the neural arch. Tomography and myelography are useful in determining the site of origin and the relationship to the spinal cord. The tumor is benign, and surgical removal produces an excellent clinical result. Three cases are described illustrating the clinical and radiological manifestations of these tumors.
