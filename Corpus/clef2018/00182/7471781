Ct in spinal trauma. The radiological evaluation of patients with acute spinal trauma has always been a challenging problem. Multiple radiological procedures are often necessary for complete evaluation of the extent of spinal injury. CT provides an ideal modality whereby accurate assessment of displacement of bony fragments as well as associated spinal cord and nerve root injury can easily be performed, eliminating the need for difficult radiological procedures.
