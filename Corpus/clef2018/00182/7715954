A study of the factors affecting the outcome of vertebromedullary injuries. Between 1982 and 1991, 194 patients were treated for cervical vertebromedullary injuries in the Department of Neurosurgery, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty of the University of Istanbul. The data were evaluated with the multiple regression method using the SPSS/PC statistical package to predict the factors influencing the outcome. In the initial neurological examination, motor deficit was detected in 63.4% of the patients, sensorial deficit was seen in 53.6% of the patients and respiratory failure in 12.9%. Of these patients 46.4% were treated surgically and 53.6% medically. Evaluating the findings and outcomes with the Frankel scale, no change in neurological status was detected in 44.8% of the patients. Improvement was detected in 36.1% and deterioration in 19.1%, the mortality rate being 18.6%. It is concluded that the main factor predicting the outcome of patients with vertebromedullary injury is the initial neurological status (P < 0.0001).
