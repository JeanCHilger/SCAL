Neuro-aggressive dorsal vertebral hemangioma and vertebrectomy. Apropos of 2 cases. Review of the literature. Vertebral hemangioma is a benign and relatively frequent lesion. It is rarely associated with medullary compression. Two cases of vertebral hemangioma with progressive neurologic deficit are presented.Successful treatment was accomplished using pre-operative embolization and vertebrectomy. The tumor was resected by an antero-lateral transthoracic and posterior approach.The technique of operative management and complications are discussed. Based on these two patients and a review of the literature, the authors recommend that management of patients with progressive neurological deficit should include pre-operative angiography and embolization, decompressive surgery with the approach determined by the degree of vertebral involvement and site of spinal compression.
