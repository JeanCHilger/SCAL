Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality in children. Seven children aged birth to 17 years with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 3 hours and 16 days after the injury. There were six cervical cord injuries and one thoracic cord injury. The MRI findings were divided into two groups: extraneural and neural. The extraneural findings included one case of anterior longitudinal ligament disruption and anterior C6-C7 disc herniation associated with hyperextension one case of posterior longitudinal ligament disruption and C2-C3 disc herniation associated with lateral flexion
