Evaluating low-speed rear-end impact severity and resultant occupant stress parameters. Automotive Systems Analysis, Inc. (ASA) and Lowell Hicks, Inc. (LHI) have developed a ground-up set of sensor instrumentation and recording method to document vehicle-artifact/occupant-stress parameters occurring from a continuing series of low-speed rear-end multi-vehicle impact tests (approximately 2 to 8 MPH). This work has four goal areas: 1) calculate impacted vehicle (TARGET) barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) from isolator Artifacts 2) correlate calculated BEV' to occupant stress
