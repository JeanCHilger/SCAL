A comparison of cervical rotation in age-matched adolescent competitive swimmers and healthy males. Physical therapists routinely compare range of motion measurements with the opposite side and/or with a standard for "normal" range. However, "normal" range may vary in relation to the individual's occupational and recreational movement patterns. The purposes of this study were 1) to compare the range of active physiological cervical rotation in 14- to 17-year-old male competitive swimmers (N = 40) and controls (N = 40) and 2) to investigate the relationship between the freestyle stroke breathing pattern and differences in right and left cervical rotation in swimmers. Analysis of variance determined if a group difference existed in goniometric measurement of cervical rotation. The experimental group demonstrated a significantly greater mean range of total active cervical rotation right (p = 0.002) than the control group. Swimmers also demonstrated a significantly greater (p = 0.0002) range of rotation on their breathing side (mean difference of 5 degrees). It was concluded that the differences in physiological cervical rotation between swimmers and nonswimmers and between sides in the swimmers were influenced by the swimming activity. The clinician needs to consider the influence of activity when assessing range of motion.
