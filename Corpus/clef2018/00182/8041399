Clinical, electrophysiological, and myelographic studies of 9 patients with cervical spinal root avulsions: discrepancies between EMG and X-ray findings. In traumatic brachial plexus injuries a thorough neurological, electrodiagnostic, and radiological examination is essential to determine treatment and prognosis. The most important diagnostic question concerns the presence or absence of a preganglionic nerve root lesion. Electromyography and motor and sensory conduction studies were performed in 17 patients with traumatic plexus injuries who had myelographic evidence of nerve root avulsion in 8 of these clinical and electrophysiological features confirmed the X-ray findings. However, in 9 cases there was a discrepancy between myelographic and neurophysiological data regarding the actual number and sites of roots avulsed. Thus, in 2 cases myelography showed avulsion of one more root than did conduction studies and EMG
