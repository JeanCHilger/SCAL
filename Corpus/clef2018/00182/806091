Measurements taken in the normal spinal column and their use in the diagnosis of platyspondylisis. Determination of factors F 1 and F 2 in the normal cervicothoracolumbar portion of the spinal column will convey an impression of the ratio between the width and height of the bodies of the vertebrae. An increase of factors F 1 and F 2 may be due to marked wedge-shaped deformity of the vertebral bodies but also to platyspondylisis. These determinations are mainly useful in that they make possible a more objective approach to the concept of platyspondylisis. In addition to the F values, normal and pathological curves are of importance. In view of the above, a family is discussed, which included a few cases in which a tentative diagnosis of the late form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia was established. In addition to platyspondylisis, marked arthrotic lesions were observed at the hip joints, knee joints and a number of more peripherally situated joints. The differential diagnosis from the late form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is discussed.
