Transcervical gunshot injuries. Gunshot injuries across the cervical midline are not addressed in existing trauma algorithms. A retrospective study of 41 patients with transcervical gunshot wounds was undertaken to delineate injury patterns and management principles. Thirty-four of the 41 patients (83%) sustained 52 injuries to major cervical structures. Vascular (22 injuries) and upper airway (13 injuries) structures were most commonly involved. This resulted in presentation with life-threatening problems in 16 patients (39%). The in-hospital mortality was 10%. In 30 of the 36 neck explorations (83%), the findings were positive for injuries to cervical structures. Sixteen bilateral explorations were performed in each case, cervical injury was observed on at least one side of the neck. These results indicate that transcervical injuries are excellent markers of associated visceral injury. Therefore, a policy of mandatory neck exploration and a particularly "low threshold" for bilateral exploration are the key to managing these injuries.
