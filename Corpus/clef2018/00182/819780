Tumor-related radiographic changes of the vertebral column in childhood (author's transl). Benign tumors and malignant primary or metastatic neoplasms of the vertebral column are rare in childhood. Radiographic changes are sometimes detected by routine investigations since no clinical symptoms are present. The type of tumor can only rarely be specified from the radiographic changes. Usually a specific diagnosis requires histologic studies. If a tumor the vertebral column is suspected detailed radiographic studies are mandatory to secure an early diagnosis. The impending danger of spinal cord compression makes an early diagnosis and rapid surgical intervention even more important. In our case material we found 11 different tumor types involving the vertebral column.
