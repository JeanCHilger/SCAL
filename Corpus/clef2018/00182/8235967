Risks and cost-effectiveness of sublaminar wiring in posterior fusion of cervical spine trauma. A report on the use of sublaminar wiring in the fusions of 34 patients with cervical spine injuries is given. No neurologic deficits were incurred in the use of this technique. There were no wire failures nor clinically significant complications. When compared with other forms of instrumentation to achieve similar results, the use of sublaminar wire is the most cost-effective.
