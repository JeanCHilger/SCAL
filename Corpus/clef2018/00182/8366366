Spinal epidural hemangiomas. Two patients with epidural cavernous hemangiomas located at the lumbar and cervical spine are reported. The first case presented clinically as progressive paraparesis, and the second began with sudden tetraparesis after a strong physical exercise. Myelography and MRI were the diagnostic tools. Surgical decompression improved the signs and symptoms in both cases. Spinal epidural cavernous hemangiomas are rare lesions that are usually regarded as vascular hamartomas. Symptom onset may be insidious or acute and the prognosis after timely surgery is better when compared with that of intrathecal cavernous hemangiomas. The histology and treatment of these processes are discussed.
