Isolated ossicle of the dens axis. Case reports and differential diagnosis. Two patients with an incidental finding of isolated ossicles adjacent to the dens axis are presented. One case was thought to be based on an isolated part of the dens axis, possibly due to trauma the second case could be a true ossiculum terminale. Such ossicles can be confused with acute fractures, initiating treatment that is not indicated.
