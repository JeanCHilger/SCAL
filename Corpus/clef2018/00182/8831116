Pitfalls in the surgical management of cervical spine injuries. Records of 69 cervical spine injury patients referred to the authors' institution over a 3-year period were reviewed. The senior author documented "definite" and "probable" pitfalls occurring in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative management. Diagnosis, traction, bracing, surgical timing, intraoperative technical errors, and incorrect surgical decisions were noted. Of the 69 patients, 39 (56%) suffered a pitfall of management. Twenty-seven patients (39%) accumulated 49 "definite" pitfalls between them and 12 patients (17%) suffered a total of 20 "probable" pitfalls. Of the 49 definite pitfalls, 7 (14%) were preoperative, 17 (34%) were those of surgical decision making, 21 (43%) were operative, and 4 (9%) postoperative. Diagnostic errors and incorrect bracing and traction led to neurological worsening. Intraoperatively, technical errors (30%), wrong timing of surgery (24%), and incorrect choice of operation (16%) were the common pitfalls. Postoperative pitfalls consisted of inappropriate bracing (17%). A Cervical Spine Research Society review (1989) rated complications of cervical spine surgery at 6.3% (63/992). In this study, a sizeable portion (56%) of cervical spine injury patients requiring surgery were at a risk of complications. Short of complications, there are areas of management where errors may have less well-documented undesirable effects or increase the potential for morbidity. An awareness of these pitfalls and increased use of non-operative treatment may eliminate up to 73% of the pitfalls and thereby decrease the morbidity associated with the management of cervical spine injuries.
