Cervical lymphangioma in adults: report of three cases. Lymphangioma is a developmental anomaly of the lymphatic system that is infrequent in children and rare in adults. The clinical diagnosis is easy and imaging techniques are useful for determining its extension. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. The procedure is less difficult in adults than in children and recurrence is rare in complete resection. Three cases of typical adult cervical lymphangioma are reported.
