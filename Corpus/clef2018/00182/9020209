Anterior instrumentation in the management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Anterior instrumentation in the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures has progressed significantly during the past 2 decades. These fixation systems have evolved to meet the anatomic, biomechanical, and imaging challenges associated with internal fixation of the thoracolumbar spine. The evolution of these devices will be reviewed, and from this, the indications and surgical techniques necessary for the safe and effective use of the device will be discussed. This study also reports the authors' initial clinical experience using the Z plate anterior thoracolumbar plating system in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. The study consists of 12 consecutive adult patients who underwent a 1-stage anterolateral decompressive and stabilization procedure for burst fractures from T9-L3. The indications for surgery included neurologic deficits, deformity, progressive kyphosis, and late pain. Ten of the 12 patients maintained their postoperative sagittal alignment or a significant portion of their kyphosis reduction. Two patients with severe kyphotic deformities greater than 50 degrees lost 10 degrees and 20 degrees of their reduction at last followup. All 3 patients with neurologic deficits recovered. There were no neurologic or perioperative complications. Eleven of the 12 patients obtained a good or excellent functional outcome. Anterior arthrodesis using instrumentation stabilization after a 1-stage anterolateral decompression and reduction procedure can yield successful clinical results in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.
