Angulation of the pediatric cervical spine with and without cervical collar. To determine whether semirigid cervical collars eliminate cervical spine (CS) flexion in children on back boards.Prospective clinical study.An urban pediatric emergency department.Eighteen head-injured children < 8 years of age undergoing CS radiographs.Children were secured to back boards, and semirigid cervical collars were applied. Following CS clearance, the collar was removed, and an additional lateral film without collar was obtained. C2-C6 lateral Cobb angles were measured on both lateral films.Mean flexion with collar was 3.4 +/- 9.9 degrees and 5.6 +/- 6.8 degrees without a collar P > 0.05Most children < 8 years, when immobilized on back boards have flexed CSs. Semirigid cervical collars do not eliminate flexion. Further study is needed to develop and test different methods of CS immobilization as present equipment is unable to position the CS optimally.
