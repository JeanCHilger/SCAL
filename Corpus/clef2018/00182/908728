Fracture of the odontoid process in young children. Fracture of the odontoid process in young children is possibly not as rare as hitherto believed. In this paper, two more patients with this fracture are presented, and an important diagnostic clinical sign is described. Both patients sustained the injury by falling from heights no greater than sixty-one to ninety-one centimeters. In each instance, injury to the cervical spine was suspected but initial roentgenograms failed to reveal any fracture. The patients were quite comfortable when lying supine and when fully erect. Each child strongly resisted any attempt at extension of the neck and cried bitterly when brought to either the erect or the recumbent position unless the head was passively supported. This a valuable clinical sign when injury to the odontoid process is suspected. Subsequent roentgenograms confirmed the diagnosis in each instance.
