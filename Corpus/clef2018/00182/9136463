Spinal cord compression by primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Epidural Cord Compression (ECC) by primary lymphomas is rare entity and constitutes less than 3% of total malignant lymphoma with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large cell type being the most common histological subtype. In this paper 16 cases of primary NHL with cord compression seen at the Department of Medical Oncology, during the period 1988-1990 are reviewed. At presentation all patients had undergone Laminectomy with decompression of epidural mass. The histological diagnosis of NHL was subclassified according to the International working formulation and was evaluated for disease process elsewhere in the body. All patients with ECC by lymphoma received high dose steroids with concurrent Radiotherapy (local) and combination Chemotherapy. These patients had longer duration of neurological deficit prior to treatment had poor response. After 6 courses of chemotherapy 50% of the patients had complete neurological recovery (CR), 31% had partial neurological recovery (PR) and in 19% there was no neurological recovery (NR).
