Traumatic spinal subarachnoid hematoma: report of a case with MRI. Spinal subarachnoid hematoma (SAH) is uncommon following traumatic injury to the spine. There are few case reports of neurologic deficit secondary to traumatic spinal SAH.This 6-year-old boy was injured in a vehicular accident from which he became paraplegic and presented to us 1 week later. Plain X rays were normal and a myelo-computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an irregular intradural lesion from D10-L2. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an SAH at D11-12 level, posterior to the cord, which was surgically evacuated. The patient did not improve neurologically.Significant cord injury and neurologic deficit can occur without obvious abnormalities on plain X rays or CT scan. MRI is very useful in detecting these lesions and can help in their management.
