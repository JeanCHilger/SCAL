The lumbosacral lucent cleft. The lumbosacral lucent cleft was first described in association with traumatic injuries to the neck. However, we have observed this sign to be present in patients with no precursor of trauma, and we reviewed the incidence of lucent cleft sign in our local population and any characteristic features of the lucent cleft.Four-hundred and thirty lumbosacral spine radiographs were examined prospectively over an 8-month period, with correlation with clinical findings. Follow-up radiographs were obtained at 1, 3 and 6 months for patients with the lucent cleft sign.Nineteen patients (4.4%) were found to have lucent clefts in their lumbosacral spine X-rays. No significant change in the number and features to the lucent clefts was noted even when the symptoms had resolved after 6 months. All the lucent clefts were linear, horizontally oriented and located at the anterior edge of the adjacent vertebral body.The lucent cleft sign in the spine, which has so far been described in association with has spinal trauma may be completely innocuous in patients with little or no symptoms.
