Magnetic resonance tomography examination of thoracolumbar spinal fractures after fixateur interne stabilization. To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal. There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD):(1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage. MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture. None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability. We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree. The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc). Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation. With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised. The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone. Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.
