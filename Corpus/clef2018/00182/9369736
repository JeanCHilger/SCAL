Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) is associated with self-reducing transient subluxation or distraction of the juvenile spine. It accounts for about 40% of spinal injuries in children under sixteen. Children's anatomical features increase their susceptibility to hyperflexion, hyperextension and distraction mechanisms. Nursing management includes an awareness of two of its greatest dangers: a delay in onset of symptoms and a possible recurrence. If these dangers are identified early, the child's potential for recovery is maximized.
