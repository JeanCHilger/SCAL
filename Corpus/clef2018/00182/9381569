Traumatic odontoid synchodrotic slip in a 2-year old child. We report a case of a two-and-a-half year-old child involved in a head-on motor vehicle accident, which is a typical mechanism of traumatic injury of the odontoid process in small children. The child was neurologically intact and the first X-ray was without signs of fractures. Two weeks later, X-ray revealed a 1 cm anterior luxation of the odontoid process. After closed reduction the child was treated conservatively with a Minerva jacket, which led to consolidation.
