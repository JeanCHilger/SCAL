The significance of cervical spine radiology in children with Down syndrome. An analysis of lateral radiographs of cervical spine in 31 children with Down Syndrome revealed 8 cases (25%) of substantial anomalies (anterior subluxation of the apical vertebrae in 3 cases and C1 laminar hypoplasia in 5 cases). The analysis outcome supported by the literature indicates screening for cervical spine anomalies in these patients, especially if participation in competitive sports is considered.
