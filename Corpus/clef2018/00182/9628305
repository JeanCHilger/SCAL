Spinal cord compression--do we miss it? Four children with spinal cord compression due to malignant tumours are presented.

Lower limb asymmetrical weakness, clear-cut sensory levels, and marked pain indicate need for urgent imaging and exclusion of a space occupying lesion. In 1997 diagnosis of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome should not be made without careful prior spinal imaging.
