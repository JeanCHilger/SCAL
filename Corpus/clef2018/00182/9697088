Magnetic resonance imaging data in the evaluation of effects of functional electrical stimulation on knee joints of adolescents with spinal cord injury. Diagnostic imaging, consisting of roentgenograms and magnetic resonance images (MRIs), was performed as part of an evaluation of the effects of a functional electrical stimulation (FES) program on the knee joints of 29 adolescents with spinal cord injuries following implantation of fine-wire intramuscular electrodes in their lower extremity muscles. The subjects underwent a regimen consisting of stimulated exercise, standing and/or walking. The effects of FES on knee joints were prospectively studied by reviewing diagnostic imaging data. Evaluation of MRIs and plain radiographs showed no evidence of knee joint pathology secondary to FES exercise or weight bearing. In fact, based on follow-up of MRI scan, many of the joints improved following participation in the program. The MRI data supported the clinical examination of the knee joints of these children. Clinical examination appears adequate for screening for potential knee joint problems.
