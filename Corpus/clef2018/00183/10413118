Inside-outside technique for posterior occipitocervical spine instrumentation and stabilization: preliminary results. The authors present a series of 16 patients who underwent inside-outside occipital and posterior cervical spine stabilization.In this technique, the screw was placed from the inside of the occiput to the outside. An articular (lateral) mass plate was contoured to the shape of the occipital bone and the cervical spine and affixed to the occiput with a flat-headed screw or stud placed through a burr hole in the calvaria with the flat head of the screw in the epidural space and the threads facing outward. The bone plate was then secured with a nut to the occipital screw and the cervical plate was attached to the spine with a bone screw that coursed through the plate and into the articular pillar. Our series included six children and 10 adults. In five patients, previous fusion had failed in two patients spinal instability was secondary to Down's syndromeThe authors conclude that the inside-outside occipitocervical fixation is an effective technique for stabilizing the cervical spine.
