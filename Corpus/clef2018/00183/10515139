Relationship of the functional oropharynx to craniofacial morphology. The association between the functional oropharyngeal airway (defined as the minimal sagittal dimension at right angles to the airstream) and craniofacial morphology was investigated using 16 craniofacial variables taken from lateral cephalometric radiographs. The sample consisted of 70 subjects (31 males and 39 females) 10 to 13 years of age. There was no difference in ages between males and females, and no correlation with age except upper face height. Oropharyngeal airway was positively correlated with length of the mandible (Gon-Men), the distance between the third cervical vertebra and the hyoid bone (C3-Hy), and cranial base angle (NSBa). Although short mandibular length is a characteristic finding in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, none of the subjects in this study had this diagnosis.
