Upper thoracic spinal fractures in trauma patients - a diagnostic pitfall. The diagnosis of upper thoracic spinal fractures in multiple-trauma patients remains a challenge. The clinical findings are often difficult to detect, especially in the presence of other (extremity) fractures, head injuries or in patients on respiratory support. The findings of chest radiographs and plain spinal films are described in a series of 23 patients with an upper thoracic spinal fracture. Radiographs were retrospectively reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon and a skeletal radiologist. Fractures were classified according to Magerl and type A1 and A2 compression fractures were excluded. The neurological outcome was assessed using the Frankel scale.Initially, the fracture was missed in 5 patients (22%), mainly due to concomitant life-threatening injuries. Fractures consisted of type A, B and C in one, 10 and 12 patients, respectively. The main findings were: loss of vertical height of vertebra with or without malalignment (21), widened paraspinal line (21), widened mediastinum (4) and no gross abnormalities (2). Neurological lesions were Frankel A, B, C and E in respectively 14, 1, 1 and 7 patients.Upper thoracic spinal fractures are easily missed in patients with multiple injuries. In patients with neurological symptoms CT and/or MRI is required as soon as the general condition of the patient permits this.
