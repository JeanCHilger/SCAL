The pathogenesis of elevated intracranial pressure in children and adolescents with craniovertebral pathology. The paper deals with intracranial hypertension in children and adolescents. Thirty-six patients with the upper cervical dysplasia and identified associated intracranial hypertension were examined. Magnetic resonance imaging and functional tests were used. Some patients were diagnosed as having a thickened ligamentous apparatus at the level of craniovertebral junction, which was a cause of spinal fluid dynamic disorders and led to elevated intracranial pressure.
