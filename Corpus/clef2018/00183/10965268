Neonatal cervical osteomyelitis with paraspinal abscess and Erb's palsy. A case report and brief review of the literature. An unusual case of pyogenic cervical osteomyelitis is reported in a newborn who immediately after birth had no movements in the left shoulder. There was a fullness in the left cervical region. Left Erb's palsy due to an unrecognized birth trauma was diagnosed in a peripheral hospital. Later, the child developed fever and a significant swelling in the left cervical region. On transfer to our institution, the X-rays of the cervical spine, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) established the diagnosis of C(6) cervical osteomyelitis and paraspinal abscess which extended to the posterior triangle of the neck. The abscess was drained, and the lamina and lateral mass of the C(6) vertebra were debrided. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the pus. The patient was put on long-term antibiotics to which he responded very well, and he became asymptomatic. In the immediate post-operative period, some movements at the left shoulder were noted, and at 6-month follow-up in the out-patient clinic, the child was virtually normal with near-complete regeneration of the C(6) lamina and lateral mass.
