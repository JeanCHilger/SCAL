Evaluation of the acute cervical spine: a management algorithm. Safe, efficient, and cost-effective evaluation of the spine is the goal in the trauma setting. At our Level I trauma facility, the trauma service, emergency medicine, radiology, anesthesia, and the spine service combined individual concerns into one agreed-upon clearance protocol. Here, we present the effectiveness of a new cervical spine clearance protocol.A retrospective review was initiated of all trauma patients evaluated in a Level I trauma center the year before and after implementation of a new cervical spine protocol to determine the incidence of missed cervical injuries. An additional 6 months were reviewed to detect any missed injuries late in the study period.During the 2-year study period, 4,460 patients presented to the emergency room with some form of cervical spine precautions. Blunt trauma comprised 90% of the study population. According to the protocol, approximately 45% required further cervical radiographs after presentation. In the preprotocol year, 77 of 2,217 (3.4%) patients were diagnosed with cervical spine injuries, 16 of 77 (21%) with multiple level of injuries, and 25 of 77 (32%) with neurologic compromise. Three of 2,217 patients had missed cervical spine injuries on their initial evaluations. In the postprotocol year, 84 of 2,243 (3.4%) patients had cervical injuries, 25 of 84 (30%) with multiple levels of injuries and 28 of 84 (28%) with neurologic compromise. No patient evaluated during the protocol year was missed. All statistics between the two groups were not significant.The current protocol by risk stratifying patients on presentation is effective in assessing patients for cervical spine injuries.
