Occult traumatic lesions of the cervical vertebrae. The numerous general and special techniques for examination of the cervical spine, with particular reference to the demonstration of occult traumatic lesions will be presented and evaluated. The advantages and limitations of each technique will be presented. Optimal procedures will be suggested for the examination of the acutely injured patient, with injuries of unknown severity, as well as for the longer term followups and minor injuries. The mechanisms of the production of cervical spine traumatic lesions and the long term abnormalities to be anticipated will be related, together with the types of radiographic findings associated with them. These will be presented in the context of the anatomy, function and dynamic physiology of the cervical spine. The dynamic interrelationship between segments of the cervical spine and the cervical spine as a whole, as well as the interrelation of the cervical spine with the skull and the remainder of the spine will be considered. The clinical data available in the literature will be collected and correlated with the radiographic findings. The results will be used to evaluate the clinical significance of these occult traumatic lesions, and the efficacy of therapy.
