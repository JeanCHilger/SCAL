A long-term follow-up study of cervical lesions in rheumatoid arthritis. To determine the natural history of cervical lesions in rheumatoid arthritis, 161 patients who had been followed for a minimum of 5 years were enrolled in this study. The average follow-up period was 10.2 years (range, 5 to 20 years). The severity of the rheumatoid arthritis was classified into three types based on the multiplicity of peripheral joint rheumatoid involvement: a least erosive subset, a more erosive subset, and a mutilating disease subset. Ninety-two patients (57%) had upper cervical involvement, which progressed in the order of anterior atlantoaxial subluxation, anterior atlantoaxial subluxation combined with vertical subluxation, and vertical subluxation alone. Subaxial subluxation was found in 18 patients (11%). In 17 of these 18 patients, upper cervical lesions were also noted. The incidence of cervical involvement in each disease subset was 39% in the least erosive group, 83% in the more erosive group, and 100% in the mutilating disease group. Fifty percent of the patients with cervical involvement had neck pain, and the remaining patients were asymptomatic. Neural involvement occurred in 10 patients. In 7 of these 10 patients, vertical subluxation of the atlas was responsible for the neural deficit. Six patients required surgical intervention because of progressive myelopathy.
