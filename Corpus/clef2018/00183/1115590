Pneumatic orthosis PILOT STUDY. The pneumatic orthosis is potentially a substitute or replacement for conventional long-ler and under outer clothing.  Pneumatic tubes are incorporated into the orthosis and may be inflated at will by the patient.  In a preliminary test it was found to be lighter, more comfortable and cosmetically more acceptable than conventional braces.  This paper presents the results of the first pilot study of the orthosis in the United States, conducted by the New York Medical College--Bird S. Coler Hospital Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, using 11 patients with different levels of cord transection.  The orthosis was tested for its effect in the following areas: pulmonary function, blood chemistries to determine calcuyn function and phosphorus metabolic retention or loss spasticity
