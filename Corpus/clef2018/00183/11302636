Pathological fracture through a C-6 aneurysmal bone cyst. Case report. The authors describe the case of an 18-year-old man who presented with complaints of weakness and paresis in his arms following an injury. Radiological examination demonstrated an aneurysmal bone cyst of C-6. The patient underwent a two-stage operation. Satisfactory results were obtained after complete resection of the lesion, laminoplasty, and anterior fusion without placement of instrumentation. The authors consider a two-stage operation supplemented by fusion without instrumentation to be the best treatment for young patients with aneurysmal bone cysts occurring at C-6.
