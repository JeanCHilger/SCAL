Cervical spine injuries: diagnostic imaging. In past few years, traumas of cervical spine have increased, chiefly owing to rise of road accidents. Nevertheless, only in a small percentage of cases lesions of cervical spine occur and, in order to reduce many negative radiographs, a careful clinical examination is required. Our purpose is to verify the value of radiology in evaluation of acute trauma of cervical spine and to propose an adequate radiological protocol. In the course of two years (1998-99), 376 patients were admitted in consequence of cervical trauma of different degree of gravity. In all patients, conventional radiographs were obtained, in 93 a computed tomography (CT) examination was executed and only in 18 patients with neurological symptoms a magnetic resonance (MR) was required. Fractures of cervical spine wee identified in 91 cases and in patients in which MR images were obtained, neurological lesions of various severity were diagnosed. On the basis of our results, we think that, in a clinical suspicion of cervical spine lesions, a conventional radiographic study has first to be performed even if often good radiographs aren't obtained for technical difficulties. If doubts persist on conventional radiographs or a fractures has already been diagnosed on radiographs but we want to verify its stability, a CT needs to be performed. MR is required if neurological symptoms are present in order to diagnose lesions of spinal marrow, nerve roots or ligaments.
