Descending necrotizing mediastinitis: surgical management. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) is a primary complication of cervical or odontogenical infections that can spread to the mediastinum through the anatomic cervical spaces.Between April 1994 and April 2000, 13 patients, mean age 39.23+/-18.47 (median 38, range 16-67) years, with DNM were submitted to surgical treatment. Primary odontogenic abscess occurred in six, peritonsillar abscess in five and post-traumatic cervical abscess in two patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) of the neck and chest. All patients underwent surgical drainage of the cervico-mediastinal regions by a bilateral collar incision associated with right thoracotomy in ten cases.Six patients out of 13 required reoperation. Two patients previously submitted only to cervical drainage required thoracotomy four patients, which have been submitted to cervico-thoracic drainage, underwent contralateral thoracotomy in two cases and ipsilateral reoperation in two cases. Ten patients evolved well and were discharged without major sequelaeEarly diagnosis by CT of the neck and chest suggest a rapid indication of surgical approach to DNM. Ample cervicotomy associated with mediastinal drainage via large thoracotomic incision is essential in managing these critically ill patients and can significantly reduce the mortality rate for this condition, often affecting young people, to acceptable values.
