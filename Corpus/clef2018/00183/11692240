Combined asymptomatic congenital anterior and posterior deficiency of the atlas. Atlas anomalies in terms of clefts and aplasia are rare. They can sometimes simulate fractures and need further evaluation. Imaging in terms of CT and MR can help resolve diagnostic confusion and also outline associated neurological involvement. A rare anomaly of anterior and posterior atlas arch, previously unclassified, is presented.
