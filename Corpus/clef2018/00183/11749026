Grisel's syndrome. Summary Atlantoaxial subluxation is a rare complication of the upper neck inflammatory processes of head and neck region. Grisel's syndrome is a non-traumatic subluxation of the atlanto axial joint. It is not associated with trauma or bone disease. It typically occurs in children after serious infection in the head and neck region. Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of inflammatory subluxation. The primary treatment of Grisel's syndrome is medical. We report a case of atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation treated with external fixation and antibiotic therapy.
