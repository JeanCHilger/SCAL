Vertebrobasilar dissection: a possible role of whiplash injury in its pathogenesis. We reviewed 29 patients with vertebrobasilar dissections (VBD) to investigate the correlation between minor trauma and VBD and the clinical features of this trauma-related condition. Mean age was 43 years, with a male predominance (male/female ratio was 25/4). Seventeen patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 12 with ischemic symptoms. Two patients presenting with ischemia had extracranial VBD (V3 segment). Angiographically, aneurysmal dilatation was observed in most SAH patients (13 patients) in contrast to narrowing or occlusion in most ischemic patients (10 patients). Among the 12 SAH patients treated with coil embolization or conservatively, five died, whereas all ischemic patients recovered well with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet therapy. Seven patients had received minor or trivial head/cervical trauma, due to whiplash injury, minor fall, or during exercise, which were identified to precede with the lapse of some time (a few minutes or days) the onset of symptoms. All of these patients presented with ischemic symptoms, and they were younger than the other ischemic or SAH patients. The site of vertebral artery dissection was intracranial in four cases, extracranial in one case, and combined in two cases at the level of the V3 segment and the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. However, no SAH occurred. These clinicopathological findings, i.e. ischemia and angiographic narrowing/occlusion, suggest that dissections were subintimal. Therefore, it is believed that this minor or trivial trauma may primarily cause subintimal dissection with luminal compromise, leading to ischemic symptoms, rather than subadventitial or transmural dissection with aneurysmal dilatation, leading to SAH. This lesion may also occur in younger patients with a favorable outcome. Careful note should be made of patient for the early recognition of this disorder.
