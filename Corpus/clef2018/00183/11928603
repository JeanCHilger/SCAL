Soft tissue injuries of the neck. Thirty five patients were examined. All had soft tissue spinal cord injury and were not treated in a hospital. Complete diagnostic and therapeutical protocol was carried out only for 13 patients. The goal was to compare their initial condition with condition after the control examination after the therapy. Results showed that 8 patients (23%) suffered from pain in the neck, 25 (72%) had limited neck mobility, and 17 (49%) manifested neurological symptoms. Signs of osteochondrosis at isolated spinal levels and dyscoligamental instability were noted in one fifth of the observed patients. In 24 patients (69%) the condition was defined as "serious". Although soft tissue spinal cord injuries are considered as "light" injuries, they can cause serious consequences that reduce the quality of patient's life due to inadequate treatment. From that point of view, a serious approach to diagnosis and treatment is necessary.
