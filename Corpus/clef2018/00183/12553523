Rib bone graft for posterior spinal fusion in children. Treatment of columnar instability in children with conventional fusion procedures may preclude normal growth and cause dysfunction and pain due to malalignment or reduced mobility. To achieve normal growth, we have treated spinal instability in 7 children with posterior fusion, using bilateral rib transplants secured by horizontal laminar cerclages. Solid fusion was obtained and no serious complications occurred.
