Drug therapy of spastic disorder of urine outflow in patients with spinal injury and spinal cord injury. A study was made of efficiency of medicamentous correction of a spastic disorder of outflow of urine from the bladder in 42 patients with dull trauma of the spinal column and marrow. The use in the above patients of cardura alpha 1-adrenoblocker permits restoring a spastic disorder of urine outflow in a 10-day period after the trauma sustained in 82 percent of patients. Shortening the time of a spastic disorder of urine outflow in patients with trauma of the spinal column and cord we allow the frequency of development of the infectious inflammatory process in organs of the urogenitary system to be substantially reduced.
