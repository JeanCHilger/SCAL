Triangular vertebropelvine stabilisation of unstable posterior pelvic ring fractures. It is the objective of this investigation to describe the early results (2 years outcome) after triangular vertebropelvine stabilisation (TVPS) of unstable fractures of the posterior pelvic ring.Between 1.1.1997 and 31.12.2000 35 patients were treated. C1 fractures occurred 9 times (25.7 %), C2 injuries 16 times (45.7 %) and 10 patients suffered fom C3 fractures (28.6 %). The mean age of the injured was 36.6 years (15 to 77 years). 22 patients (62.8 %) were treated with the TVPS. Suffering from a monotrauma, mobilisation with full weight bearing of the injured pelvis was resumed immediately on the first postoperative day. In case of polytrauma mobilisation was continued when the additional injuries allowed so, after 8.8 days on average.After an average of 23.4 months 18 of 22 patients with TVPS were controlled. Radiological criteria as well as quality of life were ascertained. It could be proved, that TVPS offered good reduction and stable retention of the pelvic fractures. 16 patients (89.0 %) suffered from moderate or mild pain, 15 (83.3 %) had slight problems in walking. No restriction in the range of motion of the lumbal vertebral column could be observed.The following advantages of the TVPS could be demonstrated: anatomical reduction and stable retention of instable pelvic fractures, full weight bearing from the first day after surgery, and only slight restriction of the quality of life two years after operation
