Vertebral fractures and abdominal trauma. A retrospective study based on 415 documented vertebral fractures. 415 spinal fractures were analysed retrospectively. A simultaneous occurrence of vertebral fracture and abdominal trauma was found in 14 patients (3.4%). The mechanism of injury was a fall from a considerable height in 9 cases, a car accident in 3 and a motorcycle accident in 2. Isolated fractures of the transverse processes and rotational injuries of the spine were found to be associated particularly frequently with an abdominal trauma (3 of 14 isolated fractures of the transverse processes = 22%, 5 of 61 rotational injuries = 8.2%), while compression injuries only showed such a simultaneous abdominal injury in 2% of the 300 fractures of this type. We never encountered the combination of distraction injury/abdominal trauma. This is probably because two-point lap-type seat belts are only rarely used in our country. In 2 patients with rotational injuries neurological deficits were observed. The abdominal injuries encountered in our patients were: massive concussion of the kidney (6 cases), rupture of the spleen (3 cases), rupture of the liver (2 cases), rupture of the mesocolon (2 cases), rupture of the caecum (1 case), rupture of a pre-existent aneurysm of the aorta (1 case), rupture of a renal artery (1 case), massive retroperitoneal haematoma (1 case). Other injuries were present in 12 of the 14 patients: 3 craniocerebral injuries, 7 fractures of the long bones, 6 injuries to the thorax and 3 to the pelvis. In conclusion, a simultaneous finding of vertebral fracture and abdominal trauma is rare in our patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
