Shape and orientation of articular facets of cervical vertebrae (C3-C7) in dogs denoting axial rotational ability: an osteological study. Macerated cervical vertebrae of 139 adult and 39 juvenile dogs were assessed for morphological evidence of axial rotation, which is denoted by the shape and orientation of the articular facets. The potential effect of the presence of caudal costal foveae at C7 on facet geometry was also investigated. Four variations of caudal facet shape were evident, namely, plane, concave, convex and sigmoid. The earliest onset of change in shape from plane to curved was noticed in juvenile dogs who were older than 8 weeks. The incidence of curved facets denoting axial rotation ability was observed to increase on descending down the cervical spine. Concave caudal facets were more frequently present in males and in large dogs (P < 0.001), compared to Dachshunds and small breeds. The degree of concavity was not related to age but was associated with the transverse distance between the most medial aspects of the caudal and corresponding cranial facets (P < 0.05). In large breeds, the presence of concave caudal facets at C7 was inversely related to the presence of caudal costal foveae (P < 0.01). The effect of axial rotation is discussed in context with clinical literature suggesting that axial rotation might attribute to the development of the wobbler syndrome.
