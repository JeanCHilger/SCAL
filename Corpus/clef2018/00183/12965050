Autonomic dysreflexia in acute spinal cord injury: an under-recognized clinical entity. While autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is well recognized in the chronic stage of spinal cord injury (SCI) this potentially life-threatening complication has been only rarely documented in the acute phase (1 month) after SCI. Based on our clinical experience we hypothesized that AD is under-recognized in the acute phase of SCI. This study was undertaken to determine the incidence and clinical associations of early AD in our center. We reviewed the charts of patients with acute traumatic SCI admitted to the Toronto Western Hospital Spinal Program between 1998 and 2000. Among 58 patients with acute traumatic SCI (15F, 43M ages 17-89 years, mean of 55.4), all three individuals who developed evidence of early AD had complete cervical tetraplegia (1F, 2M
