The cervical spine in fatal motor vehicle accidents. Of 100 fatal accident cases involving motor vehicles, 60 showed damage to the cervical spine, involving bony or disc damage in 31 and focal haemorrhages in another 29. In 8 cases, pre-autopsy radiology failed to detect lesions which were found by radiology and pathological examination of the post-autopsy specimen. Most of the lesions missed were at the C6-7 region. In some cases, the initial pathological examination 'missed' laterally placed fractures and small chip fractures. Narrow cervical canals in the elderly indicated advanced spondylosis.
