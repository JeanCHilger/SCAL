Fetal cervical hypertension in breech presentation. A review has been made of Down's syndrome patients who were radiographed as fetuses and the majority were found to be in abnormal postures, often "star gazing". Further review of "star gazing" fetuses showed that two of eight were normal and the rest were abnormal. Hypotonia was a frequent association.
