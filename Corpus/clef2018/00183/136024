Fractures of the odontoid process of the axis. Analysis of 15 cases of fracture of the odontoid process of the axis, with a follow-up time of 18 months to 9 years. In 6 cases (40 p. 100) the diagnosis of the fracture was made with a delay extending from one week to 3 months after the accident. The only case complicated with neurological findings was a fracture of the dens without radiological displacement. All patients have been treated conservatively. Twelve fractures united after 4 to 6 months immobilisation. In two cases a tight and stable non-union has developed. In only one case the pseudarthrosis was loose and unstable, and required a surgical fusion. The functional result was dominated by a restriction of movements of the head, variable in its importance, but practically constant.
