Importance of the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal in thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures. Is there any correlation between the degree of stenosis and neurological deficit?. A relationship between traumatic spinal canal stenosis and the degree of neurological deficit is known for the cervical spine. However, this has not been proven for the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. During a period of 4 years, from 1996 to 1999, 1168 patients with a spinal injury were treated at our department, 473 of these by operation. Thirty-five were examined in a separate group. They showed a single fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine with stenosis of the spinal canal. All fractures were single burst fractures after blunt trauma. All patients were conscious and fully oriented at the time of admission and a thorough neurological examination could be performed. The fractures were diagnosed by conventional X-ray in two views and computed tomography (CT). Using the transverse CT scans in horizontal view, the sagittal diameter was measured and the degree of stenosis calculated in percent at the level of the fracture and one below and above. The group included 25 male and 10 female patients, with a mean age of 38 years (range: 17-61 years). Of the 35 patients, 19 (54.3%) showed neurological deficits after spinal cord injury,and 16 (45.7%) were without any neurological complications at the time of first admission to the hospital. There was no correlation between the extent of spinal canal stenosis and the degree of the neurological deficit. One patient with stenosis of 20% suffered from neurological dysfunction, others with stenosis up to 80% were without spinal cord injury. The average stenosis of the spinal canal was 49.6% in cases with cord injury and 46.3% in patients without neurological dysfunction. No correlation and no predisposing anatomical structures could be found between stenosis and neurological deficit.
