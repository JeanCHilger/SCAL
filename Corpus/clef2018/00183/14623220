Cervical myelomeningocele--follow-up of five patients. Only a few series of patients with cervical myelomenigocele (cMMC) and cervical meningocele (cMC) have been published. Interventions as well as the neurologic, orthopaedic, urologic and intellectual outcomes were analysed in this retrospective description of five patients with cMMC and cMC diagnosed in the period 1984-1999. Four patients suffered from cMMC, one from cMC. The average duration of follow-up was 9.5 years. None of the patients had periconceptual prevention with folic acid. Three had a Chiari II malformation and two a hydrocephalus. Tethering of the cervical cord was demonstrated in three patients at follow-up. All children achieved an independent ambulatory function and urinary continence. Incomplete sensorimotor hemiparesis was present in two children, and a mild unilateral arm paresis in one. Two of five patients had age appropriate cognitive functions. Three patients with mild mental retardation or behavioural problems had to be placed in special classes. The outcome of patients with cMMC is favourable regarding to the neurologic, orthopaedic and urologic problems compared with lower neural tube defects. However, the burden of repeated examinations and therapies is considerable and induces high costs, therefore prevention with periconceptual folic acid is a crucial issue also in cMMC. Spinal cord dysfunction has to be considered in growing children due to persistent tethering or re-tethering, therefore regular neurologic and urodynamic investigations are of particular importance.
