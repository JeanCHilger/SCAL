Intracutaneous sterile water injections do not relieve pain in cervicogenic headache. Intracutaneous sterile water injections have been reported to relieve acute labor pain and cervical pain in whip-lash patients. A double blind cross-over trial has presently been conducted in 10 women with cervicogenic headache in order to investigate whether sterile water injections were effective in this disorder. No benefit was observed for either treatment (isotonic saline or sterile water), neither on pain during the first 14 days nor on neck mobility. We conclude that intracutaneous sterile water injections is not effective in cervicogenic headache.
