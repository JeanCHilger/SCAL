Fractures of the sacrum and disk herniation: rare lesions in the pediatric surgical patient? Fractures of the sacrum and lesions of the intervertebral disks are seldom reported in childhood and adolescence. In our report, illustrated by three representative cases that we treated during the past six months, we show that sacrum fractures, not an easy diagnosis, may be more frequent than currently assumed, and that in quite a number of children and adolescents an anterior pelvic fracture may in fact be an unrecognized Malgaigne type pelvic fracture with a posterior fracture plane cutting through the sacrum. They may be accompanied by herniations and/or lacerations of intervertebral disks.
