Operative stabilization of traumatic instabilities of the lower cervical spine. Experience with an angle instable anterior plate-screw system in 95 patients. Traumatic instabilities of the cervical spine between C2 and T1 can successfully be treated by anterior spondylodesis with a plate and a tricortical iliac bone graft in most cases. Various plate-screw systems are available.Ninety-five patients with traumatic instability of the lower cervical spine were operated on using the Codman anterior cervical plate system (ACPS). The mean age was 42.1 years, and the mean follow-up was 14.9 months.Twenty-three patients with initial neurological deficits demonstrated an improvement of their symptoms at follow-up. No pseudarthrosis was detected among the 86 patients who were reexamined. Implant-related complications included one pulling out of a plate and one asymptomatic screw loosening. The Codman anterior cervical plate system (ACPS) is easy to use, safe, and a reliable method to stabilize instable injuries of the cervical spine by an anterior approach. The risk of dural or neurological injury is avoided. Implant-related complications are rare.
