The efficacy of non-operative treatment of burst fractures of the thoracolumbar vertebrae. We evaluated the efficacy of non-operative treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.The study included 26 patients (19 males, 7 females mean age 36 yearsFunctional results were excellent or good in 65.3%, and poor in 7.7%. Three patients required surgery because of pain. Final follow-up evaluations showed a significant progression in the mean Cobb angle (p<0.001) and a significant remodelization in the mean canal encroachment (p<0.001). No significant correlations were found between progression in kyphosis, residual kyphosis, residual canal stenosis, and functional results (p>0.05). The mean initial Cobb angle was correlated with the mean initial canal encroachment (p<0.05). There was also a correlation between the initial canal encroachment and final remodelization (p<0.001).Although non-operative management of thoracolumbar fractures has considerable efficacy, it may yield poor results in a small percentage of patients, some of whom require surgery because of pain. Thus, further prospective, randomized, and comparative studies with longer follow-up periods are required to define prognostic factors that may predict poor results following non-operative treatment.
