Therapeutic options and results following fixed atlantoaxial rotatory dislocations. Atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation (AARD) represents a rare pathological condition of the upper cervical spine that is frequently misdiagnosed, leading to a delay in therapy. In a long-term assessment of clinical and radiological results, three different therapeutic options with regard to the length of the dislocation-therapy interval (DTI) were evaluated. Twenty-six patients were treated for AARD from December 1988 until April 2000. Proper diagnosis was established after an average interval of 15 months. Three different therapeutical protocols were followed in order to reduce the dislocation: (1) closed transoral reposition under general anesthesia (2) temporary transoral fixation utilizing the Harms T-plate
