The incidence of progressive scoliosis and kyphosis after fractures and dislocations of the spine in children (author's transl). The authors have observed forty-two cases of fractures and dislocations of the spine in children. In twenty-eight cases there was a complete spinal cord lesion and in four cases a partial cord lesion with some recovery. Ten children had no neurological lesion. Fifteen progressive kyphoses and twenty-two progressive scolioses were noted and analysed. The kyphotic deformities were more severe at cervical levels and seem to be aggravated by laminectomies. They were stabilised at the time of bone maturity. To prevent this deformity, the authors recommend long-term plaster cast immobilisation associated with posterior fusion. In scoliotic deformities, the authors distinguish those due to neurological involvement and those arising at the level of the fracture due to disturbance of vertebral growth. Indications for treatment are discussed in relation to the age of the patient and the level of the fracture.
