Segmental degeneration in the cervical spine and associated changes in dorsal root ganglia. Degenerative change in cervical segments C5-C7 was documented to determine whether osteo-ligamentous adaptations were age-related. In addition, companion morphological studies were carried out to determine whether parallel changes occurred in related soft tissues, including DRG. Independent of the provoking stimulus, aberrant soft tissue change may be expected with segmental degeneration. Two associations were identified: between the incidence of segmental degeneration and severity of DRG distortion, and between segmental degeneration and DRG inflammatory mast cell density. Peripheral type C cells seemed more susceptible to compression in circumstances of DRG distortion. In light of neuropeptide expression in these cell types, predominant type C cell compression may be clinically relevant in the noxious cascade contributing to the sensation of pain.
