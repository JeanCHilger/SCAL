Spinal cord compression and lung metastasis of Wilms' tumor in a pregnant adolescent. Wilms' tumor in adults is rare, and no treatment guidelines have been established. Spinal cord compression has also been rarely reported in all age groups. In this case report, we present a 19-year-old adolescent with recurrent Wilms' tumor, a paraspinal dumbbell mass, metastatic involvement of the vertebral bodies, lung metastasis, and pregnancy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pregnant patient with Wilms' tumor who had to undergo immediate chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin-D owing to spinal cord compression at 25 weeks of pregnancy. After delivery, complete remission was maintained with a regimen of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide. No teratogenic or other toxic effects of vincristine or actinomycin-D were observed in the fetus.
