Stabilization of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine with the internal spinal skeletal fixation system and a cross-linkage system. First results of treatment. Since 1986, 19 patients with 21 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine have been treated with the AO Internal Spinal Skeletal System. Of these fractures, 17 were burst fractures, 2 were seatbelt fractures and 2 were fracture-dislocations. All the patients in the series had a minimum follow-up of 12 months. There were 4 important losses of correction and two deep infections. In the majority of patients the postoperative reduction deteriorated during follow-up. The addition of 1 or 2 DTT appears to give the system more stability.
